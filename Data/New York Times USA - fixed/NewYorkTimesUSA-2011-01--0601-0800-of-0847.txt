HEADLINE: Letters: Zeroing In On the Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''What Obama Should Say About the Deficit'' (Economic View, Jan. 16), Christina D. Romer does not address the single greatest challenge to dealing with our accumulating deficits: the decline in American economic competitiveness and, thus, the increasing probability that the United States will not return to its historical growth path anytime soon. 
There is barely a hint that anyone in Washington appreciates both how severe and dangerous this decline has become, or that it will take fully a generation to address it in a significant way. The simple reality is that restoration of American economic vitality must be at the very center of any strategy to address our fiscal challenges.
Fred V. Carstensen
Storrs, Conn., Jan. 16
The writer is an economics professor at the University of Connecticut and director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis.
To the Editor:
Christina D. Romer hits home with her thoughts about curtailing the deficit, and the need to make sacrifices in order to do so. But I disagree with her belief in a gradual increase in the gasoline tax as one of the measures.
Although she notes that it should not be immediate, such an increase could lead to higher inflation and have an adverse affect on America's middle class. Gavin Burt
Slate Hill, N.Y., Jan. 16

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths ADAMS, F

 BODY:
ADAMS--F. Gerard (Jerry) 81, prominent economist who spent the bulk of his career at the University of Pennsylvania, died Saturday, January 15 in Newton, MA of complications related to pancreatic cancer. He was the author of a substantial body of research over a distinguished career. After spending 37 years at the University of Pennsylvania, he moved to Northeastern University in Boston. 
He completed his final teaching assignment there this last December, 2010. Prof. Adams was born in Breslau in 1929. His family emigrated to the United States in 1939. He attended the University of Michigan, receiving an undergraduate degree in 1949 and then continuing on to obtain a Ph.D. in 1956 under the supervision of Lawrence Klein, who subsequently went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. In 1961, he joined Klein, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained until 1998. He helped Klein to create the Wharton Model, one of the first econometric forecasting models using computers to simulate the world economy. It subsequently grew into the Link Model, which forecasts the economy using a variety of input data from smaller models around the world, and which contributed to Klein's Nobel Prize in 1980. Prof. Adams served as the director of the Economics Research Unit at the University of Pennsylvania and a principal investigator on the Link Model. Together with Klein, he was one of the founding members of Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates. He was the author of over 250 research articles and over a dozen books, including "The Business Forecasting Revolution," "East Asian Development: Will the East Asian Growth Miracle Survive?," "Macroeconomics for Business and Society," "The E-Business and the New Economy," and "East Asia and the New Economy." He submitted the manuscript for his newest book "Globalization and the New Economy" in December. Prof. Adams is survived by his wife Heidi Vernon, his brothers Peter Adams and Robert Adams, his four children Leslie Martin, Colin Adams, Loren Burton, and Mark Adams, his stepchildren Joshua Wortzel and Jennifer Stiller, his ten grandchildren, and his cats Minou and Maomi, all of whom will miss him greatly. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Adams Prize of the Economics Department at Swarthmore College, 500 College Ave., Swarthmore, PA 19081-1397.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths LAZARUS, LEONARD

 BODY:
LAZARUS--Leonard, passed away Saturday, January 15, 2011 at his home in Manhattan. He was 100 years old. Born on January 21, 1910, Leonard lived and loved life for over a century. He nurtured and cherished all his colleagues, friends and loved ones. 
Leonard was a self-made man. He actively practiced law into his 90s. He was a bright lawyer with a gift for bringing both allies and adversaries together to make "things work." He was a mentor to many lawyers and a man of his word and handshake. For over 70 years Mr. Lazarus played a part in the resurgence after World War II of the real estate markets in Manhattan, Queens and Long Island, engaging in a successful private practice with a schoolmate Richard Klugherz. Mr. Lazarus was born in the Bronx to German immigrants, had one brother Edward, and a sister, Nettie, both of whom predeceased him. When Leonard was very young, his father, Henry, took them to North Adams, MA because there was work there in its factories and mills. Leonard's father contracted TB and upon the doctor's advice relocated to the Adirondacks in Saranac Lake. Leonard's mother, Lillie, was very resourceful and found a place big enough, with land, to run a boarding house and for her husband to run a kosher chicken and egg business. His father was one of the first in the area to save enough money for a new Ford delivery truck, and the few Jewish families in the area loved to patronize such an enterprise. At a young age Leonard helped his parents. He had the largest paper route in the neighborhood and took furs to the rail station for a furrier. His respect for hard work, people and the love he developed for nature, while living, hiking and canoeing in the Adirondacks stayed with him throughout his life. Many years later he gave more than one hundred and fifty acres to a land trust in the Adirondacks to preserve nature from development. Mr. Lazarus' father died two days after his high school graduation so proud of his son who was the first person in the family to graduate high school. He won the state championship on the debating team and was Publisher and Treasurer of his yearbook. After his father's death, the family relocated back to the Bronx where his mother opened a family grocery business where Leonard worked. One of the customers, Rose, became his first wife. Leonard won a state scholarship to Columbia University at sixteen. He worked for the New York Times and became a soda fountain man in a movie house that showed the first talkie movie with Al Jolson, and then became the manager of the cafeteria at Columbia. While in college, Leonard befriended August Gold, a friendship which lasted a life time. In later years, August persuaded Leonard to support and invest in affordable development projects in Ossining, NY. After graduation from Columbia University School of Law during the depression, Leonard made fast friends with an older respected lawyer named Mr. Lochen who saw Leonard's potential. Leonard represented the bus driver's union, three to four hundred men on strike, and conducted labor negotiations with Mayor La Guardia. Mr. Lazarus was a conscientious objector; however he served in the Army for two years in his capacity as an attorney stationed at the Pentagon. After the Army, he lived and practiced law in Jamaica, Queens. He became associated with William Edwards, a real estate entrepreneur, who convinced Mr. Lazarus to move his law practice to Long Island and open an office in Mineola. Mr. Lazarus was instrumental in the development, leasing and sale of many buildings. A project of which he was most proud was Sheldon Solow and his building, The Solow Building at Nine 57th Street, the legendary Manhattan skyscraper designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and built in 1974. Mr. Lazarus also was a partner in the Americana Mall, a luxury destination shopping mall in Manhasset, Long Island. He enjoyed working with Steve Hess Associates, William Edwards, Milt Levin, the Castagna Family, among other businesses from Long Island. He consulted with the late Fred Trump, the Parker family and the LeFraks. Mr. Lazarus married Rose Lazarus in 1936. They lived in New York for almost fifty years. Rose was an accomplished pianist and teacher. After a tragic car accident took Rose's life in 1986, Leonard remarried a longtime friend, the widow of one of his friends from college, Henrietta (Hindy) Creamer, an accomplished economist, interior decorator and artist. Mr. Lazarus was a supporter of numerous charitable foundations, including Columbia University, C.A.R.E., Saranac Lake High School and Central Park Conservancy, Inc. Mr. Lazarus is survived by two sons, Frederic Lazarus of Bradenton, FL and David Lazarus of Queensbury, NY; three grandchildren, Dana, Nicole and David Paul as well as a recent newborn great-grandchild, Annabel Rose, all from Queensbury, NY. He also leaves his sister's children, his niece Iris Greenwald Hamburger and her husband Jerome Hamburger of Lawrence, NY and his nephew, Richard Greenwald and his brother Edward's children, his nieces Susan Qubein and Ellen Lazarus. He is also survived by his close friend and companion, Denise Bibro, and all of his caretakers who loved and took care of him for many years. Funeral services are being arranged with the Campbell Funeral Chapel on Madison Avenue, New York City. A memorial will be planned in the near future. For information you may call: 212-288-3500. In lieu of flowers, a contribution to one of Mr. Lazarus' favorite charities or a similar charity of your choice will be appreciated.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths TUNG, RUTH HUNG, FANG BELOVED MOTHER

 BODY:
TUNG--Ruth Hung-Fang Beloved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, and respected teacher to many students, passed away after a long and rich life at the age of 96 in New York City. She was born near Shenyang, in Northeast China. Her father, Tung Jing-Cheng (also named Hsu-Tsong), was a Confucian scholar, and her mother, Grand Duchess Wang Shou-Kun, was the founder and head of a girls school. 
Professor Tung, as she liked to be called, graduated from Harbin Normal College for Women, and was the first Government sponsored graduate student to attend Ochanomizu Women's University in Tokyo. To escape the massacres during the Chinese Civil War, she, together with her three infant sons, sought refuge in Japan. There she established herself as a respected professor of Chinese Culture and Literature at Keio University. To supplement her modest academic salary in order to raise her three sons, she wrote poetry, translated books and movie subtitles, and taught Chinese cooking at home and on television. After sending each of her sons to the United States for high school, she joined them there, taught at American University in Washington, D.C., and worked as a researcher in the Chinese Collection of the U.S. Library of Congress. As a daughter of a Confucian scholar, she memorized the Chinese Classics, and even in her 90s she would recite Tang poems and passages from the Analects. She was proudest of her three sons-number one son, Roger Ko-Chih, graduated from St. Louis High School in Honolulu and Dartmouth College and received his Ph.D. from the University of Stockholm, and just retired as Regional Director of the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Asia-Pacific Region; number two son, Alan Ko-Jen (known by his Japanese name Katsumi Tanaka), graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Harvard College and Harvard Law School, and is a business man in Hawaii, an advisor specializing in US-Asia transactions, and a well-known commentator on political and economic affairs; and number three son, Barry Ko-Yung, graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Harvard College, Harvard Law School, attended the University of Tokyo, is an international lawyer practicing with Morrison & Foerster and a visiting lecturer and senior research scholar at Yale Law School, and served as the Vice President and General Counsel of the World Bank. In addition to her sons, Prof. Tung is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. For those who wish, please contact Ko-Yung at ktung@mofo.com for place to make any honorary donations.

HEADLINE: Obama's Jobs Search

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER. 
Peter Baker is a White House correspondent for The Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Three days before Christmas, President Obama gathered his economic team in the West Wing's Roosevelt Room to review themes for his State of the Union address. The edge-of-the-cliff crisis he inherited had passed, but with more than 14 million Americans still out of work, he was looking for bold ways to bring down unemployment. The ideas presented to him, though, seemed familiar and uninspired. ''You know, guys,'' he said, according to someone in the room, ''I've told you before, I want you to come to me with ideas that excite me.'' Nothing he was hearing excited him. 
Obama's frustration could set the tone for the remainder of his term. For all the trials of war and terrorism, the economy has come to define his presidency. During the first half of his term, he used the tools of government to shape the nation's economy more aggressively than any president in 75 years. As the national debt rises and Republicans assume more power on Capitol Hill, it won't be easy finding ways to juice the economy that are exciting, effective and politically viable. Every day, in briefings, in trips around the country, in letters from the public, Obama is reminded of the many people who are still hurting. And he surely knows that if he cannot figure out in the next two years how to create jobs, he may lose his own.
Obama is fighting to keep Republicans, fresh from their fall electoral triumph, from reversing what he has started while prodding his own team to come up with something, anything, to put people back to work. ''The president wanted to lower unemployment but didn't see a way to get more money out of Congress,'' one adviser who sat in on many such meetings told me. ''He grew frustrated because the economic team didn't have that magic combination.'' Or as another adviser put it, ''He was really frustrated that there weren't solutions on the cheap.''
Obama has been casting about for ideas. He held two unpublicized meetings last month with outside economists, a group of liberals one day and a group of conservatives the next, soliciting suggestions while deflecting criticism. (He was ''a bit defensive,'' one participant told me.) He likewise met with labor leaders and convened a four-hour meeting with chief executives from Google, General Electric, Honeywell, Boeing and other corporations. Obama was so intent on the conversation that he canceled a lunch break and asked the executives to bring their chicken, fish and pasta back from a buffet so they could keep talking.
Some of those who met with him repeated the common complaint that he has yet to articulate a coherent strategy. While the policies have been ''quite good,'' the ''public relations and related politics have not been,'' Alan Blinder, the Princeton University economist and former Federal Reserve vice chairman, told me. ''One damaging result of that is the American public has little to no understanding why various things were done, why they made sense, what effect they were expected to have and did have, and instead they feel ripped off.''
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director who advised John McCain during the 2008 campaign and attended another meeting with Obama last month, said the problem goes beyond public relations. ''I honestly do not know where his policy rudder resides,'' he told me. ''I really can't tell. What are the principles on which he operates? He's very smart; he knows all the policy options. I just don't know what are the criteria by which he's picking between them.''
Obama would say his main criterion is finding what works. His approach to economic policy has been as much improvisational as ideological, a blend of Keynesian spending, business tax breaks, bank and auto bailouts, tax cuts for workers -- really almost anything he thought could fix the problems. ''For all the people who want to say he's a starry-eyed radical, in fact he's a moderate, middle-of-the-road guy,'' Christina Romer, who recently left as chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told me. ''He worked to fix what we have, not throw it all out and start over. To the extent that he had to take emergency action, it was born of circumstances.''
There is a compelling case that Obamanomics has produced results. An economy that was shrinking in size and bleeding more than 700,000 jobs a month is now growing at 2.6 percent and added 1.1 million jobs last year. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, known as the stimulus, produced or saved at least 1.9 million jobs and as many as 4.7 million last year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The much-derided Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, started by George W. Bush and continued by Obama, stabilized the financial sector, and the big banks have repaid the money with interest. According to a Treasury Department report sent to Congress this month, TARP will cost taxpayers $28 billion instead of the $700 billion originally set aside. The nearly $80 billion bailout of the auto industry may cost taxpayers only $15 billion, as the restructured General Motors and Chrysler come back to life with strong sales. The stock market has surged; corporate profits are setting records.
All of which seems offset by one simple figure: 9.4 percent. Or perhaps two, if you add $1.3 trillion. The first, of course, is the unemployment rate, which has remained stubbornly above 9 percent for 20 straight months, the longest since the Great Depression. Counting those who are seeking full-time jobs while working part time and those who have stopped looking altogether, it's closer to 17 percent. At the current rate, it could be 2017 before the country replaces the more than eight million jobs lost since December 2007. The second figure is this year's federal budget deficit, which has touched off a prairie fire of public protest and emerged as the central issue of the newly installed Republican House. In a recent poll by The Times and CBS News, 82 percent of Americans rated the economy bad, and just 43 percent approved of the way Obama was handling it. ''People look at the economy today, and they're disappointed by what we've achieved,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told me last month. ''But that just misses the fundamental reality -- it could have been so much worse.'' The program Obama managed to enact represented an ''unbelievably heroic, implausible accomplishment,'' Geithner argued, yet one that requires patience. ''Even if we had a magic wand,'' he said, ''it was going to take a long time to dig out.''
The path from crisis to anemic recovery was marked by turmoil inside the White House. The economic team fractured repeatedly over philosophy (should jobs or deficits take priority?) and personality (who got to attend which meetings?), resulting in feuds that ultimately helped break it apart. The process felt like a treadmill, as one former official put it, with proposals sometimes debated for months before decisions were reached. The word commonly used by those involved is ''dysfunctional,'' and in recent months, most of the initial team has left or made plans to leave, including Larry Summers, Christina Romer, Peter Orszag, Rahm Emanuel and Paul Volcker.
With Geithner as its anchor, a new economic team is being built around Bill Clinton-era figures like William Daley, Gene Sperling and Jack Lew, a group assembled to joust with Republicans instead of one another. Rather than responding to crises or putting into motion grand macroeconomic theories, they will focus on pushing the recovery into higher gear while at the same time figuring out how to reduce the deficit -- two goals that some see as incompatible in the short term. And along the way, they need to convince Americans that the president is focused on jobs, jobs, jobs.
In his State of the Union address last year, Obama declared that ''jobs must be our No. 1 focus in 2010,'' then spent much of the year on other issues, some of his choosing, like health care, and others forced upon him, like the Gulf of Mexico spill. ''The public didn't sense that everyone in the White House was waking up thinking about how to create jobs,'' said John Podesta, the former Clinton White House chief of staff and president of the Center for American Progress who directed Obama's transition. ''It seemed like they were waking up every day thinking about how to pass more bills. It was like, do something. And if that doesn't work, do something else.''
Podesta said that Obama has a chance to explain his new approach when he walks into the House for this year's State of the Union on Jan. 25. Members of the president's staff say he will do just that. Days after being appointed director of the National Economic Council, Sperling told me that Obama will be intensifying his focus. ''His message to me when offering this job could not have been clearer,'' Sperling said. ''He wants us working to ensure that his entire administration is waking up every day asking what can we do for jobs and competitiveness. . . . He wants all hands on deck.''
It may take all hands. While Obama and his team were hardly the only ones to underestimate the depth of the problem they inherited in early 2009, their failure to define it from those early days has undermined a bedrock idea of American liberalism, the faith in the capacity of government to play a constructive role in the markets and make up for the limits of individuals to cope with them. Since unemployment has remained so high for so long while deficits have soared, it must mean the stimulus did not work and the money was wasted. Smaller government, less regulation and lower taxes, therefore, would be the only answer. And so, Obama's challenge may be more fundamental even than reducing unemployment and winning re-election; he wants to prove that liberal economic theory can be adapted to the 21st century.
THE PRE-CHRISTMAS WHITE HOUSE MEETING with unexciting ideas came almost two years to the day after a far different session in Chicago, as the newly elected president set up his administration. In any White House, certain moments become etched into the creation myth, part of the narrative told again and again to explain a presidency. For Obama, the meeting on Dec. 16, 2008, was one such moment.
Aides tell the story to underscore the gravity of the situation Obama faced. ''That was a formative event,'' recalled David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser. ''The briefing was brutal,'' said Austan Goolsbee, one of Obama's economic advisers. Obama was warned the country was in far worse shape than anyone realized. ''This was not your father's or my father's recession,'' Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, told me this month from Chicago, where he is running for mayor. ''This was our grandfather's Depression.''
This was all new to Obama, who, unlike Bush or Clinton, had never managed even a state economy. Now he was responsible for a nation in which everyone from homeowners to Wall Street tycoons had so overextended themselves that the system was coming apart. Obama's theory of the case was that the country was trapped in a bubble-and-bust cycle, cascading from one artificial, unsustainable boom to the next. He wanted to not just apply a short-term patch but also to erect a more durable system with a stronger set of rules.
Obama's instinct was to take on everything at once. ''I want to pull the band-aid off quickly, not delay the pain,'' a senior Obama official remembers him saying. ''He didn't want to muddle through it, Japan-style,'' recalled Larry Summers, tapped to be director of Obama's National Economic Council. Romer calculated how much government spending would be needed to fill the gaping hole of consumer demand and came up with $1.2 trillion, the highest of three options. Summers told her to leave that number out of the memorandum to Obama. Emanuel argued that such an astronomical figure would be politically explosive. Romer left it out but mentioned it to Obama during a briefing. ''That's what you'd need to do to definitively heal the economy,'' she said, according to someone in the room. Still, she and Summers agreed on recommending close to $900 billion.
Liberals like the Nobel Prize-winning economists Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman argue that the $800 billion package of infrastructure projects, aid to states and tax breaks that Congress eventually passed was inadequate and poorly targeted. ''The stimulus was too small and not well-enough designed,'' Stiglitz told me. ''Most of my concerns have turned out to be valid.'' Romer, who has returned to teach at Berkeley, told me she now agrees about the size. In Washington, she said, ''you're not supposed to say the obvious thing, which is that in retrospect of course it should have been bigger. With unemployment at 10 percent, I don't know how you could say you wouldn't have done anything different. Of course you would have made it bigger.''
Given what was known then, however, she said the $800 billion was reasonable and the most that Congress would approve. ''In my mind,'' she said, ''the problem was not in the original package; it was in not adjusting to changed circumstances.'' Once it was clear that the situation was deteriorating, she said, the White House should have gone back to Congress for more stimulus money. ''That was where we could have been bolder,'' she said.
The crisis forced Obama to confront the larger question of government's role in the economy. Should taxpayers save large enterprises from failure? When is the risk of not intervening too great? How much should politicians dictate to business? His team engaged in a fierce debate about whether to nationalize the biggest banks, as Stiglitz and Krugman advocated. Summers entertained the idea, at least for purposes of discussion, for banks that could not pass a ''stress test'' examining their solvency. Geithner and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, argued against it. Ultimately the tests found the banks were in better shape than feared, a critical moment in shoring up confidence. ''The cheapest form of stimulus is confidence,'' Summers likes to say.
With the auto industry, the team was even more divided, and Obama adopted a more intrusive approach than with the banks. The government took over General Motors and pushed Chrysler into a merger with Fiat, forcing both firms into bankruptcy to restructure, reduce debt and lower labor costs. Then the government backed out; in G.M.'s initial public offering last November, the government cut its share of stock from 61 percent to 33 percent and recouped $13.5 billion. ''In both cases,'' Emanuel said, referring to banks and automakers, ''the extremes were rejected. In both cases, he forced management to do things they would not or could not do for themselves. And in both cases, they've emerged stronger.''
But not Obama. The flurry of actions proved deeply unpopular and stoked a Tea Party reaction. He was blamed for helping rich bankers and throwing taxpayer money away, even if the stimulus cut taxes for 95 percent of working Americans (a break many never realized they got). Critics branded his health care, climate-change and financial-regulation proposals ''job killers.'' Worse, perhaps, were the administration's own rosy forecasts. A January 2009 study by Romer and Jared Bernstein, the economic adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden, predicted that if the stimulus passed, unemployment would be at 7 percent at the end of 2010.
''I truly believed that forecast,'' Romer told me. ''I consulted with every good forecaster who would talk with me, including the Federal Reserve.'' The problem was that the baseline economy was in worse shape than even the grim assessment of that Chicago meeting in late 2008. Without the actions taken by Bush, Obama and the Federal Reserve, the economy was headed to what Bernanke called ''Depression 2.0,'' in which unemployment potentially would peak at 16.5 percent, according to a later study by Blinder and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. But the Romer-Bernstein forecast set expectations that Obama could not meet. ''I just think that killed them in terms of the perceptions,'' Zandi told me. ''I would have made the same mistake. That was an economist's mistake, a technocratic mistake. But that really hurt them.''
It was hardly the only moment of mistaken optimism. Soon after taking office, Obama's team began spotting ''glimmers of hope'' or, as Bernanke put it, ''green shoots'' indicating fresh growth. By the end of 2009, White House officials thought they were reaching escape velocity, breaking away from the gravitational pull of the Great Recession. ''There was the sense that the economy was moving again,'' Emanuel said. Then came a string of episodes that he and others believe sidetracked the economy: the European financial crisis triggered by Greece, the gulf oil spill, conflict over Gaza and the concurrent gyrations in the stock market. ''We got hit by the G-force,'' Emanuel said. Much of the late 2009 growth spurt owed to a temporary restocking of inventories, and the slowdown undercut the talk of green shoots. ''It was too premature to say that, and so it built up expectations,'' Emanuel said. Instead of a ''recovery summer,'' fears of a double-dip recession returned while the president was busy with other issues. ''It was costly to the president because it looked like Washington was fiddling while unemployment was stubbornly high,'' a senior Obama official said.
Other advisers said the administration should have moved more aggressively a year ago to bolster the nascent recovery. There was discussion then about a series of measures, like a payroll tax holiday, business tax breaks and infrastructure spending, that would have amounted to a second stimulus. But it lingered. ''Where we didn't do enough was in the fall of '09,'' Romer told me. ''We never coalesced and never made as strong a push as we should have for some of the things that finally got done last month, like a payroll tax cut.''
I went to see Geithner one evening in late December in his high-ceilinged office at the end of the third floor in the Treasury Building. At 49, Geithner is relaxed and confident, prone to using words like ''cool'' to describe esoteric economic ideas, and is so well liked within the administration that he is universally known simply as Tim. He is a surprising survivor, given the lacerating criticism of his early days in office, but he bonded with Obama, who was born just two weeks earlier, and emerged as the strongest figure on the economic team, even if not its most effective public spokesman.
When we talked, he had just helped negotiate the deal with Republicans to extend Bush-era tax cuts for two years while also temporarily trimming payroll taxes and providing more unemployment benefits. He sank into a chair, a young man in an old man's job, and began ruminating about how the team had handled the economy.
All the second-guessing, he said, missed the point. ''Everybody now has these cool ideas -- why didn't we do it in this way, why didn't we do it bigger, why didn't we have a different mix,'' he said, thinking about the stimulus. ''All of that is marginal.'' What was important, he said, were speed and force. As for nationalizing or liquidating the banks, he said, ''They both would have been catastrophic.''
Still, any way you look at it, he said, ''it was a brutal two years.''
EARLIER THIS MONTH I met with Summers at a restaurant in suburban Boston three days after his last day at the White House. Tan from a holiday in Jamaica and trying to get his bearings again at Harvard, where he plans to teach a course on Obama's economic policy and write a book, Summers sat at a corner table and ordered bisque and -- from the lighter-fare menu --a steak ''as rare as your chef will make it.''
A former treasury secretary and Harvard president, Summers, 56, was the most prominent member of Obama's economic team. It has become a cliche to describe him as brilliant and brash, but as we talked for three hours that night, he struck me as thoughtful and analytical about what went right and what didn't. He didn't want to be quoted from that conversation, though, preferring to polish his thoughts with academic precision and e-mail them to me later. ''We always believed that the greatest risk was doing too little, not to do too much,'' he wrote. ''We fought for the largest fiscal program we could get.'' More infrastructure money might not have made a difference given that much of what was included in the package has yet to be spent. As for the banks, Summers said their revival and payback of TARP money make it hard to argue that ''the economy would somehow be in better shape today if the government had nationalized the banking system.''
At the National Economic Council, Summers was charged with running the process for developing policy. But the team never embraced the no-drama-Obama ethos. Over the last two months, I interviewed nearly all of the team's main figures, past and present, and when we talked about their relations with one another, it was like picking through the wreckage of a messy divorce.
At the center was Summers, a larger-than-life figure who by many accounts was ill suited to run a bureaucratic process. To some of his colleagues, Summers was an eye-rolling intellectual bully. ''He's much better at telling you why you're stupid than creating a system that can produce usable policy solutions,'' said one Obama adviser, who, like others, did not want to be named criticizing Summers. At meetings, colleagues with differing viewpoints felt the full force of his capacity for finding flaws in their reasoning.
It was a measure of Summers's stature that everyone around him paid attention to signs of his status. Rahm Emanuel promised him a White House car, befitting a former cabinet secretary, but discovered that he could not deliver because the number of vehicles had been capped. Likewise, after Summers was not invited to march onto the floor of the House with the cabinet for Obama's first State of the Union address, Emanuel made sure he was included for the second. ''Larry was invaluable to the president,'' Emanuel told me. ''It was not unreasonable to ask for a car. It was not unreasonable to ask to walk in there.'' (A White House spokeswoman said Summers was promised a car but did not request it.)
Summers skirmished with colleagues over protocol. Austan Goolsbee, who opposed rescuing Chrysler, once cautioned Obama during a meeting that rescuing auto suppliers would signal that they would also save the automakers; Summers cornered him afterward and ''exploded,'' according to a memoir by Steven Rattner, the auto-task-force leader. ''You do not relitigate in front of the president,'' Summers scolded. Goolsbee retorted, ''I was not litigating in front of the president.'' The moment to decide whether to rescue Chrysler came during the president's morning economic briefing. And while Goolsbee and others of his rank did not typically attend that meeting, his absence was seen as depriving the president of the strongest opposition voice. Obama noticed, and summoned Goolsbee.
Summers skirmished with Romer over a meeting at which she was not included. ''I didn't come here to waste my time,'' Romer angrily told him, according to someone informed about the conversation. ''I'm perfectly happy to go home.'' While Summers was often blamed, the White House spokeswoman said that Emanuel's office determined meetings and tried to keep them small. Summers and Emanuel also clashed over incentives for small business -- the chief of staff kept demanding a proposal, but Summers opposed the idea of using TARP money for the initiative, arguing it would not be effective. It took months to develop a policy.
Obama knew what he was getting with Summers. And Summers's defenders, while calling him abrasive, said he was on the right side of nearly every issue and called the complaints exaggerated. ''Larry is a brilliant guy with a forceful personality and strong opinions,'' Sperling said. ''He was also very dedicated to ensuring the full range of opinions were fairly presented to the president.'' Summers understands where his strengths lie and where they don't. ''I told the president when he offered me the job that what I would be able to bring him was access to all views, and hopefully ensure that the thinking was rigorous,'' he told me. ''But probably making everyone feel validated was not going to be my best thing.''
The dysfunction extended beyond Summers. Paul Volcker, the former central banker tapped to lead a new Presidential Economic Recovery Advisory Board, apparently felt ignored, at least until the president embraced his suggestion, dubbed ''the Volcker rule,'' to bar big banks from risking their own capital in speculative trades. Valerie Jarrett, Obama's senior adviser in charge of relations with the business community, was derided by fellow administration officials who deemed her outreach to corporate executives empty engagement, because meetings had no tangible outcome, though, of course, her office did not set the policies that angered business in the first place. Romer was seen as insecure in Summers's shadow, frustrating some colleagues who called her difficult, a presumption her defenders considered sexist.
''There's no question there were strong personalities all around, and at times we were not as united as the president would have liked,'' Romer told me. ''I think overall we did pretty well, and we got to some good decisions and got many things done.'' Whatever their differences, she noted that she shared a lot of views with Summers. ''We were probably the two people in closest alignment philosophically and economically on the team,'' she said.
And then there was Orszag, who turned 40 just after he was chosen as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was celebrated for his brainy dynamism. By last summer, he had left after falling out with colleagues, who considered him arrogant. When Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood mentioned to a reporter that he had settled a dispute with Orszag by going around him to Emanuel, a peeved Orszag would not take his apology calls; LaHood ultimately sent a case of wine to make amends. Orszag also exchanged testy e-mails with Emanuel over the health care effort. When colleagues suspected him of leaking information to the media, Orszag denied it. But he eventually concluded that he had allowed himself to become overexposed and recognized his relationships were poisoned.
At the heart of the friction was the deficit, which Orszag saw as a priority. Other officials tired of Orzsag's refrain. ''Yes, the deficit's important, but not this year,'' said one official. ''I think the deficit for him was always most important. He was not winning the argument.'' Orszag agreed that cutting spending too soon would hurt the economy, but he wanted to begin planning ahead. One reason he left, eventually winding up at Citigroup, was the sense that the administration was trapped in a dynamic that would make it hard to reduce the deficit adequately.
Reflecting on it now, Orszag looked back on the tensions with regret. ''Unfortunately,'' he told me, ''I think the environment often brought out the worst in people instead of the best in people. And I'd include myself in that.''
ACROSS LAFAYETTE SQUARE from the White House is the headquarters of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Last spring, four massive banners were hung on its building spelling out ''J-O-B-S,'' a message presumably visible from the third floor of the White House, where the president wakes up. By fall, the chamber and Obama were at war during a midterm campaign that ended with repudiation of the president's party.
''The basic issue here,'' Thomas Donohue, the chamber president, told me last month, ''is uncertainty -- uncertainty on what health care is actually going to cost, uncertainty on hundreds of rule-makings in the Dodd-Frank bill, uncertainty about what's going to come out of the E.P.A. putting through what they couldn't get legislatively, uncertainty about taxes.''
The health care program and the financial-regulation law sponsored by Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank were bad enough, as far as the chamber was concerned. But Obama's periodic forays into populism made it personal. He couldn't seem to decide whether he was going to take Wall Street to task for its irresponsible behavior or cajole it into freeing up money to get the economy moving. One day he derided ''fat-cat bankers'' who caused the recession; another day, he soothed them by saying that he and the American people ''don't begrudge'' multimillion-dollar bonuses.
In the aggregate, at least, balance sheets haven't suffered. Given the profits washing through America's corporations now, some scoff at the depiction of Obama as antibusiness. ''That's the most ridiculous assertion I've ever heard,'' Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., told me. ''This president has been more pro-business than any before him, including Bush.''
Obama's experiments with antibusiness rhetoric fueled tensions between his political and economic advisers. The political team wanted Obama to connect with the widespread resentment Americans felt toward Wall Street and what Geithner called ''the very deep public desire for Old Testament justice.'' Geithner and the economic team warned that the White House rhetoric was too sweeping, since most American businesses had little to do with the financial crisis. David Axelrod, the political adviser, said critics used the rhetoric ''to make the case that he was somehow inhospitable to business, and nothing could be further from the truth.''
Obama has powerful incentives to make up with business. Still nervous after the crash, and uncertain about government policies, American corporations are sitting on $2 trillion in cash, and the president wants them to use it to hire people. ''How do I get companies sitting around the table to start investing in job-creating enterprises?'' Obama asked executives at last month's lunch, according to a person in the room. Obama next month plans to cross Lafayette Square to address the chamber at its headquarters. And it did not go unnoticed that in hiring former Commerce Secretary William Daley as chief of staff, Obama turned his White House over to an executive from JPMorgan Chase.
Another initiative that is playing well with the chamber is expanded trade. Three years ago, during the Ohio Democratic primary, Obama appealed to labor by vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, but never followed through. Today he presents himself as a free-trader, vowing to double exports and last month sealing a revised version of Bush's free-trade pact with South Korea. Then he enlisted Daley, the man who pushed Nafta through Congress.
By itself, trade is no short-term balm, but it represents one of the ''solutions on the cheap'' the president wanted, a way of promoting growth without deficit spending. In our conversation, Donohue, of the chamber, played down past conflicts, noting that his group supported the original stimulus bill as well as the South Korea agreement. ''I want to be very clear -- we're not having any fight with the president,'' he told me. ''We have fights over issues, but not with him.'' Given Obama's actions lately, Donohue said ''he's moving in a direction that shows that he's figured it out.''
ALMOST NO ONE NOTICED, but Obama laid out his new economic direction during a speech in Winston-Salem, N.C., last month, just hours before striking a tax-cut deal with Republicans. In the speech, he declared ''the threat of a depression has passed'' and offered a vision for rebuilding by improving American competitiveness in a global economy, calling it ''our generation's Sputnik moment.''
The competitiveness theme, which will be prominent in the State of the Union address, is a convenient rubric that encompasses trade as well as other presidential priorities like more education-accountability reforms, more federal support for research and innovation, more green technology industry like the advanced battery plants Obama likes to visit and more infrastructure like high-speed trains. Obama has tried before to link these disparate priorities into a coherent theme, calling such ideas, along with health care and financial regulation, the pillars of a New Foundation for a postcrisis economy, a la the New Deal. But he never made it stick. ''Messaging when we have 9.8 percent unemployment is difficult,'' Axelrod said. Now Obama is reframing these ideas as a response to China and other economic rivals that, he tells audiences, are moving forward while America risks lagging behind. In that way, he has turned his message into a made-in-America appeal to patriotism, and potentially grounds for consensus with Republicans. ''This is a theme people can rally around,'' Goolsbee told me. ''We've shifted out of the rescue mode. We've got to move into full-fledged growth mode.''
Goolsbee will be operating in that mode as part of the new team. He replaced Romer as head of the Council of Economic Advisers, just as Sperling replaced Summers as head of the National Economic Council, Jack Lew replaced Orszag at the Office of Management and Budget and Daley replaced Emanuel as chief of staff. The selection of Sperling, who held the same job under Clinton, was telling. A onetime boy wonder who, despite his graying hair, still has the same whirling-dervish, work-till-midnight energy, Sperling was passed over for other prominent jobs. He bided his time as a counselor to Geithner, and eventually won over Obama with his doggedness. As a champion of the payroll tax holiday, he proved critical to shaping Obama's tax deal with Republicans and so many other issues that White House officials refer to him as B.O.G., the Bureau of Gene. Where Summers was a master macroeconomic thinker, Sperling is known for his mastery of getting things done, or at least waging the fight, in the place where policy, politics and media meet. Lew is also returning to the same job he had under Clinton, when he balanced the budget alongside Congressional Republicans.
The renewed focus on the economy goes back to last August, when after months of grappling with health care, the oil spill and the financial-regulation bill, Obama resolved to redouble efforts to create jobs. While he was on vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Obama called his economic advisers and told them to develop a new agenda for the fall, which led to a September proposal to invest more money in infrastructure, make the research-and-development tax credit for businesses permanent and allow companies to deduct more expenses right away. His advisers also began discussing ideas for his next State of the Union, like a payroll tax holiday, ideas that ultimately were worked into last month's tax deal with Republicans instead.
The president's search for an agenda that will excite him, and the rest of America, has taken him to the far corners of the economic conversation. He recently asked advisers to present arguments about whether the slow recovery is part of an economic cycle that will ultimately turn around or something different, a ''new normal'' signaling stagnation as in Japan in the 1990s. ''He's trying to gather different ideas and different perspectives both on where we are and where we're going,'' Goolsbee said.
In the end, Obama concluded that the economic moment is part of a cycle. He has to hope so. The unemployment rate drifted down to 9.4 percent in December from a high of 9.8 percent, but largely because many people gave up looking for work; the economy added just 100,000 jobs last month, not enough to keep up with population growth. Economists say the economy needs to grow 2.5 percent a year just to absorb newcomers to the labor force. It takes roughly 2 percentage points of growth over that to cut unemployment by 1 percentage point. ''That's a very different kind of challenge than putting out a financial fire,'' Geithner told me.
The tax deal between Obama and Republicans amounted to a second stimulus package, and economists responded by upgrading growth projections for 2011 to around 3.5 percent. But even if that optimism is borne out, and the pace is maintained, unemployment would still be about 8 percent when voters pass judgment on Obama's presidency in 2012. His political advisers hope that the direction of the economy will be clear enough to satisfy voters, as it was in 1984 when Ronald Reagan was re-elected despite more than 7 percent unemployment.
The slow recovery is typical of recessions that follow a financial crisis, as outlined in ''This Time Is Different,'' a book by the economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart. ''They're deeper, they last longer and it takes years for unemployment to come back,'' Rogoff told me last month, shortly after a meeting with Obama. While crediting the president for averting a catastrophe, Rogoff said Obama erred by not preparing the country for a drawn-out and painful recovery. ''The biggest tactical mistake he made and the administration made,'' he said, ''was they wanted to be reassuring to everyone, so they painted this rosy picture, saying we're going to bounce back.'' After two years, he said, the president has essentially done everything he can and must wait to see if it works. ''What's going to happen with unemployment and the economy is largely set at this point,'' he said. ''He's taken his decisions, and now it will unfold and things will begin to improve.''
Instead, the debate will shift to curbing deficits and redesigning the tax code. Republicans have made shrinking government the core of their economic message, appealing to many Americans who think Obama (and before him, Bush) let spending get out of hand. ''We're at that transition moment,'' Lew told me. ''We've got to look ahead at the very serious fiscal challenges we have.'' Obama plans to use the State of the Union to present himself as a fiscal conservative. But it will be a delicate balance for someone who believes government spending helped turn the economy around; he hopes to make the case that he can rein in the deficit but that the deepest cuts should wait until after the recovery gathers momentum. ''We have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,'' Lew said. ''I deeply believe that this would be the wrong time to hit the brakes.''
The burden clearly weighs on Obama as he searches for that magic combination. He has made a point of talking more lately about jobs and associating himself with the burdens of employers and employees alike. He announced Sperling's appointment this month not at the White House but at a factory in Maryland, where he expressed sympathy for the stresses of running a business in hard times. The factory owner's family once lived above the store, and Obama joked that some days it probably feels as if they still do. ''You know,'' added the man living over the most stressful store in America, ''that's what happens when you're in charge.''

HEADLINE: Maybe Japan Was Just a Warm-Up

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
IN the 1980s, the United States faced an unnerving challenge from a rising economic powerhouse and export dynamo. It was an impressive challenger, to be sure, but one that often bent rules of global competition unfairly to its advantage by handing out financial subsidies to domestic companies, discriminating against foreign suppliers in government contracts, pilfering Western technology and keeping its currency cheap.
Three decades later, Americans are hearing an echo of the past. Yet this time, the object of admiration and angst is not Japan Inc., but China Inc.
''We've seen this movie before,'' says Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute and a former United States trade negotiator with Japan in the 1980s. ''Like Japan, China is climbing up the ladder of economic and technological development, and using every means at its disposal to do so.'' 
China, of course, is different from Japan in the 1980s in many ways -- larger, less affluent, ruled by a Communist government and yet in some respects culturally more entrepreneurial. Silicon Valley venture capitalists, for example, have begun setting up offices in China to forge links with entrepreneurs there, as they never really did in Japan.
Economic events and market trends are notoriously unpredictable. In the early 1980s, the Japanese high-technology assault on the American computer and semiconductor industry seemed scary. ''What are our kids supposed to do?'' asked Walter F. Mondale, the former vice president, speaking to a group of electrical workers. ''Sweep up around the Japanese computers?'' It captured the economic pessimism of the time, even if it serves as a laugh line today because, after all, how often do you see a Japanese computer?
So, applying equal doses of humility and hindsight, a look anew at the economic challenge symbolized by Japan -- and the American response -- might offer perspective on the China challenge today.
First, a reality check on Japan. Yes, that nation's big-business culture missed the personal computer revolution and the Internet, producing no rivals to Microsoft, Apple, Google or Facebook. But Japan is no basket case. It is a world leader in autos, machine tools, flat-panel displays and other parts of the consumer electronics industry. Some of Japan's policies did indeed prevail, and America still runs a sizable trade deficit with the country.
Japan, which lacks natural-resource wealth like oil, has a per-capita income of more than $42,000, compared with about $47,000 for the United States, according to the International Monetary Fund. China's per-capita income is less than $4,300.
In America, the 1980s were Ronald Reagan's decade, a time that celebrated free markets, free trade and tax cuts. ''Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem'' was his famous distillation. Yet, for certain industries, the Reagan administration took steps that amounted to a measured approach to industrial policy. Washington negotiated so-called voluntary export restraints with the Japanese in the automobile industry. That forced Japanese automakers to build factories in the United States that now employ many thousands of American workers. And a semiconductor trade agreement helped pry open the Japanese market.
''People often forget that we did a lot of things to address the Japanese challenge,'' says Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
IN the 1980s, the United States government's semiconductor policy focused the minds of industry leaders facing the demise of their industry. There is still considerable debate over the effectiveness of a consortium, created by the federal government and several companies. Called Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology, or Sematech, it shared the costs and risks of developing computer chip-making skills. But the partial lifting of antitrust and collusion restrictions gave companies a chance to innovate.
I.B.M., for its part, was worried that a vital supplier, the chipmaker Intel, was in danger, so it invested in it. That gave Intel -- under siege from Japanese companies in the market for memory chips, which store data temporarily -- the breathing room to risk making the jump to microprocessors, which process data and serve as the brains of personal computers. Intel made the move to the more profitable chips before the PC industry really took off -- but when it did, Intel never looked back. The Japanese didn't make that innovative leap and became stuck in a commodity business that South Korean and Taiwanese companies eventually dominated.
''In semiconductors, we got organized to defend and stay ahead,'' says William A. Reinsch, a foreign trade expert and the chairman of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan advisory group to Congress. ''In that industry, there was a considerable amount of cooperation between the U.S. government and business. The computer chip industry was deemed too important to lose, not least because of all the military applications of computer chip technology.''
One big reason that Japan posed a threat in the 1980s in computer chips and large computers was the technology transfer that had occurred years before. In order to sell in the Japanese market and repatriate profits, I.B.M. and Texas Instruments, an early leader in chips, had to share technology with the Japanese. They set up factories there, too.
In China these days, the details may differ, but the government imposes the same kind of requirements to share technology and set up manufacturing plants in joint ventures for preferred access to the domestic market.
China has a lengthy list of industries where it has long-term ambitions. They include commercial aircraft, telecommunications equipment, high-speed trains, clean-energy goods like solar panels and wind turbines, and even automobiles.
''The bet for I.B.M. in Japan, as it is for companies like Boeing and General Electric today in China, is that they can stay ahead, innovate faster than the potential competitors they are helping,'' says Edward J. Lincoln, professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University, and director of its Japan-U.S. Center for Business and Economic Studies.
In China, however, American companies are making a much larger bet that they can stay ahead in the intellectual property race. In some fields, particularly computer software, China has a well-earned reputation for theft, though Beijing has pledged to curb the practice in government agencies and state-owned companies. And in China, many more Western companies are engaged in technology-sharing joint ventures than was ever the case in Japan.
Japan sharply limited direct investment by foreign companies, while China has welcomed it. And in China, the terms and conditions of investment have evolved over the years. Beginning in the 1980s, China opened up ''special economic zones,'' mainly in the southern part of the country, where foreign companies could set up factories and export goods. In the 1990s, China opened up more broadly to foreign investment, allowing companies to sell in the domestic market.
In the last couple of years, the Chinese government, analysts and executives say, has prodded foreign companies to transfer more advanced technology for the inside track in its market. The government effort to accelerate China's technological climb is called ''indigenous innovation.''
''The campaign is focused on employing China's fast-growing domestic market and powerful regulatory regime to decrease reliance on foreign technology and develop indigenous technologies,'' explains a report on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Web site.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says: ''China was much more clever than Japan with its investment policies. It invited foreign direct investment and then took the American corporations hostage.''
The lure of tapping the fast-growing Chinese market -- far larger than Japan's -- gives China a lot of leverage with American companies, which mutes complaints in Washington, Mr. Bergsten says. Most American corporations, he says, have resisted trade restrictions on China because they hope to tap the Chinese market and produce goods there.
Yet American corporations are worried about China's innovation policy, since it means potentially jump-starting Chinese rivals. Business leaders pushed that to the top of the agenda for President Hu Jintao's trip to the United States last week, Mr. Bergsten says. And, indeed, in meetings during the week, the Chinese delegation gave American executives assurances that China would be flexible in pursuing its innovation initiative.
The Chinese currency, the renminbi, took a back seat as an issue during the state visit. But Mr. Bergsten estimates that the renminbi is undervalued by 20 percent or more -- the Chinese central bank's purchases of dollars depress the Chinese exchange rate and the subsequent lower value of the renminbi makes Chinese exports less costly abroad. ''It's an across-the-board export subsidy,'' he says.
THERE will be ceaseless currency and trade issues with China, as there were with Japan. Still, as China grows wealthier, economists predict, it will buy more of the high-value, high-technology products and services at which the United States excels.
The real answer to the China challenge, like the competition from Japan in the 1980s, must come from the United States, the industrial policy thinkers say. A mix of several ingredients will undoubtedly be sought: skillful government policy, smart private-sector strategies, national investment in research and development for long-term innovation, and improved performance of the American education system. In short, all the things the United States should be doing anyway, but with an added measure of urgency because of the global competition that China epitomizes -- an economic Sputnik.

HEADLINE: Talks on Iran's Nuclear Program Close With No Progress

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Two days of talks between Iran and six world powers ended in failure on Saturday, with Iran refusing to engage on any concrete proposals to build confidence that its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and with no date set for another meeting.
Western officials expressed disappointment, but not surprise. They reiterated that their proposals, including a modified deal under which Iran would ship out most of its enriched uranium in return for nuclear fuel, were still in effect should Iran choose to open talks without preconditions.
The head of the delegation of the six world powers, Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, said: ''Our proposals remain on the table. Our door remains open. Our telephone lines remain open.'' But she said the Iranian chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, made no promise even to raise the proposals in Tehran and report back.
A senior American official said that the Iranians were skillful negotiators, and that ''this will be a real test of our patience and resolve.'' But with no new talks scheduled, the Obama administration will now face new pressures from Congress and some allies to ramp up another round of sanctions against Iran in a strategy that has always attempted to combine increasing pressure on the country with a continued willingness to negotiate. 
At the same time, espionage activities, technical problems and crucial shortages have delayed Iran's nuclear program, providing more time for talks and pressure short of military action. But that delay also reduces the urgency felt by Iran to negotiate seriously while it continues to pile up enriched uranium, even if more slowly.
Rounds of sanctions have begun to hurt Iran, but clearly not to the point of bringing the survival of the government or the Islamic Revolution into play. In fact, even if they are bluffing, Iranian officials insist privately that the sanctions are making Iran stronger by pushing the government to make needed economic reforms and reduce domestic subsidies on energy and food.
Iran listened to the more detailed proposals of the six -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany -- but did not engage with them, a senior American official said, instead insisting on preconditions rejected on Thursday.
Each member of the group, including Russia and China, held firm in the talks with Iran, European and American officials said, blocking what the American official said was another Iranian effort to split the group.
Mr. Jalili consistently demanded that first the six acknowledge Iran's ''right'' to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes and lift sanctions -- ''obstacles'' and ''measures'' in Iranian parlance -- imposed by the United Nations before engaging on more detailed proposals.
''We had hoped to have a detailed and constructive discussion of those ideas,'' Ms. Ashton said. ''But it became clear that the Iranian side was not ready for this unless we agree to preconditions related to enrichment and sanctions. Both these preconditions are not the way to proceed.''
Mr. Jalili, in a news conference, insisted that the only way to move forward was to agree on a framework that respected Iran's rights as a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to enrich for peaceful purposes and that removed punitive measures. ''I don't say these are preconditions,'' he said. ''These are prerequisites.''
He said that while Iran was open to negotiation on many topics, the six pushed ''dictation, not dialogue.'' Without a common logic, he said, ''it's no longer a dialogue but just a set of special orders and specifications.'' He complained about being dictated to by six nations when about 130 countries have signed the nonproliferation treaty.
But American and European officials said that while the treaty provided the right to civilian nuclear energy, ''Iran must also show that its program is peaceful, and we cannot separate the rights in the treaty from the responsibilities,'' one said. So long as Iran is not in full compliance with the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency and cannot prove to the world that its program is solely civilian, the officials said, Security Council sanctions and demands that Iran suspend enrichment will remain in force.
The strategy of the six was to lay out for Iran ways to build confidence, in particular by proposals for more international monitoring and a modified fuel swap agreement, whereby Iran would ship out enriched uranium to be made into fuel rods for a small reactor in Tehran that produces medical isotopes and that is running out of fuel. In October 2009, Iran agreed in principle in Geneva to ship about 2,650 pounds -- what was then 75 percent of its lightly enriched uranium -- for this purpose, but the swap was vetoed in Iran. The idea was to leave Iran less than the amount required to build one nuclear weapon.
Iran has produced nearly three times as much low-enriched uranium in the meantime, and has also enriched about 90 pounds of it to 19.75 percent, which is more than halfway to the level required for a bomb. So the six want to modify the proposal in order to leave Iran, again, with less low-enriched uranium than required to build a bomb, and with no uranium enriched to 19.75 percent.
But Iran here did not even agree to an expert-level meeting on the proposal, diplomats said.
Still, the fuel swap idea, despite being a central part of a calculated outreach to Iran, could turn into a trap: Iran could make a counterproposal that it ship twice as much -- say about 5,300 pounds -- out of the country in return for fuel.
Such a proposal would be rejected by the negotiating partners, because it would still leave Iran with more than enough to build a bomb. Still, it could be sold by the Iranians to many countries in the world as a concession to demands by the United States and Europe to prove its peaceful intentions.
As talks shut down here on Saturday, the tone was one of frustration even as officials held out the hope that diplomacy could continue at some point.
One American official said, ''We hoped we would have a constructive discussion here, but it became clear that the Iranian side wasn't ready for this.''
A senior European official spoke of ''two quite frustrating days'' and said: ''We came here with the wish to engage seriously and begin a real dialogue'' on concrete proposals to build confidence. ''But we couldn't do that, because we got stuck at the pre-dialogue stage.''
He also said that Ms. Ashton had urged Mr. Jalili to open a bilateral channel to his American counterpart, the under secretary of state for political affairs, William J. Burns. ''We told the Iranians privately that it's a big mistake not to talk to the U.S.,'' the European diplomat said. American officials played down the lack of a direct line with Mr. Jalili, saying that it might be too politically dangerous for him at home.

HEADLINE: Baldness: Put a Crown on It

BYLINE: By TATIANA BONCOMPAGNI

 BODY:
OF all the details surrounding Prince William's April marriage to his longtime girlfriend, Kate Middleton, few seem to have garnered as much attention as his rapidly receding hairline.
''You Can Leave Your Hat On'' and ''No Hair to the Throne'' are among the many headlines that have appeared in the British tabloids. Which poses a question: Is it possible that the 28-year-old prince felt an urge to lock up a commitment from Ms. Middleton because his heart-throb status might be beginning to disappear with the hair? If so, what must the rest of the not-so-princely men in the world feel when youthful looks begin to fade?
In the past, only women were perceived to have a marital sell-by date. But thanks to a convergence of social and economic trends, some men feel the same pressures.
''The clock ticks for both men and women,'' said W. Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. 
Michael Kimmel, a sociologist, said one contributing factor is the increasing economic independence of women. Mr. Kimmel, a professor at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, cited a 1930s study by Willard Waller that evaluated how women and men assessed each other's sexual marketability based on criteria including physical appearance, social skills and financial stability. A woman of that era valued a man's earning capacity above good looks and other traits.
But now, Mr. Kimmel said, ''women are able to provide for a family, so they are more able to focus as well on physical features.''
Also, men have become more concerned with body image, meaning that they are more likely to measure themselves against culturally perceived standards of attractiveness, according to Ashley Mears, a sociologist. She traces the trend to the 1980s with more advertisements and magazines geared toward men.
In other words, those Propecia and Rogaine ads can wear on the psyche.
Men may give themselves some leeway when it comes to putting on a few extra pounds and having wrinkles (two typical areas of concern among aging women hoping to attract a mate). But hair loss -- both androgenic alopecia, often referred to as male-pattern baldness, and alopecia areata, which typically involves temporary and localized shedding -- can be emotionally traumatic, especially for men in their 20s.
In fact, the American Academy of Dermatology estimates 80 million men and women in the United States suffer from hereditary thinning or baldness.
Dr. Alice Trisdorfer, a psychologist in Philadelphia, said she once had a patient so consumed by his thinning hair that he ''would count the number of hairs lost on his pillow and how many he found in the shower drain.''
Spencer Kobren hears such hair-obsessed stories often. He is the host of ''The Bald Truth,'' a talk show streamed live online at thebaldtruth.com. The site also has a forum with many thousands of posts.
''As their hair line is eroding, so is their self-confidence and attractiveness,'' said Mr. Kobren. ''We call it a cancer of the spirit.''
For example, one of the site's users, Zero Confidence Balder, 23, posted this: ''I know this is pathetic, but I've lost so much self-confidence and I feel like I'm always angling my head so that people can't see the top.''
Because of the blow to their self-esteem, some balding men simply settle when it comes to spouses, Mr. Kobren said. ''Guys believe they don't have much time left as they continue to lose their hair. They kind of grab the person closest to them who they find relatively attractive at the time. Emotionally it's too difficult for them to go out there and try to court the girl of their dreams if they are feeling emotionally insecure about themselves.''
Although Ms. Middleton and most other women aren't likely to admit having an aversion to balding men, Susan Jones, an executive at an accounting firm in Manhattan, said many of her female friends in their late 30s and 40s are alone, in part, because their ''impossibly high'' criteria for men have little to do with what it takes to be a good husband. ''They want to date these good-looking men, but really, that's not going to get you very far in a marriage,'' said Ms. Jones, who pointed out that she has been happily married to Richard Jones, who is bald, for 13 years.
''I think we are very well matched,'' said Mr. Jones, an associate professor of accounting at Hofstra.
Dr. Neil Sadick, a dermatologist in New York who is balding, said, ''There is more acceptance for balding.'' For proof, one need only look to athletes like Michael Jordan and Mark Messier and movie stars like Bruce Willis and Jason Statham who are popularizing the shaved head.
Lauren Dalrymple, 35, believes that hair loss ''is more of an issue for men than it is for women.'' And so later this year she plans to marry 40-year-old John Christel, whose hair began thinning in his 20s.
The rise of the post-industrial workplace in which men (and women) are more likely to engage in face-to-face interactions has influenced men's self-image as well as their appearance, said Kathleen Gerson, a professor at New York University and author of ''The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work and Family.''
''Now, how we look matters,'' she said.
Of course there are plenty of bald and balding men living happily ever after. For starters, men, like women, are marrying later in life, according to Census data. And although women rank physical features higher on their future-husband wish lists, they also care about personality, said Mr. Wilcox of the National Marriage Project. ''The good news is that women are even more attentive to a man's capacity to be a good friend or be emotionally engaged,'' he said.
On thebaldtruth.com, one post, Fixed By 35, figured out a more radical way to feel loved: ''I'm emigrating to Australia next year. They're the only English speaking developed world country that still sometimes elects bald men to lead the country, so logically they must be more mature about disfigurement. Plus if you're bald, you HAVE to wear a hat in summer to avoid skin cancer.''
Lucky for Prince William, Ms. Middleton doesn't seem bothered by what adorns his head -- now or later.

HEADLINE: Superpower and Upstart: Sometimes It Ends Well

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For a superpower, dealing with the fast rise of a rich, brash competitor has always been an iffy thing.
Just ask the British, who a century ago were struggling to come to terms with the erosion of their status as the world's No. 1 empire. It didn't help that they were being upstaged by a former colony that had turned into an upstart sea-power with money, talent, and a knack for mangling a perfectly good language. Eventually they took the hit to the national ego from those Americans and discovered there were advantages to no longer playing the role of the indispensible power.
Or ask Thucydides, the Athenian historian whose tome on the Peloponnesian War has ruined many a college freshman's weekend. The line they had to remember for the test was his conclusion: ''What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta.'' 
So while no official would dare say so publicly as President Hu Jintao bounced from the White House to meetings with business leaders to factories in Chicago last week, his visit, from both sides' points of view, was all about managing China's rise and defusing the fears that it triggers. Both Mr. Hu and President Obama seemed desperate to avoid what Graham Allison of Harvard University has labeled ''the Thucydides Trap'' -- that deadly combination of calculation and emotion that, over the years, can turn healthy rivalry into antagonism or worse.
It was striking, in fact, just how carefully both sides had used the past five months -- in letters and phone calls between the presidents and quiet shuttling between Beijing and Washington -- to diffuse fears that have already cropped up on both sides. The Chinese went to extraordinary lengths to avoid any message like Nikita Khrushchev's ''We will bury you.'' And the Obama White House studiously avoided signaling, ''We will contain you.'' It was as if each was trying to send a message to the other's constituencies that despite all that one reads on the blogosphere, there is nothing inevitable about a clash of systems between China and the United States.
Consider what happened when Mr. Hu, a man who never wanders far from his notes and cue cards, entered the Oval Office on Wednesday morning after a private dinner the night before in the White House residence. He made a presentation to Mr. Obama about China's challenges at home: Low per-capita income, huge disparities between rich and poor, badly polluted cities, a social safety net with holes big enough for 1.3 billion people to slip through. It was a remarkable, if stiff, highlighting of China's limits, not its new powers.
''The message seems to be you don't need to fear us, but you also should know that we can't do everything you want,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Obama's top Asia adviser. ''And by the way, both of those statements are true.''
Mr. Bader concludes: ''The notion that they can challenge our supremacy in our lifetimes is not in the cards. They can challenge us on certain technologies,'' he said, and militarily ''in areas close to their shores -- but not globally, not for a long while.''
By contrast, anyone who turned on American television sets during the most recent Congressional campaigns, or stepped onto the campus of the Central Party School on the outskirts of Beijing over the past year, would get a heavy dose of the alternative view. More than a few American candidates portrayed the Chinese as mocking America's debts and lack of discipline, and as predicting a Britain-like decline. And at a recent conference at the Central Party School, where the country's elite are trained and its rulers have a safe place to bat around ideas, there was an underlying tone that China's time to sit on the sidelines while the United States set the global agenda was over -- even if the Chinese participants could not define what, exactly, their country's mission in the world should become.
Mr. Obama went to this summit with a few quiet advantages. China's muscular moves in the past year -- tangling with Japan over territory, with Google over Internet freedom and with the West over continued exports of missile technology to Iran -- had shaken its neighbors in Asia. Joseph Nye, in a new book called ''The Future of Power'' (Public Affairs, 2011), notes that fear can work to Washington's advantage. ''The rise of Chinese power in Asia is contested both by India and Japan,'' he wrote, ''and that provides a major power advantage to the United States'' by driving them closer to Washington.
In an interview, Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, agreed that in Asia ''the demand for our presence is quite high.'' But he said the effort to draw China's leaders back onto a path of cooperation was an elaborate one, beginning with a quiet trip he took to Beijing in September with Lawrence H. Summers, then Mr. Obama's top economic adviser, during which they laid plans for Mr. Hu's visit this year.
They arrived in Beijing with details of what the summit visit would look like, along with a schedule of choreographed visits by top American officials in advance of it. Those visits culminated in one earlier this month by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. It was critical, because it signaled a resumption of military-to-military talks that the Chinese had halted after Mr. Obama invited the Dalai Lama to the White House and approved an arms package to Taiwan early last year. During that meeting, the Chinese military did some signal-sending of its own, test-flying China's first stealth fighter hours before Mr. Gates met with President Hu.
Back home, Mr. Obama, in letters and phone calls, had been mixing his customary assurances that he has no interest in containing China's rise with a new strategy to persuade Beijing that it should no longer treat the Kim family dynasty in North Korea with kid gloves. The United States, he told the Chinese, has concluded that the North's recent unpredictability, as shown in attacks on South Korean targets, in combination with its development of new missile technology that may be able to hit the West Coast in five years, made for a direct national security threat to the United States.
''That rang their bells,'' said a senior American official who deals with China often. ''It doesn't impress the Chinese much when you say the North Koreans might proliferate their technology. When you say they threaten your homeland, it means you are going to do whatever you have to do.''
Soon Mr. Obama approved military exercises in response to the North Korean shelling of a South Korean island that killed 4 people. Last Tuesday, said another official, who was familiar with the dinner conversation, Mr. Obama made it clear that ''this is the kind of thing we are going to have to do if the North Koreans continue to act this way.'' China may be getting the hint: Mr. Hu approved, at the last minute, language in a joint statement criticizing North Korea for secretly building a uranium enrichment facility.
Will any of this stick? Who knows, but don't expect much revived talk of a ''G-2,'' a fantasy among some, several years ago, that the world would soon be run by joint action between Beijing and Washington. The lesson of the last two years is that the two powers' interests diverge more often than they overlap.
And in both capitals, fear makes for good business: It's a proven way to sell weapons systems.
Meanwhile, Thucydides might be appalled at the nationalistic talk that resounds in both countries. In Chinese newspapers these days, it's hard to avoid accounts of ''American decline.'' Meanwhile, some new members of Congress talk lightly of cutting off Chinese access to the American market -- as if that could happen in today's global economy.
In both languages, that's fear talking.
Correction: January 30, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about American and Chinese efforts to focus on common interests rather than points of contention misstated the number of South Koreans killed when North Korea shelled a South Korean island in November. Four people were killed, not 46. (That was the number killed in the sinking of a South Korean warship last March.)

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH; The Final Health Care Debate

BYLINE: By TOM DASCHLE

 BODY:
G IVEN the deep divide on health care reform in the courts, the Congress and the country, the long-term viability of this historic achievement depends in part on President Obama's ability to reduce the tension and seek common ground. In his State of the Union message, he should say something like this: 
''The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been one of my proudest achievements. Every American's quality of life will improve as a result of its passage. Yet the recent vote in the House to repeal this law is a clear indication of the great differences over the proper role of government in health care.
''In spite of these differences, both parties recognize that the trend of rising costs and declining access to health insurance is unsustainable. The growing burden of our health care bill is straining family and government budgets. We cannot close our federal deficit or remain economically competitive in the world unless we find ways to limit health care costs.
''We are united in our goal to build a high-performance, high-value health care system with lower costs, greater access and better quality. We all understand that we must do a better job in confronting obesity, chronic illness and excessive paperwork in health care. And we share the belief that health care in America will always work best as a partnership between government and the private sector.
''Let us build on what unites us -- by constructing marketplaces for health insurance that offer greater choice at less cost; creating organizations that coordinate care efficiently and bring down the unacceptable rate of medical mistakes; continuing to encourage scientists to find new ways to prevent and cure disease; and empowering cities and counties to develop new solutions to the perplexing problems of health care in America now.
''To that end, I propose that we create a bipartisan commission to examine the best ways to carry out, oversee and, where appropriate, revise the health care reform law. Made up of members of Congress, governors and members of my administration, this commission would provide invaluable guidance and solutions going forward.
''The key to our success will always be to find ways to do it together.''

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH; Create Jobs Not Deficits

BYLINE: By ALICE M. RIVLIN

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA must use his State of the Union speech to make clear his commitment to two economic imperatives: accelerating job growth and controlling the federal deficit. He must persuade Americans that we do not have a choice between the two. We have to do both, and we have to get the timing right. 
That means pushing hard for faster job creation, but also warning about looming federal deficits and their threat to prosperity. It means promising to work actively with Congress to control the rising debt.
Pivoting to deficit reduction is not me-tooing the Republicans. The pivot would have been necessary even if the Democrats had won. Fiscal responsibility is not about smaller government; it is about paying for the government we want.
Drastically cutting spending right now, as some Republicans advocate, would destroy jobs. But continued borrowing at projected rates will lead to a debt crisis, soaring interest rates and a plummeting dollar that could precipitate a deeper recession and destroy even more jobs. The president must get this danger across.
Mr. Obama must also expose the fallacy that rising debt can be controlled by cutting spending alone. True, we must reduce low-priority discretionary spending, both defense and domestic; slow the projected growth of Medicare and Medicaid; and restore Social Security to fiscal soundness. But we also need to care for an aging population and invest in the skills, research and modern infrastructure that power economic growth.
To pay those bills we will need more revenues. The president should rally both parties around serious tax reform that slashes most tax exclusions and deductions, lowers rates for most people and raises more money.
The president must use his speech to urge support for immediate action on a multiyear deficit reduction plan. America's future prosperity and global power are on the line. Only the president can exert the budgetary leadership that will avert economic disaster.

HEADLINE: OBAMA TO PRESS CENTRIST AGENDA IN HIS ADDRESS

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JEFF ZELENY; Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will outline an agenda for ''winning the future'' in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, striking a theme of national unity and renewal as he stresses the need for government spending in key areas and an attack on the budget deficit.
Mr. Obama previewed the themes in a video e-mailed Saturday evening to supporters who had helped in his election campaign. But the video made plain that his speech would be geared more broadly toward the political center, to independent voters and business owners and executives alienated by the expansion of government and the partisan legislative fights of the past two years.
''My No. 1 focus,'' he said, ''is going to be making sure that we are competitive, and we are creating jobs not just now but well into the future.'' 
''These are big challenges that are in front of us,'' Mr. Obama also said in the video, sent to members of Organizing for America, his network of supporters from the 2008 campaign. ''But we're up to it, as long as we come together as a people -- Republicans, Democrats, independents -- as long as we focus on what binds us together as a people, as long as we're willing to find common ground even as we're having some very vigorous debates.''
The annual address on Tuesday, with much of the nation watching, will pull together themes suggested by Mr. Obama over the past two months as he has moved rapidly since the midterm elections to retool his presidency.
In his speeches, policy choices and personnel appointments, Mr. Obama has signaled that after two years in which his response to the economic crisis and his push for passage of the health care bill defined him to many voters as a big-government liberal, he is seeking to recast himself as a more business-friendly, pragmatic progressive.
That means emphasizing job creation, deficit reduction and a willingness to compromise in a new period of divided government. But it also means a willingness to make the case for spending -- or investment, as many in his party would prefer to call it -- in areas like education, transportation and technological innovation when it can be justified as essential to the nation's long-term prosperity.
In that sense, his political rebranding is timed to take advantage of signs that the economy is beginning to pick up steam, allowing Mr. Obama to use his State of the Union address as a pivot point not only for himself but also for the nation, especially in the wake of the Tucson shootings earlier this month.
Without going into detail, he will touch on issues like overhauling the corporate tax code and encouraging exports, and he will defend his health care law. Less clear is whether he will touch on social issues like gun control, which has become more prominent since the Arizona attack, which killed six and gravely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others.
Mr. Obama has sounded similar notes in the past about global competitiveness, investing for the future and transcending partisanship. But on Tuesday he will look down from the dais in the House chamber on scores more Republican lawmakers than he did in previous addresses. Republicans now control the House and have a bigger Senate minority, including newly elected Tea Party adherents dedicated to undoing his agenda.
Some people touched by the Arizona tragedy will be in the gallery with Michelle Obama, according to administration officials; Ms. Giffords's husband, Capt. Mark E. Kelly, a NASA astronaut, was invited but is unlikely to attend.
Advisers say that Mr. Obama's address will be more thematic than heavy on specific policy initiatives.
He will probably call, for example, for overhauling the corporate tax code to allow lower rates by ending some current tax breaks, but without giving details.
Mr. Obama is unlikely, they said, to embrace the recommendations of a bipartisan majority on the debt-reduction commission he created, which proposed slashing projected annual deficits through 2020 with deep cuts in domestic and military spending, changes to Social Security and Medicare, and an overhaul of the individual and corporate tax codes to simplify them and to raise additional revenues.
In general, the theme of deficit reduction will be less prominent in the speech as Mr. Obama emphasizes spending ''investments'' and ''responsible'' budget cutting at a time when Republicans have proposed spending cuts, unspecified, of 20 percent or more. ''We're also going to have to deal with our deficits and our debt in a responsible way,'' Mr. Obama said in the videotaped message. ''And we've got to reform government so that it's leaner and smarter for the 21st century.''
While most midterm presidents use the State of the Union to take credit for their achievements to date, Mr. Obama is constrained by the facts that unemployment remains above 9 percent, that his signature domestic achievement -- the expansion of health insurance coverage -- remains unpopular with nearly half the country, and that prospects for withdrawing many troops from Afghanistan later this year remain uncertain at best.
As he indicated to supporters, Mr. Obama plans to cite reasons for optimism but acknowledge that more needs to be done.
''An economy that was shrinking is now growing again. We've created more than a million jobs over the last year. The stock market is back up, and corporate profits are healthy again,'' he said in the video. ''So we've made progress, but as all of you know, from talking to friends and neighbors, seeing what's happening in your communities, we've still got a lot more work to do.''
The president, advisers said, will offer a vigorous defense of the health care law, which the House last week voted to repeal, by highlighting personal stories of how the new law has already helped ordinary Americans -- by requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions, for example.
In last year's address, Mr. Obama ambitiously set a goal of doubling exports over the next five years, which he said would support two million new jobs. This year, he will probably say that American trade is well on its way to meeting that goal. The reasons for the successes so far, however, have more to do with areas outside the government's control, like China's decision last year to let its currency rise by 3 percent.
Advisers said the president would describe five ''pillars'' for ensuring America's competitiveness and economic growth: innovation, education, infrastructure, deficit reduction and reforming government.
After taking office at the height of an economic crisis and taking over bailouts of the financial and auto industries, both of which have recovered, Mr. Obama will say that while the government no longer needs to intervene, it still should be an essential partner with the private sector through tax breaks and other incentives.
''He's making the transition from an economic security president to an economic growth president,'' said Jim Kessler, co-founder of the centrist organization Third Way, ''and he's moving from the left to the center.''
As in past years, national security issues will not take up a big portion of the address. But the president is likely to cite the successes that the United States military has had in killing and capturing hundreds of Qaeda fighters and their affiliates in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He is also expected to mention the start of a troop withdrawal in July, although American and NATO officials all say that the size and pace of any withdrawal will be based on conditions in the region at the time.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH; Keep All the Top Teachers

BYLINE: By MICHELLE RHEE

 BODY:
THE past year was a sobering one for American educators, as we learned that the United States is falling farther behind in international student rankings. To his credit, President Obama put forward a plan for change that hit the mark, a brilliant stroke that even the ''abolish the Department of Education'' crowd had to admire. Race to the Top, the competitive grant program that harnesses stimulus dollars to drive reform, convinced a surprising number of governors and legislators from both parties to pay the entrance fee by proving they could strengthen their education laws. 
Twelve states improved their evaluation tools so that they can identify effective teachers and make sure they are prized in the classroom. Six states reversed policies that had made it impossible to use student achievement to evaluate classroom teachers. And 27 broadened their public charter school laws, giving parents more choices and reminding everyone that competition in education is a good thing.
Now, with a slow-moving economic recovery and no more federal stimulus dollars to spend, rumors are flying that in some cities 15 percent to 20 percent of teachers may face layoffs. Of course, states and school districts will look for other ways to cut costs. But when they have no other options, most principals are required to lay off the newest teachers rather than the least effective ones.
In his State of the Union address, President Obama should call for a federal law that would require states to help parents ascertain whether their children are getting the high-quality instruction they need to prepare for college and the work force. Parents who find that their children are not being taught by an effective teacher in a successful school should have the right to vote with their feet by choosing a different school.
Now that 12 of the 50 states have laws that allow school administrators to consider teacher effectiveness in making layoff decisions, one in four children in America stand to benefit. President Obama must make an all-out effort to help the other three.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH; Energy for the Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
FACING a public focused on economic revival, a hostile House and the lowest level of voter concern in a long while on human-driven climate change, President Obama could easily punt on energy this Tuesday. But this would actually be the ideal time for him to introduce an energy quest as a keystone 21st-century American imperative. Only by expanding our menu of nonpolluting energy choices can we hope to ameliorate a variety of social, geopolitical, climatic and economic risks facing the country and the world. 
Mr. Obama's first step should not be to announce a predetermined list of policies to transform our energy system, but to use his State of the Union address to commence a yearlong American conversation on the merits and shape of such an effort. Modeled on the president's health care summit meeting last February, this conversation would play out in public televised events attended by the president or his cabinet, along with politicians, experts, scientists and American workers, in places ranging from the White House to coal country, from the grounds of a potential site for a new nuclear reactor to the boiler room of a primary school looking to cut emissions and energy bills.
The result, by the next January address, would be an action plan endorsed by business and by some of the dozens of Nobelists who have been lobbying the White House to renew American investment in relevant areas of science after decades of bipartisan neglect.
Parts of the plan could well be supported by the array of liberals and libertarians seeking an end to market-distorting energy subsidies, perhaps even by some of the conservatives seeing the patriotic merits in a revenue-neutral gasoline tax. And the effort itself would challenge proponents of the status quo, either in Congress or in the public, to demonstrate why acting to fill the global energy gap is a bad idea.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH; Recover Our Spending Power

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. REICH

 BODY:
P RESIDENT OBAMA will have to devote a big part of his State of the Union address to the economy, but which economy?
Corporate profits are up, in part because of reduced costs, especially payrolls, so jobs and wages remain in the doldrums. People with lots of financial assets or who are deemed ''talent'' by large companies are enjoying a solid recovery, but most Americans continue to struggle. In order for the public to understand what must be done, Mr. Obama has to be clear about what has happened and why. 
The Great Recession accelerated trends that started three decades ago: outsourcing abroad, automating work, converting full-time employees to temps and contractors, undermining unions and getting wage and benefit concessions from remaining workers.
Mr. Obama should point out that the United States economy is now more than twice the size it was in 1980, but the real median wage has barely budged; that in the late 1970s, the richest 1 percent of Americans got about 9 percent of total income, while by the start of the Great Recession the richest received more than 23 percent; that wealth is now even more concentrated. And the economy is bogged down because most Americans, unable to borrow as before, no longer have the purchasing power to get it moving again.
The president should make it clear that corporations aren't to blame; they're meant to make profits. Nor is it the fault of the rich who have played by the rules. But he should stress that a future with no jobs or lousy jobs for most Americans is not sustainable -- not even for American corporations, whose long-term profitability depends on broad-based domestic demand.
The solution is to give average Americans a better economic deal. For starters, he should propose to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (essentially, a wage subsidy) all the way up through the middle class. And he should suggest making the tax system more progressive: The rate on the $50,000 to $90,000 income bracket should be cut to 10 percent; on the $90,000 to $150,000 bracket, to 20 percent; on the $150,000 to $250,000 bracket, to 30 percent. Make up the revenue by increasing taxes on the $250,000 to $500,000 bracket, to 40 percent; from $500,000 to $5 million, to 50 percent; and anything over $5 million, to 60 percent. Tax capital gains the same as ordinary income.
In addition, he should call for strengthening unions by increasing penalties on employers who illegally deter them. And he should make college affordable by allowing federal loans to be repaid as 10 percent of earnings for the first 10 years of full-time employment.
Most important, he should make it clear these measures would be good for everyone. Rich Americans would do better with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy than with a large share of one stuck in a deep hole.

HEADLINE: The One-Eyed Man Is King

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
A month before John Wayne won the 1969 Best Actor Oscar for ''True Grit,'' Richard Nixon wrote him a ''Dear Duke'' fan letter from the Oval Office: ''I saw it in the W.H. with my family and for once we agree with the critics -- you were great!'' Some four decades later, his rave was echoed by another Republican warrior, this time in praise of the ''True Grit'' remake with Jeff Bridges in the role of the old, fat, hard-drinking, half-blind 19th-century United States marshal Rooster Cogburn. Shortly after New Year's, Liz Cheney told The Times that her parents saw ''True Grit'' at the Teton Theater in Jackson, Wyo., and gave it ''two thumbs up.''
The double-barreled success of ''True Grit,'' then and now, spreads well beyond those conservative gunslingers. In our current winter of high domestic anxiety, as in the politically tumultuous American summer of 1969, it is a hit with the national mass audience and elite critics alike. The new version is doing as well in New York and Los Angeles as in red Cheneyland. 
That ''True Grit'' still works is first a testament to the beauty of the remake, as directed by the Coen brothers, and to the enduring power of both films' source, a 1968 novel by Charles Portis that refracted a Western yarn through a scintillating and original comic voice. But the latest ''True Grit'' juggernaut also has something to say about Americans yearning at a trying juncture in our history -- much as it did the first time around.
The original film opened at Radio City Music Hall on July 3, 1969, the same day that antiwar protestors incited a melee at the adjoining Rockefeller Center, shutting down Fifth Avenue. In that climate, the movie's success was hardly foreordained. The previous year, ''The Green Berets,'' Wayne's jingoistic Vietnam potboiler, had divided audiences, been ridiculed by the press and shunned by the Oscars. The Western, like the war movie, was seen as a dying genre, usurped by darker and ever more violent takes on frontier mythology like the 1967 ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''The Wild Bunch,'' which opened just a week before ''True Grit.'' July of '69 would also bring ''Easy Rider,'' the iconic '60s dope-and-biker movie in which Dennis Hopper, who played a villain in ''True Grit,'' would reinvent himself as an era's archetypal cultural antihero. The ''Easy Rider'' ad copy ran: ''A man went looking for America. And couldn't find it anywhere.''
Such was the dyspeptic mood of a nation deep into a fruitless war and a year after a summer of assassinations and riots. Yet ''True Grit'' was warmly received, including by the Times critic, Vincent Canby, who put it in a year-end list of bests dominated by such antiestablishment fare as ''The Wild Bunch,'' ''Easy Rider,'' ''Midnight Cowboy'' (that year's Best Picture Oscar winner) and the ultimate anti-Western, Andy Warhol's sexually transgressive ''Lonesome Cowboys.'' Canby described ''True Grit'' as ''a classic frontier fable that manages to be most entertaining even when it's being most reactionary.''
He was right. Its story and themes could hardly have been more retro. A 14-year-old girl from Yell County, Ark., named Mattie Ross hires Rooster to help track down an outlaw who murdered both her father and a Texas state senator before fleeing into Chocktaw territory. Though Mattie is a stickler for the law, she's not averse to frontier justice if that's required to avenge her dad. But to the grizzled old Rooster's dismay, the girl insists on joining him on the trail to make sure the job gets done.
Like classic Hollywood Westerns before it, ''True Grit'' in all its iterations has an elegiac lilt. Uncivilized hired guns like Rooster may have helped tame the West and dispatched bad guys, but they were also capable of lawlessness and atrocities. As a young Confederate soldier, Rooster had joined in the 1863 Lawrence, Kan., massacre. Ultimately, law, religion and domestic institutions like marriage -- which Rooster failed at -- had to prevail if America was to grow up. The Matties had to outlive the Roosters. And so they did. For a weary mainstream 1969 audience, and not just a reactionary one, the restoration of order in ''True Grit,'' inevitably to be followed by Rooster's ride off into the sunset, was a heartening two-hour escape from the near-civil-war raging beyond the theater's walls.
In 2010, expectations for the new ''True Grit'' may have been lower than they were for the first. The Western has once again been written off as an endangered species. The Coens' critically admired filmmaking has never generated blockbuster box office. An added indignity was the complete shutout of ''True Grit'' from Golden Globe nominations -- a measure of a movie's advance buzz, if nothing else.
Nonetheless, it is already the biggest draw of any Coen brothers film -- poised to at least double the business of ''No Country for Old Men,'' their biggest previous hit. Revealingly, I think, it is attracting an even larger audience than ''The Social Network,'' a movie of equal quality with reviews to match and more timely cultural cachet. It turns out that ''True Grit'' is as much an escape for Americans now as it was in the Vietnam era.
Our age is hardly identical to that one, whatever the resonances between the Afghanistan and Vietnam wars, and whatever our own bouts of domestic violence. The new ''True Grit'' took off before the Tucson cataclysm in any event, and the movie's broad appeal, like the demographics of its audience, transcends our running right-left debate. What is most stirring about ''True Grit'' today -- besides the primal father-daughter relationship that blossoms between Rooster and Mattie -- is its unalloyed faith in values antithetical to those of the 21st century America so deftly skewered, as it happens, in ''The Social Network.''
At its core, the new ''True Grit'' is often surprisingly similar to the first, despite the clashing sensibilities of their directors (Henry Hathaway, a studio utility man, did the original) and the casting of an age-appropriate Mattie (Hailee Steinfeld) in lieu of the 21-year-old Kim Darby of 1969. But what leaps out this time, to the point of seeming fresh, is the fierce loyalty of the principal characters to each other (the third being a vain Texas Ranger, played by Matt Damon) and their clear-cut sense of morality and justice, even when the justice is rough. More than the first ''True Grit,'' the new one emphasizes Mattie's precocious, almost obsessive preoccupation with the law. She is forever citing law-book principles, invoking lawyers and affidavits, and threatening to go to court. ''You must pay for everything in this world one way or another,'' says Mattie. ''There is nothing free except the grace of God.''
That kind of legal and moral cost-accounting seems as distant as a tintype now. The new ''True Grit'' lands in an America that's still not recovered from a crash where many of the reckless perpetrators of economic mayhem deflected any accountability and merely moved on to the next bubble, gamble or ethically dubious backroom deal. When Americans think of the law these days, they often think of a system that can easily be gamed by the rich and the powerful, starting with those who pillaged Lehman Brothers, A.I.G. and Citigroup and left taxpayers, shareholders and pensioners in the dust. A virtuous soul like Mattie would be crushed in a contemporary gold rush even if (or especially if) she fought back with the kind of civil action so prized by the 19th-century Mattie.
Talk about Two Americas. Look at ''The Social Network'' again after seeing ''True Grit,'' and you'll see two different civilizations, as far removed from each other in ethos as Silicon Valley and Monument Valley. While ''Social Network'' fictionalizes Mark Zuckerberg, it mines the truth of an era -- from the ability of the powerful and privileged to manipulate the system to the collapse of loyalty as a prized American virtue at the top of that economic pyramid.
In contrast to Mattie's dictum, no one has to pay for any transgression in the world it depicts. Zuckerberg's antagonists, Harvard classmates who accuse him of intellectual theft, and his allies, exemplified by a predatory venture capitalist, sometimes seem more entitled and ruthless than he is. The blackest joke in Aaron Sorkin's priceless script is that Lawrence Summers, a Harvard president who would later moonlight as a hedge fund consultant, might intervene to arbitrate any ethical conflicts. You almost wish Rooster were around to get the job done.
''The Social Network'' is nothing if not the true sequel to ''Wall Street.'' The director, David Fincher (no less brilliant than the Coens), makes the atmosphere almost as murky and poisonous as that of his serial killer movies, ''Seven'' and ''Zodiac.'' In ''Social Network,'' the landscape is Cambridge, Mass., but we might as well be in the pre-civilized Wild West. Instead of thieves bearing guns, we have thieves bearing depositions. Instead of actual assassinations, we have character assassinations by blog post. In place of an honorable social code, we have a social network presided over by a post-adolescent billionaire whose business card reads ''I'm CEO ... Bitch!''
This hits too close to home. No one should have been surprised that those looking for another America once again have been finding it in ''True Grit.''

HEADLINE: Chasing the China Bandwagon

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
CHINESE tanks and missiles rolled past the reviewing stand in Tiananmen Square, where I sat as a member of the foreign press corps in early October 1984. It was the annual National Day parade, and a phalanx of soldiers marched smartly by. So far, nothing out of the ordinary.
Then came a group of apple-cheeked students, waving and brandishing a sign with enormous Chinese characters: ''Hello, Xiaoping,'' it said, in a startlingly warm and casual salute to Deng Xiaoping, then China's paramount leader. Years before the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in that very square, Deng was being celebrated for his advocacy of a new path of market reform, openness to the outside world and, eventually, prosperity. It was an unorthodox approach, exemplified by the bold, decidedly un-Maoist slogan, ''Let some people get rich first.'' 
After following Deng's economic path for decades, China has been watching its prosperity rise. And foreign politicians, corporate executives and investors have taken notice. Last week, in meetings with political and business leaders during his American visit, Hu Jintao, China's current president, was treated with the respect due a man who represents the second-largest economy on the planet.
In a joint news conference in Washington, for example, President Obama chided him about human rights issues, but did so gently, moving rapidly to a much happier subject: business. ''We want to sell you all kinds of stuff,'' Mr. Obama said to Mr. Hu. ''We want to sell you planes. We want to sell you cars. We want to sell you software.''
And Mr. Hu indicated that he was happy to oblige.
In Washington and in Chicago, the Chinese president and his entourage announced a series of deals that, American officials said, amounted to $45 billion worth of American exports to China. Included in that total was $19 billion for 200 Boeing airplanes, plus railway and energy contracts for General Electric, and a joint venture between Honeywell and Haier, the giant Chinese appliance maker.
America's current $100 billion in annual exports to China ''supports more than half a million American jobs,'' Mr. Obama said, noting that those exports are growing at nearly double the rate of exports to the rest of the world.
Mr. Hu did not go to New York, but his American visit was duly noted on Wall Street and its environs. At Goldman Sachs's headquarters on West Street on Thursday, Jim O'Neill, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said he believed that the world's economic growth rate was rising sharply.
''At the core of all of this is the behemoth known as China,'' he said, adding that it must be part of every intelligent investor's long-term strategy.
Mr. O'Neill is perhaps best known as the economist who nearly a decade ago coined the acronym BRIC -- for Brazil, Russia, India and China -- developing economies that, he said, were big enough and growing rapidly enough that no investor could afford to neglect them. The giant in that group is still China, he said, whose transformation has been so thorough that ''most people, and not just investors, don't realize the sheer dimension of its rapidly growing importance in the world economy.''
Given its current size and growth rate -- a sizzling 10.2 percent in 2010 -- China's economy is likely to add roughly $1 trillion in G.D.P. in 2011, he said. To put that into perspective, he said it is ''sort of like creating half of a United Kingdom.'' Over the last decade, he said, China's economy ''has created three United Kingdoms, and that's really extraordinary.''
What's more, China still has a long way to go. In one 2009 World Bank ranking of per capita income, China fit snugly between Tunisia and Turkmenistan. In some respects, it remains at a relatively early stage of economic development.
Many unresolved issues plague the Sino-American relationship, of course -- including disputes over human rights, intellectual property rights, access to domestic markets, the proper valuation of the renminbi, an imbalance in trade and capital flows, and a host of geopolitical problems. The economic flashpoints alone could easily flare into open conflict.
The United States Business and Industry Council, for example, which represents family-owned domestic manufacturing businesses, argues that President Obama should stop negotiating with China and start imposing taxes and tariffs. ''We need to contain China's economic strength and to reduce China's military strength,'' said Alan Tonelson, research fellow at the council.
Mr. O'Neill, by contrast, points to the rich earnings that multinational companies like I.B.M. are garnering from sharply rising exports to China. ''The notion that China grows at everybody else's expense is at least three years out of date,'' he said. China's rapid growth, he said, gives the United States economic recovery a very good chance of being more robust than expected over the next few years.
FOR investors, the short-term implications of the China growth story are not entirely straightforward. The Chinese stock market has had a bumpy year, and it may continue to be buffeted by the Chinese central bank's tighter monetary policy, which is aimed at reining in inflation. It's quite possible that the stock market in a slower-growing economy like Japan's will be more profitable for investors over the next year, according to a recent analysis by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.
In any case, Mr. O'Neill said, investors can benefit from China's growth in multiple ways, by assessing valuations of specific stocks and assets, for example, and perhaps by betting on multinationals with significant China exposure. For a while to come, he said, the economic tide in China will rise, and investors should take note: some will be getting rich first.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Mexico Trucker Dispute Takes a Step Forward

BYLINE: By JULIAN AGUILAR. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org

 BODY:
A proposal by the Obama administration that would grant Mexican truckers greater access to Texas roadways -- and far beyond -- would be a boon to businesses in the state, supporters say. But unions, the Teamsters in particular, say the plan would cost American jobs.
Three of the top five ports for trade between the United States and Mexico are Laredo, El Paso and Houston. Through the first 10 months of 2010, more than $146 billion in trade between the United States and Mexico moved through the Port of Laredo, more than $57 billion through El Paso and $17.5 billion through Houston, ranking the ports No. 1, No. 2 and No. 5, respectively, in terms of trade with Mexico. Over all, the United States traded about $324 billion with Mexico during the same period.
A provision in the original 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement would have allowed long-haul truckers from Mexico to move about the United States without mileage restrictions, but it was never put into effect. Today, tractor-trailers entering the United States from Mexico (and vice versa) are limited to traveling within a 20-mile to 25-mile radius of ports of entry. There, Mexican truckers must drop their goods, which are then picked up by American truckers to be transported to their final destinations. 
This month, the Obama administration issued what it called a ''concept document'' addressing many of the concerns that have blocked full carrying out of the provision.
In 2009, Congress and the administration ended a two-year-old long-haul pilot program. Labor unions, especially the Teamsters, and other critics have long opposed allowing Mexican truckers access to American roads out of concern that trucking jobs in the United States would be lost and roadways made unsafe because of differences in safety standards between the two countries. (A status report published by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in 2009 stated that American carriers had a higher out-of-service rate than other participants in the program.)
After the pilot program ended, Mexico said the United States was in violation of Nafta and put tariffs on $2.4 billion worth of American goods -- including agricultural products like onions and peanuts -- in retaliation.
The United States Department of Transportation's preliminary proposal includes a requirement that participating vehicles be equipped with electronic recording devices to allow monitoring of the drivers' hours of service and compliance with American trucking laws. Drivers will also have their combined American and Mexican driving records checked to ensure that they have no history of unsafe driving that would disqualify them under United States standards.
''The cross-border trucking program boosts trade opportunities for the U.S. and creates jobs here in Texas. Mexican trucks must be held to stringent safety requirements -- just like any carrier on U.S. highways,'' Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said in a statement after the Transportation Department issued its proposal. ''It is time to take the brakes off this program that represents a significant trade opportunity for the U.S. and a new way to create jobs and drive revenue for my home state of Texas.''
Other Texas politicians have clamored to lift the ban on Mexican trucks, saying it damages the state's economic interests.
''U.S. farmers should not have to pay the price for broken diplomatic relationships,'' Todd Staples, the state's agriculture commissioner, wrote to President Obama when the pilot program ended. Mr. Staples estimated that before the tariffs were imposed, Mexico was the top purchaser of Texas agricultural products, buying an estimated $3.1 billion in goods in 2008.
Last week, Mr. Staples restated his support for beginning negotiations to restart the program.
''Texas agriculture should not be penalized because Congress broke a 17-year-old agreement,'' he said. ''I hope our trade negotiators cut a fair deal soon so Texas agriculture can continue to provide a safe, affordable food supply and good jobs for our citizens.''
Mexican officials have said the tariffs would be lifted if a long-haul trucking agreement were reached. Negotiations are expected to take several months.
An official with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said Nafta provisions required reciprocity across the border, meaning that American trucks would be able to travel farther into Mexico under the plan. But union leaders in Texas and elsewhere still say the proposal would take away jobs only from Americans.
''If the U.S. doesn't have the capacity to seal our borders now, why should we have confidence that a long-haul trucking program will maintain safety at our borders, on our roads and in the interior of our nation?'' said Ed Sills, a spokesman for the Texas A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''This cheap-labor program comes at too high a risk and at too large a cost to middle-class American workers who work long, hard hours to help maintain a safe commerce system in our nation.''
The Texas Department of Public Safety has not weighed in on the trucking program, but it dismissed the notion that it would lead to an increase in human, drug, illicit cash or weapons smuggling.
''The Texas D.P.S. has significantly enhanced commercial vehicle enforcement activity along the U.S.-Mexico border since 2003-4 through border staffing grants from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in anticipation of the full implementation of Nafta at some future date,'' said Tela Mange, a spokeswoman for the public safety department. ''All commercial vehicles, including commercial vehicles operated by Mexican-based carriers, entering the U.S. through commercial border crossings from Mexico are already subject to various types of inspections by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, as well as the Texas D.P.S.''
Under the Transportation Department proposal, which the administration emphasizes is only a starting point for negotiations, Mexican carriers applying to the program would have their information vetted by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice. And for ''an agreed-upon period of time,'' Mexican drivers and vehicles would be inspected by American officials every time a tractor-trailer entered the United States.
Ms. Mange said the public safety department was not convinced that allowing the long-haul program would cause a meaningful change in the amount of traffic on Texas highways. That is because the goods coming across the border are currently transported by trucks, though ones driven by Americans, to destinations throughout the United States and Canada.
''The net volume of commercial traffic entering the U.S. is not expected to increase significantly, if at all,'' she said. ''In many cases, cross-border operations will simply be replaced with some long-haul operations.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Jan. 23 about a proposal by the Obama administration that would grant Mexican truckers greater access to Texas roadways misstated the amount of tariffs that Mexico imposed on American products after the end of a two-year long-haul pilot program, which gave Mexican truckers access to American roads. Mexico put tariffs on $2.4 billion worth of American goods, not more than $2 billion in tariffs on American products.

HEADLINE: A New Chance for Mr. Obama

 BODY:
President Obama unveiled a promising new theme on Friday when he toured a factory in Schenectady, N.Y., and began talking about the desperate need to foster competitiveness and innovation in the pursuit of American jobs. The real test of his commitment to that cause in the second half of his term will come on Tuesday in his State of the Union address. He will have to make his case in the face of a newly strengthened and shrill Republican Party, determined to dismantle government's most fundamental role in fighting the recession.
A stunning glimpse of that recalcitrance was revealed last week when a group representing two-thirds of House Republicans proposed cutting $2.5 trillion from discretionary federal spending over the next decade, in ways that would only make joblessness far worse. For the first time, party lawmakers showed just where their radical cuts would be, and it was immediately clear that they would throw thousands of federal, state and private employees out of work. 
That kind of extremism gives the president a renewed opportunity to delineate forcefully the contrast with his own plans, and the largely unheralded accomplishments of his first two years.
The top of his agenda should be explaining to the public why job creation and growth are more important than short-term spending cuts, and why those two paths are incompatible. Now is the time for a full-throated statement about the need for federal investment in infrastructure, education and state aid. He should capitalize on his new team of business-oriented advisers to explain which industries he believes will provide the jobs, and show what he is prepared to do to foster that growth.
Clearly, though, a plan for long-term deficit reduction is vital to economic security. Mr. Obama has a chance to make clear how he plans to build in the years to come on cuts he has already proposed. But he cannot be drawn into the Republican game of choosing from a menu of ill-advised quick fixes. This is not an area where the difference can be split, or a few pre-emptive reductions can palliate the hunger on the right.
There is no point in even bringing up Social Security outside of a long-term and comprehensive budget debate. A moment for negotiation on the near-term budget will arrive, but it does not have to begin with sacrificial offerings from the podium. Mr. Obama is expected to propose a restructured tax code, but that important goal can only be reached in the context of raising more revenue to close chronic deficits.
The president may be able to find some rare common ground with Republicans on reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (now known as No Child Left Behind). Any new act will undoubtedly provide more flexibility for states and local districts to meet federal standards, but must maintain its commitment to pursuing equity for minority schools, along with a tough measurement system for teachers and schools.
We hope Mr. Obama dares to offer solutions on immigration, standing on the side of assimilation and earned citizenship. On the environment, he must stand firm against a coming Republican attack on the Clean Air Act and its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants like smog, soot and mercury.
Overseas, the speech should explain why Afghanistan, alarmingly unstable after a decade of war, is important to American security and how he intends to reach a minimally acceptable outcome. He also needs to address his plans for forging better cooperation with Pakistan, where Qaeda and Taliban leaders are based.
Beyond the usual laundry list, however, the president will have to balance inspiration -- the kind Americans saw in abundance in his Tucson remarks -- with feisty confidence in his fundamental principles. The midterm election showed how strongly voters hungered for lost leadership on the economy. Mr. Obama has it within him to stand up to the forces of governmental destruction and begin restoring confidence in his leadership.

HEADLINE: China Grooms a New Leader, Politically Deft, if Little Known

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and JONATHAN ANSFIELD; Li Bibo and Benjamin Haas contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- President Hu Jintao of Chinareturned home this weekend after a trip intended to repair relations with the United States. But the next time the White House marches out the honor guard and polishes the crystal for a Chinese leader, it is unlikely to be for Mr. Hu.
Following a secretive succession plan sketched out years ago, Mr. Hu has already begun preparing for his departure from power, passing the baton to his presumed successor, a former provincial leader named Xi Jinping, now China's vice president. While Mr. Xi is expected to formally take the reins next year in China, the world's second-largest economy and fastest-modernizing military power, he remains a cipher to most people, even in China.
But an extended look at Mr. Xi's past, taken from wide-ranging interviews and official Chinese publications, shows that his rise has been built on a combination of political acumen, family connections and ideological dexterity. Like the country he will run, he has nimbly maintained the primacy of the Communist Party, while making economic growth the party's main business. 
There is little in his record to suggest that he intends to steer China in a sharply different direction. But some political observers also say that he may have broader support within the party than Mr. Hu, which could give him more leeway to experiment with new ideas. At the same time, there is uncertainty about how he may wield authority in a system where power has grown increasingly diffuse. Mr. Xi also has deeper military ties than his two predecessors, Mr. Hu and Jiang Zemin, had when they took the helm.
For much of his career, Mr. Xi, 57, presided over booming areas on the east coast that have been at the forefront of China's experimentation with market authoritarianism, which has included attracting foreign investment, putting party cells in private companies and expanding government support for model entrepreneurs. This has given Mr. Xi the kind of political and economic experience that Mr. Hu lacked when he ascended to the top leadership position.
He is less of a dour mandarin than Mr. Hu is. The tall, stocky Mr. Xi is a so-called princeling -- a descendant of a member of the revolutionary party elite -- and his second marriage is to a celebrity folk singer and army major general, Peng Liyuan.
Unlike the robotic Mr. Hu, Mr. Xi has dropped memorable barbs against the West into a couple of recent speeches: he once warned critics of China's rise to ''stop pointing fingers at us.'' But he has enrolled his daughter in Harvard, under a pseudonym.
The Climb Up the Ladder
Mr. Xi (his full name is pronounced Shee Jin-ping) climbed the ladder by building support among top party officials, particularly those in Mr. Jiang's clique, all while cultivating an image of humility and self-reliance despite his prominent family ties, say officials and other party members who have known him.
His subtle and pragmatic style was seen in the way he handled a landmark power project teetering on the edge of failure in 2002, when he was governor of Fujian, a coastal province. The American company Bechtel and other foreign investors had poured in nearly $700 million. But the investors became mired in a dispute with planning officials.
After ducking foreign executives' repeated requests for a meeting, Mr. Xi agreed to chat one night in the governor's compound with an American business consultant on the project whose father had befriended Mr. Xi's father in the 1940s.
Mr. Xi explained that he could not interfere in a dispute involving other powerful officials. But he showed that he knew the project intimately and supported it, promising to meet the investors ''after the two sides have reached an agreement.'' That spurred a compromise that allowed the power plant to begin operating.
''I thought, 'This person is a brilliant politician,' '' said the consultant, Sidney Rittenberg Jr.
Mr. Xi's political skills paid their greatest dividend last October, when he was appointed vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, a move that means he will almost certainly succeed Mr. Hu as party secretary in late 2012 and as president in 2013. Mr. Hu, the commission's chairman, could retain his military post for another few years.
Over the years, Mr. Xi built his appeal on ''the way he carried himself in political affairs,'' said Zhang Xiaojin, a political scientist at Tsinghua University.
''On economic reforms and development, he proved rather effective,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''On political reforms, he didn't take any risks that would catch flak.''
Mr. Xi also emerged as a convenient accommodation to two competing wings of the party: those loyal to Mr. Hu and those allied with Mr. Jiang, who in China's collective leadership had an important role in naming Mr. Hu's successor.
Mr. Xi's elite lineage and career along the prosperous coast have aligned him more closely with Mr. Jiang. But like Mr. Hu, Mr. Xi also spent formative years in the provincial hinterlands. Mr. Hu was once close to Mr. Xi's father, a top Communist leader during the Chinese civil war.
The father, Xi Zhongxun, was one of the more liberal party leaders and was purged several times under Mao. He was a mastermind in the early 1980s of China's first special economic zone in Shenzhen. Behind closed party doors, he supported the liberal-leaning leader Hu Yaobang, who was dismissed in 1987, and condemned the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in 1989.
The younger Mr. Xi grew up in Beijing and went to the premier military-run high school. But he had to fend for himself during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. At age 15, he was sent to labor among peasants in the yellow hills of Shaanxi Province. He stayed seven years in the village of Liangjiahe, which eventually named him party secretary.
Mr. Xi came to hate ideological struggles. In an essay published in 2003, he wrote, ''Much of my pragmatic thinking took root back then, and still exerts a constant influence on me.''
Even at that early age, his conciliatory leadership style was evident. ''When people had a conflict with each other, they would go to him, and he'd say, 'Come back in two days,' '' said Lu Nengzhong, 80, the patriarch of a cave home where Mr. Xi lived for three years. ''By then, the problem had solved itself.''
Mr. Xi later relied on family ties to enter Tsinghua University in Beijing. He began his political career as an aide to Geng Biao, a powerful military bureaucrat allied with Mr. Xi's father.
By the early 1980s, party elders had identified Mr. Xi as one of a brood of prospective future leaders. His first provincial post was in Hebei, where he promoted local tourism and rural enterprise, but ran up against the conservative provincial leader. The party then sent him to Fujian Province, across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan. Mr. Xi bounced through three cities over 17 years.
There, he courted Taiwanese investors. For 14 years, he also supervised the local military command. His exposure to the Taiwan territorial issue ''may shade his views on cross-strait relations in the direction of flexibility,'' said Alice L. Miller, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Hoover Institution.
Some ambitious investments drew national scrutiny while Mr. Xi governed Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian. City leaders signed a contract with Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong real estate tycoon, to redevelop the old city quarter, but that fizzled after a public outcry. A new international airport grossly overshot its budget.
Nor was Mr. Xi untainted by corruption scandals. One party investigation into bribe-taking in Ningde and Fuzhou, publicized years after he left Fujian, toppled two former city leaders whom Mr. Xi had promoted.
Gaining Beijing's Notice
But back in Beijing, top leaders were watching out for Mr. Xi. He actually finished last when party delegates voted for the 344 members and alternates of the Party Central Committee in 1997 because of general hostility toward princelings. But Mr. Xi slipped in as an alternate anyway. Mr. Jiang, the party leader, and his power broker, Zeng Qinghong, helped back Mr. Xi's continued rise, said Cheng Li, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
His next assignment, as provincial party boss up the coast in Zhejiang, was cushier. There, too, the economy was humming. Mr. Xi hewed to Beijing's initiatives to embrace private entrepreneurs. He also hitched his star to homegrown private start-ups that have since gone global.
Soon after his arrival in late 2002, he visited Geely, then the province's sole carmaker. The firm's indefatigable founder, Li Shufu, had just begun to receive some financing from state banks. ''If we don't give additional strong support to companies like Geely, then whom are we going to support?'' Mr. Xi remarked.
Last year, Geely bought the carmaker Volvo from the Ford Motor Company.
Mr. Xi bestowed early recognition, too, on Ma Yun, founder of Alibaba, now an e-commerce giant and Yahoo's partner in China. After he left Zhejiang in 2007 to become the top official in Shanghai, Mr. Xi extended an invitation to Mr. Ma: ''Can you come to Shanghai and help us develop?''
At the time, party authorities were pushing private companies to form party cells, part of Mr. Jiang's central vision to bring companies and the party closer. Officials under Mr. Xi parceled out vanity posts to entrepreneurs, granting some the coveted title of local legislative delegate. Mr. Xi also cautiously supported small-scale political reforms in Zhejiang, where democratic experiments were percolating at the grass roots.
When cadres in one village in Wuyi County allowed villagers to elect three-person committees to supervise their leaders, Mr. Xi took notice. He issued pivotal directives that helped extend the obscure pilot program, said Xiang Hanwu, a county official. The system won praise from the Central Party School, where rising cadres are trained. In August, Zhejiang approved a provincewide rollout, though with additional party controls.
Mr. Xi also got an important career boost from Zhejiang's push to forge business ties with poorer provinces inland. He led groups of wealthy Zhejiang businessmen who met with officials in western provinces, winning points with other provincial leaders.
Seizing the Throne
For years before a party congress in October 2007, Mr. Xi was not deemed the front-runner to succeed Hu Jintao as party leader. The favorite was Li Keqiang, a protege of Mr. Hu. But Mr. Xi's political capital surged in March 2007 when he was handed the job of party boss in Shanghai after a pension fund scandal had toppled the previous leader.
Shanghai was the power base of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Zeng. During his short seven-month stint there, before he joined the elite Politburo Standing Committee in Beijing, Mr. Xi helped ease the aura of scandal on their turf, while stressing Beijing's prescriptions for the kind of measured growth favored by Mr. Hu.
It was a balancing act of a kind that had served him well for decades.
Since joining the inner sanctum in Beijing, Mr. Xi has reinforced his longstanding posture as a team player. As president of the Central Party School, Mr. Xi recently made a priority of teaching political morality based on Marxist-Leninist and Maoist ideals, a resurgent trend in the bureaucracy.
His views of the West remain difficult to divine. He once told the American ambassador to China over dinner that he enjoyed Hollywood films about World War II because of the American sense of good and evil, according to diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks. He took a swipe at Zhang Yimou, the renowned Chinese director, saying some Chinese filmmakers neglect values they should promote.
But on a visit to Mexico in 2009, when he was defending China's record in the global financial crisis before an audience of overseas Chinese, he suggested that he was impatient with foreigners wary of China's new power in the world.
''Some foreigners with full bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger-pointing at us,'' he said. ''First, China does not export revolution; second, it does not export famine and poverty; and third, it does not mess around with you. So what else is there to say?''

HEADLINE: Parties Draw Battle Lines On Spending

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans, seeking to recapture the debate over the country's economic recovery in advance of President Obama's State of the Union address, warned Sunday that they would oppose any new spending initiatives and press ahead with their plans for budget cuts in every realm of government, including the military.
In a series of carefully choreographed appearances on Sunday morning talk shows here, Republicans sought to draw the battle lines for the Tuesday night speech over government spending. With Mr. Obama planning to call for ''investments'' of tax dollars in specific areas like education, infrastructure and technology, Republicans insisted that ''investment'' was just another name for spending that the nation can ill afford.
''With all due respect to our Democratic friends, any time they want to spend, they call it investment, so I think you will hear the president talk about investing a lot Tuesday night,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''This is not a time to be looking at pumping up government spending in very many areas.'' 
Mr. McConnell's House counterpart, Representative Eric Cantor, said that his party would demand ''deep spending cuts'' in all areas and that the military, an area of the budget that Republicans ordinarily view as sacrosanct, would not be exempt. ''Every dollar should be on the table,'' Mr. Cantor said in an appearance on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC.
The appearances laid the groundwork for a fierce clash between the Republicans and Mr. Obama over spending, the size and scope of government and the federal deficit; that fight could have profound effects on the path the nation takes as it emerges from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. It occurs against the backdrop of the early days of the 2012 presidential race, as Mr. Obama prepares for his re-election campaign and Republicans position themselves to pick a candidate to challenge him.
Mr. Obama will use the State of the Union address to argue that government should be a tool for creating jobs and strengthening a fragile recovery through spending in areas like high-speed rail, scientific research, clean energy programs and college grants -- a message that appeals to Democratic voters. In effect, Mr. Obama is trying to wall off those areas from spending cuts and is daring Republicans to defy him.
Republicans are insisting that spending is not the answer; with the federal deficit already estimated at $1.3 trillion and their base still up in arms over Mr. Obama's health care bill, which conservatives regard as the ultimate exercise in big government, they are demanding that Washington make sweeping and immediate spending cuts.
''Our Congress is going to be a cut-and-grow Congress,'' Mr. Cantor said.
The public itself seems split, or perhaps confused. Americans overwhelmingly say that in general, they prefer cutting government spending to paying higher taxes, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll published last week. Yet their preference for spending cuts, even in programs that benefit them, dissolves when they are presented with specific options related to Medicare and Social Security, the programs that directly touch millions of lives and are the biggest drivers of the long-term deficit.
The spending versus cutting debate is, in effect, a reprise of the fight Mr. Obama has been having with Republicans since the outset of his presidency. But this one occurs in a very different political context, with a divided Congress and a president who is trying to reposition himself as a centrist after the self-described ''shellacking'' his party took in the midterm elections.
Now, two months after Republicans won back control of the House and increased their numbers in the Senate, vowing to make spending cuts a top priority, Mr. Obama is himself doing better in the eyes of the public. Americans are showing the first hints of optimism about the recovery and are giving the president credit for working in a bipartisan way during the lame-duck session of Congress -- sentiments that are reflected in his job approval ratings, which are inching upward.
Each side is trying to gain the upper hand in the spending debate. Where Republicans campaigned on a theme of deep reductions in federal spending, calling for $100 billion in cuts this fiscal year alone, Mr. Obama is trying to sell the public a more nuanced, gradual approach.
In speeches over the past several months, and especially over the last week, Mr. Obama has outlined an approach that emphasizes growth and competition and a slow easing of government intervention in the economy -- as opposed to the quick pullback Republicans want.
''To borrow an analogy, cutting the deficit by cutting investments in areas like education, areas like innovation -- that's like trying to reduce the weight of an overloaded aircraft by removing its engine,'' Mr. Obama said in a December speech at a community college in Winston-Salem, N.C. ''It's not a good idea.''
The debate will take center stage on Tuesday in the House, when Republicans are expected to take up a resolution calling for sharp and immediate cuts in a raft of domestic programs. The timing, just hours before Mr. Obama's State of the Union address, is no coincidence.
Republicans are themselves divided over how much of the budget they can realistically slash. The leadership has already acknowledged that it would be difficult if not impossible to fulfill the $100 billion campaign pledge, and instead has suggested that cuts prorated for the balance of the fiscal year would be more realistic. Tea Party conservatives are pushing the leaders to stick to the $100 billion target. Now the leaders face the task of uniting the rank-and-file around challenging the president.
''The simple message is 'We're broke, and there's a lot that America can invest in without having the government do it,'' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who spent years as a top aide on Capitol Hill. ''I think the point that Republicans and conservatives would make is that we have already spent way too much.''
Both sides are well aware of the budget battle of 1995 between President Bill Clinton and a newly empowered Republican-led Congress, which led to a government shutdown. Pressure built for the government to reopen, and Mr. Clinton was able to paint the Republicans as extreme and salvage his presidency, going on to win re-election.
For both sides, there are risks.
After two years of watching himself be defined by Republicans as a tax-and-spend liberal -- especially after the bitter debate over health care -- and alienating business leaders, Mr. Obama has lately been reaching out to the business community and delivering the kind of pro-growth message that will be the backbone of Tuesday night's address.
The challenge for the president, who won plaudits from the public for cooperating with Republicans during the lame-duck session, is to convince independents and centrists of his fiscal responsibility without further alienating his base by seeming too cooperative or moving too far toward the center.
The challenge for Republicans is to press their case for spending cuts without appearing dogmatic and irresponsible. An early test will be the coming vote on whether to raise the federal debt limit -- typically a routine step that allows the government to extend its borrowing power so it does not default on its obligations. But such a move makes the Republican right deeply uneasy, and Mr. Cantor said Sunday that Republicans would use the vote as leverage to demand spending cuts from Democrats.
A main player for Republicans will be Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the new Budget Committee chairman and Speaker John A. Boehner's choice to deliver the rebuttal to Mr. Obama on Tuesday night. Mr. Ryan is charged with writing a Republican budget document to counter the one Mr. Obama will propose. In announcing the selection of Mr. Ryan, Mr. Boehner signaled his party's theme for the coming months.
''We're broke,'' the speaker said, adding that Republicans intended to ''end the spending binge in Washington.''

HEADLINE: National Arts Index Shows Struggles

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN; Compiled by RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
The health of the American arts sector reached a 12-year low in 2009, according to a report from Americans for the Arts, a national advocacy group. The 2010 National Arts Index, which strives for a comprehensive picture of how the arts fared during the recession, shows that the vitality of the arts sector dropped a record 3.6 points, to 97.7. The losses from 2007 to 2009 were nearly double the gains made from 2003 to 2007, according to the report. At the same time, the number of nonprofit arts institutions grew by 3,000 during that period. As a result, the United States arts sector now includes 109,000 nonprofit organizations, 550,000 for-profit businesses and 2.2 million artists. But more organizations and individuals have struggled to make ends meet; in 2009, 41 percent of nonprofit arts organizations reporting to the I.R.S. failed to achieve a balanced budget, up from 36 percent in 2008.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Study Recommends More Oversight of Brokers

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Investment advisers and stockbrokers should be subject to the same fiduciary standard of conduct -- putting a customer's interests above their own -- rather than the different governance regimes that currently apply to the two groups, the Securities and Exchange Commission recommended on Saturday. 
In a report closely watched by Wall Street, the commission's staff said retail investors ''generally are not aware'' that stockbrokers and their firms are subject to a lesser legal standard, one that requires brokers to make sure the products that they sell are suitable for their clients. Investment advisers are already subject to the higher fiduciary standard.
The recommendation that the higher standard of fiduciary duty apply to both groups is intended to ''increase investor protection and decrease investor confusion in the most practicable, least burdensome way for investors, broker-dealers and investment advisers,'' the report said.
Wall Street groups and investor advocates generally applauded the recommendations. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a brokerage firm trade group, said it also supported beefing up examinations of financial advisers, which generally are subject to less rigorous oversight than brokerage firms.
The five S.E.C. commissioners did not vote on whether to adopt the study's recommendations, but the two Republicans issued a statement criticizing the study, saying it ''fails to adequately justify its recommendation'' and ''lacks a basis'' to conclude that a uniform standard would enhance investor protection.
The study and report to Congress were required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul passed last year to address the causes of the financial crisis. Most of its recommendations could be accomplished through rule changes by the S.E.C.
Whether the commission has the resources to enforce its recommended changes is uncertain. In a separate report to Congress issued on Wednesday, the S.E.C. concluded that the agency lacked the money and staff needed to conduct timely and effective examinations and oversight of registered investment advisers.
The agency's acknowledgment of its own shortcomings has broad implications. A failure by the S.E.C. to adequately examine the books of Bernard L. Madoff's investment advisory business contributed to the losses suffered by investors in that Ponzi scheme, the S.E.C.'s inspector general concluded in 2009.
The study on adviser examinations recommended that Congress take action to strengthen the investment adviser examination program, including possibly imposing user fees on investment advisers to pay for examinations or authorizing an industry self-regulatory organization to take over examination of the firms, under S.E.C. oversight.

HEADLINE: When States Try to Balance the Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Budget Worries Push Governors to Same Mind-Set'' (front page, Jan. 17) emphasized governors' bold spending cuts, which is half of their leadership role, but de-emphasized their timidity to raise revenues, the other half.
Most produced more honest budgets and exposed huge shortfalls, but offered only draconian cuts. They abdicated their responsibilities to educate the populace about its obligation to pay for needed government and, then, identify sources for these revenues. 
In a state like California, there is sufficient personal wealth for a single individual to spend almost $150 million to lose the race to lead the state, yet insufficient backbone to ask the millions of well-heeled citizens to contribute simply the amount they did a couple of decades ago, oil companies to pay for California oil as they pay for Texan or Alaskan oil, or billionaires to pay appropriate sales taxes on new yachts.
I optimistically see the cup of leadership half full this year.
Kenneth P. Monteiro San Francisco, Jan. 17, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Illinois Wakes Up'' (editorial, Jan. 17):
It seems as if governors of most states with large deficits are averse to raising income and corporate taxes. The words ''income tax'' and ''corporate tax'' terrify them. Which means it's time for the one tax that can be the perfect solution for our governors.
The value-added tax must make its presence felt. It is capable of gushing dollars and could well replace the income tax in time.
Jack E. Cohen Boynton Beach, Fla., Jan. 17, 2011
To the Editor:
While no one likes to pay more taxes, doing so is sometimes necessary. Illinois has surely reached such a time. Thank you for pointing out the fallacy of the mantra that spending cuts alone will solve the financial crisis of this or any other state.
Spending cuts will always be more popular with the public, for most of us can maintain the fantasy that cuts will be painless, leaving untouched our favorite programs and services. Politicians have for too long perpetrated the notion that there exists an endless pot of gold, government waste, that can also be painlessly tapped when needed.
Cuts will still be necessary. Waste can always be attacked and minimized. As a civilized society, though, we cannot claw our way out of the mess we have gotten ourselves into by further depriving our most vulnerable citizens. Any politician worthy of his or her calling will quit promising have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too lower taxes along with spending cuts affecting only someone else.
Anne-Marie Hislop Chicago, Jan. 17, 2011
To the Editor:
Your description of the situation in Illinois is wishful thinking. Tax increases in Illinois are not the solution, as Illinois is not a low-tax state. It has a low income tax but really high sales (10.25 percent in Cook County), real estate, unemployment and workers' comp taxes. It ranked 48th out of 50 as a business-friendly state before the tax increase. Now, it might slip to 50th.
Gov. Pat Quinn is failing at his main charge, which should be to make substantial changes on the spending side of the balance sheet. If Illinois were your state to run, what would you do? If Illinois were your state in which to do business, or increase business or start a business, would you?
We need to make Illinois more welcoming of employment and workers. The current system is unsustainable and will result in the bankruptcy of Illinois.
Carol Zsolnay Wilmette, Ill., Jan. 17, 2011
To the Editor:
We've heard the clarion call for sacrifice. Our politicians demand sacrifice from the public employees. Our business leaders demand sacrifice from their workers. The public demands sacrifice from the unions. The young demand sacrifice from the old, and the old declare that we can't afford to educate the young any more or any better.
I await tomorrow's newspaper hopeful that it will be rich with demands for sacrifice from our millionaires and billionaires, who, up till now, have used their control of the politicians to avoid any such demand. Perhaps tomorrow will bring demands from those excused from paying their fair share of the bills for our country to be allowed to contribute their fair share.
Then again, maybe not.
Barry Davis Stratford, Conn., Jan. 17, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Redevelopment Agencies Lie in Cost-Cutters' Sights'' (Bay Area edition, Jan. 16):
Can we clarify the real cost of eliminating redevelopment agencies? Your article noted that eliminating redevelopment agencies would save money and free up $1.9 billion for California schools and local services.
Beyond the loss of economic development activity, 20 percent of the tax increment financing generated by these agencies is one of the single most important sources of local government financing for the creation and preservation of affordable housing, generating $1.1 billion to help build and preserve thousands of affordable apartments and homes throughout the state.
The demand for affordable housing throughout California, especially in high-cost areas like the Bay Area, remains high, and redevelopment financing is a critical part of our capacity to build affordable apartments.
The consequences of losing affordable housing programs -- overcrowding and homelessness -- will only cost the state and our localities more in the long run.

HEADLINE: Small Bookstores Struggle for Niche in Shifting Times

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
ARLINGTON, Va. -- Get on Twitter. Add a wine bar. Do as one bookstore owner did and rent out space for birthday parties.
Or, as a veteran store owner from Kansas tartly suggested, just sell books.
More than 500 independent booksellers debated their next step last week at the Winter Institute, the annual jamboree that is also attended by publishers who go to mingle with their customers and promote their most promising coming titles.
But this event belongs to independents, whose surviving members withstood first the expansion of the big book chains, and later the recession. Lately, they have watched as former powerhouses like Borders have faltered, while wondering what the troubles of their old adversary mean for them. 
''We know now that in the world of physical bookselling, bigness is no longer viewed as an asset,'' said Mitchell Kaplan, owner of Books & Books, which has independent stores in South Florida, Westhampton Beach and the Cayman Islands. ''It's about selection and service and ambiance. Now we're finding a situation where the marketplace is getting back to reality.''
Not everyone here was so confident. While the number of independent bookstores has stabilized after years of decline, according to membership in their national trade association, the stores are still fighting some of the same forces that caused their ranks to diminish years ago. Amazon still rules online bookselling, while Barnes & Noble, the biggest of the book chains, is retooling itself for the digital age.
Now more independent booksellers, whose stores account for about 10 percent of the industry's retail market overall, are trying to move their own transformation along by imagining ways to supplement their printed-book business with online sales and more lucrative side businesses.
''We have to figure out how we stay in the game,'' said Beth Puffer, the director of the Bank Street Bookstore in Manhattan. ''You have to rethink your whole business model, because the old ways really aren't going to cut it anymore.''
Running an independent bookstore has lately become a much more complicated endeavor. Owners are grappling with the new realities of online bookselling, Web design and the nuances of using social media for promotion. (Less so for the Twitter-mad younger generation of bookstore owners who grew up with the Internet.)
Matt Norcross, the owner of McLean & Eakin Booksellers in Petoskey, Mich., instructed a crowd at the Crystal Gateway Marriott here on Friday how to set up a store Web site to sell both print and e-books in order to lure some customers away from Amazon. Many stores have recently begun selling e-books on their Web sites through Google, frequently at the same prices Amazon charges, but they have struggled to get the word out to their customers.
''It's important for us to figure out how to communicate these things to our customers,'' Mr. Norcross said. ''A lot of customers don't believe it.''
Naftali Rottenstreich, an owner of Red Fox Books in Glens Falls, N.Y., said it would be difficult to get customers to think of independents as places to buy books online.
''The mindset right now is, that's Amazon or that's BarnesandNoble.com,'' he said. ''There's a transformation that has to take place, and I think it will happen in time.''
Other stores are experimenting with adding more nonbook products, as Barnes & Noble has done with its in-store cafes and sales of toys and games. John Hugo of HugoBookstores, which runs three bookstores in Massachusetts, has begun including Spanish and knitting classes with his stores' traditional offerings. Mollie Loughlin, the owner of The Book Vine in the rural farming community of Cherokee, Iowa, explained to one group of booksellers how she operates a business that sells both books and bottles of fine wine.
At a workshop on Thursday, dozens of booksellers debated the finer points of alternative business models, like the addition of a cafe. Is it worth the trouble, one person asked? How do you figure out how much to charge for scones and lattes? And even if nonbook business attracts attention, how much profit will follow?
''At a certain point, I begin to feel like we don't need more P.R.,'' said Roxanne Coady, the president and founder of R.J. Julia in Madison, Conn. ''We need sales.''
But Mary Beth Nebel, the owner of I Know You Like a Book, a bookstore-with-wine-bar in Peoria Heights, Ill., said her wine business was a marketing tool that brought people into the store. ''It gives me a chance to compete against the big stores that have cafes,'' she said.
One challenge for booksellers, they said, was finding the balance between selling their core product without overwhelming it with the presence of coffee, baked goods, gifts and other merchandise.
''You don't want people to walk in and think, 'This is a toy store with books,' '' said Sarah Bagby, owner of Watermark Books and Cafe in Wichita, Kan. ''But we have to be entertaining. You can get a customer to come in for one thing, but then you have to seduce them with another -- a book.''
Vivien Jennings, the founder and president of Rainy Day Books in Fairway, Kan., said that booksellers had to realize that they were no longer the ''protected industry'' that they used to be, when it was easier to stay in business.
''Now, whether we like it or not, bookselling is hard-core retailing,'' she said. ''You have to be extra, extra good.''
Nowhere is that more apparent than at Borders, the once-thriving chain that, during its days of rapid expansion, helped knock some independents out of business.
Owners of smaller stores said they had mixed feelings about the precarious health of Borders, which last month delayed payments to publishers and has appeared dangerously close to bankruptcy.
''Short term, publishers are going to get squeezed,'' said Chris Morrow, owner and general manager of the Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt. ''Long term, it might make publishers appreciate the bricks-and-mortar stores that are still standing.''
Mr. Rottenstreich of Red Fox Books said he worried that Borders' going out of business would wreak havoc on the industry.
Then again, he said with a small smile, ''A lot of people, in their heart of hearts, are happy when a Goliath falls.''

HEADLINE: Turning the Focus To Governance

BYLINE: By MARTIN HUTCHINSON and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
The BRIC acronym for the world's biggest emerging economies, created by the Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill a decade ago, became a somewhat self-fulfilling prophecy. It arguably diverted billions of investment from elsewhere to his chosen markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Mr. O'Neill's new bloc of large growth markets -- which could be called MIST for short and is made up of Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey -- may do the same. But smaller markets with better governance could offer investors higher long-term returns. 
The BRIC grouping in 2001 was well timed. With global interest rates low for several years after its coinage, large money pools were actively seeking new investment opportunities. Growth in Asia made investing there appealing. And the active marketing of the BRIC concept attracted large amounts of money to Russia and Brazil that otherwise might not have flowed to either country, and thereby increased growth in both.
The self-reinforcing effect may repeat itself. The latest countries chosen by Goldman have little in common aside from the fact that each economy represents more than 1 percent of world gross domestic product (in Indonesia's case, just below it in 2009). For example, South Korea is much richer than the other three, with a per capita G.D.P. of $27,000. Growth in Mexico, meanwhile, has been notably sluggish over the last two decades.
This G.D.P. limitation is unduly restrictive, as the indicator fails to correlate particularly well with market liquidity. For example, Indonesia's Jakarta stock exchange had a November 2010 market capitalization of $339 billion and Turkey's Istanbul exchange $304 billion. Meanwhile, the Santiago exchange had $326 billion, even with Chile's much smaller economy. Exchanges in Johannesburg, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, also in much smaller economies, were larger and presumably more liquid.
Investors, therefore, may do better to focus on governance. The quality of national governments and their respect for property rights matter more than size when it comes to choosing investment opportunities. Apart from making an economy grow more rapidly, good governance ensures some protections to make the problems investors have encountered in, say, Russia or Venezuela, less likely. But understanding the nuances of such complex dynamics may require more than any simple acronym can ably provide.
G.E. Chief's New Role
When the president asks for help, it would be difficult for even the busiest corporate chief to say no. It's even harder when he owes the government a huge favor. And so it is that Jeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric's longtime boss, is heading to Washington to advise Mr. Obama on how to make the United States a job-creating colossus again.
G.E. shareholders, already cheered by stellar fourth-quarter earnings, including a strong showing by its troublesome GE Capital unit, didn't seem bothered Friday that Mr. Immelt will divert some of his attention to the president's agenda. After all, many of the objectives -- like bolstering America's manufacturing might and promoting access to foreign markets -- dovetail nicely with G.E.'s own global industrial businesses.
But it's a matter of timing. While G.E.'s share price has nearly tripled from the dark days of the financial crisis, it's still around 50 percent off the highs seen before the investors panicked about shaky investments that the conglomerate's finance unit made. Mr. Immelt should be credited with steering the company -- with generous support from the government through debt guarantees and short-term loans -- in the right direction. But he clearly failed to avert G.E.'s fall into a precarious state to begin with.
Gaining access to the president's ear has its advantages, and there's a long history of executives, including former G.E. officials, advising a commander in chief while continuing to run their own companies. Yet the current climate carries a distinctive disadvantage: backlash from the public if it suspects the relationship is too cozy. Just ask Goldman Sachs.
And G.E. still needs its best minds focused on business. To Mr. Immelt's credit, investors spend much less time worrying about the finance unit, which knocked its mammoth parent to its knees two years ago. He's committed to cutting it down to a more manageable size by 2012 and making it less dependent on short-term financing.
But G.E. shareholders, especially those who held on through its darkest days and are still nursing losses, deserve a committed captain. Should Mr. Immelt appear stretched too thin, they would be right in demanding he choose one job or the other.

HEADLINE: Odd Allies Join to Fight Cuomo Plan For Tax Cap

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has vowed to rein in New York's taxes, declaring them a burden to residents and businesses, and proposing help in the form of a state-imposed cap on property taxes.
But many among the very constituencies he has been aiming to satisfy, homeowners and tax protest organizations, say they are deeply dissatisfied with his proposal.
And in recent weeks many have joined educators, school district officials and unions in mobilizing against the tax cap, trying to cut off the proposal even before the governor has officially submitted it.
These opponents are arguing that a tax cap would not lower anyone's tax bill, and could instead end up costing people more in fees for programs and services as schools and municipalities seek other ways to cover costs. 
Many said they would prefer having property tax bills based partly on the income of the property owner, rather than just on the fluctuating real estate market.
''Most property tax reform groups that have been studying the issue for a long time understand that a tax cap is smoke and mirrors,'' said Susan Zimet, 56, an Ulster County legislator and a former New Paltz town supervisor. ''It's making people believe their taxes will go down. It's setting them up to be incredibly disappointed when they get their tax bill.''
The governor's proposal would cap the growth of the overall property tax levy at 2 percent a year or the rate of inflation, whichever was less. A poll conducted this month by Siena College found that 83 percent of New York State voters supported a 2 percent tax cap.
Nevertheless, New York has dozens of citizens groups, from Long Island to the Canadian border, with many claiming to represent hundreds, if not thousands, of like-minded taxpayers. By most accounts, some of these groups started banding together a few years ago when property taxes were rising steeply, and they have now stepped up their efforts with Governor Cuomo's push for a tax cap.
In recent weeks, groups have been trying to galvanize opposition to the proposal. In December, for example, representatives from the groups held a news conference in Albany and met with the editorial board of The Times-Union of Albany. They have appeared on radio shows in the Albany area and are blogging on taxnightmare.org.
In January they attended Mr. Cuomo's State of the State address to lobby legislators. They have also sent e-mails to the office of the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, asking him to reject a tax cap, and plan to bombard Mr. Cuomo's office with mail.
The state's powerful teachers union, New York State United Teachers, has also opposed the tax cap, saying it could devastate local schools, especially as mandated costs can rise by more than 2 percent annually.
But union officials said last week that they were not providing money or working closely with the taxpayer groups -- some of which would be happy to see school budgets restrained.
Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement that ''property taxes are suffocating New Yorkers'' and that ''passing a property tax cap is the best way to deliver relief and Governor Cuomo will move swiftly to see that one is passed.''
Indeed, the governor has the support of many business and community leaders, who have formed their own group, the Committee to Save New York, to promote the tax cap, along with other fiscal measures.
The group is spending at least $10 million in television and radio ads, direct mailings, and other communications.
The Business Council of New York State has also broadcast radio commercials in the Albany area.
''A property tax cap is crucial to take the pressure off homeowners and businesses in those areas of the state that have seen taxes constantly rising and jobs and people constantly leaving,'' said William T. Cunningham, a spokesman for the Committee to Save New York.
While other states have adopted tax caps, experts in fiscal policy are divided over their effectiveness.
Supporters contend that tax caps, while they do not actually cut taxes, nevertheless slow the rate of increase and make them more affordable.
Opponents say tax caps fail to reduce the tax burden on middle-class families, who are already overburdened.
An analysis of census data by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research group in Albany, showed that in 2008 an estimated one in five New York households with incomes of $250,000 or less paid more than 10 percent of their income in property taxes; among households with incomes of $100,000 or under, that rose to more than one in four.
''The problem with the property tax is that there is no limit to how much you can pay,'' said Robert McKeon, 47, a cattle farmer and co-founder of the Tax Reform Effort of Northern Dutchess. He pays $10,000 a year in property taxes, more than 10 percent of his income, Mr. McKeon said.
Many tax protest groups have instead lobbied for a ''circuit breaker'' program, which would provide a tax credit for people based on their income and ability to pay.
In the long term, they say, they want the state to take over direct financing of schools and Medicaid, easing the pressure to increase property taxes.
But these proposals would require significant state funds and face formidable hurdles, particularly during a state budget crisis.
In addition, the circuit breaker would benefit only homeowners, while businesses have also demanded tax relief.
A co-founder of taxnightmare.org, Gioia Shebar, 78, says the state's property tax system is fundamentally unfair because it is based on home values, which fluctuate with the real estate market and reassessments, without regard to a homeowner's income.
Ms. Shebar, a retired New York City teacher, said school taxes on her three-bedroom home in Gardiner, N.Y., had nearly tripled, to $9,592, since 1997. Some of her neighbors, unable to afford such increases, have been forced to move or sell part of their land, she said.
''It's like having a sewer that's really overflowing and putting a cap on it and saying 'It's fixed,' '' Ms. Shebar said. ''It's still going to stink to high heaven.''
John Whiteley, a retired Foreign Service officer who helped found the New York State Property Tax Reform Coalition, said his group was trying to educate people about the tax cap.
''It's popular because somebody comes up to you and says, 'Hey, we're going to put a cap on your property taxes,' '' Mr. Whiteley said.
''Who's going to say no? They don't bother to explain really what it is because it's a sound bite, it's not sound policy.''

HEADLINE: Students, Not States, Are Now Paying More to Cover Costs for Public Universities

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
COLUMBIA, S.C. -- For bargain-hunting families, state colleges and universities, supported by tax money, have long been a haven from the high cost of private education.
But tuition bargains are fading as the nation's public universities undergo a profound shift, accelerated by the recession. In most states, it is now tuition payments, not state appropriations, that cover most of the budget.
The shift has been an unwelcome surprise to Ashley Murphy, a sophomore at the University of South Carolina. When she and her twin sister, Allison, picked their colleges two years ago, costs were definitely an issue, since they are putting themselves through college.
Ashley said she chose the state flagship both because she believed that public universities offered the best education and because she thought it would be cheaper than Allison's choice, a small Baptist university where the published tuition is twice as much. 
But thanks to generous financial aid, Allison is paying less. And even with a campus job and a $5,000 state scholarship, Ashley struggles to make ends meet, worries about her student loans and is increasingly nervous about tuition increases.
''The whole thing is kind of scary, for somebody like me who's paying for college myself,'' said Ms. Murphy, who plans to be a teacher. ''I turn 20 tomorrow, I'm already in debt, and if tuition goes up again next year, I'll be in an even worse position.''
According to the Delta Cost Project, most of the nation's public research universities had more than half their costs paid by tuition in 2008, and other four-year public institutions were hovering near the 50 percent mark. With three more years of tuition increases, they, too, have probably passed it, said Jane V. Wellman, executive director of the project, leaving only community colleges as mostly state-financed.
And the increasing dependence on tuition has disturbing implications for access to higher education, she said.
''In the next three or four years, we're going to have more students who are spilling out the bottom, priced out of the expensive institutions,'' Ms. Wellman said. ''We're going to be rationing opportunity. We're moving in that direction fairly rapidly.''
Given that states still provide some $80 billion for higher education, some education policy experts say it is wrong to think of public universities as privatized. But they acknowledge that a fundamental reordering is under way -- and that the era of affordable four-year public universities, heavily subsidized by the state, may be over.
''Something important is happening here,'' said Pat Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. ''I wouldn't call it privatization, a word often used by presidents of public institutions who want a blank check on raising tuition. But with the shift toward more student funding, you have to wonder who owns these places -- the students, because they're paying the majority, or the state, which has invested hundreds of years in the physical plant and the brand?''
The burden on students is likely to keep growing. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 30 states face shortfalls of at least 10 percent of their budgets next year. And given the difficulties of cutting costs for Medicaid or K-12 schools, which get the biggest chunk of state budgets, appropriations for higher education are likely to shrivel further, leaving public universities ever more dependent on tuition money.
The University of South Carolina has lost almost half of its state appropriations in the last three years, gets only about a quarter of its education budget from the state and is expecting another round of deep cuts next year.
''We still have our public mission, but at this point, we have more of a private funding model,'' said Michael Amiridis, the provost.
More states may soon find themselves in a similar position. In California, where tuition has been raised by 30 percent in the last two years -- and where out-of-state tuition now tops $50,000, about the same as an elite private university -- the governor has proposed cutting state support for the University of California by $500 million for the next fiscal year.
''If approved, this budget will mean that for the first time in our long history, tuition paid by University of California students and their families will exceed the state's contribution to the core fund,'' Mark Yudof, the president of the University of California system, told the Board of Regents. ''For those who believe what we provide is a public good, not a private one, this is a sad threshold to cross.''
In Texas, legislators have proposed closing four community colleges and ending financial aid for freshmen. In Georgia, the popular Hope scholarships are likely to be slashed. In Arizona, the governor has proposed cutting financing for community colleges by half, and for four-year universities by 20 percent.
In state after state, tuition and class size are rising, jobs are being eliminated, maintenance is being deferred and the number of nonresident students, who pay higher tuition, is increasing.
''The difference between this downturn and others in the past is that this time I don't think higher education will be able to recover the ground it's lost,'' said Scott Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. ''I hope I'm wrong, but I don't see that money coming back. And with tuition already out of reach for many folks, I don't think there's much ability to keep raising it.''
At the University of South Carolina, budget cuts have already pushed tuition to $9,786, more than double what it was a decade ago and well above both the national and regional averages.
''I think we're about at the maximum tuition South Carolina parents will pay,'' said Ed Walton, the associate vice president for operations. ''If the strategy of shrinking state government till it drowns in the bathtub worked, we'd be rich. But as it is, something's going to have to go as we dwindle down from here, and I don't know what more that something will be.''
Ms. Murphy feels the budget strains both as a student and as a university employee. ''My campus job just had a four-hour meeting Sunday where they told us they wouldn't be able to hire as many people for the information center,'' she said. ''We used to have three people on a shift, but now, sometimes, it's just one.''
Education officials in South Carolina say their best hope of maintaining financing is convincing the state of the importance of higher education in producing workers who will thrive in the knowledge economy, an argument that has taken hold in North Carolina, where per-student appropriations are about twice as much.
But South Carolina's legislators are focusing their attention -- and ire -- on the tuition increases. This month, the day after the new governor, Nikki Haley, was inaugurated, the House Ways and Means Committee met for a budget briefing from the programs that get the most state support.
Garrison Walters, director of the Commission on Higher Education, made his case that higher education could help drive the state's economy.
But the legislators wanted to talk about tuition.
''You say we're not making competitive investment in higher education, but how would you answer that you all are not being responsive to the needs of the state, when you increase tuition?'' one legislator said.
Another said, ''If people can't afford it, what good is it?''

HEADLINE: Can a City This Self-Serious Take a Joke?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- The first episode of ''Portlandia,'' a new television show that pokes at this Northwest confection's urban preciousness, includes a scene in which a couple at a restaurant interrogates a waitress about the quality of the life lived by a chicken they hope to order.
The couple soon learns that the bird was raised locally on sheep's milk, soy and hazelnuts, and that it had a name, Colin. 
''He looks like a happy little guy who runs around,'' says the character played by Fred Armisen, a Saturday Night Live star and a creator of ''Portlandia,'' when he is shown a photograph of a pre-plucked version of the bird. ''A lot of friends?''
It is a funny moment, a sendup of this city's obsession with provenance. Yet the fact that it is a spoof might not always be clear.
''This is Sir Francis Bacon,'' said Jamie Dunn, the owner of the Gilt Club, the restaurant in Portland's Old Town neighborhood where the scene was filmed in September. ''The pork head mortadella came right out of this skull.''
Mr. Dunn was holding the skull of a locally raised pig that had been slaughtered and dispersed into various dishes on that day's menu, including pork and octopus stew. He said 80 percent of the restaurant's food came from within 150 miles and 99 percent came from within 300 miles. Some of the hard liquor is distilled blocks away.
''We can ride our fixed-gear bikes to pick up a bottle,'' he said.
Then he added, ''We do have a sense of humor here.''
Portland will need one.
For years, many residents here have reacted with practiced apathy and amusement toward the national fascination with Portland. Outsiders and media critics have glowed over everything from its restaurants to its ambitious transit system of streetcars and light rail. Yet with ''Portlandia,'' the flattery has given way to mockery, however gently executed, of this liberal city's deliberate differentness.
''When it makes fun of the aggressive bicyclists and things like that, well, that's stuff I complain about, too,'' said Amber Rowland, 27. ''But then I'm part of what it's making fun of as well. There's a kernel of truth in it, and it's O.K. to roll with it.''
Ms. Rowland is a co-director of In Other Words, a nonprofit feminist book store and community center that is the setting for a scene in the first episode. Yet while the humor of the scene is rooted in the rude righteousness of the store clerks, Ms. Rowland and her colleagues like to laugh, and they are in on the joke. Of course, they still measure the show by a Portland standard, its localness.
Mr. Armisen is not from Portland, but his co-star Carrie Brownstein was a leader of a popular band that was based for a while in Portland, Sleater-Kinney. (Ms. Rowland enjoyed noting that it was a ''seminal female rock band.'')
''She's going to be careful in the way she represents us because, inherently, she's part of the community,'' said Julie Park-Williams, a board member of In Other Words. ''She comes from a place of trust.''
In a popular line from the show, which is on IFC, Mr. Armisen's character describes Portland as a place ''where young people go to retire.'' Sure enough, economists have shown that the city in recent years has drawn a disproportionate amount of young people, and that many of them end up being underemployed.
''I love this show because this is how real born Portlanders look at all of you that moved here since 1998,'' one person wrote in a comments forum on The Oregonian Web site.
The show has limits as social science. While many parts of Portland feel like one big group hug, the city is a complicated place, struggling with government budget cuts, manufacturing losses and the housing downturn even as demand for office space downtown has risen. The Gilt Club restaurant is just a few blocks from a Salvation Army shelter.
In November, the city was shaken when a teenager born in Somalia and raised in Portland was charged with trying to detonate a bomb at a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony. On the day ''Portlandia'' made its debut, lawyers were in federal court here arguing that a controversial local Muslim cleric, among others, had been unjustly placed on a federal no-fly list.
''Portlandia,'' some say, is hardly Portland.
''I think it's just too narrow of a population that they're making fun of,'' said Allison Jones, 23, who takes photographs of food for Eater PDX, a Portland restaurant blog. ''And I think I can say that because I'm part of that subset.''
Yet people are clearly interested. Late Friday night, a long line wrapped around the Mission Theater. People waiting hoped a space would open up inside, where the first episode of ''Portlandia'' was about to be shown to a packed house. Some people said they did not own televisions -- or that they did not get IFC.
''It's got to be a little elitist, you know,'' said Tony Robinson, working as the doorman. ''That's part of the Portland thing, too.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about reaction in Portland, Ore., to ''Portlandia,'' a television show that pokes fun at the city, carried an incorrect byline in some editions. The article was written by William Yardley, not by Jesse McKinley.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: ''We do have a sense of humor here,'' said Jamie Dunn, who owns a restaurant in Portland, Ore., where part of the new television series ''Portlandia'' was filmed.
 ''Portlandia'' was also filmed at a store where a wall speaks to the city's sensibilities. Amber Rowland, who helps run a bookstore, praised the IFC series. ''There's a kernel of truth in it, and it's O.K. to roll with it,'' she said. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY STEVE DYKES FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: The Competition Myth

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Meet the new buzzword, same as the old buzzword. In advance of the State of the Union, President Obama has telegraphed his main theme: competitiveness. The President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board has been renamed the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. And in his Saturday radio address, the president declared that ''We can out-compete any other nation on Earth.''
This may be smart politics. Arguably, Mr. Obama has enlisted an old cliche on behalf of a good cause, as a way to sell a much-needed increase in public investment to a public thoroughly indoctrinated in the view that government spending is a bad thing. 
But let's not kid ourselves: talking about ''competitiveness'' as a goal is fundamentally misleading. At best, it's a misdiagnosis of our problems. At worst, it could lead to policies based on the false idea that what's good for corporations is good for America.
About that misdiagnosis: What sense does it make to view our current woes as stemming from lack of competitiveness?
It's true that we'd have more jobs if we exported more and imported less. But the same is true of Europe and Japan, which also have depressed economies. And we can't all export more while importing less, unless we can find another planet to sell to. Yes, we could demand that China shrink its trade surplus -- but if confronting China is what Mr. Obama is proposing, he should say that plainly.
Furthermore, while America is running a trade deficit, this deficit is smaller than it was before the Great Recession began. It would help if we could make it smaller still. But ultimately, we're in a mess because we had a financial crisis, not because American companies have lost their ability to compete with foreign rivals.
But isn't it at least somewhat useful to think of our nation as if it were America Inc., competing in the global marketplace? No.
Consider: A corporate leader who increases profits by slashing his work force is thought to be successful. Well, that's more or less what has happened in America recently: employment is way down, but profits are hitting new records. Who, exactly, considers this economic success?
Still, you might say that talk of competitiveness helps Mr. Obama quiet claims that he's anti-business. That's fine, as long as he realizes that the interests of nominally ''American'' corporations and the interests of the nation, which were never the same, are now less aligned than ever before.
Take the case of General Electric, whose chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, has just been appointed to head that renamed advisory board. I have nothing against either G.E. or Mr. Immelt. But with fewer than half its workers based in the United States and less than half its revenues coming from U.S. operations, G.E.'s fortunes have very little to do with U.S. prosperity.
By the way, some have praised Mr. Immelt's appointment on the grounds that at least he represents a company that actually makes things, rather than being yet another financial wheeler-dealer. Sorry to burst this bubble, but these days G.E. derives more revenue from its financial operations than it does from manufacturing -- indeed, GE Capital, which received a government guarantee for its debt, was a major beneficiary of the Wall Street bailout.
So what does the administration's embrace of the rhetoric of competitiveness mean for economic policy?
The favorable interpretation, as I said, is that it's just packaging for an economic strategy centered on public investment, investment that's actually about creating jobs now while promoting longer-term growth. The unfavorable interpretation is that Mr. Obama and his advisers really believe that the economy is ailing because they've been too tough on business, and that what America needs now is corporate tax cuts and across-the-board deregulation.
My guess is that we're mainly talking about packaging here. And if the president does propose a serious increase in spending on infrastructure and education, I'll be pleased.
But even if he proposes good policies, the fact that Mr. Obama feels the need to wrap these policies in bad metaphors is a sad commentary on the state of our discourse.
The financial crisis of 2008 was a teachable moment, an object lesson in what can go wrong if you trust a market economy to regulate itself. Nor should we forget that highly regulated economies, like Germany, did a much better job than we did at sustaining employment after the crisis hit. For whatever reason, however, the teachable moment came and went with nothing learned.
Mr. Obama himself may do all right: his approval rating is up, the economy is showing signs of life, and his chances of re-election look pretty good. But the ideology that brought economic disaster in 2008 is back on top -- and seems likely to stay there until it brings disaster again.

HEADLINE: Increasingly Confident Fed Is Set for First Meeting of 2011

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve will use its first policy meeting of 2011 this week to revisit its economic projections amid a climate of modest but increasing confidence about the recovery.
The statement it will issue on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the private deliberations of Fed officials, is likely to reflect a guarded optimism about the economy, while also maintaining the Fed strategy announced last November to accelerate the recovery by pumping $600 billion into the banking system.
Recent comments by Fed officials who had been particularly skeptical of the $600 billion bond-buying plan suggest that the criticism has moderated somewhat. Noisy and harsh dissents now seem less likely. 
Simply put, the Fed as an institution seems to be hoping for a more placid year. In a raucous 2010, its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was narrowly confirmed for a second four-year term, it fended off efforts to strip away its regulatory powers and it faced attacks for its extraordinary interventions to bolster the recovery by easing the supply of credit.
The Fed is also looking to improve its communications. On Feb. 3, a week after the first of eight scheduled meetings this year of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm, Mr. Bernanke will speak at the National Press Club and field questions from journalists.
The appearance, his first there in two years, is part of a strategy to improve transparency.
This month, Mr. Bernanke used his first testimony to the new Congress to explain the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying strategy, which is scheduled to continue through June and is intended to lower long-term interest rates.
Appearing before the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Bernanke predicted that the recovery would be ''moderately stronger'' this year than last. He cited ''increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold.''
The economy is expected to grow by up to 4 percent this year, above the 2.5 percent needed just to maintain the unemployment rate at its current level of 9.4 percent. But Mr. Bernanke warned that at the end of 2012 the unemployment rate was still expected to be close to 8 percent, far above the level before the recession.
Despite significant caveats, Fed officials are markedly more upbeat than they were six months ago.
Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and one of the officials most associated with the view that the weak recovery demanded more stimulus from monetary policy, said in a Jan. 14 speech that recent indicators suggested ''a somewhat happier new year.'' But he also warned that the housing sector, which is still struggling, was unlikely to spur this recovery as it has past ones.
In a speech the same day, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, said that ''consumer spending is starting to show some real signs of life,'' pointing to growth in business investment and exports.
''While the outlook may not have improved enough yet to warrant adjusting our purchase plans in the near term,'' he said, ''I anticipate earnest re-evaluation as economic developments unfold in the months ahead.''
Four votes on the Fed committee rotate every year, and of the new voting members, Charles I. Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed, and Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, are considered the most likely to dissent, if anyone does.
Mr. Plosser said in a speech last Monday that ''monetary policy is not going to be able to speed up the adjustments in labor markets or prevent asset bubbles, and attempts to do so may create more instability, not less.''
But he did not explicitly attack the most recent bond-buying plan, nor did Mr. Fisher in a speech on Jan. 12.
''None of my business contacts, large or small, publicly held or private, are complaining about the cost of borrowing, the lack of liquidity or the availability of capital,'' Mr. Fisher said then. Instead, he said, they were worried about taxes, regulations and unaddressed fiscal challenges in Washington.
One major question now, according to Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Fed governor, is how much the Fed committee will upgrade its economic projections, which are updated quarterly. (The projections updated this week will be released in mid-February.)
''The committee is very reluctant to be overly optimistic,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''If it's wrong, it wants it to be because its forecasts were overly cautious, not overly rosy. If they become too optimistic too soon, it will lead to questions about their decision to restart the asset purchases. And remember, this is still going to be a lousy economy for a very long time.''

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans to Oppose Obama's Spending Plans

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on Sunday that his party will vigorously oppose the spending initiatives President Obama plans to include in his State of the Union address on Tuesday because ''it's not a time to be looking at pumping up government spending.''
And the number two Republican in the House, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, said that his party would press ahead with its plans for immediate cuts in spending, including in the defense budget. ''Every dollar should be on the table,'' he said. 
In a video Mr. Obama sent to supporters on Saturday that gave a preview of the speech, the president indicated that he would seek to balance an attack on the deficit with increased spending in fields like education, research and technological innovation that he called crucial to long-term job growth.
Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Mr. McConnell countered that ''The American public, as one pundit put it, issued a massive restraining order,'' against government spending and excessive debt in November's Congressional elections.
Indeed, Mr. McConnell seemed at times gleefully sardonic about President Obama's efforts to depict himself as a centrist trying to find common ground with Republicans. The president, he said, has certainly moved to the enter , but mostly ''rhetorically.''
''The president needs to pivot,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''He seems to be pivoting on virtually everything else, and I don't put him down for that. I mean he obviously saw what happened in the November election and is trying to go in a different direction. He's quit bashing business and is now celebrating business.''
''Well it's about time,'' Mr. McConnell added, ''because the only way we're going to get unemployment down and get out of this economic trough is through private sector growth and development. I think excessive government spending, running up debt, making us look like a Western European country is the wrong direction.''
In the video, Mr. Obama called for an attack on the budget deficit, but indicated that his ''No. 1 focus is going to be making sure that we are competitive and we are creating jobs not just now but well into the future.'' His advisors have said that he will make the case for ''investments'' in areas like education, transportation and technological innovation.
Mr. McConnell tartly ridiculed that plan as a camouflage for spending.
''With all due respect to our Democratic friends, any time they want to spend, they call it investment, so I think you will hear the president talk about investing a lot Tuesday night.''
But Mr. McConnell said that was the wrong approach because Americans were incensed by the $1 trillion annual deficits in each of the past two years, much of which went for an economic stimulus bill that Mr. McConnell contended had no impact on the job creation or growth in private industry. While Republicans will examine Mr. Obama's recommendations, he said, ''this is not a time to be looking at pumping up government spending in very many areas.''
Appearing on the same show, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, cautioned that cutting spending could be detrimental to a rebounding economy, noting that the president's bipartisan deficit commission had issued such warnings.
''They said be careful,'' Mr. Durbin, a member of the commission, said. ''Don't start the serious spending cuts until we're clearly out of the recession in 2013. Maybe it will be sooner. But that warning is something we shouldn't forget. We learned in history with President Franklin Roosevelt that after the Great Depression when they started to hit the deficit brakes too soon, they went into a double dip recession and higher unemployment.''
Mr. Cantor, the House majority leader, said in an appearance on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' that a key confrontation between Democrats and Republicans over the issue of spending would come when Congress will be asked by the president to raise the ceiling on the national debt. Mr. Cantor has called that vote ''a leverage moment,'' when Republicans can extract concessions for their support.
''Let me be clear,'' Mr. Cantor said. ''Republicans are not going to vote for this increase in the debt limit unless there are serious spending cuts and reforms.''
He said Republicans would try to fulfill promises of cutting the budget by $100 billion this year, but noted that the figure would be met on an annualized basis, since the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, is already well along. In tackling such cuts, he said, ''every dollar should be on the table,'' including defense, whose budgets Republicans have historically safeguarded.
''No one can defend the expenditure of every dollar and cent over at the Pentagon,'' he said. ''And we've got to be very serious to make sure that they are doing more with less as well.''
Mr. McConnell did not outline where he would like to cut spending, but Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate in 2008, said Washington needs ''to take on some of the sacred cows.''
''Agriculture subsidies are outrageous today,'' he said, in an appearance on CBS's ''Face the Nation.''. ''Ethanol is a joke.'' Another target should be federal subsidies to the Post Office, which Mr. McCain called a ''model of inefficiency.''
''And then we have to go after entitlements,'' Mr. McCain said. ''And entitlements have to be on the table sooner rather than later. You and I could write the solution to Social Security problems on the back of an envelope.''
In his appearance, Mr. McConnell also promised that Republicans would find a parliamentary way to have the Senate vote on repealing President Obama's health care overhaul. If repeal doesn't pass, as he conceded it probably would not, Republicans would try to take the law apart piecemeal. The Republican-dominated House voted last Wednesday to repeal, a symbolic move since leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate have said that they will not act on the repeal measure.

HEADLINE: THE CAUCUS; President, Rebounding, Gives Opponents Pause

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Suddenly, Republicans face an unanticipated problem: less than three months after their midterm triumphs, President Obama has regained political momentum.
As Mr. Obama approaches the State of the Union address on Tuesday, various polls show him rising toward or beyond 50 percent approval of his job performance. Before his first 2011 clash with Republican adversaries who now share governing responsibility, those surveys also show that Americans credit Mr. Obama with greater commitment to finding common ground.
Analysts in both parties agree on the elements of Mr. Obama's rebound. Most Americans never turned on him personally, even as they shouted their disappointment in the November elections. 
Postelection compromises with Republicans on tax cuts showed the White House breaking Washington gridlock on the economic issues Americans care about most. That, along with signs of accelerating growth, increased confidence.
Then Mr. Obama delivered a well-received message of unity after the Tucson shootings two weeks ago. By demonstrating ''efficacy and empathy,'' as the Democratic pollster Peter Hart put it, the president complicated the task for Republicans in extending the last election's gains.
''People can only sustain anger for so long,'' said Vin Weber, a former Republican House member from Minnesota who is now a Washington lobbyist. ''Republicans have to be very careful that they don't simply refight the election of 2010.''
A Fast Rebound
Mr. Obama's recovery is not dramatic in magnitude, and may not last. What is notable is its rapidity.
After his 1982 midterm setbacks, President Ronald Reagan did not return to 50 percent approval in the Gallup poll until November 1983. Celebrating ''Morning in America'' for the economy, Mr. Reagan remained above that level through his landslide 1984 re-election.
After his 1994 drubbing, President Bill Clinton did not cross the 50 percent mark until late April 1995, after his widely praised response to the Oklahoma City bombing. But his popularity sagged soon thereafter.
Only after besting Congressional Republicans in the subsequent winter government shutdown fight did Mr. Clinton cross the 50 percent mark to stay. He, too, won a second term comfortably.
Republicans consider the Clinton example instructive. Once applause for Mr. Obama's Tucson remarks fades, he will face the familiar scourges of slow recovery and high unemployment.
''The structural elements, he hasn't changed,'' said a Republican pollster, David Winston. Congressional Republicans also insist they have learned not to overreach.
They can still compete in the jobs debate. In last week's New York Times/CBS News Poll, Americans split 44 percent to 44 percent on whether they trust Republicans or Mr. Obama more on that issue.
Yet the survey showed a clear Obama advantage on another source of public frustration: relentless partisan bickering.
Fully 77 percent predicted the president would seek to work with Republicans to get things done, compared with 46 percent who think Republicans will work with him. Approaching Tuesday's address, Mr. Obama has tried to burnish that reputation by reaching out to business leaders on taxes, trade and regulation.
Americans ''see him as someone who is pushing the hardest to work with others,'' said Joel Benenson, an Obama pollster. Barring unexpected crises, added the White House adviser David Axelrod, ''I can't imagine we're going to go backwards.''
The G.O.P's Challenge
Most cognizant of Mr. Obama's advantages are Republicans who might challenge his re-election. If Mr. Obama lacks Mr. Clinton's raw one-on-one appeal, polls reflect high regard for his demeanor and values.
''He's more likable in many ways than Clinton, though less charming,'' observed Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who is considering a 2012 presidential bid.
As a result, Mr. Gingrich said, Republicans' success now turns on demonstrating that their different approach to government's role will make America more prosperous. House Republicans call it a ''cut and grow'' approach to reducing spending and fostering private sector growth.
Mr. Weber worries that, in pushing to cut federal programs and roll back Mr. Obama's health policy, Republicans risk ceding the high ground for future-oriented optimism that conservatives like Mr. Reagan and Jack Kemp once commanded. Mr. Obama sounded that note over the weekend by declaring, ''We can outcompete any other nation.''
A second challenge, for a party fueled by energy from the right, is fashioning a coherent appeal to hold the political center. The Republican ad-maker Kim Alfano, who advises Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, a potential 2012 presidential candidate, said the key was ''reasonable, rational'' voices, rather than more boisterous conservatives who strike mainstream voters as ''kooky.''
Republican leaders heeded such advice in selecting their chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, to respond to the State of the Union. But Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a Tea Party favorite, plans to deliver her own response as well.
A final challenge is overcoming an incumbent's power to thrive simply by performing competently. There is little reason to expect Mr. Obama to stumble in Tuesday's spotlight, especially after he met the moment in Tucson.
''He didn't blow it,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''That's why presidents are hard to beat.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Still Fighting Russia, This Time With Words

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
TBILISI, Georgia -- The new teacher who arrived recently at School No. 161 could barely speak a word of the Georgian language, knew little about local customs and easily got lost in the crazy-quilt streets of this hilly capital. But she was at the forefront of one of the most notable educational initiatives -- if not social experiments -- being attempted in the former Soviet Union.
When the teacher, Deborah Cruz, walked into a classroom of squirmy teenagers, they grew rapt. Here was a stranger who would help connect them to the rest of the world, one irregular verb tense at a time. 
Ms. Cruz, who is from the Seattle area, is part of a brigade of native English speakers recruited by Georgia's government to spur a linguistic revolution. The goal is to make Georgia a country where English is as common as in Sweden -- and in the process to supplant Russian as the dominant second language.
''What we are doing is really something groundbreaking,'' Ms. Cruz, 58, said after leading her class in a form of tick-tack-toe on the blackboard, with students devising a sentence to fill in a box.
One of her students, Tekla Iordanishvili, 15, chimed in, ''English is the international language, and we need it.''
The government has already lured 1,000 English speakers to Georgia, and by September, hopes to have another 500 in place so that every school in the country has at least one. Under the program, which resembles both the Peace Corps and the Teach for America program, the teachers live rent-free with Georgian families and receive a stipend of about $275 a month.
The initiative to embed these foreigners across Georgia reflects the ambitions of its Western-leaning president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who speaks excellent English and studied law at Columbia University. Since taking office after an uprising in 2003, Mr. Saakashvili has worked to wrench Georgia out of Moscow's orbit and move it closer to the United States -- so determined is his effort that it was a factor in the 2008 war between Georgia and Russia.
During the Soviet era, the Communists used the Russian language to bind the nation's far-flung regions, requiring it as the second -- and sometimes primary -- language from Estonia to Uzbekistan. But since the Soviet Union collapsed two decades ago, many of the former Soviet republics have elevated their own languages and marginalized Russian in order to bolster their independence and national identities.
The Kremlin is highly sensitive to the status of Russian, viewing it as a kind of barometer of its influence.
The turnabout is stark in Georgia, whose cultural ties to Russia extend back centuries. Many Georgians older than 40 readily speak Russian, while the young people who have come of age under Mr. Saakashvili are often more interested in English. The government is intent on hastening that trend.
Dimitri Shashkini, the minister of education and science, said in an interview that Georgia, which has 4.6 million people, would prosper economically only by significantly improving its educational system. Ensuring that every child knows English is a major part of that objective, he said.
''Georgia doesn't have natural gas or oil,'' Mr. Shashkini said. ''The resource that we have is our human intellectual potential. So we need to use that potential as much as possible.''
Mr. Shashkini said the government was not doing away with Russian classes, but rather making them as optional as French or German. In general, English is now mandatory.
He pointed out that teachers from the United States, Canada and other English-speaking countries were also serving as cultural ambassadors in a society that is still often saddled with Soviet-era mores. The teachers not only instruct students and assist local English teachers, but also start English clubs and interact with parents.
The Georgian government has studied English language initiatives elsewhere, including in South Korea, and is working with a company, Footprints Recruiting, of Vancouver, British Columbia, that specializes in finding native English speakers for such programs around the world.
The one in Georgia has stirred complaints among old-guard Russian speakers, who maintain that whatever the country's political orientation, it cannot escape its geography or history.
Still, many of the English teachers said they were heartened by the initial response to their efforts.
''To say that children were extremely excited to meet me is a gross understatement,'' Meg Bell, 23, who is from the Dallas area, wrote in an e-mail. ''Other teacher friends that I've spoken with had similar experiences upon first entering their schools. An atmosphere of near Beatlemania hysteria broke out for about a week or so. Kids wanted me to autograph their arms.''
But some expressed frustration with the educational system in Georgia, which remains a relatively poor country. As in much of the developing world, the local English teachers sometimes do not speak competent English. Children are told to memorize lists of words and are engaged in little if any conversation. Teenagers who have been in English classes for years cannot utter a sentence.
Some of the new teachers, assigned to village schools with crumbling classrooms and few textbooks, questioned the Georgian government's emphasis on English.
''It's like buying an espresso machine before you've built a kitchen,'' said James Norton, 23, from Boulder, Colo.
''There are so many obstacles preventing this cadre of foreign teachers from doing their jobs effectively,'' Mr. Norton said by e-mail. ''I often wonder whether the government would be better off focusing on fundamentals first -- buying books for all students, training teachers in modern techniques (as opposed to the translation-and-memorization doctrine which is currently rampant), paying Georgian teachers a living wage, better accountability metrics, etc.''
He stressed that despite his misgivings, he was pleased with his time in Georgia, had no regrets, and believed that he was enriching his students. Others agreed.
Ms. Cruz, who worked in the fall at a school in Batumi on the Black Sea, recalled that when she started, the children seemed bored. Their previous English teachers had never engaged the students in conversation.
''By the time I left, they were speaking English in the classroom, and the teachers were excited about it because they saw the transformation,'' Ms. Cruz said. ''So this will continue when I am not here anymore. To me, that is more important than anything -- this is not temporary.''

HEADLINE: While House Is Abuzz, Senate Hits Snooze Button

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In its first few weeks of official business this year, the House of Representatives voted to undo President Obama's health care overhaul, pondered cuts to large swaths of the government and stood silently beneath flags flying at half-staff to honor a fallen Congressional aide and his critically wounded boss.
Over on the Senate side of Capitol Hill, an infant could have slept on the floor. 
The Senate has been largely silent, unless one counts press releases dispatched from a member's home state praising this or denouncing that. The office of the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, issued a supremely succinct one, concerning the likelihood that Senate Republicans would get the votes needed to pass the House bill to repeal the health care law: ''Unlikely.''
Congress has two chambers, and each body works at its own pace and rhythms, contingent on election cycles, changes in party control and other factors. Sometimes the House is frenzied with business, as it was in parts of 2010; at other times, most notably in last year's lame-duck session, it is the Senate that moves legislative mountains.
But there is something particularly jarring, days before President Obama addresses Congress and as Republicans and Democrats blame one another for the stubborn unemployment rate, in the contrast between a House that is busy and energized and a Senate whose members have been scattered at school visits, foreign country delegation trips or undisclosed locations for the better part of five weeks.
''While Americans are worried about where their next paycheck is coming from, the optics are bad,'' said Julian E. Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University. ''Americans want Congress to be doing something.''
Of course, there are many ways to be doing something, and members of the Senate have not, for the most part, been lounging on sandy beaches. A few, like Mr. Reid, have returned to the Capitol for discreet bits of business, like meeting last week with the Chinese president. Others have been on foreign trips known as Codels (for Congressional delegations), which range in seriousness from examinations of nuclear threats to out-and-out junkets.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, went with six Republican Senate colleagues to Afghanistan and Pakistan to visit with troops. Some lawmakers said they had chatted on the phone about proposed changes to the Senate filibuster rule. Senator Dianne Feinstein had knee surgery.
But outside of the day members were sworn in -- Jan. 5 -- the Senate has not been in session since a few days before Christmas, when there was a swarm of activity, including the last-minute passage of, among other items, an anti-nuclear-proliferation treaty with Russia.
While the chamber had planned to take only a one-week break this month, it was extended to compensate for the lengthy lame-duck session in 2010, said Jon Summers, a spokesman for Mr. Reid.
''Senator Reid did work a lot,'' Mr. Summers said, adding that the absence of a quorum was not akin to the absence of accomplishment. ''A lot of other members did do work in their states. There were committee assignments to make, negotiating on the filibuster, making calls and having meetings.''
There may also have been strategic reasons to stay home. ''The shift in control of the House gives impetus to that chamber to start making many proposals and to showing voters they are serious about change,'' Professor Zelizer said. ''The Senate has less incentive to engage in such frenetic activity.''
''Furthermore,'' he said, ''they have a political incentive to wait to see how the House acts, where they are successful and where they seem to be overreaching, and whether Obama's poll numbers continue to rise. All this will impact what kind of votes to take.''
Meeting with constituents, especially in friendly settings like schools, ribbon-cuttings and the like, can be a balm from the world of divided government that awaits.
Is Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat, excited to get back to Washington from her home in Louisiana? ''Actually I was excited to leave,'' she said Friday in a telephone interview, noting that she had just spent an enjoyable day with the National Guard. ''But I am looking forward to getting back and doing things,'' she added.
Senator Joe Manchin III, a Democrat, drove about 1,800 miles, visited 11 counties and held nearly three dozen events in West Virginia, said his spokeswoman, Emily Bittner. ''He loves being with the people of West Virginia,'' Ms. Bittner said. ''He has only been a senator since Nov. 15, so he just wants to hear where West Virginians are on all of these issues.''
No one on the House side, where disdain for the meandering pace of the Senate has always crossed party boundaries, seems particularly surprised by the recent hiatus.
''Such was the intent of the Founders,'' said Brad Dayspring, the spokesman for Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the new House majority leader. He then added, somewhat reflexively and almost certainly overly optimistically, ''We just hope that when the Senate is in session, Leader Reid will allow the repeal of Obamacare and spending cuts passed by the House to have an up-or-down vote.''
But perhaps the Senate would be wise to watch its back. In 1911, the first Socialist member of the House, Representative Victor Berger of Wisconsin, introduced a resolution to abolish the Senate, claiming that it ''has become an obstructive and useless body, a menace to the liberties of the people and an obstacle to social growth.''
In remarks on the House floor during the health care debate last week, Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, suggested that a similar move should be in the offing this year.

HEADLINE: The Understudy Takes the Stage

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT; Steve Lohr contributed reporting.

 BODY:
On an 18-hour flight from California to Singapore a few years ago, Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief operating officer, had little time for small talk with a colleague. Glued to his business class seat, Mr. Cook had his nose in spreadsheets, preparing for a thorough review of Apple's Asian operations.
The two landed at 6 a.m., took time to shower and headed into a meeting with Apple's local executives. Twelve hours later, and well past dinnertime, the local executives were ready to call it quits.
''They were absolutely exhausted,'' said Michael Janes, the Apple executive who accompanied Mr. Cook. ''Tim was not. He was ready to jump to the next slide and the next slide after that. He is absolutely relentless.'' 
That relentlessness could be indispensable in the months ahead, because Mr. Cook may be tested as never before. He has been charged with running Apple's day-to-day operations while his boss, Steven P. Jobs, the company's visionary chief executive, is on medical leave.
Mr. Cook has done that twice before, briefly and successfully. Yet if Mr. Jobs's health does not improve, Mr. Cook could be on the job for a long time. And while Apple's succession plans are closely guarded, Mr. Cook is widely believed to be the most likely candidate to permanently replace Mr. Jobs.
In Silicon Valley, Mr. Jobs is also known for relentlessness. Yet on many levels, he and Mr. Cook are opposites. While Mr. Jobs is mercurial and prone to outbursts, Mr. Cook, who was raised in a small town in Alabama, is polite and soft-spoken. He is often described as a ''Southern gentleman.'' While Mr. Jobs obsesses over every last detail of Apple's products, Mr. Cook obsesses over the less glamorous minutiae of Apple's operations.
Their complementary skills have helped Apple pull off the most remarkable turnaround in American business, and made it the world's most valuable technology company. When Mr. Cook is on his own, he will have to compensate for the absence of Mr. Jobs -- and his inventiveness, charisma and uncanny ability to predict the future of technology and anticipate the wishes of consumers.
''He is going to have to look to others to provide the creative vacuum left by Steve,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford Bernstein & Company.
Mr. Cook and Apple declined to comment for this article. From his first days at Apple in 1998, Mr. Cook, who is known as intensely private, worked in the shadow of Mr. Jobs and other prominent leaders. Although his job -- making sure Apple could produce, assemble and ship its breakthrough products around the world, and do so profitably -- was not considered sexy, he quickly removed inefficiencies from Apple's supply chain.
''My favorite scenes were meeting suppliers,'' said a former Apple executive who had traveled with Mr. Cook frequently and asked to remain anonymous because he did not want to upset their relationship. ''He is Mr. Spreadsheet. If things weren't right, he would torture the suppliers and demand improvement. At the same time, he had good relationships with them.''
Apple was smaller then and largely focused on making PCs. Its operations were a mess.
Apple was still running its own factories in California, Ireland and Singapore. While more profitable and efficient companies like Dell had moved to a just-in-time manufacturing model, Apple still held 90 days of inventory.
Mr. Cook closed Apple's factories and outsourced all manufacturing to a far-flung network of suppliers in Asia. Inventories decreased to 60 days, then to 30 days, then to the just-in-time model. Mr. Cook virtually lived in airplanes, traveling the world to meet with suppliers and browbeat them into meeting his demands.
Analysts and investors say Mr. Cook's efforts on the production end made the difference in turning Apple's fortunes around. And they still are critical to the company's success.
Take the iPad. It took Mr. Jobs's imagination and the expertise of his engineers and designers to create it. But Mr. Cook's operational abilities allowed Apple to parlay a cool product into a business that has already brought in $9.6 billion, as the company built and shipped worldwide nearly 15 million iPads in just nine months to meet customers' seemingly insatiable appetite.
''The ability to ramp up something like that is incredible, and that's largely Tim's doing,'' Mr. Sacconaghi said. As Mr. Cook delivered results, he earned more respect from Mr. Jobs. More important, because he was focused on areas that Mr. Jobs knew little about, he rarely butted heads with him, former Apple executives said.
Mr. Cook eventually took on oversight of Apple's sales and of its Macintosh division. In 2007, he became chief operating officer, and two years later, he stepped in to run Apple when Mr. Jobs went on medical leave for nearly six months. During that time, he improved the company's financial performance in the middle of an economic downturn.
He also took over for Mr. Jobs briefly in 2004, when the chief executive had surgery for pancreatic cancer.
Mr. Cook received a degree in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982. There, too, he had a reputation for his focus. ''He was a very quiet, unassuming individual and very, very intense,'' said Saeed Maghsoodloo, an emeritus professor of industrial and systems engineering at Auburn. ''I hardly ever saw him asking questions. He sat quietly and studied.''
In 1999, Mr. Cook told Auburn's alumni magazine that he ended up in the computer industry by accident. At a campus event during his senior year, Mr. Cook was nominated to be the ''outstanding engineering graduate.'' After the meeting, a recruiter from I.B.M. who was present persuaded him to join the computer giant.
At I.B.M., Mr. Cook was soon placed on the ''high-potential list,'' for promising young managers, said Ray Mays, a former boss. In a dozen years at I.B.M., Mr. Cook quickly rose through the ranks.
''Tim was the first to work, the last to leave and the smartest guy around the conference table,'' said Mr. Mays, who was a senior manufacturing manager. While at I.B.M., Mr. Cook completed a master's in business administration at Duke.
Mr. Cook left I.B.M. for Intelligent Electronics, an electronics distributor, and in 1997 took a job at Compaq, the computer maker. Six months later, an executive recruiter suggested that he meet Mr. Jobs. Mr. Cook agreed, even though his friends told him he would be crazy to leave Compaq for Apple, which was considered a basket case.
But Mr. Jobs's charisma and salesmanship proved irresistible.
''Not more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution to the wind and join Apple,'' Mr. Cook said last year during a commencement speech at Auburn.
At 50, Mr. Cook is single and is known for his serious demeanor. Several former Apple colleagues said he rarely socialized with them. His major passion outside of Apple is Auburn football. Former colleagues also described him as a fitness enthusiast who seems to live on energy bars. He is a hiker and a cyclist, who frequently gets up at 5 a.m. to exercise -- and to begin e-mailing his underlings.
''Tim, like Steve, is like a metronome who sets the pace for the rest of Apple,'' said Mr. Janes, who worked for Mr. Cook for five years and now is chief executive of FanSnap, a ticket comparison shopping Web site. At Apple, Mr. Cook has earned $156.2 million, including salary, bonuses and gains from stock awards, according to Equilar, a company that analyzes executive compensation. In addition, he holds Apple stock valued at about $140 million, Equilar said.
''Without Steve, Apple will be a different company,'' a former Apple executive said. ''But Tim knows what he knows and what he doesn't know, and will trust other guys to do a good job.''
The executive added, ''He will not be the visionary, but that's O.K. because there are other talented people around him.''

HEADLINE: Expanded List of Problems Awaits Leaders at Davos

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Leaders in business, politics and academia from around the world will gather in Davos, Switzerland, this week to try to rescue the planet. It's a safe bet that, for the 41st year in a row, they will fail.
Even if it were possible to save the world in five days, the list of global problems just keeps getting longer -- to the point where Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, is worried. 
''I am concerned that governments and international organizations can no longer cope with the capacity and fast pace of this new reality,'' Mr. Schwab said.
The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report, published this month, identified 37 major things to lose sleep over, one more than last year. The list included obvious risks like climate change, geopolitical conflict and government debt, and a few less obvious ones, including migration and new technologies.
But just last year, for all the talk of crisis prevention, participants at the forum missed what proved to be the big economic story of 2010 -- Europe's sovereign debt crisis. While Greece's fiscal problems were already becoming clear, Prime Minister George A. Papandreou assured one session last January that the government would get its debt under control.
There was no sense that the common currency itself would be in danger.
Indeed, the perennial criticism of Davos is that it is more talk and partying than action. Partly in response, the agenda this year is focused more directly on finding solutions to global threats like scarce credit or chronic disease or, better still, preventing them in the first place.
''We must transition from a firefighting mode to one of risk prevention,'' Mr. Schwab said by e-mail. ''Otherwise the world will be caught in a downward spiral of crisis management.''
The 2,500 people expected to converge on Davos, a onetime mountaintop refuge for tuberculosis patients, can still attend sessions with titles like ''Music for Social Change.'' They will be able to hear Chesley B. Sullenberger III, the pilot who landed a crippled passenger jet on the Hudson River in 2009, talk about leadership under pressure.But the emphasis is on more concrete themes, like the war on corruption or reshaping the United States economy.
Measuring the actual effect that the gathering has on the fate of the world is always tricky. Organizers and participants portray the event as a place where business executives and government leaders check their entourages at the door and are exposed to ideas and people they would not encounter elsewhere.
''Davos should not try, and it does not try, to be too specific,'' said Nikolaus von Bomhard, chief executive of Munich Re, a German insurance group. ''The beauty of Davos is that you try to connect the big points.''
About 1,400 business executives, who often pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to attend, will mingle with university professors, leaders of nonprofit groups, artists and government officials, including 35 heads of state.
Among the top officials will be Dmitri A. Medvedev, the president of Russia, who will deliver the opening address, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, who made headlines last year by calling for an end to the dollar's role as the world's primary reserve currency.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and President Jacob G. Zuma of South Africa are also scheduled to attend. So far, the most important American official on the roster is Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary.
As usual, much of the action will take place outside the newly renovated Davos Congress Center, the official site.
In hotel rooms and restaurants, the business elite will mingle and make deals; many will barely set foot in the Congress Center. Paul Achleitner, chief financial officer of the German insurer Allianz, who will be attending the World Economic Forum for the 15th time (and makes it a point to attend some panels that do not have business themes), calls it ''speed dating for managers.''
Representatives of industries and interest groups will also hold official meetings behind closed doors at the Congress Center under the auspices of the forum. Last year, for example, bankers met with top regulators, central bankers and political leaders to discuss rules to prevent future financial crises.
But there was little agreement, and the meetings did not appear to have much effect on new regulations that were endorsed later in the year by the United States Congress and the Group of 20 nations.
''I think regulators in Davos last year did not think the financial services industry was contrite, but on the contrary was focusing on business as usual,'' said Mr. Achleitner, who attended the sessions. ''Therefore they just continued to do their thing.''
Even if the forum's achievements fall short of its lofty goals, the event remains popular and prestigious. While undoubtedly elitist, it also allows leaders from developing regions to mingle with the Western establishment.
Representatives of China, India and other emerging nations are an ever bigger presence. This year, three of the six official co-chairmen of the Davos event are from Asia, compared with one last year. Indian companies and business groups seem determined to dominate the after-hours scene, with a seemingly endless series of Bollywood-themed parties and other revelry.
Ruben Vardanian, chief executive of Troika Dialog, an investment bank based in Moscow, said that Davos offered a place where people from emerging markets could meet on equal terms with counterparts from the United States and Europe.
''We didn't go to the same universities, we are not members of the same golf clubs,'' Mr. Vardanian said, explaining why Davos was still relevant. ''For me, being head of the bank and trying to connect Russia to the Western world, it's one of the best platforms.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Alternative Fuels Don't Benefit the Military, a RAND Report Says

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
The United States would derive no meaningful military benefit from increased use of alternative fuels to power its jets, ships and other weapons systems, according to a government-commissioned study by the RAND Corporation scheduled for release Tuesday.
The report also argued that most alternative-fuel technologies were unproven, too expensive or too far from commercial scale to meet the military's needs over the next decade.
In particular, the report argued that the Defense Department was spending too much time and money exploring experimental biofuels derived from sources like algae or the flowering plant camelina, and that more focus should be placed on energy efficiency as a way of combating greenhouse gas emissions.
The report urged Congress to reconsider the military's budget for alternative-fuel projects. But if such fuels are to be pursued, the report concluded, the most economic, environmentally sound and near-term candidate would be a liquid fuel produced using a combination of coal and biomass, as well as some method for capturing and storing carbon emissions released during production. 
The findings by the nonprofit research group, which grew out of a directive in the 2009 Defense Authorization Act calling for further study of alternative fuels in military vehicles and aircraft, are likely to provoke much debate in Washington.
The Obama administration has directed billions of dollars to support emerging clean-energy technologies even as Congress has been unwilling to pass any sort of climate or renewable energy legislation.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon is seeking to improve the military's efficiency and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels over the coming decade, devoting $300 million in economic stimulus financing and other research money toward those goals.
RAND's conclusions drew swift criticism from some branches of the military -- particularly the Navy, which has been leading the foray into advanced algae-based fuels.
''Unfortunately, we were not engaged by the authors of this report,'' said Thomas W. Hicks, deputy assistant secretary of energy for the Navy. ''We don't believe they adequately engaged the market,'' he said, adding, ''This is not up to RAND's standards.''
The analysis has also irked environmental groups and biofuels proponents, who argued that RAND had underestimated the commercial viability of algae and overestimated the availability and efficacy of carbon capture and storage technology.
The Air Force is engaged in extensive testing of biofuel blends in its aircraft, and the Navy received 20,000 gallons of algae-based fuel for testing and certification from the California company Solazyme last summer. Solazyme signed a contract with the Defense Department to deliver another 150,000 gallons this year.
Proponents of these endeavors argue that the military, with its substantial buying power, can help spur the expansion of renewable fuel markets into the civilian sphere.
''This would not be the first example of a military-driven research project where the civilian benefit far outweighs the military benefit,'' said Paul Winters, a spokesman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington. ''Witness the Internet,'' he said.
Mr. Hicks of the Navy also took issue with the notion that there was no military benefit to the pursuit of oil alternatives.
''We are doing this because there are energy security issues at play,'' he said. ''Every barrel of oil we can replace with something that's produced domestically, the better we are as a nation, and the more secure and more independent we are.''
In the report, however, James T. Bartis, a senior policy researcher at RAND and the lead author of the analysis, argued that while the military consumes substantial amounts of liquid fuels -- about 340,000 barrels each day -- this accounts for less than 2 percent of the nation's total use, which is estimated to be 19 million barrels a day.
As such, the greenhouse-gas benefits arising from the military's efforts along these lines are likely to be minuscule. The authors argued that both the Defense Department and Congress should ''reconsider whether defense appropriations should continue to support the development of advanced alternative fuel technologies.''
Further, the report said that the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 required that any alternative and synthetic fuels bought by federal agencies for ''mobility-related use'' must have lower greenhouse gas emissions -- or at least no greater -- than those of conventional fuels.
The full life-cycle emissions of many plant-based fuel alternatives are still not fully understood, Mr. Bartis argued -- particularly the degree to which they cause, directly or indirectly, changes in land use around the globe.
Alternative fuels made from plants also compete with food crops for land. Producing just 200,000 barrels of such fuels a day -- or about 1 percent of total oil consumption in the United States -- would require an area ''equal to about 10 percent of the croplands currently under cultivation in the United States,'' Mr. Bartis said.
The most promising alternative fuels, according to the report, are those derived from what is known as the Fischer-Tropsch process, a method developed almost a century ago by Germany for turning coal into a liquid fuel. The method is still in limited use in a handful of countries, and it can be used with a variety of feedstocks -- coal, natural gas, even biomass.
The conversion process, however, is extremely energy-intensive, and when coal is used, it produces vast amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide -- far more than conventional fuels.
But a blend of coal and sustainably produced biomass as feedstocks, combined with carbon-capture technology, could be a viable low-carbon alternative, the report said.
Meanwhile, other advanced fuels like those derived from algae are far from commercially ready, RAND said. ''Large investments in research and development will be required before confident estimates can be made regarding production costs and environmental impacts,'' the authors said.
RAND's findings rankled industry and environmental groups.
Brian Siu, a policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he was still analyzing the report, but he called coal-based fuels a nonstarter. ''Any liquid coal deployment would increase coal mining beyond today's levels,'' he said. ''That would drive more mountaintop removal, groundwater contamination, biodiversity loss and other mining impacts.''
In an e-mail, Mary Rosenthal, the executive director of the Algal Biomass Organization, a trade group, said the report's characterization of algae as a mere research topic was ''both demeaning and patently false.''
''We have more than 100 companies, academic institutions and national laboratories working to develop the algae-to-fuels industry,'' she said. ''We believe algae commercialization is far closer than RAND suggests.''

HEADLINE: Caution, Not Euphoria, Over the Recovery

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
A year ago, the economy looked as if it were speeding down the runway, only to stall out in the spring.
Now tentative signs of a pickup are emerging across the country again. Factory production, retail sales and existing-home sales are rising, while unemployment claims are trending down. Companies like General Motors and Macy's have recently announced hiring plans, and bank lending to businesses is starting to expand. Investor sentiment is strengthening, as major stock market indexes climb to their highest levels since mid-2008.
This time, though, economists and business leaders are more measured in their optimism about the recovery. Growth is real, they say, though they remain unconvinced it will accelerate all that much.
As President Obama prepares to tackle the economy in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, economists and industry executives are likewise sifting through the data. 
The darkest clouds that marred the economic landscape last summer and fall have indeed lifted, but expectations have also been reined in. Many of the factors that have restrained growth, including heavy household debt and strained state and local budgets, remain. Parts of Europe are still unstable, and higher food and energy prices could crimp household spending. The construction industry has not yet staged a comeback.
The unemployment rate, stubbornly high at 9.4 percent, could climb higher as more people who stopped looking for work return to the job search. And few see enough jobs being created over the next year to help more than a small portion of the eight million people who lost work during the recession.
So even if the economy is picking up steam, and the president is hoping to ride its momentum, making a significant dent in joblessness will probably remain frustratingly difficult for him and his new economic advisers.
''It's really a muddle-through economy,'' said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for the investment firm Gluskin Sheff & Associates.
Part of what has changed is simply a growing belief that unlike in previous recoveries, the economy will not suddenly ignite.
''After a normal recession, once the economy starts growing again, within six months, you're back to where you started,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor at Harvard and co-author, with Carmen M. Reinhart, of ''This Time Is Different,'' a history of financial crises. ''We're still just crawling back to where we started.'' He added, ''It's going to take a few more years, really, before we're back at whatever normal is.''
One reason that hope was crushed last spring was that debt crises in Europe's weak countries destabilized the stock markets, in turn unnerving consumers. And when fiscal stimulus measures expired, like the tax credit for first-time homebuyers, the housing market sagged.
Unlike last year, hardly anyone is expecting skyrocketing growth in coming months. Industry leaders instead talk of stable improvement.
''We don't expect a big upswing in sales,'' said Tom Henderson, a spokesman for General Motors. ''It's just slow and steady, which is tracking along what we're seeing in the economy.''
The automaker announced on Monday that it was beginning a third shift at its pickup truck assembly plant in Flint, adding 750 jobs. Most of those slots will be filled by people who were laid off in recent years.
Overall sales are starting to improve, and bank lending to businesses rose in the fourth quarter of last year for the first time since the end of 2008, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics.
Small businesses -- which represented about two-thirds of job growth in the last recovery -- are still cautious.
''It's not that sales haven't been improving, but it's improving from a really horrible level of a year ago,'' said William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. ''We still haven't got Main Street firing on many pistons.''
Some small businesses are having trouble getting bank loans because they do not have the collateral. Ami Kassar, chief executive of MultiFunding, a small-business lending broker in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., said that many of his clients had seen the values of their homes, office buildings and warehouses fall so much that banks would not accept them as security.
Mr. Kassar said that when his clients did procure loans, they often used the money to cover payrolls rather than to hire new workers, in part because many of their largest customers were taking longer to pay their bills.
Other small businesses are concerned about what they view as onerous regulation. Jason W. Speer, vice president of Quality Float Works, a small manufacturer of parts that are used in valves and pumps in the agricultural and oil industries, said the company hired six people last year, after letting four workers go during the recession. Mr. Speer said the company, in Schaumburg, Ill., northwest of Chicago, was ready to hire two more people, but was hesitating in part because of fear of new regulations and the burden of increased corporate taxes in Illinois.
''Every little bit helps or hurts in a small company,'' said Mr. Speer. ''There's a lot of agencies now that are coming out with new rulings and regulations, and it's hard to keep up with that. So instead of hiring or giving bonuses or buying new equipment, we're paying to cover us for regulation issues.''
President Obama recently announced plans to initiate a governmentwide review of corporate regulation, vowing to ''remove outdated regulations that stifle job creation.''
That measure, along with the one-year cut in the payroll tax, could spur consumer and business spending, said Mr. Dunkelberg. Time, too, tends to generate spending, as washing machines, boilers, industrial machinery and cars eventually wear out.
Mr. Henderson of G.M. said that part of the reason the company was adding a shift in Flint was that it had seen a surge in demand from small businesses like heating and air-conditioning companies, plumbers and carpenters who were buying trucks and vans. ''In the fourth quarter, our sales to this segment were up 36 percent,'' he said.
Another sign of hope is in the jobs data. Last year, job growth was relatively strong in the first quarter as measured by the government, but other indicators -- like the number of people filing for unemployment insurance each week and surveys of business hiring intentions -- were still weak. Now, the average weekly jobless claims have fallen and several key surveys have indicated that companies are planning to hire this year.
''There is supporting evidence that the market has turned decisively,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc. ''If you look at all the evidence that surrounds the labor market, it's pretty compelling that we're on the cusp of further improvements here.''
Another encouraging sign is that federally withheld employment taxes have been rising, according to an analysis of Treasury Department data by James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global.
Once hiring picks up, it feeds many corners of the economy, including housing. As people get jobs, Mr. O'Sullivan said, they move out of their parents' homes or split with roommates and rent new apartments. Eventually, some of them will start buying homes.
At Toll Brothers, a higher-end home builder, the chief executive, Douglas C. Yearley Jr., hesitates to predict robust growth after disappointment last year. ''I think we're just more guarded,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Raising False Alarms

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
If there's a better government program than Social Security, I'd like to know what it is.
It has gone a long way toward eliminating poverty among the elderly. Great numbers of them used to live and die in ghastly, Dickensian conditions of extreme want. Without Social Security today, nearly half of all Americans aged 65 or older would be poor. With it, fewer than 10 percent live in poverty.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tells us that close to 90 percent of people 65 and older get at least some of their family income from Social Security. For more than half of the elderly, it provides the majority of their income. For many, it is the only income they have. 
When you see surveillance videos of some creep mugging an elderly person in an elevator or apartment lobby, the universal reaction is outrage. But when the fat cats and the ideologues want to hack away at the lifeline of Social Security, they are treated somehow as respectable, even enlightened members of the society.
We need a reality check. Attacking Social Security is both cruel and unnecessary. It needs to stop.
The demagogues would have the public believe that Social Security is unsustainable, that it is some kind of giant contributor to the federal budget deficits. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the Economic Policy Institute has explained, Social Security ''is emphatically not the cause of the federal government's long-term deficits, since it is prohibited from borrowing and must pay all benefits out of dedicated tax revenues and savings in its trust funds.''
Franklin Roosevelt couldn't have been clearer about the crucial role of the payroll taxes used to finance Social Security. They gave the beneficiaries a ''legal, moral and political right'' to collect their benefits, he said. ''With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program.''
There has always been feverish opposition on the right to Social Security. What is happening now, in a period of deficit hysteria, is that this crucial retirement program is being dishonestly lumped together with Medicare as an entitlement program that is driving federal deficits. Medicare costs are a serious problem, but that's because of the nightmarish expansion of health care costs in general.
Beyond Medicare, the major drivers of the deficits are not talked about so much by the fat cats and demagogues because they were either responsible for them, or are reaping gargantuan benefits from them, or both. The country is drowning in a sea of debt because of the obscene Bush tax cuts for the rich, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that have never been paid for and the Great Recession.
Mugging the nation's grandparents by depriving them of some of their modest, hard-earned Social Security retirement benefits is hardly an answer to the nation's ills. And, believe me, those benefits are modest. The average benefit is just $14,000 a year, which is less than the minimum wage would pay. With employer-provided pensions going the way of the typewriter and pay telephones, the income from Social Security is becoming more precious by the day.
''If we didn't have Social Security, we'd have to invent it right now,'' said Roger Hickey, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future. ''It's perfectly suited to the terrible times we're going through. Hardly anyone has pensions anymore. People's private savings have taken a huge hit, and home prices have been hit hard. So the private savings that so many seniors and soon-to-be seniors have counted on have just been wiped out.
''Social Security is still there, and it's still paying out retirement benefits indexed to wages. It's the one part of the retirement stool that is working.''
The deficit hawks and the right-wingers can scream all they want, but there is no Social Security crisis. There is a foreseeable problem with the program's long-term financing, but it can be fixed with changes that do no harm to its elderly beneficiaries. One obvious step would be to raise the cap on payroll taxes so that wealthy earners shoulder a fairer share of the burden.
The alarmist rhetoric should cease. Americans have enough economic problems to worry about without being petrified that their Social Security benefits will be curtailed. A Gallup poll taken recently found that 90 percent of Americans ages 44 to 75 believed that the country was facing a retirement crisis. Nearly two-thirds were more fearful of depleting their assets than they were of dying. The fears about retirement are well placed -- most Americans do not have enough to retire on. But there should be no reason to believe that Social Security is in jeopardy.
The folks who want to raise the retirement age and hack away at benefits for ordinary working Americans are inevitably those who have not the least worry about their own retirement. The haves so often get a perverse kick out of bullying the have-nots.

HEADLINE: The Bright Side Of Blight

BYLINE: By DIANA LIND.

Philadelphia
EVEN in Philadelphia, with its 40,000 vacant properties and a quarter of its population living below the poverty line, the Kensington neighborhood still shocks. On a frigid afternoon, a prostitute lingers in the shadow of the elevated train tracks, waiting restlessly for customers. Husks of long-closed factories stand amid thigh-high winter wheat. Streams of garbage flow down the streets, as if both the people and the city government had agreed to forsake the effort of propriety.
In recent months, this neighborhood has also been terrorized by a killer who choked and raped his victims in the area's ubiquitous abandoned houses and vacant lots. If only these deserted places could be charged as accomplices to the so-called Kensington Strangler's three murders and two sexual assaults, and for aiding and abetting the drug use and prostitution that have caused so many of the neighborhood's problems. But the empty lots with their discarded furniture and ghetto kudzu and the weather-beaten houses with boarded-up windows won't be going anywhere soon. 
It's been nearly 30 years since James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling published their broken windows theory, positing that the torn social fabric that allows for vandalism also encourages other kinds of crime and disinvestment in a neighborhood. The theory validated the inclination to improve the built environment first, in the hopes that once a sense of confidence has been restored other aspects of an engaged community will follow. And in places on the cusp of gentrification or economic recovery, like certain New York areas in the '90s, quality-of-life campaigns have been proven to clean up the streets and reduce crime.
Indeed, as gentrification has slowly crept northward in Philadelphia, Kensington residents have gained some hope from a newly branded arts corridor, a few rejuvenated parks and street improvements, all thanks to the efforts of an invaluable local community development corporation. But this scattershot approach has failed to create the kind of holistic change needed in this neighborhood -- or its counterparts in St. Louis, Cleveland, Detroit and Baltimore.
Many cities have also sought to transform undeveloped lots into green space and urban agriculture. It's a natural fit and, again, in Kensington a full city block has been converted from an industrial brownfield to an admirably active farm. But land-based strategies that try to reinvent this vacant lot or that blighted ground do little to stem the larger social trends that created the spatial problem in the first place.
Philadelphia, like many Rust Belt cities, was so deeply hurt by the loss of manufacturing that began in the 1950s that it has yet to recover. Gone were the jobs that even high-school dropouts could leverage to achieve stable lives, and with them went the housing stock. Today, we are left with a city where the number of jobs requiring postsecondary education has grown, while more than 60 percent of Philadelphia's adults read at a sixth grade level or below, creating a miserable mismatch that leaves both employers and the unemployed in need.
That's why any plan to mitigate the vacant property crisis must not only include innovative urban planning, but also try to restore employment opportunities. We need to literally build jobs on neglected and undeveloped land.
There are a number of organizations in Philadelphia that provide models for dealing with vacancy and joblessness as intertwined problems. For example, the Job Opportunity Investment Network, a public-private partnership, supports workforce training programs that have a hyperlocal impact.
One such program is the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which provides low-skill residents with intensive education and then matches graduates with jobs at the prestigious universities and medical centers within walking distance of their homes. While the jobs help people leave poverty behind, they ensure that the new wealth created remains in their neighborhoods, helping stabilize these downtrodden communities.
Roots to Re-Entry enrolls convicts in a horticulture vocational and life-skills training program that, upon their release, leads to landscaping jobs. Part of the training includes growing organic food that is donated to Philadelphia's neediest, showing how this work can nourish impoverished neighborhoods.
Such programs can teach residents the skills they need to reimagine the urban voids they encounter every day. Cities, in turn, should partner with neighborhood groups to determine the most suitable abandoned buildings and lots for development, luring companies and projects that would employ newly retrained residents.
Strategies that deal with vacant spaces by generating new paths to employment aim to do more than fixing broken windows ever could. They seek to change the dynamics of the local economy by creating better communities, not just prettier ones, where abandoned properties are viewed as job sites rather than crime scenes waiting to happen.

President Obama will be talking about economic growth and competitiveness in the State of the Union address Tuesday night. It will be interesting to see if he talks about it in the standard way or in a visionary way.
The conventional way would be fine -- expanding exports, reforming education, adjusting corporate tax rates to help firms compete. But it wouldn't really give the country what it hungers for. The country wants a more precise vision of what a thriving America is going to look like in the 21st century. It also wants Obama to define, once and for all, his vision of government's role.
A visionary speech might begin with the fact that America's position in the world is changing. In the 20th century, America was the Big Dog nation. We had more money, more resources and more skilled labor, and we could outcompete our rivals by dominating the inputs and the outputs -- by pouring in more talent, greater investments and more resources. 
In the 21st century, the U.S. will no longer be the Big Dog. Human capital will be more broadly dispersed. There will be an array of affluent nations fully engaged in the global economy. Therefore, competitiveness will be more about organizing relationships than amassing force. To thrive, America will have to be the crossroads nation where global talent congregates and collaborates.
Parents in middle-class nations around the world should want to send their kids to American colleges. Young strivers should dream of working in Hollywood or Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurs from Israel to Indonesia should be visiting venture-capital firms in San Francisco or capital markets in New York. Global engineers should want to learn the plastics techniques in Akron and retailers should learn branding and distribution in Bentonville and Park Slope.
In this century, economic competition between countries is less like the competition between armies or sports teams (with hermetically sealed units bashing or racing against each other). It's more like the competition between elite universities, who vie for prestige in a networked search for knowledge. It's less: ''We will crush you with our efficiency and might.'' It's more: ''We have the best talent and the best values, so if you want to make the most of your own capacities, you'll come join us.''
The new sort of competition is all about charisma. It's about gathering talent in one spot (in the information economy, geography matters more than ever because people are most creative when they collaborate face to face). This concentration of talent then attracts more talent, which creates more collaboration, which multiplies everybody's skills, which attracts more talent and so on.
The nation with the most diverse creative hot spots will dominate the century.
If this is the nature of competitiveness, what is the role for government? Well, government will be a bit like the administration of a university. A university president is nominally the head of the institutions. He or she lives in the big house. But everybody knows a university president is a powerful stagehand.
The professors, the researchers, the tutors, the coaches and the students are the real guts of a university. They handle the substance of what gets done. The administrators play vital but secondary roles. They build the settings. They raise money. They recruit and do marketing. They help students who are stumbling.
The administrators couldn't possibly understand or control the work in the physics or history departments. They just try to gather talent, set guidelines and create an atmosphere where brilliance can happen.
So it is with government in an innovation economy. Entrepreneurs, corporate executives, line workers and store managers handle the substance of the economy. Government tries to nurture settings where brilliance can happen.
First, government establishes an overall climate, with competitive tax rates and predictable regulations and fiscal balance. Tax rates don't have to be rock bottom. Companies will pay more if there are other amenities to compensate. But everything should be structured to nurture new business formation.
Then government actively concentrates talent. City governments are used to thinking in this way, while national governments lag. For example, Robert Steel, the deputy mayor of New York City, gave an excellent speech on Dec. 16 on how to build a bioscience center in Brooklyn and how to build an engineering center on Staten Island or Roosevelt Island. The speech was about using government to build hubs.
Finally, the government has to work aggressively to reduce the human capital inequalities that open up in an innovation economy. That means early and constant interventions so everybody has a chance to participate.
President Obama exists because his father was drawn to study in the United States. Obama embodies America's nascent role as the crossroads nation. Let's see if he can describe the next phase of American greatness.

HEADLINE: Revenue Rises On Card Use At American Express Co.

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The American Express Company, the credit card lender and payment network, said Monday that its fourth-quarter revenue grew 13 percent from the period a year earlier, as consumer spending increased and the company earned more from fees. 
The company said that it had $7.3 billion of total revenue net of interest expense in the quarter, compared with $6.5 billion a year earlier.
American Express narrowly missed analysts' expectations last week when it said it had earned $1.1 billion, or 88 cents a share, for the quarter. It also said it was cutting 550 customer service jobs.
The company said the increase in revenue resulted from an accounting change as well as increased spending on American Express cards.
The chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in the earnings statement that customers increased their spending on their cards by 15 percent in the quarter. The company also benefited from fewer losses on soured loans.
''Unemployment levels and housing remain a concern, but other aspects of the economy continue to show signs of improvement,'' he said.
American Express, which lends directly to consumers but also competes with Visa and MasterCard to process credit card transactions, has recovered from the financial crisis more fully than many other consumer lenders.
The company's shares closed down less than 1 percent at $45.79 on Monday, and fell about 1.1 percent in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: Profit Edges Up at McDonald's, and Its Prices Will, Too

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporationposted a 2.1 percent increase in fourth quarter profit on Monday and said it would raise prices this year to cover rising commodity costs.
McDonald's said it earned $1.24 billion, or $1.16 a share, in the quarter, up from $1.22 billion, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue, including sales from company-owned restaurants and royalties from franchisees and other fees, rose 4 percent, to $6.21 billion from $6.0 billion.
McDonald's said it expected its costs to rise 2 percent to 2.5 percent this year in the United States and 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in Europe.
The chief financial officer, Peter J. Bensen, said McDonald's would ''raise prices where it makes sense'' to offset some, but not all, of the cost increases. McDonald's did not give a commodity forecast for Asia and its other markets.
Diners around the world remain cautious with their spending on food away from home, and McDonald's will be careful not to turn customers off with higher prices, Mr. Bensen said.
McDonald's raised prices last year in China to offset an increase in commodity costs there. It also increased prices in Britain to cover a Jan. 1 value-added tax increase.
Analysts expect McDonald's to make smaller increases than many rivals because it uses its size to its advantage.
''They're large enough to put some pressure on their suppliers and they also will, through direct price increases or perhaps changing portion sizes, try to pass some of it on to consumers,'' said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer with OakBrook Investments.
McDonald's historically has been a strong performer in times of inflation. John Ivankoe, a J. P. Morgan analyst, said in a client note that McDonald's was ''the most insensitive to commodities'' from an earnings-per-share perspective.
Renovated stores, expanded value menus and new food items like lattes and smoothies appealed to diners and helped it increase its market share last quarter.
McDonald's said global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.7 percent overall in December. They gained 2.6 percent in the United States, slid 0.5 percent in Europe and rose 8.9 percent for the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa.
For January, the company expects global same-restaurant sales to increase 4 percent to 5 percent.

HEADLINE: In This Judge's Decisions, You Never Know Who Will Crop Up

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Many judges have been known to sprinkle their decisions with mentions of great minds like Jefferson or Shakespeare.
But when New York lawyers see rulings citing authorities like SpongeBob SquarePants, Laurel and Hardy, and Flip Wilson, some of them have come to recognize the unmistakable hand of a prolific, if unorthodox, judge who presides in Staten Island Civil Court: Philip S. Straniere.
In 14 years on the bench, Judge Straniere has built a following for entertaining judicial writing that tends to take some twists and turns. He has been known to opine for no obvious reason that Papa John's does not sell what New Yorkers call pizza and that Clark Kent ''was in fact only a person who understood the difference between right and wrong.''
Judge Straniere is the bard of the Staten Island courts, offering, in all manner of disputes, homespun advice, original lyrics, puns and, on occasion, withering sarcasm that can make a decision must-reading -- even if it seems highly unlikely to alter the course of American jurisprudence. 
After one lawyer suggested that a ruling of his was not adequately supported, he responded by footnoting every word in the first paragraph of a later decision, including ''a,'' ''the'' and ''two'' (''the cardinal number between one and three in the Arabic number system probably derived from Old English,'' according to Footnote 4).
During the recession, New York civil courts like Judge Straniere's have been especially busy because credit card companies sue there for past-due bills up to $25,000. A string of decisions that have included eye-rolling exasperation at the credit card companies has won him new followers.
Consumer lawyers passed around a ruling by him that described the ordeal of credit card customers who run afoul of company rules created in distant states. Credit card country, he wrote, is ''like the Land of Oz, run by a Wizard who no one has ever seen.''
Another favorite was one that said Citibank's logic in justifying astronomical interest rates would have impressed Vito Corleone, the godfather in ''The Godfather.''
But for Judge Straniere's longtime fans, his new followers are late to the party. Charles Apotheker, an acting State Supreme Court justice in Rockland County, said he had been following the oeuvre for years.
Whenever he comes across a Straniere ruling, Justice Apotheker said, ''I have to read it because I'm sure there will be some little twist or something that he wants to share that has very little to do with the decision.'' These rhetorical touches, Justice Apotheker said, set Judge Straniere apart from run-of-the-mill judges, who can be ''just generally boring.''
In his courtroom on Castleton Avenue, Judge Straniere sometimes offers a chuckle or a pun, as he did one day recently, his cheeks rosy behind his bushy white mustache. But it is at his desk in his cozy chambers that his creativity is truly unleashed.
His cases bring all kinds of things to mind, he said. Like Bartholomew Cubbins, the Dr. Seuss character; Old Yeller; and Mad Magazine, all of which he has found relevant to one issue or another. ''I have a mind that can remember all these ridiculous details,'' he said.
Still, there is no substitute for looking things up. Along with the usual legal treatises, he pointed out, he keeps other resources close at hand, including an impressive collection of Broadway cast recordings arranged alphabetically and several books of quotations. ''Will Rogers is a good source,'' he said.
Judge Straniere's opinions are exhaustively researched. One, in June, included references to ''The Music Man,'' ''The Miracle Worker,'' ''Oklahoma'' and ''Seinfeld.''
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Surrounded by baseball memorabilia, the judge described his decision-writing process. He will consider the case at hand. Sometimes, inspiration will strike. In the case of one Louis Raiolo v. B.A.C. Home Loans, for example, he sat down after a trial last fall that concerned the plaintiff's claims that the defendant had damaged his credit. The controversy included evidence that Mr. Raiolo had defaulted on mortgages for investment properties he had bought in Florida.
The man had been trying to live the American dream, the judge recalled thinking. Voila: He opened his decision with the words to ''The American Dream,'' a song from ''Miss Saigon.'' ''Come and get more than your share,'' the song says.
A lyric here, a legal precedent there and pretty soon he will have one of the hundreds of decisions he writes every year. ''Sometimes,'' he said, ''I'll think, 'This is really going someplace.' ''
For example, in the case of a movie studio sued by a landlord for rent due after a hopeful start to their business dealings he wrote: ''Respondents at this point believed life is beautiful and that they would soon be enjoying the sweet smell of success.'' The site ''on the waterfront'' had a ''rocky'' history before the landlord decided there was some ''monkey business'' and put a ''big chill,'' and their dreams went ''up in smoke,'' he continued.
Every line is not Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., though there are some similarities in the mustaches of the two judges. But ever since he got a laugh in the fourth-grade play in elementary school on Staten Island, Judge Straniere said, he has been hooked on humor.
Now 63, Judge Straniere was first elected to the bench in 1996, after years of private practice, some of it with his brother, Robert, a Republican who represented Staten Island in the Assembly for years. He is married with three grown children.
A graduate of Wagner College, on Staten Island, and New York University Law School, Judge Straniere decided early on that he would write a full decision in every case so that people would know why they won or lost, he said. He said his goal was to make his decisions understandable.
''If you refer to 'The Wizard of Oz,' everyone says, 'I understand that,' '' he said.
It is no accident that his rulings may be mistaken for performance art. He has long flirted with acting, working in summer stock as a young man and in community theater in more recent years. He played Nathan Detroit in ''Guys and Dolls.''
Traci Batiancela, his secretary, said: ''I think people who work for comedians don't laugh and smile as much as we do here.''
In the decision in which he cited ''Miss Saigon,'' for example, there was a quotation: ''This is another fine mess you've gotten me into.''
Again, not Oliver Wendell Holmes, as Footnote 10 made clear in clarifying the source: ''Oliver Hardy to Stanley Laurel on numerous occasions.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans to Add 750 Jobs at Pickup Truck Plant

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
FLINT, Mich. -- General Motors said on Monday that it would add 750 jobs so that it can increase production of pickup trucks, welcome news in this economically depressed city. 
G.M. will call back workers from its pool of about 3,000 employees nationwide who have been laid off from other plants, adding a third daily shift at the Flint plant, which builds heavy-duty versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. The news follows hiring announcements at several other G.M. plants and word this month from the Ford Motor Company about plans to add 7,000 jobs at its plants by the end of 2012.
''Less than two years ago, we didn't even know if we were going to have a company,'' Dana Rouse, the chairman of United Automobile Workers Local 598, which represents the plant's hourly employees.
G.M. plans to bring the workers to Flint in the second quarter, primarily from other parts of Michigan where plants have closed or shifts were eliminated as the company spiraled toward a bankruptcy filing in 2009.
The Flint plant currently has 2,100 hourly and salaried workers. Because analysts say automotive jobs generally support at least six other jobs in the surrounding area, the new hires could have a significant effect on Flint's unemployment rate, which was 12.5 percent in November.
Flint, a city of slightly more than 100,000 about an hour's drive northwest of Detroit, was once home to tens of thousands of G.M. jobs, but the company maintains only a small presence today.
Sales of pickup trucks rose 16 percent in the United States last year, as more businesses that had been waiting out the recession to replace older trucks resumed making big purchases.
G.M. said demand has surged, with sales of Chevrolet pickup trucks and other models to small businesses up 39 percent in November and 54 percent in December.
But Mark Reuss, the president of G.M.'s American operations, said the company would proceed cautiously in adding jobs, carefully monitoring demand to avoid having too much production capacity.
''The economy is still fragile,'' Mr. Reuss said.
Earlier Monday, G.M. said it sold 8.39 million vehicles worldwide in 2010, a 12.2 percent increase from what had been a miserable 2009. Its total was just shy of regaining the title of world's largest automaker from Toyota, which sold 8.42 million, or about 30,000 more than G.M.
Toyota outsold G.M. by 320,000 vehicles in 2009.
Mr. Reuss declined to say whether he thought G.M. could surpass Toyota this year but played down its importance.
''I'm concentrating on rebuilding what we've got here and putting workers back to work,'' he said.
For the first time ever last year, G.M. sold more vehicles in China than in the United States. G.M.'s China sales rose 29 percent to 2.35 million, versus 2.22 million, a 6 percent increase, in its home country.

HEADLINE: Oil Giants Need A Reorganization

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
Big oil companies could unlock big value for shareholders. But to do so they need to slaughter an industry sacred cow: the integration of the exploration and production business with refining and other activities. This model worked for decades but today accords a conglomerate discount to the likes of Exxon Mobil, Shell and BP. Splitting up, as the smaller Marathon is doing, could add tens of billions of dollars to shareholders' portfolios.
As United States members of the group prepare to report earnings starting this week, the world's big oil companies know they have a problem. Whereas a decade ago their shares fetched price-to-earnings multiples in the high teens, today they languish on valuations ranging from around seven times earnings for BP to 12 times for Exxon, despite the tripling of oil prices over the period. With the majors increasingly locked out of oil-rich nations, the difficulty of ramping up production bears much of the blame. 
But so, too, does a growing distaste for complexity among investors. Largely for historical reasons, today's oil giants are ungainly combinations of higher growth exploration businesses shackled to sluggish refining and marketing operations.
Observable valuation measures hint at a shareholder preference for simplicity. While the integrated majors as a group trade at around nine times 2011 earnings, pure exploration companies in the United States command multiples closer to 20 times, with independent refiners at about 14 times. Even allowing for the swifter growth of these smaller companies, investors are penalizing big oil companies.
Oppenheimer researchers contend the United States majors could raise their valuations 20 percent by spinning off their refining and marketing operations. By this calculus, a partition would add $15 to Exxon's $79 share price -- or $80 billion to its nearly $400 billion market capitalization. Slower-growing leviathans don't deserve the racier values accorded to the independents. Yet even a modest increase in price-to-earnings multiples could be a boon for investors.
For instance, valuing Exxon's exploration and production business at 13 times expected 2011 earnings -- far less than independents command -- would yield a stand-alone value of $382 billion, according to research from Madison Williams. Assuming a conservative multiple of 10 times for Exxon's downstream, or refinery, businesses makes them worth $78 billion, Madison Williams calculates. Combined, that's a 15 percent higher value than Exxon at present.
That kind of illustration makes justifications for integration seem increasingly threadbare. Executives argue that lumping refiners and explorers together offers a natural hedge. In theory, when falling crude prices hurt production, the refining business gets relief from lower input costs. Exxon, for example, fared relatively well during the slide in oil prices of 2008, when its shares fell a mere 15 percent.
Still, it seems Exxon was shielded more by its size and a lack of debt, rather than integration. The much smaller rival Marathon, for example, fell 55 percent over the year. In reality, oil prices and refining margins are frequently correlated, since both are led by fuel demand and economic growth.
Big oil companies also claim that technology developed in one part of the business can be used in another. Yet with the possible exception of liquefying natural gas, energy experts struggle to think what these supposed synergies may be. Besides, technology can be easily bought or hired: none of the majors seem to have objected to relying on oil services companies like Schlumberger for technology and Transocean for rigs.
Finally, energy majors contend that refining expertise helps clinch access to reserves in oil-rich nations. A company that knows refining, they say, is more likely to be granted exploration rights. This may have been true decades ago when large national oil companies were less sophisticated. Now they are more than capable of developing their own refining operations or signing joint ventures.
So the benefits of integration are hard to pin down. By contrast, splitting up would make oil companies far easier for investors to value. It would surely sharpen management focus, since different skills are required to run exploration and refining operations.
There is no reason to fear that oil giants would have to give up the scale needed to compete. Newly liberated exploration and production companies could simply hook up. Most of the smaller integrated oil companies, like Marathon and Murphy Oil, have already reached these conclusions. It may not be long before the majors do too. CHRISTOPHER SWANN

HEADLINE: New York Nonprofits Turn to Out-of-State Options for Bonds

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Nonprofits based in New York are turning to other states for help in issuing tax-exempt bonds.
Late last year, the Phoenix Industrial Development Agency in Arizona sold bonds for two private schools in Manhattan, the Nightingale-Bamford School and the Friends Seminary School, and Planned Parenthood of America is seeking to follow suit.
''We are exploring our options for out-of-state financing in several states,'' said Stuart Schear, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood. 
Historically, New York's own industrial development agencies have issued tax-exempt bonds on behalf of the state's nonprofits seeking to raise money for new facilities and other projects.
But the law allowing those agencies to float such bonds expired in January 2008, and the state Legislature has not renewed it.
The lapsed law worsened the problems experienced at the height of the financial crisis by nonprofits that had issued auction-rate securities, but it has not received much attention until now.
''With the I.D.A. out of commission and the Legislature unable to remove the law, people are looking at other options,'' said Sisi Kamal, chief financial and operating officer at the Friends Seminary School in New York.
The school, which had other bonds coming due and a desire to pay down a term loan, floated $28 million in bonds through the Phoenix agency in December.
The strategy was suggested by bankers at First Republic Bank, which bought all the bonds. ''It was a great solution for us,'' Ms. Kamal said.
In the past, several large, national nonprofits have issued bonds in states other than those in which they operated, but not because laws had lapsed, said Richard A. Newman, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in tax-exempt bond issuance.
''We had a client with facilities in 23 states, and the transaction costs of issuing bonds separately in each state would have exceeded any benefits,'' Mr. Newman said. ''So instead, they went to an out-of-state issuer to do the whole thing.''
Not all states offer such services to groups outside their borders. Arizona, Colorado and Virginia do, as well as one agency in California, and Wisconsin has created an agency devoted in large measure to issuing bonds on behalf of out-of-state borrowers.
Nonprofits must get the approval from the state where the project awaiting financing is located. That increases the cost because they incur fees in multiple states, and in some cases, the interest rates are slightly higher.
Assemblyman Sam Hoyt of Buffalo, chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the law, said renewal of the provision allowing industrial development agencies to issue bonds on behalf of nonprofits had become snarled in a broader debate.
''There's a prevailing opinion that the I.D.A.'s need to be reformed and that the law needs to be changed so they are held more accountable and transparent and operate in a manner more consistent with the original intent, which was to attract industries to the state,'' Mr. Hoyt said, speaking about industrial development agencies. ''The nonprofit piece of the law has gotten mixed up with that.''
Some lawmakers in New York are insisting that a renewed law include requirements that borrowers pay a ''prevailing'' or ''living'' wage, which typically matches or is just slightly lower than union rates.
Additionally, Mr. Hoyt said, many legislators object to allowing charter schools, which are publicly financed but independently governed, to issue bonds via the industrial development agencies.
Unlike public schools, charter schools cannot tap public finances to support construction of school facilities and so would benefit from floating tax-exempt bonds for that purpose.
But charter schools typically do not hire unionized teachers or administrators. ''There are legislators who are either anticharter school or pro-building trades or both who feel it's important to make prevailing wages part of the legislation,'' Mr. Hoyt said.
The standoff does not affect all nonprofits in New York. Hospitals and universities can use the Dormitory Authority, while some cultural institutions turn to the Trust for Cultural Resources. Those issuers technically could issue bonds on behalf of other types of nonprofits, but they tend to work with much larger deals than, say, the needs of a private school or social services agency.

HEADLINE: Paper Company Wants Printers to Go the 'Flo' Way

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
In the brave new world of media -- or the brave world of new media -- turnabout is most definitely fair play. Google, for instance, advertises itself in newspapers and trade publications. And now a leading paper company is promoting one of its products with a series of online video clips.
The company is Sappi, and the product is Flo, Sappi's value-priced, or economy, line of paper. To gain a following for Flo among a target audience of printers and press operators, Sappi is sponsoring humorous webisodes under the title ''Off Register.''
The cast members for the ''Off Register'' Web series come from the Second City improvisational troupe in Chicago. They play parts that include a put-upon printer named Sully and his finicky, demanding, offbeat and off-base clients. 
Sappi and its agency, VSA Partners in Chicago, say the stories told in each webisode are based on, or inspired by, actual experiences of printers around the country.
Printers are being invited to share their ''outrageous'' tales for future episodes of ''Off Register'' by contacting Sappi at this e-mail address: offregister@sappi.com
The ''Off Register'' webisodes have their own channel on YouTube, known as the Flo Channel. They can also be watched on Vimeo and Funny or Die.
The campaign for Flo is not forgoing print entirely. Plans call for a book about the online series, offering behind-the-scenes looks at the stories and characters.
Yet even the book is to have a new-media bent: It will contain QR codes that can be scanned to connect readers to the trailer for ''Off Register'' and the first two webisodes.
''We are a paper company, and print is our business,'' says Patti Groh, director for marketing communications at Sappi Fine Paper North America in Boston.
Still, ''we've been working the last few years on how to make print more relevant and embrace technology,'' she adds, rather than to ''take a defensive posture.''
Video makes sense for the campaign, Ms. Groh says, because it is among ''the media we use in our day-to-day life.''
And it shows how ''you can integrate print with other things for a more powerful impact,'' she adds.
Sappi joins a lengthening list of marketers that are using online video and Web series to sell products. Like Sappi's, many such webisodes are in a humorous vein, the idea being that to get someone to come to a Web site and watch a clip, entertainment is a powerful draw.
Just last week, Hewlett-Packard teamed with YouTube for a live show to promote its H.P. ePrint technology, featuring the comedian Rob Riggle and members of the Upright Citizens Brigade improv troupe.
A goal of Sappi's is ''reaching our printers in an emotional way,'' Ms. Groh says, and ''show we understand the pain they go through on a daily basis'' in the course of getting their jobs done.
So far, ''everyone seems to identify with our printer, Sully,'' she adds.
In the first webisode, which was uploaded last month, Sully, played by an actor named Paul Grondy, must deal with an assertive client named Kat who in getting a brochure printed wants a color pink that is ''more than pink''; she insists on what she calls ''luscious.''
''Luscious is more than a color,'' Kat declares. ''It's a state of mind.''
She tells Sully she wants a ''luscious'' that brings to mind flirting with a towel boy on a ''perfect hair day'' during a Caribbean cruise, the seared ahi tuna at a Tokyo noodle restaurant, ''the inside of a baby polar bear's ear'' or being ''French-kissed'' by King Kong.
''Stop it, Kong,'' says Kat, played by an actress named Susan Messing.
Hours go by until finally poor put-upon Sully sends out for ''a bottle of luscious.'' Showing Kat the results, he says, ''We added lots and lots of luscious.''
Kat is ecstatic. ''That's it,'' she screams, adding in a voice normally used to speak to poodles: ''Thank you so much. You are a good boy.''
The video ends with Sully letting the viewers in on a secret: ''It was pink.'' In between ''was'' and ''pink'' is an epithet that is bleeped out as if the clip were on a comedy cable channel.
The second webisode, called ''Designer Disaster,'' is scheduled to make its debut in March. The plot is centered on a pretentious artist visiting the printer whose masterpiece -- which looks, truth be told, pretty weird -- gets caught in a machine and is chewed up.
''My baby is dead,'' the artist wails.
Sully, trying to be helpful, tells him, ''At least it's out of its misery.''
Plans call for at least four more videos, Ms. Groh says, to be released in April, May, June and July or August (or maybe after the summer).
Sappi and VSA are estimating that the trailer and first two episodes of the Web series cost a thrifty $80,000 to write, edit and produce. For another campaign, composed of television commercials, that would perhaps cover the budget for the catering truck -- or the honey wagon.
''We had a very small budget,'' says Jonathan Turitz, a creative director at VSA who used to work at a behemoth Chicago agency, Leo Burnett.
''This is not Burnett money,'' he adds, laughing. ''This is a new world.''
To stretch the budget, a decision was made to hire current and former Second City actors for the webisodes, Mr. Turitz says, because ''they could improvise, take what I write and run with it.''
Mr. Turitz says he got the idea for ''Off Register'' when he was watching an episode of ''The Office.''
''And it was, 'O.K., there we go,' '' he says, noting that, appropriately, ''The Office'' is a sitcom about a company that sells paper.
At one point, Mr. Turitz says, ''we were talking about a print piece'' as the focus for the campaign, because ''you always want to show the beauty of ink on paper.''
But ''printers are inured to print promos,'' he adds. ''Another print piece is not going to do the job,'' which he defines as ''endear ourselves to printers.''
''This is an audience that knows Sappi,'' Mr. Turitz says. ''We don't need to build awareness.''
So ''Off Register'' is ''not about Sappi,'' he adds, but rather about the target audience, ''celebrating what they do and their role in the print world.''
Asking the printers to submit ideas for webisodes will help them ''feel they're a part of the program,'' Mr. Turitz says, and make the content ''more engaging.''
''These are guys in their 50s and 60s,'' he adds. ''They have years of awesome stories.''
Ms. Groh says that Sappi has already received ''hundreds of e-mails and phone calls thanking'' the company for the first webisode.
''They all identify with the characters,'' she adds of the viewers, and ask questions like ''Is that so-and-so from so-and-so company?''

HEADLINE: The End of the Hotel Deals

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
Hotel owners and management companies are breathing a sigh of relief.
After weathering the worst of the economic downturn that sent their occupancies and room rates plummeting, hotels are starting to see more demand as business travel and, to a lesser extent, leisure travel, pick up. Occupancy rates climbed by close to 6 percent last year, according to the 2010 Hotel Horizons report published by Colliers PKF Hospitality Research. Average room rates, though, were generally flat.
Analysts consider occupancy a leading indicator -- it climbs first, then rate increases follow. This year, they say, hotel rates will begin rising again. ''We still have a long way to go, but we're seeing early signs that because of strong demand recovery in 2010, managers are beginning to move room rates,'' said R. Mark Woodward, president of Colliers PKF Hospitality Research. ''We're literally at the turning point.'' 
For travelers, that probably means the beginning of the end of the buyer's market they have enjoyed over the last couple of years.
The return of the business traveler has been a big factor in driving up demand for hotel rooms. At the same time, according to Bruce MacMillan, president and chief executive of the trade group Meeting Professionals International, the number of meetings booked this year is expected to grow by 8 percent. Some events that had been canceled during the recession, he said, are now being rebooked.
Add to that equation lenders' reluctance to extend financing to commercial real estate developers, in general, and hotel builders, in particular. ''The pipeline has been shrinking fairly dramatically,'' said David Loeb, managing director at the private equity firm Robert W. Baird & Company. He predicted that ''relatively modest demand growth is still going to result in solid occupancy growth.''
To give more liquidity to the market, some hotel management companies have been stepping in and helping developers obtain financing, sometimes by providing what is called ''key money,'' funds akin to a developer's down payment. ''There are various ways of supporting the financing without becoming the lender directly,'' said Frits D. van Paasschen, chief executive of Starwood Hotels and Resorts. ''We do believe it's important to help spur development of properties in markets where we think there are great opportunities.''
Ian R. Carter, president of global operations and development for Hilton Worldwide, said he expected that ''as the credit markets free up and supply starts to catch up, we'll start to see more balance come into the market.'' But he pointed out that it would take a while, since it can take a year or two to build a hotel, even a limited-service property.
While the anticipated increase in room rates is good news for the lodging industry, it presents a challenge for travelers and travel and meeting managers.
''Hotels are asking for rate increases,'' said Kevin Maguire, travel manager for intercollegiate athletics for the University of Texas at Austin. Mr. Maguire said he had noticed an increase in fees for items like a special pillow. ''I'm starting to see some of that pop up on a much broader scale,'' he said. In response, he is reducing the number of hotel brands he works with to increase his clout with the ones that remain.
Business travelers who pay their own way have had to get creative to keep getting the kind of deals they could easily find two years ago. Vivek Khanna, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who travels about 100 days annually, said he was able to get rooms at full-service properties for $50 a night in the depths of the recession. But on a recent trip to New York City, Mr. Khanna said he couldn't find a room at a low enough rate and stayed instead at a hotel in Newark for $45 a night.
One caveat to the good news for hotel companies is that the rebound in demand is unevenly distributed. ''It's pretty normal to see the demand increase on the coasts and work its way in,'' said Tom Faust, vice president of sales for Omni Hotels. Cities like New York, Washington and San Francisco all finished 2010 with healthy occupancy rates. But analysts said many smaller cities and those located far from the coasts may continue to struggle.
''A lot of these second-tier cities have spent a lot of money building new convention centers or adding onto existing convention centers,'' said Kevin Iwamoto, vice president of enterprise strategy at the online event management firm StarCite. ''They have to fill that space.'' For travel and meeting managers who have the flexibility of choosing where to hold events, this means it still may be possible to find bargains.
Leisure travelers, too, can still find deals if they are flexible, analysts say.
Luxury hotels may also still be offering recession-era rates, Mr. Carter of Hilton said. Rates at high-end hotels fell the most. And while prices are recovering quickly, the magnitude of their earlier fall means rates at those high-end properties have further to go before catching up.

HEADLINE: Job Placement, With a Record

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Faced with yawning budget gaps and high unemployment, California, Michigan, New York and several other states are attacking both problems with a surprising strategy: helping ex-convicts find jobs to keep them from ending up back in prison.
The approach is backed by prisoner advocates as well as liberal and conservative government officials, who say it pays off in cold, hard numbers. Michigan, for example, spends $35,000 a year to keep someone in prison -- more than the cost of educating a University of Michigan student. Through vigorous job placement programs and prudent use of parole, state officials say they have cut the prison population by 7,500, or about 15 percent, over the last four years, yielding more than $200 million in annual savings. Michigan spends $56 million a year on various re-entry programs, including substance abuse treatment and job training.
''We had a $2 billion prison budget, and if you look at the costs saved by not having the system the size it was, we save a lot of money,'' said Patricia Caruso, who was Michigan's corrections commissioner from 2003 through 2010. ''If we spend some of that $2 billion on something else -- like re-entry programs -- and that results in success, that's a better approach.'' 
All told, the 50 states and the federal government spend $69 billion a year to house two million prisoners, prompting many budget cutters to see billions in potential savings by trimming the prison population. Each year, more than 600,000 inmates are released nationwide, but studies show that two-thirds are re-arrested within three years.
''An exorbitant amount of money is dedicated to incarcerating people,'' said Nancy La Vigne, director of the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute. ''There are ways you can go about reducing the number of people incarcerated. The best way to help them successfully integrate into society and become independent, law-abiding citizens is to make sure they get a job.''
Pushed by faith-based organizations and helped by federal stimulus money, California, Michigan, New York and other states expanded jobs programs in recent years to give prisoners a second chance and to reduce recidivism. The nation's overall jobless rate is 9.4 percent, but various studies have found unemployment rates of 50 percent or higher for former prisoners nine months or a year after their release.
Many states remain enthusiastic about the re-entry programs, but in a few states facing deficits, like Kansas, officials are cutting them back, partly because of the curtailment of federal stimulus dollars that helped finance them.
''There's a lot of national momentum to expand strategies to reduce recidivism, and a lot of that is focusing on connecting people to jobs,'' said Michael Thompson, director of the Council of State Governments Justice Center, a research organization for state policy makers. ''At the same time, some states that want to accomplish those goals are concerned about cutting money where they can and are putting some of these programs on the chopping block.''
Brian Vork, executive director of 70 Times 7 Life Recovery, a faith-based nonprofit in Holland, Mich., that helped place 60 former prisoners into jobs last year, said he had seen firsthand what a difference a job can make. His organization, whose name refers to a biblical passage in which Jesus speaks of how many times to forgive sinners, has set up a construction company -- part apprenticeship program, part life-skills mentor -- that allows him to size up the offenders who participate.
''You get some people who really want to change, and then you get some people who want all the bad things to stop happening to them regardless of their behavior,'' Mr. Vork said. ''What makes it all worthwhile is when you see the light bulb go off in some people.''
Take Robert Satterfield, 46, who spent five and a half years in prison on embezzlement and other charges. After being released, he spent several fruitless months searching for work and then turned to 70 Times 7 for guidance and training. Mr. Vork recommended him to Premier Finishing, a metalworking company with 16 employees.
Premier's owner, Andy Ribbens, said the six former inmates working for him were among his best employees. ''These guys will do whatever it takes,'' he said. ''Maybe they had their come-to-Jesus moment in prison: 'If I ever get out of here, I don't want to ever go back.' Their attitude is second to none, although it's not every ex-offender.''
Mr. Satterfield is grateful for his second chance. He has received several raises since being hired 16 months ago, with his pay jumping to $13 an hour from $9.
''I feel blessed that this company is willing to give me a chance,'' he said. ''I'm giving back now. I'm part of the taxpaying rolls. I don't like paying taxes, but I prefer that to being on food stamps.''
In New York, the state and city are channeling money to groups like America Works and the Center for Employment Opportunities to train and place offenders, while Illinois is sending money to the Safer Foundation in Chicago.
Assisted by federal stimulus funds, several states have provided employers with wage subsidies -- up to $2,500 in New York's case -- if they hire an offender for at least six months.
With 170,000 inmates, California is under orders from a federal judge to reduce its prison population by about 25,000 because of severe overcrowding. That has many Californians worried that a flood of newly released inmates will cause crime to spike.
Jerry Brown, the governor of California, has proposed expanding county job-placement programs for former inmates as part of a broader move to shift more state prisoners to county jails.
Meanwhile, federal support is drying up. Three years ago, under President George W. Bush, Congress passed the Second Chance Act in a bipartisan vote. It gave states money for re-entry programs, including $100 million in the year that ended last September. While no federal budget has yet been passed for this fiscal year, the Senate Appropriations Committee has voted to cut funding to $50 million.
''The reality is many of these programs are disappearing,'' said Joan Petersilia, a Stanford law professor and an adviser to Mr. Brown on criminal justice matters.
While state officials and prisoner advocates argue that these job programs for prisoners are worth the investment, the efforts sometimes face angry resistance.
''We often hear, why on earth should we want to help these guys, and where is the help for my son and daughter who haven't done anything wrong?'' said Pat Nolan, a former Republican leader of the California State Assembly who served prison time for taking bribes and is now vice president of the Prison Fellowship, a Christian ministry to prisoners. ''I don't think there should be a preference for someone with a record, but there shouldn't be a permanent black mark against them either, unless we want to condemn them to life on the margins of society and elicit the behavior that leads to.''
Glenn E. Martin, vice president with the Fortune Society, a Manhattan group that helps offenders find jobs, said that persistently high unemployment had made placing former inmates even more challenging. ''You have many more people in the labor market who are overqualified, and that makes it much more competitive for our people,'' he said.
Candice Ellison, 22, a New Yorker who spent two and a half years in prison for assault, has applied for scores of jobs in the last six months, to no avail. She has turned to the Fortune Society, and it has helped her buy interview clothes and coached her on how to discuss her conviction with prospective employers.
''Some of my high school friends say it's not that hard to get a job, but for people like me with a criminal background, it's like 20 times harder,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Panel Investigating Financial Crisis Is Said to Refer Cases to Justice Dept.

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The panel appointed by Congress to investigate the causes of the financial crisis referred a handful of cases involving potential wrongdoing to the Justice Department, a person close to the investigation said Monday evening. 
The referrals were made as a precaution to ensure that federal authorities were aware of potential misconduct the panel came across during its yearlong investigation, according to the person, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because the referrals were intended to be confidential.
The person said that a civil investigation would be the most likely outcome of the referrals and that criminal charges were unlikely.
Most of the potential violations concerned securities laws, the person said, without naming any individuals identified. The referrals were approved by votes of the panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, last year, the individual said. The Huffington Postreported some details of the referrals on Monday evening.
The panel intends to wrap up its work on Thursday, with the release of a book-length report that details multiple causes of the 2008 crisis, from deficiencies in regulatory oversight to Wall Street excesses that abetted the subprime housing bubble. The report will be published in two versions: one by the publisher PublicAffairs (on sale for $14.99) and the other by the Government Printing Office.
The 10-member commission has been sharply divided in reaching its conclusions. The final report -- totaling 576 pages in the commercially available version -- will reflect the majority viewpoint of the six members appointed by Congressional Democrats. But the four members named by Republicans have written separate dissents.
The commission conducted 19 days of hearings and interviews with 700 witnesses. Its work was loosely modeled on the Pecora hearings, which the Senate conducted in the 1930s to investigate the causes of the Depression, and on the 9/11 Commission, whose final report, published in 2004, was a surprise best seller.
Though the financial crisis led to the loss of more than eight million jobs and a continuing overhaul of Wall Street regulations, it has resulted in few criminal prosecutions.
The commission is hoping that the report will serve as a definitive explanation of the origins of the crisis.
The law that President Obama signed in May 2009 that established the commission required the panel to complete its work by Dec. 15, 2010, but the Democratic majority announced in November that it would need more time, in part to accommodate the production schedule required in putting out a book.
The commission now intends to cease operations by Feb. 13.

HEADLINE: Super Bowl Comeback on Wheels Signals Optimism

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE two teams that will play in Super Bowl XLV on Feb. 6 are the Packers and the Steelers. But perhaps for a day they ought to be renamed the Porsches and the Siennas or even, given their old-school roots, the Packards and the Studebakers.
That is because the automotive industry could be buying the most commercial time of any advertiser category during the game, vying with beverages and movies for the top spot. There may be as many as nine car brands peddling their wares during what is typically the most-watched television program of the year, from economy makes like Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia to luxury marques like BMW and Mercedes-Benz. 
For the Chevrolet parent, General Motors, the ad buy signals a return to the Super Bowl after two years away. It will also be the first Super Bowl in a decade for BMW, which will run two commercials in the game, and the first ever for Mercedes-Benz.
The automakers are also surrounding their Super Bowl buys with extensive pre- and postgame promotions, many of them in social media like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
For instance, Mercedes-Benz will give away two cars in what is being called the ''Tweet Race to the Big Game.'' Kia plans a contest, giving away five cars, and will team with SocialVibe to sponsor a ''Big Game Tournament'' for players of Zynga social games like FarmVille.
Auto-related marketers are also clambering aboard the Super Bowl XLV bandwagon. Those buying spots in the game are Bridgestone tires; CarMax, the nation's biggest seller of used cars; and the Web site Cars.com.
There were five carmakers in the Super Bowl in 2009 and six in the game last year. The industry's interest in putting the pedal to the metal reflects the increasing sales of cars and trucks as the United States recovers -- albeit slowly -- from the financial crisis.
''After a couple of tough years, everyone sees the market improving,'' said Stephen Cannon, vice president for marketing at Mercedes-Benz USA in Montvale, N.J., a unit of Daimler.
The Super Bowl ad debut for Mercedes-Benz will come in the form of a 60-second commercial, scheduled for the fourth quarter, promoting new models like the C-Class coupe and the SLS roadster.
The spot, by Merkley & Partners in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, also offers a nod to the brand's heritage, reflecting a celebration this year of its 125th anniversary. And for viewers interested in the here and now, the hip-hop star Diddy, a k a Sean Combs, will make a humorous cameo appearance.
Another car brand to be hawked during the game, Kia, will also go back and forth in time in its commercial, a 60-second spot planned to run in the first quarter.
The commercial, for the Kia Optima midsize sedan, mimics a science fiction movie; the cast members include an Aztec-type chieftain and his tribe, Poseidon and space aliens.
''We've got a great car, and characters who will go to great lengths to drive it,'' said Michael Sprague, vice president for marketing and communications at Kia Motors America in Irvine, Calif.
This will be the second Super Bowl for Kia, which appeared in the game last year with a 60-second commercial for the Sorento crossover sport utility. That spot helped the Sorento become ''our No. 1 selling vehicle every month in 2010,'' Mr. Sprague said, and the 108,000 Sorentos sold represented ''the first time we sold more than 100,000 units for a single model.''
To help lightning strike again, Kia will begin running teaser commercials on Monday ''to say, 'Look for us in the game' '' on Feb. 6, he added.
''The Super Bowl is so crowded,'' Mr. Sprague said, ''we want to build advocates before the game for our spot in the game, so when it comes on they'll say, 'Hey, everybody, quiet down and watch this.' ''
Also reflecting those circumstances of Super Bowl viewing -- millions of people watch the game at parties and gatherings that can be noisy -- the ''One Epic Ride'' Optima commercial this year, like the Sorento commercial last year, will feature loud music on the soundtrack but no voice-over narration.
''The idea is to have fun, keep people engaged and reward them in the end for watching,'' said David Angelo, chairman and chief creative officer at David & Goliath in Los Angeles, which created the Kia Super Bowl spots as well as other commercials like a series for the Kia Soul featuring hip hamsters.
The car giveaway contest, along with the Zynga social game, are intended ''to take it up a notch this year,'' Mr. Angelo said, ''and engage in a long conversation with consumers before they experience the product.''
Brian Dunbar, managing partner and director for client services at David & Goliath, said that executives at the agency and Kia ''knew going in that it would be a much more crowded Super Bowl'' in the car category than in recent years.
''That's more reason to do something that would really, really stand out,'' Mr. Dunbar said, ''and keep people talking before, during and after the game.''
Mr. Cannon at Mercedes-Benz USA echoed his assessment.
''It doesn't bother me one bit there are eight or nine other car companies crowding into'' the game, he said. ''With the postrecession rebound in car sales, everybody's hungry for this increasing pie and no one wants to miss out on their slice.''
Fox, a unit of the News Corporation that will broadcast Super Bowl XLV, is charging an estimated $2.8 million to $3 million for each 30 seconds of ad time.
Among those advertising in the game, in addition to the auto and auto-related marketers, are Anheuser-Busch InBev, Best Buy, CareerBuilder, Coca-Cola, Walt Disney Pictures, E*Trade, GoDaddy.com, HomeAway, Mars, Paramount Pictures, PepsiCo, Pizza Hut, Skechers, Teleflora and Universal Pictures.
Groupon, which was planning to buy commercial time in the pregame show, may also advertise in and after the game, running commercials by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, a unit of MDC Partners.

HEADLINE: Texas Instruments Narrowly Beats Forecasts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Texas Instruments, the chip maker, posted fourth-quarter results on Monday that narrowly surpassed forecasts, and the company said it was past a ''short and shallow downturn'' that hit in the second half of 2010. 
The company said it earned $942 million, or 78 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $655 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier.
The most recent period included 14 cents a share in one-time gains from the sale of a product line and a tax benefit. Excluding those, earnings beat the average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet by 1 cent a share.
Revenue rose 17 percent to $3.53 billion, up from $3.0 billion last year and beating the analysts' forecast of $3.51 billion.
For much of last year, the company's results reflected a rebound from the recession. Then, in October, the company warned that the market was weakening, and that its outlook for 2011 was cautious. Demand for chips for laptop computers, hard disk drives and televisions started to look poor, while chips for video games and smartphones stayed in strong demand.
But on Monday, the chief executive, Richard K. Templeton, said the fall's downturn looked ''mostly complete.'' The company used it to replenish its inventories and return product lead-times to normal, he said.
For the first quarter, Texas Instruments projected a revenue range of $3.27 billion to $3.55 billion and net income of 54 cents to 62 cents a share. Analysts had forecast revenue of $3.34 billion and net income of 58 cents.
The company, based in Dallas, reported its results after the close of market trading. Its stock rose 74 cents, to $34.65 a share, during the trading session but fell by about 2 percent in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: Accused of Rights Abuses, Uzbek Leader Is Welcomed in Brussels

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- President Islam A. Karimov of Uzbekistan was given the red-carpet treatment on Monday during meetings here with top European leaders, his warmest reception in the West since his government massacred several hundred protesters in 2005. 
Mr. Karimov met with both Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, and with Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO's secretary general. Mr. Karimov did not speak to reporters after either meeting.
Human rights groups were scathing in their criticism.
''Karimov came here to get a photo opportunity, and they gave him that,'' said Andrew Stroehlein, a spokesman for the International Crisis Group, which works to prevent human rights abuses. ''These pictures will be broadcast in Uzbekistan to legitimize him.''
Mr. Barroso said he discussed specific human rights concerns with Mr. Karimov and urged him to release all of Uzbekistan's political prisoners.
''The European Union follows a policy of critical, conditional and comprehensive engagement with Uzbekistan,'' he said. ''I have raised all key concerns of Europe, notably regarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, which stand at the heart of E.U. foreign policy. I believe it is through such a robust eye to eye dialogue, and not an empty-chair policy, that we can further the E.U.'s unanimously agreed policy of engagement most effectively.''
The United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic that has significant energy reserves, after Uzbek troops killed several hundred protesters in the town of Andijan in May 2005. The sanctions were considered ineffectual and were lifted four years later. Since then, Mr. Karimov, who refused to allow an international investigation of the Andijan massacre, has met with several European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
Mr. Stroehlein said such diplomatic engagement can be useful in 99 percent of cases. But with Uzbekistan, he said, ''this is the 1 percent of cases where it has failed every time.''
Mr. Karimov, who has been in power since the Soviet Union broke apart 20 years ago, has crushed his political opposition and jailed dozens of human rights advocates. In 2008, when Mr. Karimov began a third seven-year term and received 88 percent of the vote, Human Rights Watch reported that he cared little for democratic values. The United Nations has said that torture is common.
Uzbekistan -- which is about the size of California, and with 28 million people is the most populous country in the region -- is rich in cotton, gold, gas and oil. An American air base there supported operations in Afghanistan, across its southern border, until the government asked the Americans to leave in 2005 in retaliation over the sanctions.
The United States began warming to Mr. Karimov's government after the war in Afghanistan began to falter. Uzbekistan still allows Germany to operate an air base out of a southern Uzbek city.
Two years ago, Mr. Karimov made an attempt at international redemption when he scheduled a parliamentary election, although all four parties that were allowed to participate staunchly support his government.
Mr. Karimov acknowledged at the time that ''previously, there were no political parties vying for political influence and power,'' but that he had injected genuine competition into the process.

HEADLINE: Obama and the State of the Union

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding President Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night, at a time when the nation's sense of itself and our mission may be changing, the context of the president's remarks should be the role of the federal government in maintaining a sane society.
By that I mean a just society that looks after its disadvantaged, educates its children, ensures access to health care for all Americans, and gives the middle class as well as the wealthy a voice in the public conversation and a stake in an expanding economy. 
Until we're clear about what to expect of our government, and how our president sees its role, the debate about its proper size will remain a partisan shouting match.
David Kernis Trumbull, Conn., Jan. 23, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama to Press Centrist Agenda in His Address'' (front page, Jan. 23):
Where does Jim Kessler, the co-founder of the centrist organization Third Way, get the idea that President Obama is ''moving from the left to the center''? The last time I remember President Obama supporting a leftist agenda was during the presidential campaign. The continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the unkept promise to close Guantanamo speak for themselves.
Monique Frugier Ardmore, Pa., Jan. 23, 2011
To the Editor:
I support President Obama's apparent move to the center, but have never felt that he was a doctrinaire liberal. He is far too creative a thinker to adhere slavishly to any party line or become boxed in by a single ideology.
Patrick Frank Kingstree, S.C., Jan. 23, 2011
To the Editor:
The problem with President Obama's shift to the center is that it happens only during a campaign. In fact, that's the signal that he's back to campaigning.
Andrea Economos Scarsdale, N.Y., Jan. 23, 2011
To the Editor:
It seems that President Obama, despite ample evidence to the contrary, will stick with the common Republican mantra of competition and deficit reduction as the cure-all for our nation's economic ills.
Unfortunately, he seems incapable of understanding that what the nation really needs is cooperation and an equitable tax structure!
It should be patently obvious that we cannot compete against low-wage nations that have lax labor standards or environmental regulations, if any at all. And we cannot sit around talking about ''job creation'' when even newly created jobs are lost as factories are closed and moved elsewhere.
If the United States is not to continue its downward spiral into third-world status as jobs continue to disappear and people lose their homes, we will have to level the playing field through imposition of tariffs, negotiation of trade treaties or other means. More jobs will mean more people paying taxes. Cutting public jobs, as has been proposed, simply worsens the situation.
Prompt action is needed, but first we need wise decisions.
L. M. Arndt San Rafael, Calif., Jan. 23, 2011
To the Editor:
Dear Mr. President:
Surely you will speak about gun control in your State of the Union address. Let me help you put to rest the canard that guns don't kill people, people kill people.
Make the analogy between the control of cars (licensing restrictions, driving regulations) and control of guns. Cars don't kill people, people using cars kill people.
Cars and guns, carelessly or intentionally misused, are both lethal. We extensively regulate who uses cars and how they use them. Shouldn't we do the same with guns?
I wish you luck, Mr. President, with your address, and with efforts to bring common sense to the debate over gun control.
David Swanger Santa Cruz, Calif., Jan. 23, 2011

HEADLINE: Russia, Facing Big Budget Gap, Warms to Foreign Investors

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- A few years ago, Vladimir V. Putin, as president, compared the energy riches of Siberia to a piece of candy held tightly by Russia, as if in a ''sweaty fist.'' However much investors might want it, it was off limits.
Yet just last month, Mr. Putin, now prime minister, said Russian officials ''understand that we need foreign investment.'' And if the current president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, continues with his plan to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week -- despite Monday's airport bombing in Moscow -- he, too, will be trying to attract foreign capital.
What has changed, to turn the sweaty fist into the open hand? Simply put, Russia needs the money.
Windfall profits from oil exports, which Russia had salted away before the global recession to cover deficit spending, are about to run out. In fact, that portion of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, the Reserve Fund, is down to $26 billion -- not enough to cover even half of the projected 2011 budget deficit. 
Thus, for the first time since the financial crisis of 1998, Russia will be compelled this year to turn to international banks and pension funds in the United States and Europe to maintain financing for everything from modernizing the military to paying high public sector wages.
The government is also lining up a fresh batch of asset sales. It has retained Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch as an adviser for the planned sale of a stake in the state bank VTB. Shares in oil companies, hydroelectric dams and shipping lines will also go on the market.
With so much state property scheduled for privatization, Goldman Sachs reinforced its Moscow office this month by moving the chief of investment banking in France, Jean Raby, to Russia. Mr. Raby will be co-director, along with Christopher Barter.
Russian officials all the way up to the Kremlin are clearly trying to entice other foreign investors as well. Mr. Medvedev had been scheduled to deliver the keynote speech Wednesday night at the Davos forum. But after the bomb attack on Monday at Moscow's busiest airport, the Kremlin said that Mr. Medvedev had delayed his departure. There was no immediate word on when, or if, he might reschedule.
But Russia's pressing need to raise cash will remain.
To make up its budget shortfalls, the government plans to issue $50 billion worth of ruble-denominated bonds and privatize $10 billion in state assets every year until at least 2014.
Mr. Medvedev had been planning to spend two days at Davos, seeking to charm chief executives from Deutsche Bank, Novartis, Siemens, PepsiCo, Boeing and others at a private reception and in public panel discussions.
''The main signal that Medvedev will give is that Russia is open for investment,'' his chief economic adviser, Arkady V. Dvorkovich, said last Friday at a news conference to preview the Russian goals at Davos.
Mr. Dvorkovich said the Russian president would also be going to gauge the chief executives' interest in Russian assets to decide which state companies should go up for sale first.
Potentially on the block along with VTB are stakes in Rosneft, the state-owned oil company; RusHydro, the national hydroelectric utility; and Sovcomflot, a fleet of state-owned merchant ships.
Russian domestic banks, which are still relatively flush, will most likely buy about three-quarters of the newly issued government debt, said Ivan Tchakarov, the chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Moscow. But the Kremlin will depend on foreign investors to buy the rest.
''We are entering an entirely different ball game,'' Mr. Tchakarov said during an interview. ''They want to open up to foreigners.
Not since an oil price slump in the mid-1980s dented Soviet finances have officials in Moscow committed to such extensive fund-raising. The 1980s borrowing led to foreign debt of more than $100 billion.
A big challenge will be overcoming multinational companies' wariness of Russia.
This month, the British political risk consulting firm Maplecroft ranked Russia 186th out of 196 countries for political risk to business -- worse than Pakistan. India and China fared much better, ranked 26th and 62nd.
Meanwhile, the corruption perception index compiled by Transparency International ranked Russia as the world's most corrupt major economy in 2010 -- near the bottom of the overall list, at 154 of 178 countries, tied with Tajikistan and Kenya.
To make Russia look more appealing to foreign investors, a reform-oriented wing in the government has streamlined a host of rules. Russia lowered its capital gains tax, for example. while the main stock exchange, the Micex, eliminated a requirement that nonresidents trade through local brokers.
In 2010, after years of foot-dragging, Russian negotiators resolved sticking points on entry into the World Trade Organization. By October, Lawrence H. Summers, then director of the National Economic Council in the United States, said Russia had made such progress that it appeared ready to join the trade group within a year.
And in September, Mr. Medvedev trimmed the list of so-called strategic assets that were off-limits to foreigners -- the large oil and metals deposits clenched in the ''sweaty fist'' -- to about 50 sites, down from more than 200.
But problems remain. Mr. Dvorkovich, Mr. Medvedev's economic adviser, acknowledged that the criminal conviction of the former oil company owner Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky last month had harmed Russia's ability to attract foreign investment and that the case would surely come up at Davos.
It was an unusually frank statement for a senior official. ''I think that a significant part of the international community will have serious questions, and the assessment of the risks of working in Russia will increase,'' Mr. Dvorkovich said.
Once Russia's richest man, Mr. Khodorkovsky had angered Mr. Putin by taking part in politics and by negotiating to sell a portion of his oil company, Yukos, to Exxon Mobil without the Kremlin's blessing.
After the second conviction, handed down last month as the police were clubbing protesters on a street outside the courtroom, Mr. Khodorkovsky will remain behind bars until 2017.
Still, the Russian government's warming attitude toward foreign business executives was on display this month in the latest twist for the assets of Mr. Khodorkosvky's company.
Yukos was bankrupted and sold off, largely to Rosneft, which this month struck a partnership agreement with BP. The two companies have agreed to swap shares and jointly search for oil off Russia's northern coast.
Encouraged by the implication that the pendulum was again swinging toward openness, investors shifted $742 million into Russian-dedicated funds in the week after the Rosneft-BP agreement.
That was three times more than the $196 million in the previous week, and the largest jump in Russian portfolio investment ever recorded, according to EPFR Global, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass., that tracks fund flows around the world.

HEADLINE: Director Of Policy On Climate Will Leave

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Carol M. Browner, the White House coordinator for energy and climate change policy, will leave the administration shortly, officials confirmed Monday night. Her departure signals at least a temporary slowing of the ambitious environmental goals of President Obama's first two years in the face of new Republican strength in Congress. 
Ms. Browner, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was charged with directing the administration's effort to enact comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases and moving the country away from a dependence on dirty-burning fossil fuels. That effort foundered in Congress last year, and Mr. Obama has acknowledged that no major climate change legislation is likely to pass in the next two years.
No decision has been made on whether she would be replaced or if the position would simply disappear, a White House official said.
''She will stay on as long as necessary to ensure an orderly transition,'' a White House official said. ''Carol is confident that the mission of her office will remain critical to the president.''
News of her departure was first reported by Politico.
An aide to Ms. Browner said she was proud of her White House accomplishments, including helping to coordinate response to the BP oil spill and fashioning a deal under which automobile fuel efficiency will increase by nearly 25 percent over the next five years. The aide said Ms. Browner was also pleased that Mr. Obama's State of the Union message would include a strong endorsement of the clean-energy policies she championed.
But she is leaving with her major goals unmet and the E.P.A. -- where she served for eight years under President Bill Clinton -- under siege by Republicans who believe it is strangling job creation by imposing costly new pollution rules.
In recent weeks there has been speculation that Ms. Browner would be moved to another senior position at the White House, perhaps deputy chief of staff, with a broader portfolio. But those rumors did not pan out and instead Ms. Browner decided to return to the private sector.
Ms. Browner is known as a savvy navigator of the bureaucracy and a strong voice for environmental protection in a White House that was focused more on health care and the economy. Her departure leaves the administration's other major environmental and energy policy makers without a strong advocate at the White House.
But in the face of Republican skepticism about climate change and strong opposition to environmental regulation, the administration will be spending more time defending the modest policy gains of the past two years than advancing new proposals.
Scott Segal, an energy expert at Bracewell & Giuliani, a law and lobbying firm in Washington, said Ms. Browner's leaving might be a sign that the administration would be more sensitive to the concerns of business.

HEADLINE: Pitch for Rebuilding Infrastructure Carries Political Challenges

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
When President Obama uses his State of the Union address on Tuesday to rally America to ''outbuild'' other nations, he will face an unusual challenge: getting Republicans to embrace public works projects again as the kind of worthy bacon they have traditionally fought to bring home, and not as wasteful pork that should be spurned.
The atmosphere has changed considerably since last year, when the president used his address to outline his vision of a national high-speed rail network and then flew to Tampa the next day to announce stimulus money for a bullet train to Orlando. 
Now Florida's new Republican governor, Rick Scott, is looking that gift train in the mouth and trying to decide whether to accept the promised $2.4 billion from the federal government to begin construction. New Republican governors in Ohio and Wisconsin have already turned down federal money for new rail lines that they saw as boondoggles. And the Republicans who now control the House have said that deficit-reduction, not new spending projects, would be their top priority.
So Mr. Obama is recalibrating his message and trying to make the case that public works are not just about short-term construction jobs, but about long-term economic competitiveness. He is increasingly arguing that spending money to rebuild the nation's roads, rails, ports, power grids and even broadband networks will be necessary if America is to be able to compete in the global economy. And he is expected to repeat his call for creating a National Infrastructure Bank, which would choose public works projects by their merits.
''The question is, how do you know you're going to get a return on your investment?'' said David Burwell, the director of the Energy and Climate Program at the Carnegie Endowment, explaining the importance of careful project selection. ''It's a question of, how do you give us some confidence that you're investing to grow the economy?''
Tuesday's speech will be Mr. Obama's third call to rebuild the nation's aging infrastructure. His first effort, the $787 billion stimulus package, ended up devoting only a small part of the money to public works, and many stimulus projects were selected more because they were ''shovel ready'' and could get people working relatively quickly than because they were particularly transformative. His second effort, a call for a $50 billion infrastructure program on Labor Day, went nowhere in the run-up to the midterm elections.
The challenge the administration now faces is twofold: negotiating a new transportation bill with Congress amid great uncertainty over where the money will come from and what it should be spent on, and then devising a system that would ensure that in times of limited resources, the worthiest projects get money.
In Washington, the Obama administration's priorities for expanding mass transit, passenger rail and what planners call ''livability'' will likely be challenged by Republicans in Congress, who come from more rural areas with different needs -- a trend that gathered steam after the midterm elections. The median Republican Congressional district now has a population density 11 times smaller than the median Democratic district, according to an analysis by Transportation Weekly, a trade publication that focuses on federal transportation spending. That kind of disparity can have big ramifications when it comes to deciding how much federal transportation money should be spent on, say, mass transit instead of highways.
The battle is already beginning to play out. Just last week, a bloc of conservative Republicans in the House released a proposal to cut Amtrak subsidies, grants for passenger rail and high-speed rail, a major federal transit program and the federal subsidy for the Washington Metro. That led William Millar, the president of the American Public Transportation Association, to charge that the group had ''focused only on the short-term costs without looking at the economic value these essential public transportation investments provide.''
There are areas of possible common ground. The new chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, had long been a champion of high-speed rail. But unlike the Obama administration, which decided to put more than half of its high-speed rail money toward regular passenger routes that it hopes can one day be upgraded, Mr. Mica wants the federal money to go toward true bullet trains that could be run at a profit and attract investment from the private sector.
Right now the bulk of the money in the federal Highway Trust Fund comes from the federal gasoline tax, a flat 18.4-cent tax levied on each gallon of gasoline sold that has not been raised since 1993. One of the less-noticed proposals made late last year by the president's commission of fiscal responsibility and reform -- sometimes known as the debt commission -- was to gradually increase the gas tax by 15 cents per gallon from 2013 to 2015. But doing so could still be politically difficult.
In an era where ''bridges to nowhere'' have eroded public confidence, most federal transportation money is divided by a formula and sent to the states, which get wide latitude in deciding how to spend it. This fall, a report by the Treasury Department and the Council of Economic Advisers found that ''with a few notable exceptions, federal funding for infrastructure investments is not distributed on the basis of a competition between projects using rigorous economic analysis or cost-benefit comparisons.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about plans by President Obama to stress during his State of the Union address the need to update the nation's infrastructure referred incorrectly to population data for Congressional districts. Democratic districts tend to be more urban, so the median Democratic district has a population density -- not a total population -- that is 11 times greater than the median Republican district.

HEADLINE: Republicans' Budget Man Draws Fire

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- He is the guy with the piercing blue eyes, love for heavy metal on his iPod and a reputation among Democrats, including President Obama, as a Republican who has put forward budget ideas that are thoughtful and serious, if not in sync with their own.
But now Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican point man on spending cuts and designated responder to the State of the Union address, has emerged as the latest chew toy among Democrats. They spent Monday beginning a campaign to portray him as the architect of fiscal policies that they view as unwise and hope will prove unpopular among voters, including plans to partially privatize Social Security and Medicare. 
As the House cleared a key test vote on a resolution that would direct Mr. Ryan to cut most federal spending to 2008 levels, Democrats ripped into Mr. Ryan, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and will celebrate his 41st birthday on Saturday. And they took direct aim at a long-term proposal he produced last year for balancing the federal budget called ''A Roadmap for America's Future.''
''We will be putting a focus on the fact that on spending matters, the Republicans are making judge, jury and executioner out of someone who, according to his Roadmap, wants to privatize Social Security,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat.
A spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, went further, calling Mr. Ryan ''the architect of a plan to end Social Security and Medicare'' in a statement that also nodded to the House resolution, declaring, ''Republicans are not only endorsing Representative Ryan's extreme plan but giving him unprecedented power to carry it out.''
Mr. Ryan's plan includes an option for retirees to invest some of their Social Security taxes in personal investment accounts and a new program that would give older Americans a fixed payment to buy certified private health insurance in place of traditional Medicare. It would not make any changes to Social Security and Medicare for people currently 55 years old and older, and Mr. Ryan has argued that the changes would preserve the programs for coming generations.
Aides said that Mr. Ryan, who was not granting interviews on Monday, was focused on preparing for his speech -- by far the biggest moment of his political career -- and was more interested in the Green Bay Packers in the Super Bowl than in the political venom being directed at him.
''It is not about him,'' said Stephen Spruiell, a spokesman for the Budget Committee. ''He wants this debate to stay policy and issue focused. Obviously he is also willing to take the heat on it. If he wasn't, he wouldn't have put the Roadmap forward in the first place.''
In focusing the fight on Mr. Ryan, the Democrats are partly trying to pressure House Republicans into stating publicly whether they agree with his plan. Given the popularity of those two big entitlement programs, even some of the most fiscally conservative Republican candidates resisted endorsing Mr. Ryan's proposal in the fall elections. Aides said Mr. Ryan relished the chance to put his ideas in the spotlight and engage in a rigorous debate. They also did not shy away from hitting back at the Democrats, saying they were the ones potentially endangering Social Security and Medicare by refusing to consider politically difficult policy options.
The Democrats' ''focus on Paul Ryan'' program has echoes of Mr. Obama's strategy before the elections, when he hammered on the prospect of the House under the leadership of John A. Boehner of Ohio, who is now the speaker, in a bid to make voters think twice about backing Republicans.
Democrats said Mr. Ryan should be the focus now, even more than Mr. Boehner, who will be sitting behind Mr. Obama during Tuesday night's speech.
''On these financial issues Paul Ryan has become the leader of the Republican Party,'' Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, said Monday.
On the House floor, Democrats denounced the Republicans' resolution.
''Under those rules, a single member of Congress, the chairman of the Budget Committee, has the authority to determine spending levels for the government for the rest of the year,'' said Representative James P. McGovern of Massachusetts.
The vote in the House was 240 to 168, with eight Democrats joining all Republicans in favor.

HEADLINE: Stories to Tell: Curating an African-American History Exhibition

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Researching local or national black history, choosing significant artifacts and creating a museum display. 

 BODY:
Overview | Given that history is composed of many interwoven stories, how do curators and other historians decide which stories to tell? How can key historical events, people, places and themes best be represented in a meaningful, engaging exhibition to teach others? In this lesson, students consider the messages sent by artifacts and then develop an African-American history exhibition. 
Materials | Student journals, personal artifacts (as described in the warm-up below), computers with Internet access, research materials and historical artifacts (as described in the main activity below)
Warm-Up | Prior to class, give students the following instructions:
Imagine that a local museum is planning to include the story of your life so far in an exhibition. Only three objects, photographs or other artifacts or items can be included to represent your life's history. Decide which items you think best represent you and your life story, and bring them to class tomorrow. For each item, write a descriptive tag (one to two short paragraphs) that briefly describes the object and explains its significance. Note that you will be sharing these objects and tags with the class.
Encourage students to think broadly about items that represent them and tell something important about them, like clothing, things they created, cherished objects, significant documents, things they often use, favorite entertainment vehicles, family photographs, and so on. Let them know that if they are not able to bring their chosen items to class for any reason, they should find another way to represent them, perhaps in a photograph or sketch.
At the start of class, have everyone set up their displays on their desk, and allow everyone to circulate. After everyone has had a chance to look at the entire collection, instruct students to pair up, preferably with someone who sits adjacent or nearby. Each student should closely examine his or her partner's display and then write, in his own words, the overall life story that is told by his partner's exhibition.
If students need prompting in writing their stories, you might pose these questions: What impressions does the display give you of this person? How does it alter what you already know of him or her? Why do you think he or she chose these items to help tell his or her life story? What impressions might the display give a stranger about your partner?
Have students share what they have written with their partner. Questions to discuss include these: Was anyone surprised by what their partners wrote? Were the observers' stories similar to or different from the exhibitors' intended stories? Why do you think that is? What was challenging about choosing only three items to represent the story of your life? How would the story of your life have changed if you had chosen different things to represent it? Is one version "more true" than another? Why or why not? Why did you settle on this particular "story" of your life? Was it the most true? The most crowd-pleasing? The happiest? The coolest? The most shocking? If you were a museum curator (and not yourself), might you have chosen objects that would have told a different story? Why or why not?
Finally, tell students that these are the types of questions that museum curators struggle with in endeavoring to tell the stories not only of individuals, but also of whole peoples and time periods, and they will now read about the efforts and challenges associated with creating a new museum dedicated to African-American history.
Related | The article "The Thorny Path to a National Black Museum" describes the many decisions facing curators of the new Smithsonian African-American History museum on the National Mall in Washington:
In the late 1970s, when Lonnie G. Bunch III had his first job at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, veterans of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black squadron, accused the museum of playing down their contributions during World War II. In response, the museum asked some of the African-Americans on staff to allow their faces to be used on mannequins, increasing the "black presence" in its exhibits.
"I didn't do it," Mr. Bunch said recently, who was among those asked. "That's not the way I wanted to be part of a museum."
Thirty years later Mr. Bunch, and African-American history itself, are part of a Smithsonian museum, but in a very different way. As the director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Mr. Bunch, 58, is charged with creating an institution that embodies the story of black life in America.
The pressure couldn't be greater. To open in 2015, in a $500 million building designed to evoke the art of an ancient West African kingdom, the museum will stand at the geographic center of American civic identity, on the National Mall.
Read the entire article as a class, focusing on the following questions.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
What factors are playing a role in the decisions over what story or stories the museum will tell, and why?
        
Pull out from the article the various descriptions of the planned museum, including "a lens to understand what it means to be American" and "a healing space." What is the significance of these descriptions? Do any of these purposes seem to diverge or even conflict with one another? How are they driving the development of the museum?
        
What specific items are mentioned in the article, and what significance do they hold?
        
How is the museum's staff choosing to tell the story of slavery? How do you think these decisions are informed by the politicized nature of the museum? How would you tell the story of slavery?
        
Mr. Bunch says, "If my ancestors are smiling, then I know we've done a good job." What would be your metric for deciding whether or not the museum has "done a good job"?
Activity | The following activities could be combined into a single mini-unit, or one or more could be selected and folded into existing curriculum or used for a grade-wide or school-wide Black History Month activity.
The overall idea is for students to research, design and perhaps even create an exhibition on African-American history and culture. The focus here might be one of the following:

        
The local community, with "local" defined with respect to your school, neighborhood, town, city or however works best within your context.
        
Relevant people, events or genres to which students feel emotional proximity and connection. Students might choose, for instance, black leaders, thinkers and heroes they feel connected to and create an exhibition to honor them.
        
Relevant curriculum, devoted either to one specific historic time period or to various events, movements and people in African-American history. For example, students might curate an exhibition to culminate a history unit on slavery or to complement the reading of a literary work like Toni Morrison's "Beloved." Or music students might devote various sections to major music genres in African-American culture, like blues and jazz.
Which Story Should We Tell?
Engage students in a discussion about which stories they think would be most important to tell. Tell the students that they will be using a "fishbowl" format for discussion. Discussion questions might include the following; adjust them as needed depending on the specific focus you have chosen for the class exhibition.

        
What lessons about life, community, history or citizenship do you think people in our community could learn from studying African-American history?
        
What do we already know, and what do we need to discover, to create our exhibition?
        
How does local black history fit into the context of national - and global - history?
        
The planned national museum in Washington is meant, in part, to be a "healing space." Should our exhibition have a similar or different goal? Why?
        
The museum will be divided into three sections: history, including slavery; culture, including music, visual arts and sports; and community, focused around important places in the United States. How should we focus and divide our exhibition?
        
Because it is impossible to tell every story that makes up local African-American history, how should we decide which stories get told and which get left out?
        
How will we gauge whether we have done a good job? Who do we want to be especially careful not to disappoint?
        
With this exhibition, we have an opportunity to start and frame important discussions about race, history and culture in our community. What discussions do you think people in our community should be having? How can we spark those discussions with our exhibition?
        
Exhibition titles often sum up their general messages. If it were up to you, what would you title the exhibition? Why would you choose this title?
Ensure that students are thinking about historical periods, events, places, people and movements, as well as about culture, politics and more, as appropriate.
Keep a list of themes that emerged from your discussion and display it for the duration of the time that you spend creating your exhibit. When questions about how to address certain issues arise, return to the list and continue to engage in discussions around them as questions or problems arise. Modify the list as needed as the class collects historical materials and learns more about local black history.
Conducting a Listening Tour
"The Thorny Path to a National Black Museum" notes that Mr. Bunch went on a "listening tour" of black America. Have students conduct their own "listening tour" in their local community to learn more about what members of their community, as you have defined it, think should be included in an exhibition on African-American history.
If they are focusing instead on personal connections, they might do some personal writing and perhaps interview family members to develop ideas. And if their project is history-based, they might find relevant oral histories to watch and listen to.
For a local project, you might draw on our lesson "Beyond Question: Learning the Art of the Interview" to help students develop interviewing skills. Have students contact local African-American community organizations, and local chapters of national organizations, to identify knowledgeable community members to interview. Work in class to develop interview protocols that will elicit rich information from their interviewees about local African-American history. During this listening tour, have students work to collect artifacts like photographs, objects, documents, videos and so on for the exhibition.
You might also draw on our lesson "The Power of Place: Doing Ethnographic Studies of Local Sites."
After this portion of the project is complete, bring the class together and discuss what place personal experiences and eyewitnesses have in your exhibition. How can individual stories be interwoven with others to tell a bigger story? How can we put individual stories into the larger context?
Examining the Archives
Visit a local historical society and tour the archives. Discuss with the staff whether they would be willing to lend your class documents or artifacts, or allow you to scan, take photographs or copy down transcripts of artifacts or documents.
Students should also find other primary sources like newspaper articles, photographs, speeches and documents from online archives to help them frame the local artifacts that they collect. Resources include PBS's "Africans in America" and New York Times resources on black history and culture and archival articles.
Developing the Exhibition
Taking into account all of the interviews and archival materials you have collected along with the key themes that you agreed upon, decide on the overall design and the various sections for the exhibition. Have small groups work together to plan, design and create their assigned sections.
They should focus on developing the layout, representation of objects and descriptive text. Consider having one group be in charge of the overall exhibition to figure out how the sections will be connected to each other and to the larger themes and stories.
Going Further | Invite community members, including those who were interviewed, to visit the exhibition. Have the class write and deliver a special introduction at the opening.
Students might also write letters to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, explaining what they learned from creating their project and offering ideas to the curators. As appropriate, they might also participate in the museum's Memory Book project.

 BODY:
News that Borders, the nation's second-largest book chain after Barnes & Noble, is teetering on the brink of a bankruptcy filing has made book publishers even more nervous about their online future. 
The recording industry, which preceded books' move online by about a decade, sold $7.7 billion worth of music in 2009, down from $14.3 billion in 2000. Electronic books are much easier to pirate than songs and movies -- a fact made clear when Dan Brown's blockbuster ''The Lost Symbol'' was downloaded illicitly more than 100,000 times within days of hitting stores in 2009.
Despite all that, we are happy to say that it's far too early to kiss book publishing goodbye. E-book sales more than doubled in the first 11 months of last year -- to about 8 percent of total sales. E-readers are flying off the shelves, and overall book sales are holding up as the paper-based industry transitions to the digital age, increasing 3.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2010.
The resilience of the book business may be because of demographics. Like jazz, which is less prone to illicit downloads than hip-hop, books cater to older, less Internet-savvy customers. Publishers also avoided the recording industry's mistake of wasting precious time suing customers and have rightly focused on promoting cheap and easy ways for them to download books legally.
Books, as a cultural product, face important pressures. The pursuit of blockbusters by big publishers and retailers means that potential readers are exposed to a narrower set of titles. Americans have more choices on how to spend their spare time. Some argue that the short texts usually found on the Internet are changing readers' habits, perhaps reducing our attention spans.
Yet for all the fear of reading's demise, books have survived similar challenges before. Over the last 50 years, books have had to contend with television, then cable, VCRs, DVDs, PCs, laptops, iPods, iPhones and iPads. Despite all these diversions, Americans spend a larger share of their budgets on books today than they did in 1960. Though book sales have declined slightly in the last 10 years as a share of consumer spending, they have still grown more than 15 percent over the period, after accounting for inflation. And Nooks, Kindles and the like might actually help books gain a wider following by taking the bookstore to the customer.

HEADLINE: Housing Prices, Already Down, Fall Again

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
A new slide in housing prices has begun in earnest, with averages in major cities across the country falling to their lowest point in many years.
Prices in 20 major metropolitan areas slid 1 percent in November from October, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index released Tuesday. The index has fallen 1.6 percent from a year ago.
Nine of the 20 cities in the index sank in November to new lows for this economic cycle: Chicago; Las Vegas; Detroit; Atlanta; Seattle; Charlotte, N.C.; Miami; Tampa; Fla.; and Portland, Ore. Only a handful of places -- essentially, California and the District of Columbia -- went counter to the trend and had rising prices over the last year. 
Whether the long-predicted double dip is looming or has already arrived is a quibble of semantics.
David M. Blitzer, chairman of S.& P.'s Index Committee, does not count a downturn as a double dip until it exceeds the previous low. The index is still 3.3 percent above the low it reached in April 2009. Mr. Blitzer thinks a double dip could be confirmed before spring.
''We shouldn't kid ourselves,'' he said. ''The last few months have been weak.''
Cities that were never mainstays of the boom are suffering unduly in this latest bust. Atlanta, Chicago and Portland have dropped more than 7 percent over the last year, with much of the tumble in October and November.
By this point, the problems in the housing market are well known. Builders built too much, lenders lent too much, and people bought too much. The binge was epic and so is the hangover.
The era during the middle of the last decade when many people thought houses were a great investment is long gone. A house in Atlanta is worth almost exactly the same as it was 11 years ago, the Case-Shiller data shows. And that is before adjusting for inflation.
Cities like Minneapolis and Charlotte did not do much better. ''I don't know if that's a disaster, but it's certainly a disappointment,'' Mr. Blitzer said.
The Case-Shiller Index is a three-month average of prices, so shifts in the market take a long time to play out. The market has been experiencing what S.&. P. called ''an unambiguous deceleration'' since last May. That, not coincidentally, was when the government's special tax credit for buyers was ending.
The tax credit particularly strengthened sales of cheaper houses, and now its absence is speeding their fall. In Atlanta, for instance, prices for lower-priced homes fell 32 percent over the last year, the Case-Shiller data shows.
''It's a direct reversal from the way things were during the credit,'' said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.
There are few calls to bring back the tax credit, even among the Realtors who championed it when it was first proposed and then when it was extended. Nor are other forms of stimulus or stabilization being widely proposed.
''There seems zero interest in doing anything along these lines,'' said the economist Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ''My view is that we should just let the market adjust and try to help out the homeowners who are hurt most by this.''
Mr. Baker has proposed letting foreclosed owners stay in their homes as renters. The idea has gained little traction.
One hopeful sign for real estate is that on both a seasonally adjusted and an unadjusted basis, the Case-Shiller declines measured in November were less than in October. The 20 cities fell 0.5 percent on seasonally adjusted basis in November after a 1 percent drop in October.
Nevertheless, analysts said the declines would continue, even if not as sharply as in 2007 and 2008. ''The enormous supply overhang of existing homes -- particularly factoring in all those in foreclosure or soon to be -- promises to keep pressure on prices for some time,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist of MFR Inc.
Mitch Kaminer, the president-elect of the Atlanta Board of Realtors, said the November Case-Shiller numbers were ancient history. ''Atlanta's a strong market,'' he said. ''I'm expecting the January numbers to be much better. I can't say it often enough: this is a great time to buy.''
Mr. Kaminer was speaking after he had just finished showing a house in Dunwoody, Ga., to a Chicago transplant. The agent ticked off its selling points: four bedrooms, three-and-a-half baths, a close-in location. The asking price of $439,000 was a sharp discount to the $525,000 it might have fetched a few years ago.
But the potential buyer did not go for it. ''Just like every other buyer out there, he wants to make sure he's getting a great deal,'' Mr. Kaminer said.
In others words, today might be a great time to buy, but tomorrow might be even better. It is a conviction the housing market cannot seem to shake.

HEADLINE: Illinois Plan For Pensions Questioned

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Federal regulators are examining disclosures by Illinois about its unorthodox pension funding method, trying to determine whether the state misled bond investors about the risks.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has said it has a special team devoted to investigating public pensions, and last year it brought its first case ever against a state, accusing New Jersey of securities fraud for claiming to have pension assets that did not really exist.
If the commission decides at some point to bring a case against Illinois, it would send another warning. 
Some other states, including Arkansas, Ohio, Rhode Island and Texas, have used variations of Illinois's method, which reduces their annual contributions to their pension funds. The effect is to save money at a time of tight budgets, but it can also weaken the pension funds.
The S.E.C.'s inquiry was disclosed in a prospectus for a $3.7 billion bond offering planned by Illinois for February. The state wants to use the proceeds from the sale to make its annual contribution to its pension funds, which are among the most poorly funded in the country. Illinois must sell bonds to come up with the cash because the state is low on money.
The prospectus said that the S.E.C. contacted the state last September and that Illinois was cooperating with the inquiry.
The state also disclosed that even before it heard from the S.E.C., it had decided to improve its pension disclosures. The prospectus said officials had made that decision as a precaution last August, after the S.E.C. accused New Jersey of securities fraud for making false statements about its pension fund. The New Jersey case was the S.E.C.'s first enforcement action against a state, and the state settled without admitting any wrongdoing.
''We feel our disclosures have always been accurate and complete,'' said Kelly Kraft, a spokeswoman for the Illinois governor's office of management and budget, which handles communications with the capital markets.
The S.E.C. contacted Illinois after an article appeared in The New York Times about an unusual actuarial technique the state had been using to save money by shrinking its annual pension contributions.
The method, enacted last year, is based on sharp cuts in benefits for state workers who have not yet been hired. Although the cuts will not produce an appreciable savings until far in the future, Illinois has begun funding its plans as if its current workers were already earning the smaller benefits of the future.
For more than a decade, Illinois failed to put into its pension funds the amount needed to cover the promised benefits. The gap between how much is needed and how much is actually in the funds has grown so big that the state is overwhelmed by the required contributions. The benefit cuts were presented by state officials last year as a reform that would get the situation under control.
Some actuaries who have studied the funding method have said they doubt it meets the standards of their profession. Some have called it reckless when used by a state with a severely stressed pension system, like Illinois. That is because it deprives the pension fund of the substantial yearly contributions it needs now, to pay for the benefits already earned by today's workers.
Because the calculations are esoteric, it is hard for anyone besides a seasoned actuary to see that a program that Illinois ushered in as a reform could be harmful.
Actuaries have also expressed concern that other states and cities will adopt methods like the one Illinois is using, because many of them are cutting benefits for future workers, to save money and close budget gaps.
Rather than cutting benefits of existing workers, governments usually cut benefits for future workers. Laws and state constitutions make it very hard to do otherwise.
Illinois's method does not appear to comply with current governmental accounting standards, but governmental accounting rules are voluntary.
The S.E.C. has no direct jurisdiction over public pension funds and cannot order a government to follow any particular funding method. Its interest is in protecting investors, and making sure they have enough information to make well-informed decisions. It appears to be trying to determine whether Illinois adequately explained its method to bond buyers, giving them an understanding of how the reduced contributions may ultimately affect the state's finances.
News of the S.E.C.'s Illinois inquiry comes at a sensitive time. Many economists have been reviewing public pension disclosures and challenging the way governments calculate their obligations, saying the method in use tends to hide debt. The governments have generally responded that their accounting methods are correct and that long-term obligations should not be measured the same way as bills the states must pay right away.
Moody's Investors Service issued a report on Monday holding the state's rating steady, with a negative outlook. Along with its long-term pension funding problems, Illinois is grappling with a short-term budget deficit, largely stemming from reduced revenue, that it is trying to close in part with big tax increases.
Members of Congress have recently begun looking into whether a new chapter of the federal bankruptcy code, or some other legal framework, could be created to allow states with the most troubled finances to restructure their long-term debts.
The California state treasurer, Bill Lockyer, on Monday held a conference call in which he took issue with the critics of the current pension system. ''They've confused the near-term budget shortfalls with the long-term funding obligations, and grossly inflated the size of the long-term liabilities,'' he said.
Mr. Lockyer, who has a seat on the board of California's big public pension funds, is also responsible for signing the state's disclosures to investors. California does not use the unusual Illinois method that is drawing attention from regulators. But the S.E.C. has been looking into disclosures by the state's biggest pension fund, known as Calpers, under the tenure of a previous state treasurer, according to officials with knowledge of the inquiry.

HEADLINE: Across Egypt, Protests Direct Fury at Leader

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM and MONA EL-NAGGAR; Liam Stack and Dawlat Magdy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Tens of thousands of people demanding an end to the nearly 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak filled the streets of several Egyptian cities on Tuesday, in an unusually large and sometimes violent burst of civil unrest that appeared to threaten the stability of one of the United States' closest Arab allies.
The protests, at least partly inspired by the toppling of the authoritarian government in Tunisia, began small but grew all day, with protesters occupying one of Cairo's central squares. Security forces, which normally prevent major public displays of dissent, initially struggled to suppress the demonstrations, allowing them to swell.
But early Wednesday morning, firing rubber bullets, tear gas and concussion grenades, the police finally drove groups of demonstrators from the square, as the sit-in was transformed into a spreading battle involving thousands of people and little restraint. Plainclothes officers beat several demonstrators, and protesters flipped over a police car and set it on fire. 
Protests also flared in Alexandria, Suez, Mansura and Beni Suef. There were reports of three deaths and many injuries around the country.
Photographers in Alexandria caught people tearing up a large portrait of Mr. Mubarak. An Internet video of demonstrations in Mahalla el-Kubra showed the same, while a crowd snapped cellphone photos and cheered. The acts -- rare, and bold here -- underscored the anger coursing through the protests and the challenge they might pose to the aging and ailing Egyptian leader.
Several observers said the protests represented the largest display of popular dissatisfaction in recent memory, perhaps since 1977, when people across Egypt violently protested the elimination of subsidies for food and other basic goods.
It was not clear whether the size and intensity of the demonstrations -- which seemed to shock even the protesters -- would or could be sustained.
The government quickly placed blame for the protests on Egypt's largest opposition movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, which is tolerated but officially banned. In a statement, the Interior Ministry said the protests were the work of ''instigators'' led by the Muslim Brotherhood, while the movement declared that it had little to do with them.
The reality that emerged from interviews with protesters -- many of whom said they were independents -- was more complicated and reflected one of the government's deepest fears: that opposition to Mr. Mubarak's rule spreads across ideological lines and includes average people angered by corruption and economic hardship as well as secular and Islamist opponents. That broad support could make it harder for the government to co-opt or crush those demanding change.
''The big, grand ideological narratives were not seen today,'' said Amr Hamzawy, research director of the Carnegie Middle East Center. ''This was not about 'Islam is the solution' or anything else.''
Instead, the protests seemed to reflect a spreading unease with Mr. Mubarak on issues from extension of an emergency law that allows arrests without charge, to his presiding over a stagnant bureaucracy that citizens say is incapable of handling even basic responsibilities. Their size seemed to represent a breakthrough for opposition groups harassed by the government as they struggle to break Mr. Mubarak's monopoly on political life.
Security officials said a soldier in Cairo, along with two protesters in Suez, were killed in circumstances that were not immediately clear. Scores of demonstrators and more than a dozen soldiers were injured in the Cairo clashes, which lasted hours and included bouts of rock-throwing by both protesters and the police.
There were mixed signals about how the authorities planned to handle the unrest. In contrast with other recent political demonstrations in Cairo, thousands of security officers seemed content at times to contain rather than engage the protesters -- especially when it became clear that the demonstrators would not retreat from Tahrir Square. In a statement, the Interior Ministry said its policy had been ''securing and not confronting these gatherings.''
But there were signs of other containment tactics. Several times Tuesday afternoon, cellphone networks appeared to be blocked or otherwise unavailable for people calling from Tahrir -- or Liberation -- Square. Many people had trouble getting access to Twitter, the social networking tool that helped spread news of the protests. Twitter confirmed that its site had been blocked in Egypt, Reuters reported.
By early Wednesday, the police appeared determined to clear protesters from the streets, leading to more clashes.
On a bridge, drivers stopped their cars and some joined the protesters, chanting, ''The people want the downfall of the regime.''
In the days leading up to the protests, more than 90,000 people signed up on a Facebook page for the ''Day of Revolution,'' organized by opposition and pro-democracy groups to be held on Police Day, a national holiday. The organizers framed the protest as a stand against torture, poverty, corruption and unemployment. The Muslim Brotherhood said it would not officially participate, though some members were among the protesters in Cairo.
But many people said they did not belong to any particular group and were attending their first demonstration. They included Ramy Rafat, 25, who said he lived in El-Marg, an impoverished neighborhood in north Cairo. Mr. Rafat, who has a master's degree in petroleum geology and is unemployed, said he learned about the protest on a Facebook page for Khaled Said, 28. Mr. Said's family says police officers fatally beat him last year.
''There are a lot of things wrong with this country,'' Mr. Rafat said. ''The president has been here for 30 years. Why?''
Aya Sayed Khalil, 23, brought her sister, her mother and her father to the protest. ''I told them the revolution was coming,'' she said. Asked about their political affiliation, Ms. Khalil's mother, Mona, said, ''We're just Egyptians.''
The marchers came from all social classes and included young men recording tense moments on cellphone cameras, and middle-age women carrying flags of the Wafd party, one of Egypt's opposition groups. A doctor, Wesam Abdulaziz, 29, said she had traveled two hours to join the protest. She had been to one demonstration before, concerning the treatment of Mr. Said.
''I came to change the government,'' she said. ''I came to change the entire regime.''
What began as a small demonstration outside Cairo's Supreme Court building around noon Tuesday quickly swelled. Hundreds marched through winding streets while security officers shadowed them in a moving cordon. Scuffles broke out as the officers tried to halt the march by linking arms and forming lines.
''Freedom, freedom, freedom,'' the protesters chanted. ''Where are the Egyptian people?''
By midafternoon, groups of people had converged in Tahrir Square, where they met security forces in full riot gear and a water cannon truck. Several people said the clashes began in earnest after protesters tried to take control of the water cannon.
In front of the Mugamma, a towering administrative building in the square, young men threw rocks at the police as older demonstrators tried to stop them. Several young men were carried away from the clashes, clutching bloodied tissues to their heads.
As night fell, the crowd grew larger. An older man with a bullhorn appealed to his more Internet-aware counterparts, asking them to spread the word to railway workers and dockworkers. Many people said they planned to sleep in the square.
After midnight, the security forces, using concussion grenades and tear gas, renewed attempts to disperse the protesters.
Since Jan. 14, when President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia fled his country during a popular revolt, autocrats throughout the region have fretted about responses by their own restive populations who shared many of the grievances that toppled Mr. Ben Ali: rampant corruption, injustice, high unemployment and the simple lack of dignity.
It was unclear whether the day of demonstrations would lead to any broader social unrest. ''I think it is the beginning of the process,'' said Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a political science professor at the American University in Cairo.
''Some of the demonstrators are still in Tahrir and said they will not leave until their demands are met by the government,'' he said, hours before they were forced out of the square. ''Their demands will not be met by the government, but they will not give up.''

HEADLINE: Cut Waste Or Invest? Try Both

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Washington
President Obama wants to be sure that the United States keeps making the investments that help the economy grow. Congressional Republicans want the government to stop wasting so much money.
Education -- particularly higher education -- offers a great opportunity for a compromise that would let both sides claim victory and, even more important, help the economy.
Why? Education is the single best investment a society can make. High school became universal in the United States in the early 20th century, when other countries viewed universal schooling as wasteful, which goes a long way toward explaining our economy's 20th-century success. Likewise, the slowing increase in the number of new college graduates in the 1980s and '90s helped contribute to the slow economic growth of the last decade. So protecting higher education from across-the-board budget cuts, as Mr. Obama is urging, makes sense. 
But the status quo is not worth protecting. Both the federal government and the states spend money on higher education in terribly wasteful ways. They don't offer incentives for success, and they demand little accountability from colleges. Colleges that do a masterful job of graduating students receive no reward, and those that do a subpar job -- of which there are many -- go unpunished, giving them little reason to improve.
''Colleges are very much like high schools,'' as Arne Duncan, the education secretary, says. ''Some do a phenomenal job in building college-completion cultures and helping first-generation, low-income and minority students graduate, and some do a horrendous job.'' When I asked Mr. Duncan last year whether the Obama administration would consider changing federal financial aid to encourage success, he said, ''Yes, stay tuned.''
It has not happened yet, though, which makes it a good opportunity for the White House and Congress to work together now.
The basic problem is that colleges receive government money based largely on how many students they enroll. Perversely, colleges can even help their budgets by having a lot of dropouts. A college with a high dropout rate will have many more freshmen and sophomores than upperclassmen, and freshmen and sophomores are cheaper to have on campus, because they take big lecture classes.
Without any financial incentive to turn students into graduates, most colleges have paid far too little attention to their graduation rates. Nationwide, only about half of teenagers who enroll in college end up graduating.
The economic consequences have been severe. You often hear that income has stagnated in recent years, but it hasn't stagnated for four-year college graduates. They have received a 19 percent raise since 1979, on top of inflation. People who went to college without getting a four-year degree -- a combination of dropouts and two-year graduates -- suffered a 7 percent pay cut.
Fortunately, a few states have started to respond. Most intriguingly, West Virginia's biggest merit scholarship requires students to remain on track to graduate in four years. The policy has lifted the four-year graduation rate of recipients by almost 7 percentage points, according to research by Judith Scott-Clayton of Columbia University.
Indiana, meanwhile, has tweaked its formula for financing public colleges, to give more money to those with higher graduation rates. The formula also takes into account students' economic backgrounds, in an effort to recognize that some colleges have an inherently tougher job turning freshmen into graduates. But even in Indiana, the amount of public money that depends on results is small, less than 10 percent of the total. And virtually no federal funding is tied to results.
In the federal budget, the obvious candidates for cutbacks come from a grab bag of programs that cost about $12 billion a year and make up about one-fourth of federal spending on colleges. (An additional $32 billion goes to Pell grants, scholarships for low- and middle-income families, which do appear to lift graduation rates by helping students stay enrolled.)
Most of the $12 billion subsidizes student loans so that interest doesn't accrue while students are still in college. That may be a nice little benefit, but it does not help students stay in school. For one thing, it is too complicated to persuade people worried about tuition costs to enroll in college anyway. Even without the subsidy, their loan repayment would not begin until later; the subsidy merely reduces future payments.
The remainder of the $12 billion is no better. Many of these dollars are matching funds for financial aid awarded by colleges, which means much of the money ends up going to wealthy private colleges. Sandy Baum, a George Washington University economist who led a recent financial aid commission, calls the allocation of this money ''inequitable and inefficient.''
It isn't hard to think of more productive ways to use the $12 billion. Some of it could pay for promising state programs like West Virginia's or Indiana's. Other money could turn into additional aid for Pell recipients who remain on track to graduate in four years. Yet other money could reward colleges that succeed in graduating large numbers of low-income students -- an idea the White House is considering, officials say.
The fairest objection to policies focused on graduation rates is that they could cause some colleges to graduate undeserving students. And it's true -- they could. But such cases would probably be the rare exception.
Kevin Carey of Education Sector, a Washington research group, points out that most dropouts today are not students unable to keep up with college work. Instead, they generally attend colleges that, research shows, are neither very rigorous nor very engaged in students' lives. Many of these colleges devote little energy to thinking about -- let alone improving -- their graduation rate. Changing the funding rules could help change that mind-set.
The historical returns to education have been so high that I would rather see Washington both increase higher education spending and make it less wasteful. If anything, the federal government's role is more important now, when many states are cutting education spending.
But even if Congress won't increase spending, it can still do a lot to improve spending. The same is true of states, which together spend much more on colleges than Washington. A dollar that's well spent on education today will more than pay for itself tomorrow, through faster economic growth. For that reason, a tougher approach to college funding is actually a form of deficit reduction as well.

HEADLINE: The State of the Union

 BODY:
This nation faces huge problems -- putting millions of Americans back to work, investing to compete in a 21st-century global economy and wrestling down a long-term budget deficit that threatens everyone's future.
Ever since the 2010 campaign, we have heard precious little in the way of serious solutions -- mostly just smoke-and-mirrors spending cuts from Republicans and their usual clamor for more tax cuts for the wealthy. 
Tuesday night's State of the Union address was President Obama's chance to rise above that pinched vision, to help Americans understand that while government cannot do everything, it is indispensable in reviving the economy, spurring innovation, educating Americans and keeping them healthy and making the nation competitive globally.
Mr. Obama took on those issues, and the Republicans, squarely. Rebutting their single-minded focus on slashing discretionary domestic spending, Mr. Obama said we have to ''stop pretending'' that cutting this kind of spending ''alone will be enough.''
The speech was a chance for Mr. Obama to talk about the need for government investment in highways and railroads, schools and new, clean-energy industries. And we were encouraged that Mr. Obama set national goals in these areas -- 85 percent of the nation's energy should come from clean energy by 2035; 80 percent of Americans should have access to high-speed rail within 25 years; and 98 percent should have access to high-speed wireless within five years.
These are grand, and expensive, ideas, and it was vital that Mr. Obama talked about the need to pay for new spending.
He proposed eliminating taxpayer subsidies for oil companies, for example, to help pay for his clean-energy initiative. ''I don't know if you've noticed,'' the president said, ''but they're doing just fine on their own. So instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow's.''
Mr. Obama also is calling for extending his proposed three-year freeze on some discretionary programs to five years. The White House said that would create $400 billion in savings over 10 years -- a deep cut at a bad time, but far saner than Republican calls to slash spending so deeply that it would surely cripple the recovery.
The White House said Mr. Obama needed to make some proposal like that to remain in the debate. That is likely true. But he also made clear that there is no long-term solution without cutting military spending and mandatory spending on Medicare and Social Security.
He made a strong case for ending the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy when they expire in two years. ''Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break,'' he said.
That's important, but letting high-end tax breaks expire won't raise enough revenue to pay for needed investments or reduce long-term deficits. Mr. Obama proposed to simplify both the corporate income tax and the personal income tax, but he did not call for raising other taxes. Americans may not want to hear that taxes have to go up, but until Mr. Obama and other political leaders are willing to say so, credible deficit reduction will remain out of reach.
Mr. Obama's speech offered a welcome contrast to all of the posturing that passes for business in the new Republican-controlled House. On Tuesday, House Republicans pushed through a resolution calling for reducing spending on domestic programs to 2008 levels. In a fragile economy, cutting spending on transportation, education, scientific research, food safety and childhood nutrition will do huge damage.
At times Tuesday night, Mr. Obama was genuinely inspiring with a vision for the country to move forward with confidence and sense of responsibility. Americans need to hear a lot more like that from him.

HEADLINE: Financial Crisis Was Avoidable, Inquiry Finds

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The 2008 financial crisis was an ''avoidable'' disaster caused by widespread failures in government regulation, corporate mismanagement and heedless risk-taking by Wall Street, according to the conclusions of a federal inquiry.
The commission that investigated the crisis casts a wide net of blame, faulting two administrations, the Federal Reserve and other regulators for permitting a calamitous concoction: shoddy mortgage lending, the excessive packaging and sale of loans to investors and risky bets on securities backed by the loans.
''The greatest tragedy would be to accept the refrain that no one could have seen this coming and thus nothing could have been done,'' the panel wrote in the report's conclusions, which were read by The New York Times. ''If we accept this notion, it will happen again.''
While the panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, accuses several financial institutions of greed, ineptitude or both, some of its gravest conclusions concern government failings, with embarrassing implications for both parties. But the panel was itself divided along partisan lines, which could blunt the impact of its findings. 
Many of the conclusions have been widely described, but the synthesis of interviews, documents and testimony, along with its government imprimatur, give the report -- to be released on Thursday as a 576-page book -- a conclusive sweep and authority.
The commission held 19 days of hearings and interviews with more than 700 witnesses; it has pledged to release a trove of transcripts and other raw material online.
Of the 10 commission members, the six appointed by Democrats endorsed the final report. Three Republican members have prepared a dissent focusing on a narrower set of causes; a fourth Republican, Peter J. Wallison, has his own dissent, calling policies to promote homeownership the major culprit. The panel was hobbled repeatedly by internal divisions and staff turnover.
The majority report finds fault with two Fed chairmen: Alan Greenspan, who led the central bank as the housing bubble expanded, and his successor, Ben S. Bernanke, who did not foresee the crisis but played a crucial role in the response. It criticizes Mr. Greenspan for advocating deregulation and cites a ''pivotal failure to stem the flow of toxic mortgages'' under his leadership as a ''prime example'' of negligence.
It also criticizes the Bush administration's ''inconsistent response'' to the crisis -- allowing Lehman Brothers to collapse in September 2008 after earlier bailing out another bank, Bear Stearns, with Fed help -- as having ''added to the uncertainty and panic in the financial markets.''
Like Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Bush's Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., predicted in 2007 -- wrongly, it turned out -- that the subprime collapse would be contained, the report notes.
Democrats also come under fire. The decision in 2000 to shield the exotic financial instruments known as over-the-counter derivatives from regulation, made during the last year of President Bill Clinton's term, is called ''a key turning point in the march toward the financial crisis.''
Timothy F. Geithner, who was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the crisis and is now the Treasury secretary, was not unscathed; the report finds that the New York Fed missed signs of trouble at Citigroup and Lehman, though it did not have the main responsibility for overseeing them.
Former and current officials named in the report, as well as financial institutions, declined Tuesday to comment before the report was released.
The report could reignite debate over the influence of Wall Street; it says regulators ''lacked the political will'' to scrutinize and hold accountable the institutions they were supposed to oversee. The financial industry spent $2.7 billion on lobbying from 1999 to 2008, while individuals and committees affiliated with it made more than $1 billion in campaign contributions.
The report does knock down -- at least partly -- several early theories for the financial crisis. It says the low interest rates brought about by the Fed after the 2001 recession; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants; and the ''aggressive homeownership goals'' set by the government as part of a ''philosophy of opportunity'' were not major culprits.
On the other hand, the report is harsh on regulators. It finds that the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to require big banks to hold more capital to cushion potential losses and halt risky practices, and that the Fed ''neglected its mission.''
It says the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates some banks, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, which oversees savings and loans, blocked states from curbing abuses because they were ''caught up in turf wars.''
''The crisis was the result of human action and inaction, not of Mother Nature or computer models gone haywire,'' the report states. ''The captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings and failed to question, understand and manage evolving risks within a system essential to the well-being of the American public. Theirs was a big miss, not a stumble.''
The report's implications may be felt more in the political realm than in public policy. The Dodd-Frank law overhauling the regulation of Wall Street, signed in July, took as its premise the same regulatory deficiencies cited by the commission. But the report is sure to be a factor in the debate over the future of Fannie and Freddie, which have been run by the government since 2008.
Though the report documents questionable practices by mortgage lenders and careless betting by banks, one striking finding is its portrayal of incompetence.
It quotes Citigroup executives conceding that they paid little attention to mortgage-related risks. Executives at the American International Group were found to have been blind to its $79 billion exposure to credit-default swaps, a kind of insurance that was sold to investors seeking protection against a drop in the value of securities backed by home loans. At Merrill Lynch, managers were surprised when seemingly secure mortgage investments suddenly suffered huge losses.
By one measure, for about every $40 in assets, the nation's five largest investment banks had only $1 in capital to cover losses, meaning that a 3 percent drop in asset values could have wiped out the firm. The banks hid their excessive leverage using derivatives, off-balance-sheet entities and other devices, the report found. The speculative binge was abetted by a giant ''shadow banking system'' in which the banks relied heavily on short-term debt.
''When the housing and mortgage markets cratered, the lack of transparency, the extraordinary debt loads, the short-term loans and the risky assets all came home to roost,'' the report found. ''What resulted was panic. We had reaped what we had sown.''
The report, which was heavily shaped by the commission's chairman, Phil Angelides, is dotted with literary flourishes. It calls credit-rating agencies ''cogs in the wheel of financial destruction.'' Paraphrasing Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar,'' it states, ''The fault lies not in the stars, but in us.''
Of the banks that bought, created, packaged and sold trillions of dollars in mortgage-related securities, it says: ''Like Icarus, they never feared flying ever closer to the sun.''

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Timothy Egan is a columnist for nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Date night, they called this State of the Union address. Here was a chance for a large and unruly freshman class to make a good first impression, for jaded seniors to hold hands across the aisle, and for the skinny president to prove he's more than a nerdy know-it-all.
The grumpy grown-ups -- Harry Reid, cautioning against playing too nice, and Mitch McConnell, still sucking on that lemon after he declared his party's agenda was to deprive the president of a second term -- seemed annoyed with it all. 
Some people couldn't get the dates they wanted. Eric Cantor, the new House majority leader, held out a Twitter invite for Nancy Pelosi to sit next to him, but she was already taken. Still, charming! Were those tears in John Boehner's eyes?
Some people tried to the crash the party. Representative Michele ''Don't-Know-Much-About-History'' Bachmann made fellow Republicans cringe with her insistence on a rogue rebuttal. After wiping slavery from the history books last weekend in her version of how America came to be, Bachmann showed she is as good at making stuff up from the past as she is at reconstituting the present.
And one of the chaperones in black robes, Justice Samuel Alito of the Supreme Court, a bad boy last year when he mouthed the words ''not true'' back at the president, ditched the whole affair for a speaking gig in Hawaii.
But all of that was theater, gone by midnight. If the night lacked a certain magic, what will last into the 2012 election and beyond are the governing principles laid out by the two parties.
''At stake right now is not who wins the next election -- after all, we just had an election,'' said President Obama. But, of course, it's all about who wins the next election. What is ''Winning the Future,'' as Obama aides titled the theme of the speech, if not keeping a forward-looking Democrat in the White House?
From the president, we got the first blueprint for how to build a second term. With a wind of higher approval ratings at his back, he will run as the Pragmatic Progressive. The pragmatist will compromise when he has to, as Obama did with tax cuts and as he promised to do Tuesday night with possible corrections in the health care law.
The progressive will not repeal anything that keeps insurance companies from denying coverage to someone who is sick, and will move forward with new investments -- ''a latin word for taxes,'' as McConnell said. That's a fight Obama will win if he works primarily for those mentioned in his speech: ''proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.''
Obama was right to reach for larger themes, tapping into American DNA, when he said, ''We do big things.'' And, ''We are poised for progress.'' Indeed, polls this week showed that Americans are more optimistic now than at any time in the last four years. Obama's task is to ride the better feelings, and take credit for them. Civility. Job creation. A call to American moments of greatness, past and present.
With a 9.4 percent unemployment rate, Obama put the business community on notice that they have to deliver on new jobs. The stock market is jumping, and has been since Obama was inaugurated. Corporate profits are at record highs. The titans of American capitalism that Obama has newly embraced owe him.
For Republicans, Tuesday night was a chance to show their newly sober side -- cuts, cuts and more cuts. Obama's call for a five-year-spending freeze is not good enough. It was trashed by Republican leaders before the first teleprompter went up under the Capitol Dome.
They want a return to 2008 spending levels. That sounds fine until construction stops on the new road in Ohio, or seniors have to give back something they got in the health care overhaul.
And then, there is Representative Bachmann. Most Democrats couldn't be more delighted that she was trying to steal the buttoned-down rebuttal of the class-debate champion Paul Ryan. As a face of the opposition, she's an answered prayer to the White House.
If Obama sticks with ''Winning the Future'' as a theme for the next six years, Republicans will have to do more than slash, cut, and turn down every request for a dream.
The shadows hanging over this speech were long, even for deep winter. There was John F. Kennedy's stirring inaugural, 50 years ago this month. There was the dawn of the centennial year of the birth of Ronald Reagan. There was the Tucson tragedy, and the call to civility that -- surprise! -- still resonates.
Obama tried to embrace all of that on a date night when nobody wanted to be alone.

HEADLINE: OBAMA PROPOSING BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO WIN THE FUTURE

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama challenged Americans on Tuesday night to unleash their creative spirit, set aside their partisan differences and come together around a common goal of outcompeting other nations in a rapidly shifting global economy.
In a State of the Union address to a newly divided Congress, Mr. Obama outlined what he called a plan to ''win the future'' -- a blueprint for spending in critical areas like education, high-speed rail, clean-energy technology and high-speed Internet to help the United States weather the unsettling impact of globalization and the challenge from emerging powers like China and India.
''The rules have changed,'' he said.
But at the same time he proposed budget-cutting measures, including a five-year freeze in spending on some domestic programs that he said would reduce the deficit by $400 billion over 10 years. 
Drawing a stark contrast between himself and Republicans, who are advocating immediate and deep cuts in spending, Mr. Obama laid out a philosophy of a government that could be more efficient but would still be necessary if the nation was to address fundamental challenges at home and abroad.
''We need to out-innovate, outeducate and outbuild the rest of the world,'' he said. ''We have to make America the best place on earth to do business. We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government. That's how our people will prosper.''
Just weeks after the shooting in Tucson that claimed six lives and left Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, gravely injured, Mr. Obama received a reception that was muted and civil.
There were no boos or a shout of ''You lie!'' as in speeches past. Many Republicans and Democrats sat side by side -- the first time anyone here can remember such mixing -- and nearly all wore black-and-white lapel ribbons in honor of the dead and injured. Ms. Giffords's colleagues held a seat open for her.
The president's speech, lasting slightly more than an hour, lacked the loft of the inspirational address he delivered in Tucson days after the shooting. But it seemed intended to elevate his presidency above the bare-knuckled legislative gamesmanship that has defined the first two years of his term.
Reaching out to Republicans who have vowed to end the pet projects known as ''earmarks,'' Mr. Obama pledged to veto any bill that contained them. He tried to defuse partisan anger over his health care measure with humor, saying he had ''heard rumors'' of concerns over the bill, and he reiterated his pledge to fix a tax provision in the measure that both parties regard as burdensome to businesses.
He drew sustained applause when he declared that colleges should open their doors to military recruiters and R.O.T.C. programs now that ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'' the policy barring gay men and lesbians from serving openly, has been repealed.
And he tried to charm Republicans by weaving the new House speaker, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, into his narrative about American greatness, citing Mr. Boehner's rise from ''someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father's Cincinnati bar'' as an example of ''a country where anything is possible.''
Still, the good will lasted only so long. Moments after Mr. Obama finished speaking, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, delivered the official Republican response, in which he criticized Mr. Obama as doing too little to attack the deficit.
And Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who delivered her own Republican critique with the backing of the Tea Party wing, complained that instead of creating ''a leaner, smarter government,'' Mr. Obama had created ''a bureaucracy that tells us which light bulbs to buy.''
The president sought to use Tuesday night's address to shed the tag of big-government liberal that Republicans have placed on him, and to reclaim the mantle of a pragmatic, postpartisan leader that he used to ride to the presidency in 2008.
With one eye toward his 2012 re-election campaign, Mr. Obama offered a rosy economic vision. The president who once emphasized the problems he had inherited from his predecessor was instead looking forward and making the case that the nation had at long last emerged from economic crisis.
''Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.''
The speech was light on new policy proposals, reflecting both political and fiscal restraints on the administration after two years in which it achieved substantial legislative victories but lost the midterm elections, failed to bring the unemployment rate below 9 percent and watched the budget deficit rise sharply.
Mr. Obama did not address gun control, a hotly debated topic after the shooting in Tucson.
He did not lay out any specific plans for addressing the long-term costs of Social Security and Medicare, the biggest fiscal challenges ahead. He backed an overhaul of corporate taxes but spoke only in passing about the need to simplify the tax code for individuals. He called for legislation to address illegal immigration but provided no details.
He called for an end to subsidies for oil companies and set a goal of reducing dependence on polluting fuels over the next quarter-century, but without any mechanism to enforce it. And in a speech largely devoted to economic issues, he talked only generally about the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
As he drew a contrast between the United States and other nations, Mr. Obama gave a nod to the nation's high unemployment rate, arguing that ''the world has changed'' and that it was no longer as easy as it once was for Americans to find a good and secure job.
Government itself, he said, needs to be updated for the information age. ''We can't win the future with a government of the past,'' he said.
He packaged his message in optimistic, almost nationalistic phrasing, saying the country had always risen to challenges.
''So yes, the world has changed,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn't discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember, for all the hits we've taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world.''
He continued: ''No workers are more productive than ours. No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventers and entrepreneurs. We are home to the world's best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any other place on earth.''
Mr. Obama outlined initiatives in five areas: innovation; education; infrastructure; deficit reduction; and a more efficient federal bureaucracy. He pledged to increase the nation's spending on research and development, as a share of the total economy, to the highest levels since John F. Kennedy was president, and vowed to prepare an additional 100,000 science and math teachers over the next 10 years.
He proposed new efforts on high-speed rail, road and airport construction and a ''national wireless initiative'' that, administration officials said, would extend the next generation of wireless coverage to 98 percent of the population.
''Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped,'' Mr. Obama said. ''South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do. China is building faster trains and newer airports.''
Saying it was imperative for the nation to tackle its deficit, Mr. Obama reiterated his support for $78 billion in cuts to the Pentagon's budget over five years, in addition to the five-year partial freeze on domestic spending. But he did not adopt any of the recommendations of the bipartisan fiscal commission he appointed to figure out ways to bring the deficit under control.
Mr. Obama headed into the speech in surprisingly good political shape, given the drubbing Democrats took in the November elections. His job approval ratings are up -- in some polls, higher than 50 percent. The public is feeling more optimistic about the economy, voters are giving Mr. Obama credit for reaching out to Republicans in a bipartisan way, and the president won high marks for his speech in Tucson after the shooting.
''There's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday night. ''Amid all the noise and passions and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater -- something more consequential than party or political preference.''

HEADLINE: 3M Profit Falls to $928 Million, Though Sales Increased 9.6 %

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The 3M Company said on Tuesday that profitability suffered last quarter as more spending for advertising and research ate into margins, and warned that rising costs for raw materials would put pressure on its bottom line. 
3M, the diversified manufacturer known for its tape and other office products, also reported a fourth-quarter profit of $928 million, or $1.28 a share, compared with $935 million, or $1.30 a share, a year earlier.
Sales rose 9.6 percent, to $6.7 billion, lifted by especially strong growth in Asia and Latin America. Analysts, on average, had expected 3M, which is based in St. Paul, to report a profit of $1.27 a share on sales of $6.6 billion, Thomson Reuters said.
In a sign of 3M's caution, it said it planned to hold back discretionary spending to protect its margins in the face of rising raw material costs, higher pension costs and tax rates, and a lackluster economic recovery in the United States, where a high unemployment rate and chronic weakness in the housing market have soured consumer sentiment.
Even so, 3M raised its forecast for 2011 earnings to a range of $5.95 to $6.20 a share, up from a previous forecast of $5.90 to $6.10. It earned $5.63 a share in 2010.
3M shares closed down $1.82, or 2 percent, at $88.50.

HEADLINE: Packers' Coach Has Fans In a Small Slice of Steelertown

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH -- Down at the bottom of the hill, not far from the river and near where a steel mill buzzed for generations, the place has not changed much in the years since it was called Joe McCarthy's. There is still a long bar on the left, a pool table in the middle and Steelers posters decorating the walls.
Near the pull-lever cigarette machine is an autographed photo of Green Bay Packers Coach Mike McCarthy, who was raised a couple of miles away at the upper end of Greenfield Avenue and as a teenager helped out at the family bar. Scattered around the place on Monday night were people who, despite being born and raised in this blue-collar neighborhood with views of downtown, will be rooting for Green Bay to beat their Steelers in the Super Bowl on Feb. 6.
''We've been waiting for this,'' said Bernie O'Connor, sipping a beer and eating 50-cent chicken wings, a Monday night special. ''We can't lose.'' 
O'Connor is a cousin of Mike McCarthy's; their mothers are sisters.
''If you're related, you root for the Packers,'' he said. On his bar stool rested a leather Steelers jacket.
The can't-lose approach is a popular one in the Greenfield neighborhood, a wedge of Pittsburgh that rises from the Monongahela River and widens along a two-mile uphill stretch of Greenfield Avenue. The area is squeezed between other neighborhoods like Hazelwood and Squirrel Hill.
This is fervent Steelers territory. It is fervent McCarthy territory, too. In Greenfield, it is far more difficult to find someone who does not know McCarthy than someone who does.
''If the Steelers lose, it'll at least feel good that he won,'' Tim Zielmanski said. He wore a Steelers cap and told stories of McCarthy, a former classmate and basketball teammate.
McCarthy is more than a hero to Greenfield's roughly 8,000 residents. He is a friend, a neighbor, a cousin, a brother or a son.
Joe and Ellen McCarthy, parents of Mike and his four siblings, were raised in the neighborhood. They still live on the upper end of Greenfield Avenue. Like a smattering of houses in the neighborhood, theirs displays their counterallegiance openly -- in this case, with a green-and-gold scarf that reads ''Go Pack Go'' wrapped around a Christmas wreath on the front door.
Mike McCarthy, 47, was born and raised here, a devoted Steelers fan from the Steel Curtain days in the 1970s. His father was a Pittsburgh police officer, then a firefighter. For a time, the family owned a bar and grill that provided postshift fuel for workers at a couple of nearby mills.
The mills are gone, and a freeway hums high above the little valley, but the old family bar that sits inside a nondescript little house survives. It is now called Chasers in the Run.
Everyone there, it seemed, had a Mike McCarthy connection. Duke Lamanti played baseball with him as a boy. (''Family,'' Lamanti said in describing McCarthy. ''He'd take his shirt off his back for you. Well mannered, just the way his parents taught him to be.'')
A woman handed over a cellphone and said her brother was on the other end; it was Jim Gregg, who coached McCarthy and countless other boys in grade school over the past 40 years. (''One thing about Mike -- he never forgot where he came from,'' Gregg said.)
A man asked if one of McCarthy's high school football coaches at Bishop Boyle should be summoned. Minutes later, Tim Kelly walked through the door wearing a Property of Green Bay Packers sweatshirt. (''I think I'm going to have to root for the Packers,'' he said. ''But it's a win-win.'')
When McCarthy was not playing sports -- not often -- he helped at the bar, everything from pouring beers to cleaning the bathroom. Through eighth grade, he attended St. Rosalia Catholic school, built in 1912, where he led Gregg's basketball team to a 39-1 record one season.
A bit farther up the road is Magee Field, with basketball courts and a swimming pool where McCarthy and his friends whiled away their summers. Visible from the street, large painted letters across the front of the bleachers proclaim Greenfield ''a fine residential community.''
The neighborhood is tightly lined with houses built in the first half of the last century along a tangle of impossibly steep streets. The houses are filled with people who have ties that go back several generations. The web is bisected by Greenfield Avenue, a curvy two-lane road lined with everything from auto shops to well-manicured brick homes.
Bill Smith has lived in Greenfield since third grade, and his ties to the neighborhood date to his grandparents. Now in his 50s, he is the executive director of the Greenfield Organization, a community center on Greenfield Avenue that does everything from sponsoring food drives to providing tax assistance. The organization also publishes a monthly neighborhood newspaper.
(How small is the world in Greenfield? Smith's 8-year-old daughter is coached in basketball by one of McCarthy's three sisters and her husband.)
When McCarthy was growing up in the 1970s, Smith said: ''It was all big families. There were tons of kids. I had five brothers and sisters. Mike comes from a big family. You had families with 8 or 10 kids in them. It was a different time.''
Then the last part of the J & L steel mill closed, part of an industrial downturn that temporarily crippled the Pittsburgh area. But Greenfield suffered less than most areas. Families served as anchors in the stormy economy. Greenfield's location, just a few minutes southeast of downtown and near the city's university and hospital district, made it appealing. Housing prices remain cheaper than in neighboring Squirrel Hill, seen as more of a bastion of white-collar workers.
''A lot of places in America, especially in the Rust Belt, full neighborhoods packed up and disappeared,'' said Doug Shields, a Pittsburgh councilman whose district includes Greenfield. ''Greenfield didn't.''
Like any urban area, though, it could always use more help. And McCarthy is revered, in part, for doing his share.
He left in the 1980s to play tight end in college, ultimately at Baker University in Kansas. His first coaching break came when Pittsburgh's Paul Hackett let him be a volunteer assistant in 1989.
To make ends meet, McCarthy worked as a toll collector on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. But he followed Hackett to the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993, when Hackett became Marty Schottenheimer's offensive coordinator. McCarthy built his resume with stops in Green Bay, New Orleans and San Francisco before the Packers hired him as the coach in 2006.
McCarthy donates $100,000 a year to his old neighborhood. Some goes to the Greenfield Organization. Some goes to the Greenfield Baseball Association. Most of it goes for tuition assistance to St. Rosalia, which has 175 students from preschool through eighth grade. ''It has been a blessing -- a complete blessing,'' said Sarah Tonski, the principal.
In the school's entry is a framed 2007 letter from McCarthy, on Packers letterhead, thanking the students for naming him a ''distinguished graduate.'' Next to that is a photograph of McCarthy on the Green Bay sideline. He signed it and wrote, ''St. Rosalia -- No place like home.''
But signs of the neighborhood's conflicting emotions are everywhere. McCarthy's autographed photo hangs outside Tonski's office, near a placard that reads ''Here We Go, Steelers.'' Tonski proclaimed next Tuesday as Gold Day, a time for students to shed their school uniforms and wear their true colors -- blue and gold for St. Rosalia, black and gold for the Steelers or green and gold for the Packers.
On the windows of the sixth-grade class, in large block letters on construction paper, students had spelled out ''Go Steelers'' and ''Go Packers.''
The people at the old bar are comfortable with their rooting ambivalence. To them, the potential sting of a Steelers loss to Green Bay is mitigated by the thrill of a neighborhood boy hoisting the Super Bowl trophy.
''This way,'' said O'Connor, McCarthy's cousin, ''we're assured a win.''

 BODY:
THE WEALTHY ELITE Intentionally or not, the World Economic Forum will focus attention on one of the most striking consequences of the technological revolution and the spread of globalization that has transformed the world economy in the last 30 years or so: the emergence of an international economic elite whose globe-trotting members have largely pulled away from their compatriots. 
The trend is particularly stark in the United States, where from 1980 to 2005 more than 80 percent of the total increase in income went to the top 1 percent of the population. The gap there between the super-rich and everybody else is now greater than at any time since before the Depression of the 1930s. CHRYSTIA FREELAND
A PUSH FOR TRANSPARENCY Striking the right balance between public and private, between transparency and discretion, can be a challenge for the World Economic Forum, whose invitation-only annual meeting in Davos gathers a cross section of the world's corporate and political elite.
With governments and companies around the world shaken by the release of confidential documents via the antisecrecy Web site WikiLeaks, the issue of transparency has become more than just an organizational matter at the forum this year, but a topic of discussion itself. ERIC PFANNER
THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED The forum's 110-page program is by turns exciting and daunting. From Tuesday night through Sunday, hundreds of sessions cover myriad subjects. And it just isn't possible, as a practical matter, to attend them all, because many overlap. So what's a Davos Delegate to do?
Most of the panels have compelling, if predictable, topics. But while perusing the program, we occasionally came across an offbeat session that had nothing to do with global trade, monetary policy or world hunger. Those talks appear to raise the cool factor at Davos, appealing to the attendees' inner hipsters -- or at least their liberal arts degrees. Panels include ''Film's Power to Revitalize Culture Economies and Hope,'' with Robert De Niro, and ''Exploring the Extremes,'' with Chesley B. Sullenberger III, the US Airways pilot who executed an emergency landing in the Hudson River.

HEADLINE: Alternative Rock Festival Is Moving to Jersey Shore

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
When All Tomorrow's Parties, a British alternative music festival known for its connoisseur taste and noncorporate, mom-and-pop leadership style, came to the New York area in 2008, its organizers chose an unusual spot: Kutsher's Country Club in Monticello, N.Y., one of the last old Catskills resorts, whose aging facilities brought some charm and kitsch to louder-than-loud shows by bands like My Bloody Valentine and Sunn O))).
But after three years, Kutsher's charm has worn thin. 
This year All Tomorrow's Parties is moving to Asbury Park, N.J., and its three-day lineup, beginning on Sept. 30, includes two big bookings that confirm the festival's reputation for returning lost heroes to the spotlight. Jeff Mangum of the band Neutral Milk Hotel will play his first major show in a decade, and the British trip-hop band Portishead will make its first East Coast appearance in 13 years.
The events will be held at the Convention Hall and the adjacent Paramount Theater, on the Asbury Park boardwalk.
Barry Hogan and Deborah Kee Higgins, the married couple who run the festival, say that leaving Kutsher's is painful but necessary.
''It was deteriorating into a state where it wasn't kitschy and funny anymore,'' Ms. Higgins said. ''It was a little bit beyond the pale.''
Economics was also a factor. Kutsher's location off the beaten path, and its relatively small concert capacity, meant that costs were high and the potential return was low. Its total capacity was 3,000, but last year only 2,300 people attended. By contrast, the Convention Hall in Asbury Park holds 3,600 people, and the Paramount 1,600.
Kutsher's did not respond to a phone call requesting comment.
Mr. Mangum's appearance, at the Paramount, is one of the most anticipated events in indie rock in years. His band's 1998 album, ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,'' has become a classic of the genre, but the group went on hiatus not long afterward, and Mr. Mangum largely withdrew from the public eye. When he made a brief appearance at a New York benefit show last May, audience members openly wept.
When asked how he secured the booking, Mr. Hogan said, ''constant persistence.''
Mr. Mangum's appearance will be available only to holders of full three-day passes. To avoid accusations of exploiting his fans -- this is indie rock, after all, not big business -- the organizers will put on a second, nonfestival appearance on Oct. 3, also at the Paramount.
Mr. Hogan and Ms. Higgins had originally chosen Kutsher's because it allowed them to recreate the sleep-away-camp character of their British events. But with no resort connected to the theaters, this aspect will be lost, so the concerts are being labeled as a sister event, All Tomorrow's Parties Presents I'll Be Your Mirror. (It's another Velvet Underground reference, the B-side of the ''All Tomorrow's Parties'' single from 1966.)
All Tomorrow's Parties' various festivals have been popular with musicians, who often credit the organization's passionate founders and the events' lack of corporate sponsorship -- and the discriminating tastes of its audience -- as factors in deciding to play at them.
Portishead, which played the Coachella festival in California in 2008 but has not played anywhere on the East Coast since 1998, is helping to program two of the three nights. In an interview on Tuesday, Geoff Barrow, a member and producer of Portishead, said the decision to play an All Tomorrow's Parties event was simple.
''If we were going somewhere to watch music, A.T.P. would be it,'' Mr. Barrow said. ''They're people who really enjoy left-of-center music. And you won't find people filming the first song on their phones and then talking the rest of the gig.''
Tickets for the festival go on sale Friday at atpfestival.com.

HEADLINE: China, Once Suspect on Emissions, Is Rapidly Becoming a Clean-Energy Power

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
For years, China was seen as a major obstacle to global efforts to combat climate change because of its refusal to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.
Now, for some, the concern is not that China is moving too slowly but that it is rushing ahead so fast that clean-energy companies in the West will be left in the dust.
Demands on China for verifiable monitoring of emissions have been a long-running source of tension in climate negotiations. They helped to sour the mood at the United Nations climate meeting in Copenhagen a year ago, which broke up in acrimony after poorer countries balked at accepting limits on their emissions. 
Heading into 2011, however, there were some surprising signs of renewed movement in efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions.
A United Nations climate meeting in December in Mexico pleased many environmentalists by putting global talks back on track. And this month, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research group, reported that investors had injected a record $243 billion into cleaner sources of energy in 2010 as the rising price of oil gave a lift to the prospects for renewable and low-carbon alternatives.
With the gloomy atmosphere dissipating, organizers at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said this week that they expected business leaders were ready to pay attention again to climate issues.
The meeting in Mexico showed an ''enhanced spirit of cooperation'' on cutting emissions, said Caio Koch-Weser, who leads sustainability initiatives for the forum and is vice chairman of the Deutsche Bank Group. And the clean-energy sector ''has never been more dynamic than it is today,'' he said.
But along with such optimism, there is also mounting anxiety about which countries - and whose companies - will benefit from the clean-energy boom. As financially struggling governments in Europe and the United States trim support for clean-energy development, emerging countries, led by China, have been pouring state resources into the sector.
China represents ''a huge challenge'' for established clean-energy businesses, said Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's commissioner for climate action. ''We can never subsidize it as much as they would do in China.''
She said that China was preparing a five-year plan that would be the clearest indication yet of its determination to become a clean-energy powerhouse. European nations would need to ''pool our efforts better'' to remain competitive, said Ms. Hedegaard, who is expected to attend the forum.
Investment in clean energy in China rose 30 percent last year, to $51.1 billion - by far the largest figure for a single country - and represented more than 20 percent of the total global investment of $243 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
At the same time, the issue of clean-energy subsidies in China is at the heart of an investigation the Obama administration started in December. The administration is looking at bringing a case against China, including accusations about manufacturing subsidies for wind turbines, before the World Trade Organization.
This month, in what looked like a countermove, President Obama signed a law that contained a ''buy American'' provision for Defense Department purchases of solar panels.
The European Commission has raised concerns with China about access to rare earth minerals and other elements used in clean-energy industries, including the manufacturing of electric cars. But so far, the commission has taken no formal action on trade in the wind and solar industries.
Not everyone sees China's drive to dominate the clean-energy sector as worrisome.
''China is moving so far into the lead'' on a number of clean-energy technologies ''that we don't have to worry as much about whether they'll really keep their commitments because they have a commercial drive to do it,'' said Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group in Washington.
The surge of investment in climate-related industries, as well as growing concerns about extreme weather, should deliver significant business opportunities in the coming year, and not just in China.
Vincent Mages, a director for climate change initiatives at Lafarge, the giant cement company based in France, said catastrophic flooding in Australia and Pakistan and a scorching summer heat wave in Russia should be good for businesses like his.
Cities and regions grappling with a changing climate increasingly need the kinds of products made by Lafarge, he said, to make buildings and infrastructure more energy-efficient and robust.
But, he added, Europe and the United States could do more to support domestic industries by adopting tougher rules for new buildings and retrofittings now, rather than setting goals that are decades away for cutting emissions or adopting renewable power.
''China talks about programs and policies rather than focusing on targets,'' Mr. Mages said. ''We focus on targets too much.''
The main tool most governments in the developed world are counting on to cut emissions and drive investment into climate-related industries is carbon trading, also known as cap and trade. The European Union established its system six years ago. Its goal is to cut emissions by one-fifth from 1990 levels by 2020.
Carbon trading has run into obstacles in Europe, where the system has been rocked by extreme volatility, computer attacks, tax fraud, recycling of used credits and suspicions of profiteering.
In Australia, Japan and South Korea, governments that have supported carbon trading have been delayed by political concerns.
Mr. Koch-Weser said he believed that ''shortcomings'' in international carbon trading could be overcome, adding that he saw no need to invalidate any existing carbon credits.
He also said business leaders at the World Economic Forum would push for progress on a Green Climate Fund for countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which could help to channel $100 billion each year by the end of the decade.
The committee running that fund should include representatives from the private sector and multilateral lenders, he said.
Failure to raise that money, he said, would ''reinforce mistrust and breed cynicism'' in the developing world before the next round of global climate talks, in Durban, South Africa, in November.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumer Confidence Higher in January

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Consumer Confidence Index rose in January to its highest level in eight months as Americans grew a little more self-assured about the job market and business conditions. 
The Conference Board said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index climbed to 60.6 this month, up from 53.3 in December. While that reading was better than economists had expected, confidence is still far from the 90 level that signals a healthy consumer mindset.
The January figure was the highest last May's 62.7. At that time, consumer attitudes were improving as economic growth seemed to be taking off. However, the economy stalled in the summer, and so did confidence.
Confidence has been depressed by unemployment that surged during the country's worst recession since the 1930s and has stayed stubbornly high even though the downturn ended in June 2009. Confidence has not been above 90 since the recession began in December 2007.
But moods may be lifting a bit. A new survey from the National Association for Business Economics reported Monday that the number of companies expressing positive hiring plans was at its highest level in 12 years.
In the Conference Board survey, the percentage of people surveyed who felt jobs were hard to get fell slightly, to 43.4 percent from 46 percent in December. The share who expected to see more jobs six months from now rose to 16 percent from 14.2 percent.
While confidence has stayed weak since the recession ended in summer 2009, consumer spending has been picking up. During the 2010 holiday shopping season, sales increased at the fastest rate in six years.
Economists are hoping that consumer confidence will keep improving as the economy begins to show greater signs of strength and unemployment declines.
The jobless rate fell to 9.4 percent in December from 9.8 percent in November, but the economy added only 103,000 jobs. Employers added 1.1 million jobs for all of 2010, or about 94,000 a month. The nation still has 7.2 million fewer jobs than it did in December 2007, when the recession began.
But many economists expect the nation will create twice as many jobs this year as it did last year. They note that people who still have jobs are not as worried about losing them as they might have been a year ago, and that people are spending more.

HEADLINE: In Split Vote, S.E.C. Adopts Rules on Corporate Pay

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News8:38 p.m. Updated
The Securities and Exchange Commission took aim at lavish corporate pay on Tuesday, enacting new rules that give shareholders a voice on salaries, bonuses and so-called golden parachutes.
While these ''say on pay'' rules let investors vote on executive compensation at publicly traded companies, boards do not necessarily have to listen since the votes are considered nonbinding. 
The rules, which the S.E.C. first proposed in October, passed in a 3-2 vote. The two Republicans on the commission, Kathleen L. Casey and Troy A. Paredes, opposed the changes, calling them too costly for smaller companies.
''I believe the say-on-pay rules we are adopting today are unduly restrictive and impose unnecessary burdens, particularly on smaller reporting companies, with minimal corresponding benefits for investors,'' Ms. Casey said Tuesday.
In an effort to compromise, the agency agreed to delay instating the rules until 2013 for businesses where public investors hold less than $75 million of shares. Other public companies will have to put their compensation to a vote at annual meetings this year.
''I believe that this two-year deferral is a balanced and responsible way for the commission to ensure that its rules do not disproportionately burden small issuers,'' Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., said in a statement.
The measures are the latest rules born from the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul enacted in July. Lawmakers are hoping to discourage companies from awarding lucrative packages that encourage risky behavior - a chief criticism of firms like Lehman Brothers and American International Group that collapsed during the financial crisis. Pay remains a central concern on Wall Street, with big banks still reporting large compensation figures in the latest round of earnings.
''Excessive executive compensation is an ongoing outrage,'' Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said in a recent letter to the S.E.C.
The issue has become a thorny one for the agency. It received more than 60 public comment letters about its shareholder voting proposal and has had 15 meetings about executive pay rules with groups including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the New York Stock Exchange. After the lobbying period, the S.E.C. left its original proposal largely intact.
The rules require shareholder votes to take place at least once every three years, although investors can opt to increase the frequency. The agency also mandated separate nonbinding votes on golden parachutes, which is compensation promised to executives in the event that they lose their jobs through a company merger. The companies must disclose in public filings whether they followed shareholders' wishes.
Although the shareholders' votes are only symbolic, dissension among a majority of investors could embarrass a company. And if a company does not adjust its ways, directors may not get re-elected.
''If executive compensation plans are not approved, it will be big news and we can expect companies to respond,'' said James D. C. Barrall, a partner at the law firm Latham & Watkins, where he leads the firm's benefits and executive compensation group. Mr. Barrall added that such occurrences would be ''fairly rare.''
In recent years, dozens of companies have voluntarily adopted say-on-pay rules. But shareholders at only a handful of companies, including Motorola, have contested compensation packages, according to Mr. Barrall.
The new pay rules were among several Dodd-Frank items on the S.E.C.'s agenda for Tuesday.
The agency's commissioners also unanimously agreed to propose rules to heighten scrutiny of hedge funds. The proposal would require hedge fund advisers to report detailed information about their exposure to various assets.
The S.E.C. on Tuesday also proposed rules that would raise the bar for investing in private offerings. To buy such products, which are exempt from reporting requirements, investors must be ''accredited'' - meaning they have a net worth of at least $1 million. Under the S.E.C.'s proposal, the calculation would exclude the value of an investor's primary residence.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China's Challenges Are Expected to Be a Hot Topic in Davos

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI - The seemingly unstoppable rise of China has long been high on the agenda at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This year, though, the discussion is likely to include a greater focus on major challenges facing the country.
China is already the world's biggest exporter and the second-largest economy after the United States. The country has $2.9 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and is pushing to build its first aircraft carrier and land a spacecraft on the moon within two years.
But there are also potential problems ahead in 2011. At home, there are growing worries about inflation, including rising property prices and the possibility that a widening income gap between the rich and the poor could threaten social stability.
On the international front, China is struggling with trade friction over its currency policy and coming off what analysts say was a year of diplomatic missteps. 
Minxin Pei, who teaches political science at Claremont McKenna College in California, said China undermined its standing last year with a more assertive and erratic posture in foreign affairs.
Among other things, he said, China needlessly confronted the United States over the sale of weapons to Taiwan, berated Japan for its decision to detain the captain of a Chinese fishing trawler and lashed out at the West in an exaggerated way after Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese dissident.
''This may reflect the nature of the regime and its autocratic system,'' Dr. Pei said. ''But in the end, they're pragmatists. They're not led by blind megalomaniacs. So there may be some adjustments. There is some hope.''
Sensing discord in its foreign relations, China has responded in recent months with what some analysts see as a series of charm offensives.
Delegations of high-ranking Chinese leaders have traveled to world capitals to sign multibillion-dollar trade and investment deals. In Europe this month, Chinese leaders pledged to support the euro, in part by buying the sovereign debt of some weakened euro zone members.
And when President Hu Jintao of China visited Washington last week, China signed business deals that promised to create a quarter-million American jobs. Beijing also tried a dose of soft power by releasing a promotional video showing positive images of China and Chinese celebrities. The images are being broadcast on giant television screens in Times Square in New York.
But those efforts had been undermined by diplomatic stances that seem increasingly hardheaded, said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society in New York.
''There's a muscular resistance to any kind of cooperation that might seem like yielding to U.S. demands and interests,'' Mr. Schell said. ''For the last hundred years, China has wanted to be in the position where it's not pushed around. And now they are close to that.
''It should be a sweet moment. But when such cooperation even so much as hints at submission, it becomes difficult. Especially at a high, visible level, this concern makes the give-and-take that is essential in working out common problems very difficult.''
Other analysts say the United States and Europe need to accept some of the blame for souring relations. Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said the West often demonized China, and Western leaders tended to lecture the Chinese in a way that could be seen as disrespectful and was likely to fan resentment among Chinese officials.
''The West is terrified because they've dominated history for the past 200 years and now China's emerging,'' Mr. Mahbubani said. ''But we should all recognize that a multipolar world is much better than a unipolar world.''
Still, the ruling Communist Party's chief concerns this year are internal, analysts say. Top among them are maintaining strong economic growth, which helps improve the livelihood of its citizens and also reduces the likelihood of social instability and challenges to the party.
To strengthen the economy, the government has promised to rein in inflation and soaring property prices. Several big cities are considering new property taxes. And local governments have announced plans to build more low-income housing.
Many economists have forecast another year of stellar economic growth, with the Chinese economy expected to grow about 9 percent. Yet concerns remain about overly aggressive lending by state-run banks.
Since early 2009, Chinese banks have engaged in a record lending spree that has helped back state-owned companies and financed huge infrastructure and property projects. Analysts say the policies probably encouraged loose lending standards, which could increase the likelihood of a sharp rise in nonperforming loans - something that seriously threatened state-run banks less than a decade ago.
The government has also pledged to revamp the economy, moving away from a heavy reliance on exports and government investment and toward more domestic consumption.
Chinese leaders are supporting efforts to increase the wages of average workers and are encouraging more investment in inland provinces, which have lagged far behind the nation's coastal cities.
But getting Chinese consumers to spend more will not be easy, analysts say, particularly in a nation with a relatively weak social safety net.
Another barrier to change is what some analysts say is a quiet shift in government policy away from market-oriented changes toward ones that back state-owned companies and so-called national champions.
Two recently published books argue that China has been moving away from Western-style capitalism toward what is called state capitalism, in which the government and state-owned companies team up to dominate business and the economy and compete with multinational corporations from abroad.
In ''Red Capitalism,'' Carl E. Walter and Fraser J.T. Howie, wrote that the Chinese government's efforts to change the nation's banks and financial system had stalled from 2003 to 2005 as various government agencies battled for control over the banking system.
While the outside world sees a vibrant Chinese stock market, splashy initial public offerings and new billionaires - all ostensibly signs of an increasingly market-oriented economy - the reality, they say, is a system in which the state manipulates the markets to raise huge sums of money and then forces the banking system to make wasteful loans to state-owned companies.
The real turning point came after the financial crisis, when China lost confidence in Wall Street's financial model, said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, and author of ''The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations?'' China then began adopting a system that allowed the state to use its assets to move markets and strengthen support at home.
This, Mr. Bremmer said, will greatly alter the relationship between China and Western countries like the United States, generating more conflicts over jobs and market access.
''This has certainly changed the calculus,'' Mr. Bremmer said in an interview. ''This means the most important economic relationship in the world will become an increasingly zero-sum game.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Development Agency Plans Suit Over Former Deutsche Building

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The last chapter in the tortured tale of the former Deutsche Bank building near ground zero will play out in court now that the 41-story office tower has finally been dismantled. 
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation plans to file a $100 million claim in State Supreme Court in Manhattan next week against Bovis Lend Lease, the construction manager it hired more than five years ago for a job that was supposed to be completed in June 2007.
If successful, the lawsuit would pare the taxpayers' bill to about $57 million for a project that ultimately cost $266 million, more than twice the original estimate. Two former insurers of the tower -- AXA and Allianz -- agreed a year ago to pay $102.4 million toward the total cost. And this month, the corporation settled an asbestos case against Deutsche Bank, the former owner of the building, for $3.8 million.
''We will do everything within our power to ensure that we recover what is owed to the taxpayers and put it to use downtown, where there are still many unmeet needs,'' said Avi Schick, chairman of the development corporation.
Bovis, which declined to comment, filed its own lawsuit six months ago claiming that it had been shortchanged at least $80 million for work it was ordered to do in decontaminating and demolishing the building.
Almost nothing has gone according to plan with the building, which was one of the nation's most expensive and long-running demolition projects, finally finishing this month. The north side of the tower was heavily damaged during the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
The development corporation bought the building in 2004 and hired Bovis under an $82 million contract to oversee its demolition. The project was plagued by lengthy delays, political squabbling and a fire that killed two firefighters in 2007.
Bovis narrowly avoided being indicted in that blaze. The company is also at the center of an investigation by the United State attorney in Brooklyn into allegations of overcharges on 100 public-works projects.
The development corporation's lawsuit will seek to recover money it advanced to Bovis as part of a 2007 agreement to get the stalled project moving, as well as certain costs for which Bovis may have obtained insurance payments.
The corporation is expected to turn the site over to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey next month.

HEADLINE: Board Backs Development of Site on Lower East Side With Housing

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
After sitting fallow for 43 years as the Lower East Side's popularity soared, a desolate stretch of parking lots along Delancey Street is closer than ever to being transformed into housing and shops, marking the end of a long and bitter stalemate over the future of the sites. 
On Tuesday night, Community Board 3 voted unanimously in favor of guidelines to develop the five parcels, collectively known as the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area.
Under the guidelines, the properties would become the site of about 1,000 housing units -- roughly half of which would be allocated to middle- and low-income earners -- along with retail shops, green space and, potentially, a school.
On Monday, after a subcommittee approved the guidelines, the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, whose district includes the land, gave the plan crucial support. ''The final guidelines that were approved by the committee tonight strike an appropriate balance between the needs and concerns of all stakeholders,'' Mr. Silver said in a statement, ''and will result in a development that will ensure our neighborhood continues to thrive.''
The parcels have sat undeveloped since 1967, when the city razed 14 tenement buildings on them and displaced their 2,000 residents in the name of urban renewal. Various development plans were paralyzed by deep disagreements over what the sites ought to become.
Some residents argued that they should be reserved for low-income families to preserve the neighborhood's flavor and recapture people forced out by Manhattan's nosebleed rents. Nearby property owners said the neighborhood had more than its fair share of low-rent apartments.
''For 40 years, it has divided this community,'' said David McWater, chairman of the task force.
Few local residents like the parking lots; one has called them ''psychological and physical barriers'' isolating the neighborhood. Community leaders began tackling the development issue anew in 2008, having won a rezoning campaign to restrict the height of buildings in a 110-block area of the Lower East Side.
At a public hearing that preceded the vote, community members and advocates affirmed their hope that the housing be allocated solely for low- and middle-income families, a concept that others described as economically unfeasible. According to Mr. McWater, the site would house 1,500 low- and middle-income earners and create jobs for up to 700 people. The Essex Street Market sits on one of the sites, and could be moved as the parcels are developed, a prospect greeted with much local dismay.
The plan will now go to various city agencies for approval.
State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, whose district includes the site, said it would probably be a year and a half before the City Council would vote on the plan. He also cited a milestone, saying ''a unanimous vote on the Lower East Side may be a first.''

HEADLINE: Con Ed Manager Is Charged With Accepting Kickbacks

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Updated, 5:01 p.m. A Consolidated Edison manager has been charged with accepting some $4 million in kickbacks from a contractor, federal prosecutors announced on Tuesday.
The manager, Sassine Razzouk, 53, oversaw the creation of plans and designs for control systems at Con Ed generating plants, and solicited and took the payments from a contractor performing work under contracts he supervised, according to the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn. 
The payments made by the contractor, Rudell & Associates of Queens, went to a shell company Mr. Razzouk controlled called MDM Capital, prosecutors said. According to court documents (see complaint below), MDM's disbursements included $2.7 million in checks to Mr. Razzouk, $115,000 to pay his American Express bill, $75,000 for payments on two Mercedeses, $71,000 to his mother, $23,000 to his daughter, $56,000 for the taxes on his second home in Marlboro, N.J., $65,000 in income taxes and $200,000 to a company Mr. Razzouk owned called Heavenly American Yogurt.
Mr. Razzouk, of Staten Island, who has worked for Con Ed since 1984 and makes $150,000 a year, faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. The case against him stems from the same investigation that led to 10 Con Ed supervisors being charged in 2009 with taking more than $1 million in kickbacks. After the arrests, prosecutors said, Mr. Razzouk had Rudell make payments to MDM through an intermediary company in order to obscure the money trail, prosecutors said.
Rudell & Associates has not been charged in the scheme, but prosecutors declined to say whether the company would face charges. ''It's an active investigation,'' said Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District.
Rudell, for its efforts, was paid $18 million under contracts supervised by Mr. Razzouk, prosecutors said. Rudell would grossly underbid competitors to win contracts, but after the contracts were awarded, payments to Rudell would be greatly increased through approval of added-on expenses by Mr. Razzouk, prosecutors said.
''In these most difficult of economic times,'' Ms. Lynch said in a statement, ''the defendant allegedly perpetrated a scheme of staggering proportions for his personal financial gain, the cost of which will ultimately be borne by the city's utility payers.''
In a statement, Con Edison said the arrest was ''an outgrowth of our cooperation with the U.S. attorney's office and our new and more aggressive internal auditing procedures'' put in place since the earlier arrests. The utility said it would ''seek full recovery of any misappropriated funds.''

HEADLINE: New Arena For the Nets Is Sprouting In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
Jason Kidd was the Nets' All-Star point guard when he attended the naming ceremony for the organization's new arena in Brooklyn four years ago. Since then, Kidd's home has changed, and so has the Nets' since they vacated the Izod Center in the Meadowlands after last season.
Last weekend he returned to New Jersey, as a point guard for the Dallas Mavericks, who played the Nets at their interim home at Prudential Center in Newark. 
By now, Kidd had expected a building in Brooklyn to go along with its name. On Saturday, he said that players could not consider the long-planned Barclays Center an incentive to joining the Nets.
''Unless it's built, you can't believe it,'' Kidd said. ''Until it's built, guys can't, won't believe it.''
Perhaps that reluctance influenced Carmelo Anthony, a Brooklyn native, in weighing the possibility of signing a contract extension with the Nets, a prerequisite to facilitating a trade from Denver. Those talks seemed to drag on for almost as long as the organization's proposed move to Brooklyn until the Nets' majority owner, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, broke off negotiations last week.
The developer Bruce C. Ratner sold his majority stake in the team to Prokhorov in 2010 after losing millions annually, but he remained as a minority owner. He is also the developer of the Barclays Center and the Atlantic Yards development, and said he understood Kidd's doubts -- even if they are now misguided.
After several years of legal wrangling and the economic downturn, the Barclays Center is finally and firmly on the way after ground was broken last year.
''It got delayed so much and there were so many false starts, 'I think we're there, I think we're there,' and then the economy got bad and this thing happened and that thing happened, so unless you read carefully, you don't realize how far along it is and that it's really on its way,'' Ratner said.
He spoke Tuesday from the 14th floor of a bank building across the street from the construction in Prospect Heights as snow fell and workers pieced together parts of the upper bowl. The arena, which is expected to open in the summer of 2012, will also host boxing, tennis and other events. The Nets will attempt to tap into the Knicks' stranglehold of New York City and have hired the marketing agency Translation, led by the former recording executive Steve Stoute, to promote the brand.
''I think Brooklyn has been waiting for this, really, since the Dodgers left,'' Ratner said.
The opposition that clogged the arena's path would probably disagree. Ratner -- a development partner of The New York Times in building its current headquarters -- once doubted that the arena would be built when the economy collapsed, but regained optimism once the Yankees gained financing for their new stadium.
Brett Yormark, the Nets' chief executive, said he expected no further delays.
''None whatsoever, and I don't have my blinders on because I'm open to see any and all obstacles,'' he said. ''But we're full speed ahead all the way.''
For Yormark, the chance to pitch something tangible finally replaces the burden of selling a long-delayed vision.
''I agree with him,'' he said of Kidd's comments. ''It's got to be tangible, and now it is. It's tangible. We're going to Brooklyn. The arena is being constructed.''
After the protracted negotiations for Anthony fell through, and after the Nets failed to lure LeBron James, Dwyane Wade or Chris Bosh during last summer's free agency, the building lacks a marquee name to open with. And the Nets, despite winning three of their last four games, are just 13-32.
But there is hope in the adage that if you (finally) build it, the players will come.
''Teams cycle in how good and bad they are,'' Ratner said. ''We had a very good period for six years. We made the playoffs for six years, and I think that the team will get good again because I think players will come to Brooklyn and to New York City.''

HEADLINE: Growth Agenda For Davos Forum

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON

 BODY:
The global economy is not as healthy as it looks. The International Monetary Fund now predicts 4.4 percent growth for 2011. But inflation has reared its ugly head across the globe, suggesting that many economies are growing faster than can be sustained without structural changes. Spurring on reform should be the main focus of the annual World Economic Forum gathering this week in Davos, Switzerland.
If one wants to look at the glass as half full, there are things to feel positive about. The American economy is growing smartly again; the I.M.F. predicts it will be 3 percent this year. China and India should each grow about 9 percent this year. Even the euro zone may be pulling itself out of crisis. 
But the glass is still very much half empty, too. America is growing rapidly only because it has engaged in loose monetary and fiscal policies. The monetary splurge has resulted in hot money spilling out across the world, which, in turn, is driving asset and consumer price inflation. And that is causing difficulties in emerging economies.
The fiscal profligacy, meanwhile, will have to be reined in or America will suffer its own sovereign debt crisis in a few years. The same goes for Japan, which is living on borrowed time and borrowed money.
China and India are trying to curb inflation. But each is moving gingerly.
Beijing is unwilling to allow the renminbi to appreciate significantly, something that would also help rebalance the flow of global trade.
And India is maintaining negative real interest rates, despite nudging policy rates up by an additional 25 basis points this week. Neither Asian giant wants to take action that would slow its rapid growth rate.
In the euro zone, the big question is Spain. If the authorities can regain credibility with investors, the crisis will end with Portugal. Creating a firewall in the Iberian Peninsula will, however, require Madrid to recapitalize its weak savings banks. The plan announced this week may work, but investors might conclude it is too little, too late.
After all, Madrid has estimated that a maximum of 20 billion euros ($27 billion) will be needed, whereas the estimates of independent analysts are clustering around 50 billion euros. What's more, even if the hot phase of the crisis ends, the periphery of Europe is still saddled with uncompetitive economies and heavy debt burdens.
There are, though, many things that can be done to create a healthier global economy in the long term. Unfinished business from the last financial crisis is tackling the ''too big to fail'' problem among banks. A more coordinated effort across frontiers is required to ensure that a future Lehman Brothers could be thrown onto the scrap heap without running the risk of bringing the rest of the financial system down with it.
Clearer thinking is also required on how to tame destabilizing capital flows. Part of the answer is to distinguish between what is healthy (foreign direct investment) and what is not (short-term foreign currency borrowing). The emerging macroprudential tool kit can be used to tackle the latter. South Korea is, for example, considering imposing a levy on banks' foreign currency liabilities. A code of conduct on capital flows, as advocated by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who is leading the Group of 20 this year, may be part of the solution, so long as he doesn't try to stuff the code with pet antimarket ideas.
Improved governance should also be high on the list of priorities. Large swaths of the world -- whether it is corruption-riddled India, Greece with its rampant tax evasion or most of the Arab world with its democratic deficit -- are restrained by poor governance.
Finally, there is liberalization. It has become fashionable to blame the global financial crisis on free markets. But the problem rather was that markets were distorted by bailouts and skewed incentives.
Freeing markets, whether by liberalizing rules on hiring and firing or sweeping away restricted practices in professions, still has the capacity to deliver a big long-term boost to productivity in much of the world. The Davos delegates should grasp this agenda.

PERSON: Daniel Bell 

HEADLINE: Daniel Bell, Ardent Appraiser of Politics, Economics and Culture, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN; Michael T. Kaufman, a reporter at The New York Times, died in 2010. William McDonald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Daniel Bell, the writer, editor, sociologist and teacher who over seven decades came to epitomize the engaged intellectual as he struggled to reveal the past, comprehend the present and anticipate the future, died on Tuesday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 91.
His daughter, Jordy Bell, confirmed the death.
Mr. Bell's output was prodigious and his range enormous. His major lines of inquiry included the failures of socialism in America, the exhaustion of modern culture and the transformation of capitalism from an industrial-based system to one built on consumerism.
But there was room in his mind for plenty of digressions. He wrote about the changing structure of organized crime and even the growing popularity of gangsta rap among white, middle-class, suburban youth. 
Two of Mr. Bell's books, ''The End of Ideology'' (1960) and the ''Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism'' (1978), were ranked among the 100 most influential books since World War II by The Times Literary Supplement in London. In titling ''The End of Ideology'' and another work, ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'' (1973), Mr. Bell coined terms that have entered common usage.
In ''The End of Ideology'' he contended -- nearly three decades before the collapse of Communism -- that ideologies that had once driven global politics were losing force and thus providing openings for newer galvanizing beliefs to gain toeholds. In ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society,'' he foresaw the global spread of service-based economies as generators of capital and employment, supplanting those dominated by manufacturing or agriculture.
In Mr. Bell's view, Western capitalism had come to rely on mass consumerism, acquisitiveness and widespread indebtedness, undermining the old Protestant ethic of thrift and modesty that writers like Max Weber and R.H. Tawney had long credited as the reasons for capitalism's success.
He also predicted the rising importance of science-based industries and of new technical elites. Indeed, in 1967, he predicted something like the Internet, writing: ''We will probably see a national information-computer-utility system, with tens of thousands of terminals in homes and offices 'hooked' into giant central computers providing library and information services, retail ordering and billing services, and the like.''
Mr. Bell became an influential editor of periodicals, starting out with The New Leader, a small social democratic publication that he referred to as his ''intellectual home.'' He joined Fortune magazine as its labor editor and in 1965 helped found and edit The Public Interest with his old City College classmate Irving Kristol, who died in 2009.
Though The Public Interest never attained a wide readership, it gained great prestige, beginning as a policy journal that questioned Great Society programs and then broadening into one of the most intellectually formidable of neoconservative publications.
''It has had more influence on domestic policy than any other journal in the country -- by far,'' the columnist David Brooks wrote in The New York Times in 2005.
Mr. Bell also maintained a distinguished academic career, teaching at the University of Chicago in the 1940s, at Columbia as a professor of sociology from 1959 to 1969 -- the university awarded him a Ph.D. for his work on ''The End of Ideology'' -- and then at Harvard, where in 1980 he was appointed the Henry Ford II professor of social sciences
As both a public intellectual and an academic, Mr. Bell saw a distinction between those breeds. In one of his typical yeasty digressions in ''The End of Ideology,'' he wrote: ''The scholar has a bounded field of knowledge, a tradition, and seeks to find his place in it, adding to the accumulated, tested knowledge of the past as to a mosaic. The scholar, qua scholar, is less involved with his 'self.'
''The intellectual,'' he went on, ''begins with his experience, his individual perceptions of the world, his privileges and deprivations, and judges the world by these sensibilities.''
In some measure Mr. Bell may well have been referring to himself in that passage -- his intellectual persona self-consciously winking at its detached scholarly twin with whom it conspired in a lifetime of work and experience.
Daniel Bolotsky was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on May 10, 1919, to Benjamin and Anna Bolotsky, garment workers and immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father died when Daniel was eight months old, and Daniel, his mother and his older brother, Leo, moved in with relatives. The family changed the name to Bell when Daniel was 13.
Mr. Bell liked to tell of his political beginnings with an anecdote about his bar mitzvah, in 1932. ''I said to the Rabbi: 'I've found the truth. I don't believe in God. I'm joining the Young People's Socialist League.' So he looked at me and said, 'Kid, you don't believe in God. Tell me, do you think God cares?' ''
Mr. Bell did join the League and as an adolescent delivered sidewalk speeches for Norman Thomas, the Socialist candidate for president. By the time he had graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan and entered City College in the late 1930s, he was well grounded in the Socialist and Marxist canon and well aware of the leftist landscape, with its bitter rivalries and schisms.
At City College, he had no trouble finding his way to Alcove No. 1 in the cafeteria, where, among the anti-Stalinist socialists who dominated that nook, he found a remarkable cohort that challenged and sustained him for much of his life as it helped to define America's political spectrum over the last half of the 20th century.
Its principal members, in addition to Mr. Bell, included Mr. Kristol, whose eventual move to the right as a founding neoconservative led Mr. Bell to leave The Public Interest in 1972 while steadfastly affirming his friendship for his old school chum.
There was Irving Howe, the late critic, professor and editor of the leftist journal Dissent, who remained a Social Democrat. And there was Nathan Glazer, who would become Mr. Bell's colleague in the Harvard sociology department, the author, with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, of ''Beyond the Melting Pot,'' and the architect of strategies for school integration. In 1998 the four men were the subjects of a documentary film by Joseph Dorman titled ''Arguing the World.''
The atmosphere of City College in the '30s was supercharged with leftist ideology. There were Communists and Socialists, Stalinists and Trotskyites, all giving vent to their views in the years of the Spanish Civil War just before Hitler's pact with Stalin paved the way to world war.
In the film, Mr. Bell described the atmosphere in the cafeteria as ''kind of a heder,'' referring to the Jewish religious schools where arguing a variety of views and redefining positions was the basis of learning. He graduated in 1939.
The associations Mr. Bell made at City College were fundamental. He also met the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset and the literary critic Alfred Kazin, whose sister, Pearl Kazin, Mr. Bell married in 1960. She survives him.
Besides his daughter, Jordy, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Mr. Bell is survived by a son, David, of Princeton, N.J., four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
Mr. Bell never hesitated to expand and revise his thinking through the years. New editions of his older books often include new prefaces and afterwords that look at his old arguments in the light of new developments in politics and society. And he was always quick to point out what he regarded as misconceptions about his work and his life.
In 2003, for example, an article by James Atlas in The Times described him and Mr. Kristol as neoconservatives who had felt that the Vietnam War had a ''persuasive rationale.'' He answered with a letter that declared, ''I was not and never have been a 'neoconservative.' Nor did I support the war.''
Indeed, for all the ideological wars he had witnessed, Mr. Bell disdained labels, particularly as they were applied to him. Over the years he would offer his own political profile, declaring what he called his ''triune'' view of himself: ''a socialist in economics, a liberal in politics and a conservative in culture.''

HEADLINE: Some Difficulties Unnoted, And Some Facts Shaded

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN, JOHN M. BRODER, ROBERT PEAR, SEWELL CHAN, MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's State of the Union address was chock-full of the sort of simple declarative statements that make him one of the most engaging political orators of his generation. But gauging the accuracy of those statements is not quite so straightforward, and some of the points in his speech shaded facts to help deliver his desired political message.
In addition, many of the president's policy proposals are likely to prove far more complicated or difficult to carry out than the warm applause in the House chamber might suggest. 
Politics
Mr. Obama opened his speech with a sweeping generalization about the net effect of last year's midterm elections that resulted in a divided Congress. ''With their votes,'' the president said of American voters, ''they've determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties.''
He added, ''We will move forward together, or not at all.''
But research suggests that Mr. Obama will be held most responsible for the results -- or lack thereof -- over the next two years, and that the economy will be the primary driver of the choices voters make in 2012.
So while Mr. Obama is right that legislation cannot pass without bipartisan support, he and his fellow Democrats will most likely bear greater responsibility. DAVID M. HERSZENHORN
Energy
The centerpiece of Mr. Obama's new energy agenda is a proposal to double the share of electricity generated from lower-emissions sources, including nuclear power, wind, solar and natural gas.
The idea is to provide government incentives and subsidies to encourage utilities to switch to cleaner fuels and to drive innovation by creating a predictable market for advanced energy technologies.
The president set a goal of having 80 percent of all electricity generated from clean sources by 2035, a highly ambitious target that goes beyond other proposals from members of Congress, policy groups and even his own energy secretary, Steven Chu, who suggested last month that it would be difficult to reach even a 50 percent clean-energy standard by 2050.
The plan is fraught with financial, technical and political challenges. It is certain to face criticism both from environmentalists who will object to a surge in the construction of nuclear power plants and from oil and gas executives who will complain about the elimination of some $4 billion in annual tax subsidies to help pay for the program.
The speech left unanswered the question of exactly what fuel sources will be deemed ''clean'' for accounting purposes. Others will ask whether it is realistic to ask Congress to act now on a plan that will have significant early costs with a payoff nearly 25 years in the future.
JOHN M. BRODER
Jobs
Mr. Obama said that ''more than one million private sector jobs'' were created last year. This is correct, according to data compiled by the Labor Department, which reported that nonfarm private employment rose by 1.3 million last year, to 108.5 million in December.
What the president did not say is that government employment fell last year by more than 220,000, mainly because of cutbacks by local governments, especially in education.
Moreover, private employment is still substantially below what it was at the start of the most recent recession in December 2007. ROBERT PEAR
Education
Mr. Obama emphasized the importance of education. And he repeated a common refrain about the competitive threat overseas.
''Nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own,'' he said, ''they could complete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science.''
The president's remarks suggested that the United States puts less of a priority on schooling. But that does not appear to be accurate at least in terms of compulsory education. China requires nine years of education and India just eight. While laws vary by state, rules in the United States are mostly tougher, with four states and the District of Columbia requiring 13 years of schooling.
DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and SEWELL CHAN
Infrastructure
Mr. Obama called for the United States to ''outbuild'' the rest of the world and find ''the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods and information.''
But it was 24 other words that presaged the political battles to come: ''We will make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment and pick projects based on what's best for the economy, not politicians.''
First, finding the money for the nation to update its aging infrastructure will not be easy, especially at a time when Republicans are demanding steep cuts to nearly all federal programs.
Right now, the federal Highway Trust Fund pays for much of the nation's transportation program. It gets most of its money from the federal gasoline tax, a flat 18.4-cent tax levied on each gallon sold. The tax has not been raised since 1993.
In recent years, the trust fund has run out of money, and the government has spent billions of dollars to try to keep it solvent. Numerous panels -- most recently the president's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform -- have called for raising the gas tax, but doing so is unpopular.
Finally, there is Mr. Obama's call for attracting private investment. Just how public-private partnerships should work is the subject of much debate. Some states have leased toll roads, generating big up-front payments and outsourcing operating and maintenance costs, but also giving up big, steady streams of future revenue.

HEADLINE: Obama Counters G.O.P. With Plan to Extend Spending Freeze

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- By proposing a two-year extension to the three-year domestic spending freeze he called for a year ago, President Obama sought to quickly counter Republican demands for deeper cuts to shrink government and reduce annual budget deficits.
But Mr. Obama, in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, declined to suggest additional ways to rein in the unsustainable growth of Medicare and Medicaid or to resolve the long-term financial problems facing Social Security. He is waiting for the new political dynamic of divided government to sort itself out before inviting Republicans to plunge into the risky business of addressing costly entitlement programs. 
Mr. Obama ''recognizes we have to do more,'' Gene Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser, said before the speech. ''But he also recognizes that it's only going to happen if we create a frame and an atmosphere that allows both houses and both parties to work together.''
For now, the president would extend a partial freeze of domestic spending that he proposed in last year's address while increasing the government's economic ''investments'' in areas like research and education.
Mr. Obama also called upon Congress to join him in simplifying the corporate tax code by eliminating loopholes in exchange for lowering the 35 percent rate, and perhaps to overhaul the individual income-tax system as well.
The annual address allowed Mr. Obama to directly answer the new House Republican majority that has spent weeks attacking him as spending too much. But he also spoke to a national television audience, in effect beginning a debate about the country's priorities at a time of large annual deficits and unmet public needs that will probably last through his term and re-election campaign.
Mr. Obama called his proposal to extend to five years his earlier three-year spending freeze a ''down payment'' on reducing annual deficits. The freeze would apply to spending covering a wide variety of domestic programs, but that slice is only about one-seventh of the federal budget -- limiting the overall deficit reduction that would result.
The freeze would exempt the biggest and fastest-growing areas of the federal budget -- Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and the military. But the Pentagon is coming in for cuts in the annual budget Mr. Obama will send to Congress in three weeks: Administration officials say it will include proposals from Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates squeezing $78 billion from military accounts over five years.
The five-year freeze in so-called discretionary domestic spending would reduce deficits by more than $400 billion in the 10 years through the fiscal year 2021, the administration said. By comparison, a group representing most House Republicans last week called for cutting $2.5 trillion over that decade.
Mr. Obama acknowledged that his budget-cutting measures would not go far enough when an aging population and rising health care costs were driving up projected annual deficits. Both sides, he said, ''have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough.''
Even so, the president declined to embrace any of the recommendations of a bipartisan majority on the fiscal commission he created last year, and which finished in December. He proposed that commission in last year's State of the Union address, saying, ''This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem.''
The commission's majority report proposed cuts through the fiscal year 2020 in all spending, including for Medicare and Social Security, and an end to a raft of costly tax breaks for individuals and businesses so the revenue savings could be used to lower tax rates and to reduce deficits.
The naysayers on the commission included its three House Republicans, including Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the new chairman of the House Budget Committee, who delivered the Republican response to Mr. Obama on Tuesday night. They said the proposed cuts were not deep enough.
While Mr. Obama told lawmakers that the parties must come together to make the necessary tough choices, his decision not to embrace the fiscal commission's report as the basis for immediate bipartisan talks disappointed many centrist, anti-deficit groups -- even as it pleased liberal activists who have been lobbying against the recommendations.
''He really has to kick off this discussion,'' said Maya MacGuineas of the bipartisan and centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ''It was his commission. They reported at the end of last year. There needs to be a follow-up, and it needs to come from the president.''
But other budget analysts said Mr. Obama was smart not to get out front too soon. Already newly empowered Congressional Republicans are struggling to come up with the specific cuts they need to keep their ambitious campaign promises.
''Major deficit reduction will not happen without bipartisan negotiations,'' said Robert Greenstein, founder of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ''and it would have been a mistake for the president to lay out a detailed deficit-reduction plan now, only to have his opponents attack it and try to blow it up.''
''The last two times that we had large, successful bipartisan negotiations on the budget -- in 1990 and 1997 -- the president did not lay out all the changes he would be willing to accept before the negotiations began,'' Mr. Greenstein added. ''Why should this time be different?''

HEADLINE: The Republican Response

 BODY:
Following is the prepared remarks of Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who was expected to give the official Republican response to President Obama's second State of the Union address, as released by the House speaker's office:
Good evening. I'm Congressman Paul Ryan from Janesville, Wisconsin and Chairman here at the House Budget Committee.
President Obama just addressed a Congressional chamber filled with many new faces. One face we did not see tonight was that of our friend and colleague, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. We all miss Gabby and her cheerful spirit; and we are praying for her return to the House Chamber.
Earlier this month, President Obama spoke movingly at a memorial event for the six people who died on that violent morning in Tucson. Still, there are no words that can lift the sorrow that now engulfs the families and friends of the fallen. 
What we can do is assure them that the nation is praying for them; that, in the words of the Psalmist, the Lord heals the broken hearted and binds up their wounds; and that over time grace will replace grief.
As Gabby continues to make encouraging progress, we must keep her and the others in our thoughts as we attend to the work now before us.
Tonight, the President focused a lot of attention on our economy in general and on our deficit and debt in particular.
He was right to do so, and some of his words were reassuring. As Chairman of the House Budget Committee, I assure you that we want to work with the President to restrain federal spending.
In one of our first acts in the new majority, House Republicans voted to cut Congress's own budget. And just today, the House voted to restore the spending discipline that Washington sorely needs.
The reason is simple.
A few years ago, reducing spending was important. Today, it's imperative. Here's why.
We face a crushing burden of debt. The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy, and grow to catastrophic levels in the years ahead.
On this current path, when my three children who are now 6, 7, and 8 years old are raising their own children, the Federal government will double in size, and so will the taxes they pay.
No economy can sustain such high levels of debt and taxation. The next generation will inherit a stagnant economy and a diminished country.
Frankly, it's one of my greatest concerns as a parent and I know many of you feel the same way.
Our debt is the product of acts by many presidents and many Congresses over many years. No one person or party is responsible for it.
There is no doubt the President came into office facing a severe fiscal and economic situation.
Unfortunately, instead of restoring the fundamentals of economic growth, he engaged in a stimulus spending spree that not only failed to deliver on its promise to create jobs, but also plunged us even deeper into debt.
The facts are clear: Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25% for domestic government agencies an 84% increase when you include the failed stimulus.
All of this new government spending was sold as ''investment.'' Yet after two years, the unemployment rate remains above 9% and government has added over $3 trillion to our debt.
Then the President and his party made matters even worse, by creating a new open-ended health care entitlement.
What we already know about the President's health care law is this: Costs are going up, premiums are rising, and millions of people will lose the coverage they currently have. Job creation is being stifled by all of its taxes, penalties, mandates and fees.
Businesses and unions from around the country are asking the Obama Administration for waivers from the mandates. Washington should not be in the business of picking winners and losers. The President mentioned the need for regulatory reform to ease the burden on American businesses. We agree and we think his health care law would be a great place to start.
Last week, House Republicans voted for a full repeal of this law, as we pledged to do, and we will work to replace it with fiscally responsible, patient-centered reforms that actually reduce costs and expand coverage.
Health care spending is driving the explosive growth of our debt. And the President's law is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy.
Our debt is out of control. What was a fiscal challenge is now a fiscal crisis.
We cannot deny it; instead we must, as Americans, confront it responsibly.
And that is exactly what Republicans pledge to do.
Americans are skeptical of both political parties, and that skepticism is justified especially when it comes to spending. So hold all of us accountable.
In this very room, the House will produce, debate, and advance a budget. Last year in an unprecedented failure Congress chose not to pass, or even propose a budget. The spending spree continued unchecked.
We owe you a better choice and a different vision.
Our forthcoming budget is our obligation to you to show you how we intend to do things differently how we will cut spending to get the debt down help create jobs and prosperity and reform government programs. If we act soon, and if we act responsibly, people in and near retirement will be protected.
These budget debates are not just about the programs of government; they're also about the purpose of government.
So I'd like to share with you the principles that guide us. They are anchored in the wisdom of the founders; in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence; and in the words of the American Constitution.
They have to do with the importance of limited government; and with the blessing of self-government.
We believe government's role is both vital and limited to defend the nation from attack and provide for the common defense to secure our borders to protect innocent life to uphold our laws and Constitutional rights to ensure domestic tranquility and equal opportunity and to help provide a safety net for those who cannot provide for themselves.
We believe that the government has an important role to create the conditions that promote entrepreneurship, upward mobility, and individual responsibility.
We believe, as our founders did, that ''the pursuit of happiness'' depends upon individual liberty; and individual liberty requires limited government.
Limited government also means effective government. When government takes on too many tasks, it usually doesn't do any of them very well. It's no coincidence that trust in government is at an all-time low now that the size of government is at an all-time high.
The President and the Democratic Leadership have shown, by their actions, that they believe government needs to increase its size and its reach, its price tag and its power.
Whether sold as ''stimulus'' or repackaged as ''investment,'' their actions show they want a federal government that controls too much; taxes too much; and spends too much in order to do too much.
And during the last two years, that is exactly what we have gotten along with record deficits and debt to the point where the President is now urging Congress to increase the debt limit.
We believe the days of business as usual must come to an end. We hold to a couple of simple convictions: Endless borrowing is not a strategy; spending cuts have to come first.
Our nation is approaching a tipping point.
We are at a moment, where if government's growth is left unchecked and unchallenged, America's best century will be considered our past century. This is a future in which we will transform our social safety net into a hammock, which lulls able-bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency.
Depending on bureaucracy to foster innovation, competitiveness, and wise consumer choices has never worked and it won't work now.
We need to chart a new course.
Speaking candidly, as one citizen to another: We still have time but not much time. If we continue down our current path, we know what our future will be.
Just take a look at what's happening to Greece, Ireland, the United Kingdom and other nations in Europe. They didn't act soon enough; and now their governments have been forced to impose painful austerity measures: large benefit cuts to seniors and huge tax increases on everybody.
Their day of reckoning has arrived. Ours is around the corner. That is why we must act now.
Some people will back away from this challenge. But I see this challenge as an opportunity to rebuild what Lincoln called the ''central ideas'' of the Republic.
We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper. Under this approach, the spirit of initiative not political clout determines who succeeds.
Millions of families have fallen on hard times not because of our ideals of free enterprise but because our leaders failed to live up to those ideals; because of poor decisions made in Washington and Wall Street that caused a financial crisis, squandered our savings, broke our trust, and crippled our economy.
Today, a similar kind of irresponsibility threatens not only our livelihoods but our way of life.
We need to reclaim our American system of limited government, low taxes, reasonable regulations, and sound money, which has blessed us with unprecedented prosperity. And it has done more to help the poor than any other economic system ever designed. That's the real secret to job creation not borrowing and spending more money in Washington.
Limited government and free enterprise have helped make America the greatest nation on earth.
These are not easy times, but America is an exceptional nation. In all the chapters of human history, there has never been anything quite like America. The American story has been cherished, advanced, and defended over the centuries.
And it now falls to this generation to pass on to our children a nation that is stronger, more vibrant, more decent, and better than the one we inherited.
Thank you and good night.

HEADLINE: Obama's Second State of the Union (Text)

 BODY:
Following is the transcript for President Obama's second State of the Union address on Tuesday, as released by the White House:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:
Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker, John Boehner. (Applause.) And as we mark this occasion, we're also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber, and we pray for the health of our colleague -- and our friend - Gabby Giffords. (Applause.)
It's no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years. The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs. And that's a good thing. That's what a robust democracy demands. That's what helps set us apart as a nation.
But there's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater - something more consequential than party or political preference. 
We are part of the American family. We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.
That, too, is what sets us apart as a nation. (Applause.)
Now, by itself, this simple recognition won't usher in a new era of cooperation. What comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow. (Applause.)
I believe we can. And I believe we must. That's what the people who sent us here expect of us. With their votes, they've determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties. New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. We will move forward together, or not at all - for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than politics.
At stake right now is not who wins the next election - after all, we just had an election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else. It's whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded. It's whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world.
We are poised for progress. Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.
But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone. We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise. By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children.
That's the project the American people want us to work on. Together. (Applause.)
We did that in December. Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans' paychecks are a little bigger today. Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year. And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year.
But we have to do more. These steps we've taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we'll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making.
Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown. You didn't always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors. If you worked hard, chances are you'd have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion. Maybe you'd even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.
That world has changed. And for many, the change has been painful. I've seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets. I've heard it in the frustrations of Americans who've seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear - proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.
They're right. The rules have changed. In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business. Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100. Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there's an Internet connection.
Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science. They're investing in research and new technologies. Just recently, China became the home to the world's largest private solar research facility, and the world's fastest computer.
So, yes, the world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn't discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember - for all the hits we've taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world. (Applause.) No workers -- no workers are more productive than ours. No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs. We're the home to the world's best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth.
What's more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea - the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny. That's why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here. It's why our students don't just memorize equations, but answer questions like ''What do you think of that idea? What would you change about the world? What do you want to be when you grow up?''
The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can't just stand still. As Robert Kennedy told us, ''The future is not a gift. It is an achievement.'' Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat. It has required each generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new age.
And now it's our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time. We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. (Applause.) We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business. We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government. That's how our people will prosper. That's how we'll win the future. (Applause.) And tonight, I'd like to talk about how we get there.
The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation. None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from. Thirty years ago, we couldn't know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution. What we can do -- what America does better than anyone else -- is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. We're the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook. In America, innovation doesn't just change our lives. It is how we make our living. (Applause.)
Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation. But because it's not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need. That's what planted the seeds for the Internet. That's what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS. Just think of all the good jobs -- from manufacturing to retail -- that have come from these breakthroughs.
Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon. The science wasn't even there yet. NASA didn't exist. But after investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.
This is our generation's Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven't seen since the height of the Space Race. And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal. We'll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology - (applause) -- an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.
Already, we're seeing the promise of renewable energy. Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company. After September 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon. But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard. Today, with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country. In Robert's words, ''We reinvented ourselves.''
That's what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves. And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, we've begun to reinvent our energy policy. We're not just handing out money. We're issuing a challenge. We're telling America's scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we'll fund the Apollo projects of our time.
At the California Institute of Technology, they're developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they're using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities. With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. (Applause.)
We need to get behind this innovation. And to help pay for it, I'm asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies. (Applause.) I don't know if -- I don't know if you've noticed, but they're doing just fine on their own. (Laughter.) So instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow's.
Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they're selling. So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: By 2035, 80 percent of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources. (Applause.)
Some folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all -- and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen. (Applause.)
Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America's success. But if we want to win the future - if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas - then we also have to win the race to educate our kids.
Think about it. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education. And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us - as citizens, and as parents - are willing to do what's necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.
That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities. It's family that first instills the love of learning in a child. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done. We need to teach our kids that it's not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair. (Applause.) We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline.
Our schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance. But too many schools don't meet this test. That's why instead of just pouring money into a system that's not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top. To all 50 states, we said, ''If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we'll show you the money.''
Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation. For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning. And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country. And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that's more flexible and focused on what's best for our kids. (Applause.)
You see, we know what's possible from our children when reform isn't just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities. Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver. Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado -- located on turf between two rival gangs. But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma. Most will be the first in their families to go to college. And after the first year of the school's transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, ''Thank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it.'' (Applause.) That's what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country.
Let's also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child's success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers are known as ''nation builders.'' Here in America, it's time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect. (Applause.) We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. (Applause.) And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math. (Applause.)
In fact, to every young person listening tonight who's contemplating their career choice: If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child -- become a teacher. Your country needs you. (Applause.)
Of course, the education race doesn't end with a high school diploma. To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American. (Applause.) That's why we've ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students. (Applause.) And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit - worth $10,000 for four years of college. It's the right thing to do. (Applause.)
Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today's fast-changing economy, we're also revitalizing America's community colleges. Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina. Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town. One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old. And she told me she's earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams, too. As Kathy said, ''I hope it tells them to never give up.''
If we take these steps - if we raise expectations for every child, and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take - we will reach the goal that I set two years ago: By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. (Applause.)
One last point about education. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens. Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities. But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us. It makes no sense.
Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows. (Applause.) I know that debate will be difficult. I know it will take time. But tonight, let's agree to make that effort. And let's stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation. (Applause.)
The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America. To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information -- from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet. (Applause.)
Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped. South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do. China is building faster trains and newer airports. Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation's infrastructure, they gave us a ''D.''
We have to do better. America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System. The jobs created by these projects didn't just come from laying down track or pavement. They came from businesses that opened near a town's new train station or the new off-ramp.
So over the last two years, we've begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry. And tonight, I'm proposing that we redouble those efforts. (Applause.)
We'll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges. We'll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on] what's best for the economy, not politicians.
Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail. (Applause.) This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car. For some trips, it will be faster than flying - without the pat-down. (Laughter and applause.) As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway.
Within the next five years, we'll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans. This isn't just about -- (applause) -- this isn't about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls. It's about connecting every part of America to the digital age. It's about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world. It's about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.
All these investments - in innovation, education, and infrastructure - will make America a better place to do business and create jobs. But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success.
For example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change. (Applause.)
So tonight, I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years - without adding to our deficit. It can be done. (Applause.)
To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 - because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home. Already, our exports are up. Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States. And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs. This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans -- and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible. (Applause.)
Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs. That's what we did with Korea, and that's what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks. (Applause.)
To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I've ordered a review of government regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them. (Applause.) But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common-sense safeguards to protect the American people. (Applause.) That's what we've done in this country for more than a century. It's why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It's why we have speed limits and child labor laws. It's why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis. (Applause.) And it's why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients. (Applause.)
Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law. (Laughter.) So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved. If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you. We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses. (Applause.)
What I'm not willing to do -- what I'm not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition. (Applause.)
I'm not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered. I'm not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business man from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees. As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients' -- parents' coverage. (Applause.)
So I say to this chamber tonight, instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let's fix what needs fixing and let's move forward. (Applause.)
Now, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we aren't buried under a mountain of debt.
We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago. And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's pockets.
But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in. That is not sustainable. Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same.
So tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. (Applause.) Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.
This freeze will require painful cuts. Already, we've frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years. I've proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs. The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without. (Applause.)
I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I'm willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without. But let's make sure that we're not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens. (Applause.) And let's make sure that what we're cutting is really excess weight. Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may make you feel like you're flying high at first, but it won't take long before you feel the impact. (Laughter.)
Now, most of the cuts and savings I've proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget. To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough. It won't. (Applause.)
The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear. I don't agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress. And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it - in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes. (Applause.)
This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit. The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit. Still, I'm willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year -- medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits. (Applause.)
To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations. (Applause.) We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans' guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market. (Applause.)
And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can't afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. (Applause.) Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break. It's not a matter of punishing their success. It's about promoting America's success. (Applause.)
In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code. (Applause.) This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them. (Applause.)
So now is the time to act. Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress - Democrats and Republicans - to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done. If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future.
Let me take this one step further. We shouldn't just give our people a government that's more affordable. We should give them a government that's more competent and more efficient. We can't win the future with a government of the past. (Applause.)
We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV. There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy. Then there's my favorite example: The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater. (Laughter.) I hear it gets even more complicated once they're smoked. (Laughter and applause.)
Now, we've made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse. We're selling acres of federal office space that hasn't been used in years, and we'll cut through red tape to get rid of more. But we need to think bigger. In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote - and we will push to get it passed. (Applause.)
In the coming year, we'll also work to rebuild people's faith in the institution of government. Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you'll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history. Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done -- put that information online. And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it. I will veto it. (Applause.)
The 21st century government that's open and competent. A government that lives within its means. An economy that's driven by new skills and new ideas. Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation. It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.
Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges. No single wall separates East and West. No one rival superpower is aligned against us.
And so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion. And America's moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity. And because we've begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America's standing has been restored.
Look to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high. (Applause.) American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new government has been formed. This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq. America's commitment has been kept. The Iraq war is coming to an end. (Applause.)
Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us. Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we're disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies. And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family. (Applause.)
We've also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad. In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces. Our purpose is clear: By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.
Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency. There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance. But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them. This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead. And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home. (Applause.)
In Pakistan, al Qaeda's leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001. Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield. Their safe havens are shrinking. And we've sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe: We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you. (Applause.)
American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war. Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed. Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists. (Applause.)
Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before. And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons. (Applause.)
This is just a part of how we're shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity. With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense. We've reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India.
This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas. Around the globe, we're standing with those who take responsibility - helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.
Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power - it must also be the purpose behind it. In south Sudan - with our assistance - the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war. (Applause.) Thousands lined up before dawn. People danced in the streets. One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him: ''This was a battlefield for most of my life,'' he said. ''Now we want to be free.'' (Applause.)
And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator. And tonight, let us be clear: The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people. (Applause.)
We must never forget that the things we've struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people everywhere. And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country. (Applause.)
Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families. Let us serve them as well as they've served us -- by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation.
Our troops come from every corner of this country - they're black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim. And, yes, we know that some of them are gay. Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love. (Applause.) And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC. It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past. It is time to move forward as one nation. (Applause.)
We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit - none of this will be easy. All of it will take time. And it will be harder because we will argue about everything. The costs. The details. The letter of every law.
Of course, some countries don't have this problem. If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed. If they don't want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn't get written.
And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn't a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth. (Applause.)
We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution. We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try. We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible. No matter who you are. No matter where you come from.
That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight. That dream is why a working-class kid from Scranton can sit behind me. (Laughter and applause.) That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father's Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.)
That dream - that American Dream - is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era. It's what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future. And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher.
Brandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology. And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them.
But Brandon thought his company could help. And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B. His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment. And Brandon left for Chile.
Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working three- or four-hour -- three or four days at a time without any sleep. Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued. (Applause.) But because he didn't want all of the attention, Brandon wasn't there when the miners emerged. He'd already gone back home, back to work on his next project.
And later, one of his employees said of the rescue, ''We proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things.'' (Applause.)
We do big things.
From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That's how we win the future.
We're a nation that says, ''I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.'' ''I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.'' ''I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.'' ''I'm not sure how we'll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we'll get there. I know we will.''
We do big things. (Applause.)
The idea of America endures. Our destiny remains our choice. And tonight, more than two centuries later, it's because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong.
Thank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

HEADLINE: Pushing Competition and Trying to Pull America Out of a Funk

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At a moment when the momentum in Washington is driving toward slashing budgets and shrinking government, President Obama argued on Tuesday evening that the politics of austerity, mindlessly applied, would amount to a pre-emptive surrender to China, India and a raft of smaller competitors who are investing while Americans are cutting.
It is a theme Mr. Obama has struck repeatedly since the Democrats' devastating losses in the midterm elections exactly 12 weeks ago. He warned soon after that America must ''step up our game,'' and on Tuesday night he told Congress and the nation that this is ''our generation's Sputnik moment.'' 
With those words, Mr. Obama was defining the ideological battle of the coming year: strikingly different views of the role of government, even as both sides agree that cuts will be necessary.
To the new Republican majority in the House, the path to restoring American ''competitiveness'' -- the word itself is something of a Rorschach test -- includes slashing taxes and getting the government out of the way. To Mr. Obama, even a leaner federal government must play a central role in guiding the country's economic future, helping the United States to confront the rising economic powers that ate away at America's lead while the country was distracted in the post-Sept. 11 decade.
''South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do,'' Mr. Obama said, ticking off the list of how America had fallen behind. ''Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do. China is building faster trains and newer airports.'' He noted at another point that the world's biggest private solar research facility and fastest supercomputer were now in China.
Mr. Obama is hardly the first president to try to rekindle the spirit of cold-war competition in an effort to force Americans to set aside political differences and join together to face a common threat to their prosperity and security.
''Americans are prone to cycles of belief in their own decline,'' Joseph Nye wrote in his newest exploration of America's status in the world, ''The Future of Power.''
Mr. Obama was clearly seeking to pull America out of its latest funk, arguing that no country has a deeper bench, better universities or a more entrepreneurial spirit. But he also portrayed those as fragile assets, and his bet is that Americans expect their government to preserve the country's lead, a view that puts him in direct competition with Tea Party-fueled calls for a diminished Washington.
In his speech, Mr. Obama tried once again to differentiate between his short-term tactics to get the country working again -- which led him to agree to extending tax cuts, including many he believes to be unwise -- and a long-term strategy of selective investment and deficit reduction.
''Let's make sure that what we're cutting is really excess weight,'' Mr. Obama said, in what may be the line in his hourlong speech that was most directed at the Tea Party caucus. ''Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may feel like you're flying high at first, but it won't take long before you'll feel the impact.''
In some ways his warning was reminiscent of the Obama style circa 2008. As a candidate, he prided himself on ignoring the passions of the moment, not letting hyperventilation on cable television or predictions of impending political doom drive his tactics, much less his strategy. His coolness, his detachment, seemed a political virtue after eight years of an intensely ideological presidency.
But this is a different moment, and it is far from clear that the formula that worked so well two years ago retains much potency today. As several of his own aides concede -- especially those who have left the White House or are preparing to -- Mr. Obama failed to rally the country behind his strategy for combating the most marked economic crisis since the Great Depression. His health care victory came at a tremendous cost. Foreclosures and a jobless rate of just under 10 percent seemed a symptom of national drift, downward.
Only with his speech in Tucson two weeks ago, in response to the actions of a gunman who shot a congresswoman in the head and caused a nation to question the proper limits of political divisiveness, did he begin to turn the narrative back in his direction.
Now his challenge is to win the argument against those who say that when government intervenes in the economy, it is usually for the worse. While directly hailing the wonders of free enterprise -- an effort to beat back his opponents' charge that he is a socialist in capitalist clothing -- he made the case that at moments, government intervention has been inspired.
''Because it's not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout history our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need,'' he said. ''That's what planted the seeds for the Internet. That's what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS.''
But that is an argument that President Bill Clinton could have made, and often did, 15 years ago. What Mr. Obama stepped around is the reality of American competition today -- that innovation, education and infrastructure are necessary ingredients for global competitive success, but no guarantee. Many of the technologies on which Mr. Obama is depending are the product of joint ventures that combine American ideas, European design and Asian manufacturing. That is something few in this Congress may want to hear, much less finance, given that many of the jobs those innovations create do not go to Americans.
''We do big things,'' Mr. Obama repeated, twice, as he concluded his speech. That has been a hallmark of America, especially in the past century. Yet Mr. Obama has all but said that his biggest challenge is to take a country that often seems to want to retreat into its shell and force it to do big things again.
One of his subtexts on Tuesday night was that doing big things these days may require a bit more humility, a lot more work, and some international partners that Americans rarely thought about 20 years ago but whose competition they have now grown to fear.

HEADLINE: Shares Stall as Investors Await Policy News

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street ended the day little changed on Tuesday as investors held back in anticipation of economic and policy developments. Earnings results were also mixed, adding to the lack of direction.
The market flirted in recent days near the psychologically important level of 12,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average and 1,300 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But there was little momentum on Tuesday to propel the indexes past those levels, which have not been reached since mid-2008.
The Dow closed down 3.33 points, or 0.03 percent, at 11,977.19, while the broader Standard & Poor's index was up 0.34 or 0.03 percent, at 1,291.18. The Nasdaq was up 1.70 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,719.25. 
Doug Roberts, the chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research, said that the address by President Obama scheduled for Tuesday night and the results of the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm were weighing on investors.
The Federal Reserve is expected to issue a statement on Wednesday after a regular two-day meeting, its first in 2011, that it will leave the federal funds rate between zero to 0.25 percent. Analysts also expect it to include updates on the economy and the central bank's bond-buying program.
And Mr. Obama, in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, was expected to deliver a blueprint for economic recovery.
While investors were not expecting broad changes, they were at least counting on certainty that things would stay the same, Mr. Roberts said.
''People are backing off a little bit,'' he said, referring to market activity.
''What they are looking for is no blindside,'' he said. ''They want to see something that is not going to cause a ripple. No tightening, nothing that is basically going to upset the apple cart.''
In addition, the first estimate for 2010 fourth-quarter gross domestic product in the United States was scheduled to be released on Friday. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect an annualized 3.5 percent estimate.
The approach to the market was tepid, with the impending policy and economic factors to consider, Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial, said.
''The market has to absorb quite a bit of policy news and the Fed statement, and I think there is a little bit of caution,'' she said.
The last time the Dow closed above 12,000 was in June 2008. The market that day had been recording only modest advances, but a sharp drop in oil prices, after weeks of rising prices, helped to counter concerns about the strength of the economy. It was came as the financial crisis was starting to unfold.
Ms. Krosby said that the 12,000 level for the Dow was not that significant.
''It is psychological, but the fact is we have been there before,'' Ms. Krosby said. ''The question is, is it notable enough to bring in the retail investor? The retail investor has been gradually allocating more money to the stock market, but certainly not in the amounts that would get us beyond 12,000.''
Also on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes in January was 60.6, its highest level in eight months, helped by optimism about the economy and the employment sector. The index was revised upward from 53.3 in December.
In earnings news, Verizonreported a decline in quarterly revenue in a report that was slightly below analyst expectations. But it also said it had a rise in new customers.
Telecommunications shares gave the broader market a lift with a rise of more than 1 percent. Verizon shares were up 1.56 percent at $35.79 and MetroPCS rose nearly 5 percent to $13.49.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 20/32, to 94 5/32. The yield fell to 3.33 percent, from 3.40 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Emanuel Is Back on Ballot; Illinois Supreme Court Takes Case on Eligibility

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and JOHN SCHWARTZ; Monica Davey reported from Chicago and John Schwartz from New York. Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- The Illinois Supreme Court puffed life back into Rahm Emanuel's mayoral campaign on Tuesday when it restored his name to the city's ballots, at least for now, and agreed to decide whether he should be allowed to run for mayor.
The decisions arrived at a dizzying pace, only a day after a panel of the Illinois Appellate Court had ordered Mr. Emanuel's name stricken from the ballot, saying his time in Washington as White House chief of staff meant that he failed to meet a requirement of residing in Chicago for a year before the Feb. 22 election.
The Supreme Court's orders were seen as a positive sign for Mr. Emanuel (the court could have chosen to skip the case altogether), but the justices still have to consider the merits of the case itself, and so Chicago -- already suffering from political whiplash -- will have to wait a bit more.
The Supreme Court will study briefs already submitted to the lower court, rather than wait for new ones, and will entertain no oral arguments. It is uncertain exactly how quickly a decision will emerge, but deadlines are looming; early voting, for instance, begins Monday. 
While Mr. Emanuel seemed to defiantly march on Tuesday with a local Teamsters' endorsement, a fund-raising event, a meeting with teachers, as if nothing much was going on, his five opponents were left trying to sort out whether the top polling candidate was in or out, and just who, then, to criticize.
City elections officials, too, found themselves trapped in the tangle of the legal fight. With absentee ballots due to be mailed out as early as Friday, the officials had begun printing ballots -- without Mr. Emanuel's name, per the appellate court's Monday ruling -- at 7 a.m. Tuesday.
By noon, with 300,000 ballots done, the Supreme Court said no ballots should be printed without Mr. Emanuel's name. ''We absolutely called the printers and said, 'Stop the presses,' '' Jim Allen, a spokesman for Chicago's Board of Election Commissioners, recounted not long after.
And by 2 p.m., election officials started all over, this time printing ballots with all the names. Presuming no new order arrives in the interim, two million of those were to be completed, and the 300,000 shorter ballots were placed in what officials described as a location that was ''segregated and secured.'' (Depending on the final ruling in this case, they may yet be of value.)
Legal experts cautioned against reading too much into the State Supreme Court's decision to bar printing of ballots without Mr. Emanuel's name even before it decides the case. In cases of someone seeking a stay, courts often take into account the possibility of irreparable harm.
''In this case, Emanuel would suffer great harm in the event that his name was left off the ballot and the State Supreme Court reverses'' later in the process, said Richard L. Hasen, a visiting professor of law at the University of California, Irvine.
For months, even as Mr. Emanuel became the clear front-runner in the race to replace Mayor Richard M. Daley, who will retire this spring, challenges have been simmering over whether he lived here long enough to qualify for the ballot. Such challenges fit into a broader landscape strewn, experts said, with narrow readings of statutory language and broad principles of election law.
In essence, in finding on Monday that Mr. Emanuel did not qualify to run for mayor, the appellate panel relied on a distinction in Illinois's code between the residency qualifications to cast a vote and the requirements for those running for office. Running for local office, the appellate judges said, actually required a person to physically live in a given city, not just to own property there or pay taxes there, as Mr. Emanuel always had.
In their appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Emanuel's lawyers argued that such a distinction ''has never been endorsed by this court or by any other appellate court.'' And a dissenting member of the appellate panel (the ruling against Mr. Emanuel was 2-1), Bertina E. Lampkin, scoffed that such a distinction was ''not based on established law but, rather, on the whims of two judges,'' and ''should not be allowed to stand.''
Other legal experts pointed to a broader concern in the realm of such election questions.
''In a circumstance where there is uncertainty'' about the interpretation of an election statute, Mark D. Rosen, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law said, ''basic democratic principles would suggest you would construe the uncertain statute to expand voter choices rather than contract them.''
Professor Rosen pointed, for example, to the circumstances in 2010 of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who ran for re-election as a write-in candidate and for whom election officials allowed poorly spelled versions of her name.
Still, residency has tripped up candidates before. In 1974, Charles Ravenel was heavily favored to win a race for governor of South Carolina, but was knocked out by a lawsuit that cited a State Constitution requirement that candidates have lived in the state for five years.
Chicago voters, meanwhile, were reeling. At lunch spots downtown on Tuesday, they had questions: Was Mr. Emanuel in? Was he out? Could he ultimately launch a write-in campaign? (Perhaps, though that would likely create new challenges.) Would the election be stopped altogether?
Langdon D. Neal, chairman of the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, seemed to empathize, even encouraging voters with lingering questions to consider waiting beyond the start of early voting -- to see what happens to all of this -- before casting their ballots.
''There are no do-overs,'' Mr. Neal cautioned. ''Once you vote, that's it.''
Mr. Emanuel's top opponents -- Carol Moseley Braun, a former United States senator, and Gery Chico, a former mayoral chief of staff to Mr. Daley -- seemed uncertain about how best to proceed as well. In the past, most of Mr. Emanuel's opponents have focused squarely on him, but on Tuesday Ms. Braun issued a news release condemning Mr. Chico's stance (misunderstood, Mr. Chico's aides say) on whether city workers should live within the city limits.
Still, the effort seemed to draw little notice. And efforts to woo away Mr. Emanuel's supporters and donors had not worked so far, some from his campaign said; campaign donations have not dropped off.
And while nearly everyone -- including the local Teamsters who decided to announce their endorsement of Mr. Emanuel on Tuesday morning in part because they were angry at the prospect that he might be removed from the ballot -- debated his fate, Mr. Emanuel himself seemed intent on talking about anything but.
Inside a fruit warehouse on the Southwest Side, he grinned and high-fived members of the Teamsters and spoke of the city's struggling economy. He talked about safety on the streets, his tax plan, a comprehensive wellness plan for city workers and the minimum wage.
Finally, pressed by reporters to discuss his ballot woes, he said he intended to go full force ahead. Perhaps he would double up now, he said, adding even more campaign stops, more handshaking visits to trains, more sojourns to bowling alleys.

HEADLINE: For a Medicaid Cost-Cutter From Wisconsin, a More Complicated Job in New York

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Two years ago, Gov. James E. Doyle of Wisconsin knew that he needed to cut hundreds of millions in Medicaid spending in his state.
He could have done it the conventional way, imposing lower payment rates across the board for providers, while preparing himself for battle with the health care industry. Instead, he negotiated with lawmakers on the total dollar figure to be saved: ultimately, $625 million over two years. Then he instructed his Medicaid director, Jason A. Helgerson, to gather Wisconsin's hospital executives, labor leaders and others with an interest in the outcome and figure out where the savings would come from.
''I wouldn't say they all were happy with us,'' Mr. Doyle said about the process, ''but I think they felt they all got a fair shake.''
Wisconsin is not New York, where Mr. Helgerson, 39, now has the task of reining in the state's troubled Medicaid program. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recruited him to find billions of dollars in savings to help close the state's more than $9 billion budget gap in the next fiscal year. 
In Wisconsin, state and federal spending on Medicaid this fiscal year is projected to total $6.2 billion. In New York, it will be more than $53 billion. In Wisconsin, about a million people are enrolled in Medicaid, which pays for health care for the poor. In New York, enrollment is approaching five million.
And perhaps most significant, in Wisconsin, Mr. Helgerson was charged with slowing growth, not making huge cuts, as Mr. Cuomo wants. In the two-year period when he worked on the savings, Wisconsin expanded eligibility for its Medicaid program, and overall spending grew nearly 20 percent.
''This is a tough, difficult budget,'' Mr. Helgerson said in a recent interview. ''The hope is through this engagement process, we'll be able to generate some new, additional ideas that might be able to replace some challenges that otherwise would have to go into the budget.''
In interviews, health care officials in Wisconsin generally praised Mr. Helgerson's handling of the cuts, though his work was not without critics. Some said that the process was not as collaborative as described and that some of the measures he approved would produce only one-time saving or involved creative accounting, like deferring $127 million in managed care payments to the next fiscal year. Other measures took the form of more traditional rate cuts, particularly to managed care providers and pharmacies.
Nevertheless, hospital and union officials in New York said they were encouraged by Mr. Helgerson's record of producing cost savings without making enemies or reducing patient care.
It is not likely to go as smoothly in New York, where officials would not commit to accepting whatever cuts emerged from the work of the so-called Medicaid Redesign Team that Mr. Cuomo appointed shortly after taking office this month. Their cautiousness underscores the delicate negotiating position that Mr. Helgerson -- and, by extension, Mr. Cuomo -- finds himself in.
Mr. Cuomo does not want cost savings to come simply from one big cut in the rates paid to providers.
''Let's see if we can't actually find efficiencies in the program so we actually provide a better service for less money,'' Mr. Cuomo said in his State of the State address.
Enter Mr. Helgerson, who before becoming Mr. Doyle's Medicaid director worked as a policy adviser or budget official for the mayor of San Jose, the Milwaukee public school system and the Milwaukee mayor. (He takes no shame in his fascination with balancing budgets: when he signed up for Twitter, he chose the user name @policywonk1.)
To find the savings that Mr. Doyle and lawmakers had agreed on, Mr. Helgerson assembled nine committees for different constituencies, including physicians, hospital executives and pharmacists.
For three hours at a time, Mr. Helgerson and other state officials huddled with each group, writing idea after idea on big easels. They also solicited ideas from the public via a Web site, a practice that Mr. Cuomo has replicated.
More than 500 ideas were proposed, and after three months of analyzing the numbers in various ways, Mr. Helgerson and his boss, the secretary of Wisconsin's Department of Health Services, reached the magic $625 million figure.
The savings came from 71 measures, like teaming up with Michigan on a contract to buy adult diapers in bulk (savings: $2.2 million) or checking the market price for generic medication more frequently and updating payment rates accordingly ($41 million).
Over all, aides to Mr. Doyle, a Democrat, who did not seek election to a third term in the fall, projected that Medicaid costs per recipient would decline 9 percent from 2008 to 2011, with no loss of care.
Yet even with the savings, a $1.2 billion gap is projected for the next two-year fiscal period, in large part because of the loss of extra federal financing provided by special economic stimulus funds.
Elements of the process also came under criticism.
John Sauer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, said, ''I would say, for us, there was more an appearance of openness than there was actual sitting down and working collaboratively.''
Still, Mr. Helgerson found the requisite savings and lived to tell about them.
''You didn't see a lot of angry press releases,'' said Tom Petri, the policy and communications director for the Wisconsin Primary Health Care Association, a group that represents community health centers. ''Not as much as you could have, considering there was a lot of money being hit.''
Whether that will be the case in New York remains to be seen. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo declined to say whether a cost-cutting target had been set, but members of the Medicaid task force said they expected Mr. Cuomo to seek at least $2 billion in savings in state Medicaid spending; that would require an overall reduction of at least $4 billion because of the matching federal financing.
Mr. Helgerson will also have to work quickly: Mr. Cuomo asked his Medicaid panel, which had its first public meeting on Jan. 13, to report its first round of suggestions by March 1.
Mr. Helgerson also has less authority here than he did in Wisconsin. There, the Legislature, controlled by Democrats, approved the $625 million spending reduction at the outset and delegated to the Doyle administration the responsibility for finding the savings, without further legislative approval.
But in New York, the Legislature -- which has representatives on Mr. Helgerson's panel -- still has to approve the budget after the panel makes its recommendations. Democrats have a majority in the State Assembly, while Republicans do in the Senate.
So, unlike in Wisconsin, those in health care have recourse if they do not like what Mr. Helgerson comes up with.
''I think every group should feel compelled to offer its most constructive proposals,'' said one panel member, Daniel Sisto, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State.
''That does not necessarily mean that we will agree on the target or what conclusions they draw,'' he added. ''We all in the end will reserve our right to go back to the Legislature and seek further refinements and remedy.''
Even so, the task force provides Mr. Cuomo political cover, intended or not. With a role in the process, health care lobbyists who might otherwise run advertisements attacking a cost-cutting governor will presumably stay quiet in February -- the critical period when Mr. Cuomo is making the case for his budget.
And the mere fact that discussions are being held about reforming Medicaid, rather than simply cutting and cutting, gave Mr. Sisto and others hope.
Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association and also a member of the panel, characterized the past few years as a political merry-go-round: ''They propose, we oppose, and then the matter is wrestled out in the court of public opinion.''
Not so with Mr. Helgerson's committee. ''I'm enthusiastic about it,'' Mr. Raske said, ''because it does represent a significant departure from the past.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Renews Call to Tie U.N. Funding to U.S. Goals

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- Republican members of Congress on Tuesday used their newly won control of the House to advocate that the United States hinge its hefty support for the United Nations budget to more tangible efforts by the organization to root out corruption and advance American foreign policy goals.
The House foreign affairs committee held an initial briefing to debate whether the administration should withhold the money for certain branches of the world body that members said worked against American interests. They focused much of their attention on the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, which repeatedly condemns Israeli rule over the Palestinians while generally ignoring abuses committed by member states like Iran, Zimbabwe and Saudi Arabia. 
The new committee chairwoman, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, who did not attend the session for family reasons, criticized the Obama administration stance that the United States can be most effective in eliminating waste and pressing for reforms at the United Nations if it is participating fully in the organization.
''Ambassador Susan Rice says that the U.S. approach to the U.N. is: 'We pay our bills. We push for real reform,' '' Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said in the statement, which was read for her. ''Instead, we should be conditioning our contributions on 'reform first, pay later.' ''
As with other actions by the Republican-controlled House, how much change it can put into effect is unclear given that Democrats control the Senate and the White House. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, is a strong United Nations supporter.
Most questions directed at the six witnesses were divided along party lines. Republicans suggested that more financial oversight was essential for the United Nations to run smoothly. Democrats, while endorsing change, cautioned that the United States should not slash the budget of an organization that generally abets American foreign policy interests -- from passing Security Council sanctions against Iran to distributing humanitarian aid in Haiti.
The expert witnesses were also divided, although even those pushing for greater Congressional financial oversight noted that the United Nations budget process made it difficult to isolate financing for particular branches.
Annual assessments from member states are lumped into a large pot -- with the United States by far the largest contributor because of the size of its economy. It pays about one-fifth of the general budget and more than a quarter of the separate peacekeeping budget.
In 2009, the last year for which complete figures are available, the United States paid $6.35 billion, roughly half in assessed contributions and the rest in voluntary payments for humanitarian and other needs, according to State Department figures.
The administration of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has been accused of being weak on ferreting out corruption. After fierce opposition from member states, including Russia and Singapore, an independent investigations office that unearthed serious procurement corruption was disbanded, and promises to carry out the work internally were never put into effect.
The Obama administration has also been faulted -- a permanent American ambassador at the United States Mission to oversee reform issues was not nominated until November and has not yet been confirmed. Withholding American budget support for the United Nations is a Republican perennial -- President Obama reversed the Bush policy of not paying hundreds of millions of dollars in American arrears.
Mr. Ban will travel to Washington soon to meet with Republican lawmakers, although no date has been set, his spokesman said.

HEADLINE: From G.O.P., A Response, Followed By Another

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The crosscurrents inside the Republican Party were on fresh display Tuesday evening with the unusual sight of two lawmakers delivering responses to the State of the Union address.
In the party's official reply, which immediately followed President Obama's speech, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the country faced ''a crushing burden of debt.'' He vowed that Republicans, after assuming control of the House this year, would honor their pledge to provide Americans ''a better choice and a different vision.''
''Americans are skeptical of both political parties, and that skepticism is justified -- especially when it comes to spending,'' Mr. Ryan said, striking a conciliatory tone as he vowed to work with the president to find cuts. ''So hold all of us accountable.'' 
But Mr. Ryan, who was designated by Speaker John A. Boehner to respond to the president, did not have the last word. Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who founded the Tea Party Caucus last year, gave a response of her own in a message to the Tea Party Express, one of the movement's largest groups of activists.
''For two years,'' Ms. Bachmann said, ''President Obama made promises, just like the ones we heard him make this evening, yet still we have high unemployment, devalued housing prices and the cost of gasoline is skyrocketing.''
She stood in front of a chart, which she used to illustrate how federal spending has increased in the Obama administration. The broadcast was delayed for several minutes, and after Ms. Bachmann finally arrived in front of the cameras, she glanced offstage throughout her six-minute speech.
While the speech from Ms. Bachmann was initially to be carried only on the Web site of the Tea Party Express, her speech was elevated when CNN provided live coverage after Mr. Ryan's remarks. The dueling responses, which privately angered several leading Republicans, highlighted the potential fissures inside the party as Republicans face the challenges of governing in a time of severe budget constraints.
Mr. Ryan, a rising figure inside the party who has become a leading Republican voice on budget cuts, characterized the nation's fiscal outlook as urgent and dire. He did not dwell upon his often-discussed plan to overhaul Social Security and other entitlement programs -- ideas that are controversial even inside his own party -- but instead focused on differences with the White House, particularly the health care law.
''Health care spending is driving the explosive growth of our debt. And the president's law is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''Our debt is out of control. What was a fiscal challenge is now a fiscal crisis.''
He delivered his remarks from the Budget Committee hearing room on Capitol Hill, where many of the difficult debates will take place as lawmakers decide how to try to control spending. He offered few specific ideas in his 10-minute address, saying that the role of the government ''is both vital and limited.''
While Mr. Ryan's remarks had the blessing of his party's leadership, and were intended to serve as a blueprint for a way forward, aides said Ms. Bachmann had not shared her comments in advance with Republican leaders or sought their approval, but rather was speaking on behalf of leaders of the Tea Party Express.
''I'm here at their request,'' she said, ''and not to compete with the official Republican remarks.''

HEADLINE: After a Detour, Mapping America's Journey

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
For all the speculation leading up to President Obama's second State of the Union address, the most profound shift in the speech turned out not to be a move from left to center, as some had predicted, but rather a move away from legislative priorities in favor of telling a broader American story.
After two years of getting dragged down into the arcane details of lawmaking, the man who rocked two Democratic conventions with his soaring language signaled that he was ready to reach for grand themes once again. 
Mr. Obama delivered a narrative of American life that evoked images of Depression-era murals and cold-war newsreels, rather than hammering away at specific laws he had passed or planned to propose. He harked back to sputnik, the Apollo project and the intercontinental railroad. He made a case for public investment, not with specific proposals but by describing a futuristic America -- one million electric vehicles by 2015, 80 percent clean energy by 2035, access to high-speed rail for 8 out of 10 Americans within 25 years.
''We are the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices, the nation of Edison and the Wright Brothers, of Google and Facebook,'' Mr. Obama said. Illustrating his intention to modernize the federal bureaucracy for the information age, the president said that ''the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV.''
''We do big things,'' the president said repeatedly in a closing riff about the American journey.
Last year, in his first State of the Union address, Mr. Obama spent much of his time, as he had as president to that point, discussing the merits of his economic program and pushing Congress to pass bills to create jobs and overhaul the health care system. By contrast, on Tuesday night, he dwelled for barely two paragraphs on the health care law, which is bound to transform the American economy, for better or worse.
Mr. Obama is hardly the first modern president to sweep into the White House on the strength of a compelling storyline, only to lose himself in the minutiae of Congressional wrangling. President Bill Clinton, too, surrounded himself largely with Capitol Hill veterans and hurled himself into legislative negotiations when he took office in 1993.
Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Clinton broadened his focus after losing control of both the House and the Senate in 1994. In his second State of the Union speech, Mr. Clinton returned to the idea of his ''new covenant'' between government and citizens, a theme he had used when he first announced his candidacy years earlier.
If anything, though, Mr. Obama has been even more immersed in business on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue -- and less engaged in any sustained pitch to the public. This is probably because he himself was a senator, the first directly elected to the presidency in almost a half-century.
It may also be because Mr. Obama's advisers were sensitive to the suggestion, which trailed him during the campaign, that he preferred pep rallies and uplifting rhetoric to the business of governing, with which he had limited experience. It probably seemed prudent, at a time of economic crisis, to avoid the appearance that Mr. Obama was planning to orate the country back to health.
This strategy yielded, by any measure, a remarkable string of legislative victories, not limited to the roughly $880 billion stimulus plan and the health care law. But it also allowed the connection between Mr. Obama and an inspired electorate to atrophy. And in the absence of an ongoing public explanation of the president's policies, confusion set in -- even among a lot of his supporters -- about why Mr. Obama wanted to spend all this money and what kind of political philosophy he really espoused.
''The irony, of course, is that he was ubiquitous and constantly in people's faces,'' said Don Baer, a communications director in the Clinton White House. ''But he wasn't consciously explaining and pounding a narrative to the country about where we were and where we were going.''
Since the November elections, though, Mr. Obama has seemed inclined to pivot toward a more expansive notion of the presidency. His top hires in the past several weeks, including William Daley to be chief of staff and Gene Sperling to be his top economic policy adviser, have deep experience not just in government but also in Democratic campaigns. The White House's newest senior adviser, David Plouffe, was the architect of Mr. Obama's high-tech and historic 2008 campaign, built on a model of grass-roots support that bypassed the traditional party apparatus.
In describing his State of the Union approach to reporters before Mr. Obama's speech last night, senior White House aides used the terms ''story'' and ''painting a picture,'' but they declined to discuss the specific proposals that might be coming in the weeks ahead, or even whether those proposals would be included in Mr. Obama's budget or in separate bills. Their fear now seems to be not that Mr. Obama might be viewed as too lofty or imprecise in his governing vision, but that he might come to seem like an American prime minister -- a legislative technocrat rather than a visionary leader.
No doubt the details will come soon enough, and no doubt they will prove divisive. (''We will argue about everything,'' Mr. Obama said on Tuesday.) But the argument this time seems more likely to resonate outside the halls of Congress, in a far grander debate.

HEADLINE: Who Invests in Low-Income Housing? Google, for One

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Melbourne Apartments is a new 84-unit building in Des Moines, where a three-bedroom apartment rents for $775 a month but comes with restrictions -- a family of five, for example, can earn no more than $47,460 a year. What is remarkable about this otherwise modest project is that the equity came from the search-engine giant Google, whose Mountain View, Calif., headquarters are more than 1,500 miles away.
The investment by Google and other large corporations in Melbourne Apartments and similar projects is one reason a cloud of gloom has lifted for developers of income-restricted housing. These developments depend heavily on low-income-housing tax credits, which provide the equity that makes the difference between whether a project gets built or not.
But when the economy collapsed in 2008 the market for these tax credits dwindled, and many projects never got off the ground. Just $4.5 billion in tax credit equity was raised in 2009, compared with $9 billion in 2006, said Frederick H. Copeman, who heads the tax credit practice at the Reznick Group, a national accounting and consulting company. ''People were ready to walk off gangplanks,'' he said. Mr. Copeman estimated that $7 billion was raised last year. 
Created more than two decades ago to instill market discipline into the development of subsidized housing, low-income-housing tax credits are allocated by the federal government and awarded by the states to projects that meet strict requirements. Developers sell the credits to investors -- generally financial institutions -- that are seeking to reduce their federal income tax over a 10-year period. The banks have another incentive, because investing in tax credits helps them fulfill their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act to invest in poorer neighborhoods where they have customers.
But after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, ''the banks were focused on their long-term liquidity,'' rather than on offsetting profits, said another income-restricted housing expert, Michael Novogradac, the managing partner in the San Francisco office of Novogradac & Company. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which had been major investors in tax credits, stopped buying them in 2007. Weakened demand for tax credits led to lower prices, which made them less valuable to developers.
But if you can buy $1 worth of tax credit for 59 cents, you are getting a better return on your investment. That made the credits attractive to a new class of investors looking for double-digit yields. In addition to Google, new investors include Verizon and the insurance companies Liberty Mutual and Allstate, said James L. Logue III, chief operating officer of Great Lakes Capital Fund, in Lansing, Mich., which invests in income-restricted housing in the Midwest and upstate New York.
Now that the pool of investors has grown and many financial institutions are once again healthy, prices for tax credits are rising and many long-delayed projects are getting under way.
John Hayes, the chief executive of Ginosko Development Company in Milford, Mich., said he waited almost two years to begin a $7.7 million rehabilitation of Devon Square, a 1970s garden apartment complex in Ferndale, Mich., a suburb of Detroit. ''We closed five deals in 2008, and then we had nothing from September 2008 on,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''Our next closing was in April 2010.'' Great Lakes provided more than $3 million credit equity.
Some tax credit specialists say that coastal states have an unfair advantage over other regions where the need for this type of housing is just as pressing. In the Midwest, for example, the going price for a dollar's worth of tax credits is about 70 cents or so, with some metropolitan areas getting 80 cents, Mr. Logue said. In New York, by contrast, Capital One Bank is paying 97 cents on the dollar for about $29 million worth of tax credits for Sugar Hill, an ambitious project that will replace a former garage on 155th Street between Saint Nicholas Avenue and Saint Nicholas Place in Harlem. Just two years ago, though, a dollar's worth of tax credits in New York was selling for about 20 cents less, said William Traylor, the president of Richman Housing Resources, a New York-based division of the Richman Group of Greenwich, Conn., which brought together Capital One Bank and the Sugar Hill developer, Broadway Housing Communities.
Mr. Copeman attributed the differential today in tax credit prices from one region to another to ''the unintended, perverse consequences'' of the Community Reinvestment Act, despite what he said was a need for five million more units in all 50 states. He said banks generally did not make these investments in places where they had no depositors.
Joe Hagan, the president and chief executive of the National Equity Fund, a nonprofit organization based in Chicago that raised $800 million in tax credit equity last year, said he favored a regional approach so that a financial institution with branches only in New York could fulfill its community reinvestment duty in Albany.
A second reason for the spread in tax credit prices is the perceived risk in communities where market-rate housing has declined in value. Tax credits are forfeited if a foreclosure occurs.
But demand is so high in New York that the 124 units at Sugar Hill will be allocated by lottery. A three-bedroom apartment at Sugar Hill will rent for about $1,200, less than half of market rent, Broadway Housing officials said. About 5,000 applications are expected, they said.
Perched on the promontory known as Coogan's Bluff, near where the old New York Giants played baseball at the Polo Grounds, the $73 million Sugar Hill development will also include a children's museum named for the Harlem artist Faith Ringgold, and education and other services for the low-income residents and the surrounding neighborhood. By augmenting housing with services, ''we can serve more families than can be accommodated in a residential development,'' said Ellen Baxter, the executive director of Broadway Housing, a nonprofit organization that has redeveloped six other buildings in Harlem.
Outside New York and a few other places, investors may worry about whether the units will fill up. Capital One will not invest in a project unless market-rate rents in the area are at least 10 percent higher than the subsidized rents, said Laura Bailey, a managing vice president.
Beth Stohr, the director of the low-income housing tax credit program for the U.S. Bancorp Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, said the investors needed to be sure that a project would be viable over a long period of time. ''The key to all of this is getting a good market review,'' she said, ''so you understand the dynamics of the market.''
But for certain types of cash-rich investors, the riskier markets have presented a lucrative opportunity because of the high returns. Robert J. Wasserman, the managing director for tax credit syndications at U.S. Bancorp, said he had logged 170,000 miles since a 2009 meeting with potential new investors like Google. The bank arranged an $86 million fund for Google to invest in 480 income-restricted apartments in the Midwest and California, including the Melbourne Apartments in Des Moines.
Brent Callinicos, a Google vice president, took note in a statement of the ''void in affordable housing investment'' and said the tax credit investments ''allows us to further our goal of providing relief to people who otherwise may not have access to quality housing.'' But will tax credits seem less attractive now that the annual rate of return has declined to about 8 percent from a high of 15 percent?
Mr. Wasserman acknowledged that the answer was unknown. ''Will these new investors stay in the market?'' he said. ''So far, we think it will go on for another year. I don't know what's going to happen after that.''

HEADLINE: Johnson & Johnson's Profit Falls 12%, Hurt by Series of Recalls

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Johnson & Johnson, hurt by product recalls and a weak economy, posted a 12 percent decline in profit and a 5.5 percent decline in sales for the fourth quarter on Tuesday. 
The company reported net income of $1.94 billion, or 70 cents a share, down from $2.21 billion, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, earnings would have been $1.03 a share, matching analysts' expectations. The company took an after-tax charge of $922 million for litigation settlements, a recall of poorly fitting DePuy hip implants and an increase in its product liability reserve.
The company's revenue fell to $15.64 billion from $16.6 billion a year earlier. It was also below the $16 billion expected by analysts polled by FactSet.
Johnson & Johnson has been hurt by 17 recalls since September 2009, covering multiple McNeil Consumer Healthcare products, plus contact lenses and hip replacements, and the lengthy shutdown of one of the factories involved. Lost revenue from the recalled products reduced 2010 sales by $900 million, 50 percent more than Johnson & Johnson predicted last year.
The chief executive, William C. Weldon, tried in a conference call to reassure analysts and investors that the company had its manufacturing and other problems under control.
But shares of Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., fell $1.14, or 1.8 percent, to $61.08.
Johnson & Johnson also forecast a full-year profit of $4.80 to $4.90 a share, below the $4.99 expected by analysts.
Results also were affected by the weak global economy squeezing consumer health spending, the impact of the health care overhaul in the United States and European government demands for lower prices.
During a conference call Tuesday, Mr. Weldon said pricing pressures from hospitals and governments would not go away soon, if ever, but that expected continued sales growth in emerging markets, and several important new drugs awaiting approval, would help J.& J. recover.
Mr. Weldon, 62, also said the company was committed to restoring its over-the-counter medicines to the quality level consumers expected.
Sales of consumer products like Tylenol, Benadryl and Rolaids, all the subject of recalls over product contamination and other problems, were down the most. Sales in that division fell 15 percent to $3.6 billion, with a 29 percent decline in the United States.
Sales of prescription drugs, which include Remicade for immune disorders and Concerta for attention deficit disorder, fell nearly 5 percent to $5.71 billion. The medical device division, now J.& J.'s largest, did best with sales up 0.2 percent to $6.32 billion.

HEADLINE: Financial Distress and the Bankruptcy Code

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: Chapter 9 and Chapter 11 could be harmonized with regard to labor contracts, argues Stephen J. Lubben. 

 BODY:
Now that the issue of states filing for Chapter 9 relief is in the spotlight, it seems appropriate to revisit this topic.
In particular, I want to consider the strong political tint that the notion of opening Chapter 9 to the states has taken. In large part, this tracks a similar political tone that has developed with regard to the use of Chapter 11 to resolve failing financial institutions, as contrasted with the new Dodd-Frank resolution authority.
With the exception of myself, the parties advocating both of these positions -- and the publications that have published articles about these suggestions -- are associated with the Republican Party.
In many ways this is unfortunate, since it has focused the debate on the issue of using the Bankruptcy Code to break union contracts, in the case of state bankruptcy, and using Chapter 11 to prevent government bailouts of corporations, in the case of the resolution authority. 
In the case of state bankruptcy in particular, this is apt to make the discussion a nonstarter for members of the Democratic Party, which controls two out of three parts of the legislative process.
Moreover, it obscures other reasons to consider expanding Chapter 9 to the states, among them the sovereign immunity problem I identified in my previous Dealbook article on this topic. 
As part of such a revision to the Bankruptcy Code, Chapter 9 and Chapter 11 could be harmonized with regard to labor contracts -- right now there is a much stronger power to terminate union contracts in municipal bankruptcy cases.
On the issue of using Chapter 11 to address financial distress in financial institutions, I think the belief of those on the right that Chapter 11 would prevent bailouts cannot be taken at face value.
Theautomotive cases, which they are undoubtedly aware of, demonstrate that bailouts and Chapter 11 are entirely compatible. Those that support the repeal of Dodd-Frank's resolution authority and its replacement with Chapter 11 must also contemplate a ban on the government as a lender to complete their argument.
But I think there are reasons to favor Chapter 11 as a bailout mechanism even without this final, radical step. Chapter 11 provides a degree of transparency totally lacking in cases like those involving the American International Group, or even Washington Mutual. 
The notion that the government will not resort to bailouts in times of financial crisis seems totally implausible in any real world, however much it may be at home in the theoretical worlds populated by certain economists. But it seems perfectly reasonable for taxpayers to want to understand how their money is being spent and what risks are being incurred in their name.

HEADLINE: From Bullets to Megabytes

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. FALKENRATH. 
Richard A. Falkenrath, a principal of the Chertoff Group, an investment advisory firm, is a former deputy commissioner for counterterrorism for the New York Police Department and deputy homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush.

 BODY:
STUXNET, the computer worm that last year disrupted many of the gas centrifuges central to Iran's nuclear program, is a powerful weapon in the new age of global information warfare. A sophisticated half-megabyte of computer code apparently accomplished what a half-decade of United Nations Security Council resolutions could not.
This new form of warfare has several implications that are only now becoming apparent, and that will define the shape of what will likely become the next global arms race -- albeit one measured in computer code rather than firepower. 
For one thing, the Stuxnet attack highlights the ambiguous boundaries of sovereignty in cyberspace. Promoting national security in the information age will, from time to time, cause unpredictable offense to the rights and interests of innocent people, companies and countries.
Stuxnet attacked the Iranian nuclear program, but it did so by maliciously manipulating commercial software products sold globally by major Western companies. Whoever launched the assault also infected thousands of computers in several countries, including Australia, Britain, Indonesia and the United States.
This kind of collateral damage to the global civilian realm is going to be the norm, not the exception, and advanced economies, which are more dependent on advanced information systems, will be at particular risk.
What's more, offensive and defensive information warfare are tightly, insidiously coupled, which will significantly complicate military-industrial relations.
The expertise needed to defend against a cyberattack is essentially indistinguishable from that needed to make such an attack. The Stuxnet programmers are reported to have exploited proprietary information that had been voluntarily provided to the American government by Siemens, that German company that makes data-and-control programs used in nuclear power facilities -- including Iran's.
Siemens did this to help Washington build up its ability to fend off cyberattacks. Will Siemens and other companies think twice next time the American government calls? Probably. Whether it's true or not, as far as the rest of the world is concerned, the United States is now in the business of offensive information warfare, along with China, Israel and Russia, among others.
It's not hard to imagine, then, the splintering of the global information technology industry into multiple camps according to their willingness to cooperate with governments on security matters. We can already see this happening in the telecommunications industry, where companies promote their products' resistance to government intrusion. At the same time, other companies might see an advantage to working closely with the government.
Stuxnet also raises sticky and perhaps irresolvable legal questions. At present there is no real legal framework for adjudicating international cyberattacks; even if victims could determine who was responsible, their governments have few options outside of diplomatic complaints and, perhaps, retaliation in kind. An international entity that could legislate or enforce an information warfare armistice does not exist, and is not really conceivable.
A similar question exists within the United States. Under American law the transmission of malicious code is in many cases a criminal offense. This makes sense, given the economy's reliance on information networks, the sensitivity of stored electronic data and the ever-present risk of attack from viruses, worms and other varieties of malware.
But the president, as commander in chief, does have some authority to conduct offensive information warfare against foreign adversaries. However, as with many presidential powers to wage war and conduct espionage, the extent of his authority has never been enumerated.
This legal ambiguity is problematic because such warfare is far less controllable than traditional military and intelligence operations, and it raises much more complex issues of private property, personal privacy and commercial integrity.
Therefore, before our courts are forced to consider the issue and potentially limit executive powers, as they did after President Harry Truman tried to seize steel plants in the early 1950s, Congress should grant the White House broad authority to wage offensive information warfare.
By explicitly authorizing these offensive operations in appropriate, defined circumstances, a new statute would strengthen the president's power to provide for the common defense in cyberspace. Doing so wouldn't answer all the questions that this new era of warfare presents. But one thing is sure: as bad as this arms race will be, losing it would be even worse.

HEADLINE: Moody's Credit Ratings of States To Factor In Unfunded Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service has begun to recalculate the states' debt burdens in a way that includes unfunded pensions, something states and others have ardently resisted until now.
States do not now show their pension obligations -- funded or not -- on their audited financial statements. The board that issues accounting rules does not require them to. And while it has been working on possible changes to the pension accounting rules, investors have grown increasingly nervous about municipal bonds.
Moody's new approach may now turn the tide in favor of more disclosure. The ratings agency said that in the future, it will add states' unfunded pension obligations together with the value of their bonds, and consider the totals when rating their credit. The new approach will be more comparable to how the agency rates corporate debt and sovereign debt. Moody's did not indicate whether states' credit ratings may rise or fall. 
Under its new method, Moody's found that the states with the biggest total indebtedness included Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey and Rhode Island. Puerto Rico also ranked high on the scale because its pension fund for public workers is so depleted that it has virtually become a pay-as-you-go plan, meaning each year's payments to retirees are essentially coming out of the budget each year.
Other big states that have had trouble balancing their budgets lately, like New York and California, tended to fare better in the new rankings. That is because Moody's counted only the unfunded portion of states' pension obligations. New York and California have tended to put more money into their state pension funds over the years, so they have somewhat smaller shortfalls.
In the past, Moody's looked at a state's level of bonded debt alone when assessing its creditworthiness. Pensions were considered ''soft debt'' and were considered separately from the bonds, using a different method.
''A more standard analysis would view both of these as liabilities that need to be paid and put stress on your operating budgets,'' said Robert Kurtter, managing director for public finance at Moody's.
In making the change, Moody's sidestepped a bitter, continuing debate about whether states and cities were accurately measuring their total pension obligations in the first place. In adding together the value of the states' bonds and their unfunded pensions, Moody's is using the pension values reported by the states. The shortfalls reported by the states greatly understate the scale of the problem, according to a number of independent researchers.
''Analysts and investors have to work with the information we have and draw their own conclusions about what the information shows,'' Mr. Kurtter said.
In a report that is being made available to clients on Thursday, Moody's acknowledges the controversy, pointing out that governments and corporations use very different methods to measure their total pension obligations. The government method allows public pension funds to credit themselves for the investment income, and the contributions, that they expect to receive in the future. It has come under intense criticism since 2008 because the expected investment returns have not materialized. Some states have not made the required contributions either.
Moody's noted in its report that it was going to keep using the states' own numbers, but said that if they were calculated differently, it ''would likely lead to higher underfunded liabilities than are currently disclosed.''
After adding up the values of each state's bonds and its unfunded pensions, Moody's compared the totals to each state's available resources, something it did in the past only for each state's bonds. It found that some relatively low-tax states, like Colorado and Illinois, had very high total debts compared with their revenue, suggesting that their finances could be improved by collecting more taxes.
But some states that are heavily indebted, like New Jersey, also have among the highest tax rates, suggesting other types of action may be needed to reduce their debt burdens.
Moody's also ranked total indebtedness on the basis of each state's total economic output and its population. It did not factor state promises for retiree health care into its analysis, on the thinking that pensions are a fixed debt like bonds, but retiree health plans can usually be renegotiated.
Mr. Kurtter said Moody's was not suggesting that any state was in such serious trouble that it was about to default on its bonds, something considered extremely unlikely by many analysts.
Some state officials have complained about a recent tendency to focus on total pension obligations, calling it a scare tactic by union opponents who want to abolish traditional pensions and make all state workers save for their own retirements.
Mr. Kurtter said Moody's had decided it was important to consider total unfunded pension obligations because they could contribute to current budget woes.
''These are really reflections of the budget stress that states and local governments are now feeling,'' he said. A company with too much debt could close its doors, he said, but governments do not have that option.
''They have a tax base. They have contractually obligated themselves to make these payments. These are part of the ongoing budget stress,'' he said. ''It ultimately all comes back to being an operating cost. Addressing those problems is really what's happening today.''

HEADLINE: One Nation, Indivisible

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit flouted Supreme Court law when it struck down affirmative action at the University of Texas Law School. Last week, in an act of redemption, the appellate court upheld an admissions plan for undergraduates at the University of Texas at Austin that takes race into account to encourage diversity. The plan was adopted after the Supreme Court again approved affirmative action in higher education in 2003. 
Like many other universities, the University of Texas values diversity's many educational benefits. Students educated in a diverse university are better prepared for a diverse work force and for helping bring about what the Supreme Court called the dream of ''one nation, indivisible.''
When the Fifth Circuit said the university couldn't consider race in admissions in 1996, Texas passed the Top 10 Percent Law that used geographic diversity as a proxy for race. Any resident graduating in the top tenth of a high school class is assured admission to a state university. Four-fifths of the places in each University of Texas at Austin class have been for Top 10 students.
For the remaining fifth, the university assesses applicants individually through grades, test scores and so on. But it also looks at other factors, including socio-economic background and race. Students admitted this way turn out to be more competitive, not less. The average SAT score of these students at the university is higher than that of Top 10 students automatically admitted.
Two unsuccessful white applicants challenged this method, saying it discriminated against them because of their race. Rejecting the claim, the Fifth Circuit explained why the selective method is successful and why the Top 10 plan hasn't met the university's diversity goal although it has admitted a lot of minority students.
As Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote, ''those minority students remain clustered in certain programs'' -- education and social work -- ''limiting the beneficial effects of educational diversity.'' While Top 10 plans successfully increase minority enrollment, some high schools don't prepare students well to meet requirements of the more demanding majors at the university.
When the Supreme Court said universities could consider race in admissions, it said they could do that, not that they had to. This ruling should give confidence to all universities about seeking diversity and merit.

HEADLINE: Nassau County Has Its Finances Seized by State

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
UNIONDALE, N.Y. -- A state oversight board on Wednesday seized control of Nassau County's finances, saying the county, one of the nation's wealthiest and most heavily taxed, had nonetheless failed to balance its $2.7 billion budget.
Many hard-hit local governments have flirted with insolvency because of revenue shortfalls caused by the recession, but the financial problems of Nassau, on Long Island, owed more to a failure by county officials to face up to tough economic reality responsibly and quickly enough, according to the state board.
''The county's 2011 budget is built on a foundation of sand,'' a board member, George J. Marlin, said.
The move, which came after months of steadily more ominous threats and a downgrade of Nassau's debt by a credit-rating agency in November, turns the oversight board into a control board, with vast power to rewrite the county's budget and veto labor contracts, borrowings and other important financial commitments. 
As a first step, the control board ordered the county government to rewrite its budget by Feb. 15 omitting cost-savings items that the board has called specious or too risky.
Nassau's tax receipts are the envy of many worse-off municipalities: its malls and busy retail districts, a short drive from New York City, help generate about $1 billion in sales taxes a year, and its aging bedroom communities add about $800 million in county property taxes.
But the county has resisted cuts in services, and its current leaders have been just as adamant about not raising taxes.
Nassau now finds itself joining much less affluent places in New York State, like the cities of Newburgh, Troy and Yonkers, that have had control periods imposed on them in recent years.
The only other county in New York that has been taken over in modern times is Erie, the state's 24th-wealthiest county, where the median household income is about half that in Nassau, which is the richest county in the state.
''Some places manage their way into fiscal problems, and other places are beset by social forces, many of them outside of their own control,'' said Steven J. Hancox, a deputy state comptroller who oversees local government. ''Nassau has had a history where the populace has enjoyed a variety of services, and those cost money.
''It doesn't really matter where you are; when the money dries up you have tough choices to make.''
While voting 6 to 0 to take over the county's finances, the control board, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, stopped short, for now, of declaring a financial emergency, which would also allow it to impose a wage freeze on county workers. But it said that remained a likelihood if Nassau's leaders did not comply with its demands to cooperate in bringing the county's spending into line with revenues by Feb. 15.
''The taxpayers elected a team,'' the authority's chairman, Ronald A. Stack, said. ''Hopefully the team will be able to perform.''
Yet the takeover was a stinging rebuke to Nassau's county executive, Edward P. Mangano, a Republican who took office a year ago after upsetting a popular incumbent in 2009. Mr. Mangano had repeatedly said the budget was balanced, and then insisted there were ample contingencies to cover any shortfalls. But the authority said that many of his assertions were unfounded or unsupportable.
Should the county choose to work closely with the authority, it could seek to reopen talks with labor unions, emboldened and newly empowered by that alliance. But the response from the county on Wednesday was adversarial in tone.
''Who elected them?'' asked the county attorney, John Ciampoli, referring to the authority.
Mr. Mangano, speaking to reporters after the board's decision, said he was considering a lawsuit to block the takeover, accused the authority of wanting to raise property taxes and urged taxpayers to question its ''motivation.'' He has accused the board members of having partisan Democratic sympathies.
Mr. Stack, a veteran municipal banker who as a state official was involved in addressing the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, said the county's deficit, under the strict accounting standards required by state law, was $176 million, or more than six times the threshold of 1 percent of the budget -- above which the law required the authority to take control.
Using the county's own more forgiving accounting rules, he added, the county's deficit was $49 million, but still nearly twice the statutory trigger point for a takeover.
In a lengthy text explaining its decision, the authority said that Mr. Mangano's signature tax cut -- the repeal of a tax on home-heating fuel -- was one of several factors that stretched the county's ability to balance its budget to the ''breaking point.''
Moreover, the authority said Nassau's reserves had dropped to dangerously low levels.
A takeover would last only until the county's budget was declared back in balance, but how long that will take depends largely on county officials, Mr. Stack said.
Mr. Marlin, a Conservative Party member, noted that he was an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Mangano's election, and even credited him with ''some forward progress.''
And Mr. Stack said the board included a Republican and an Independent, along with three Democrats. ''We have a 6-0 vote here,'' he said. ''It is not partisan. It is not political.''
Mr. Mangano, in his news conference, also questioned why the authority had refrained from imposing a wage freeze. And he insisted that a takeover was unwarranted, pointing to an 11th-hour tentative labor agreement with a county worker's union, announced on Monday, that he said would mean tens of millions in annual county savings.
But Mr. Stack said the labor deal, which the authority now can approve or reject, would have saved only $2 million this year.
Nassau's government, once a model for other suburban communities, has long been plagued by a tangled property tax-assessment system that forces it to refund tens of millions of dollars a year to residents and business owners who win appeals of their local, school and county tax bills. In effect, the county subsidizes some of the nation's richest school districts.
The county first got into deep trouble a decade ago by borrowing to pay those refunds, though they are an operating expense, and by relying on one-shot revenues, rather than raising taxes. It averted disaster only with a $100 million state bailout in June 2000. As a condition of that aid, the state created the oversight board to ensure that Nassau corrected its poor fiscal practices.
Chief among those was borrowing to pay tax refunds, and some progress was made in switching to a pay-as-you-go policy. But Mr. Mangano's financial plan called for borrowing $364 million over the next two years to pay tax refunds -- ''the very practice that precipitated the 2000 crisis NIFA was created to address,'' the board said.

HEADLINE: Record Level of Stress Found in College Freshmen

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The emotional health of college freshmen -- who feel buffeted by the recession and stressed by the pressures of high school -- has declined to the lowest level since an annual survey of incoming students started collecting data 25 years ago.
In the survey, ''The American Freshman: National Norms Fall 2010,'' involving more than 200,000 incoming full-time students at four-year colleges, the percentage of students rating themselves as ''below average'' in emotional health rose. Meanwhile, the percentage of students who said their emotional health was above average fell to 52 percent. It was 64 percent in 1985. 
Every year, women had a less positive view of their emotional health than men, and that gap has widened.
Campus counselors say the survey results are the latest evidence of what they see every day in their offices -- students who are depressed, under stress and using psychiatric medication, prescribed even before they came to college.
The economy has only added to the stress, not just because of financial pressures on their parents but also because the students are worried about their own college debt and job prospects when they graduate.
''This fits with what we're all seeing,'' said Brian Van Brunt, director of counseling at Western Kentucky University and president of the American College Counseling Association. ''More students are arriving on campus with problems, needing support, and today's economic factors are putting a lot of extra stress on college students, as they look at their loans and wonder if there will be a career waiting for them on the other side.''
The annual survey of freshmen is considered the most comprehensive because of its size and longevity. At the same time, the question asking students to rate their own emotional health compared with that of others is hard to assess, since it requires them to come up with their own definition of emotional health, and to make judgments of how they compare with their peers.
''Most people probably think emotional health means, 'Am I happy most of the time, and do I feel good about myself?' so it probably correlates with mental health,'' said Dr. Mark Reed, the psychiatrist who directs Dartmouth College's counseling office.
''I don't think students have an accurate sense of other people's mental health,'' he added. ''There's a lot of pressure to put on a perfect face, and people often think they're the only ones having trouble.''
To some extent, students' decline in emotional health may result from pressures they put on themselves.
While first-year students' assessments of their emotional health were declining, their ratings of their own drive to achieve, and academic ability, have been going up, and reached a record high in 2010, with about three-quarters saying they were above average.
''Students know their generation is likely to be less successful than their parents', so they feel more pressure to succeed than in the past,'' said Jason Ebbeling, director of residential education at Southern Oregon University. ''These days, students worry that even with a college degree they won't find a job that pays more than minimum wage, so even at 15 or 16 they're thinking they'll need to get into an M.B.A. program or Ph.D. program.''
Other findings in the survey underscore the degree to which the economy is weighing on college students.
''Paternal unemployment is at the highest level since we started measuring,'' said John Pryor, director of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at U.C.L.A.'s Higher Education Research Institute, which does the annual freshman survey. ''More students are taking out loans. And we're seeing the impact of not being able to get a summer job, and the importance of financial aid in choosing which college they're going to attend.''
''We don't know exactly why students' emotional health is declining,'' he said. ''But it seems the economy could be a lot of it.''
For many young people, serious stress starts before college. The share of students who said on the survey that they had been frequently overwhelmed by all they had to do during their senior year of high school rose to 29 percent from 27 percent last year.
The gender gap on that question was even larger than on emotional health, with 18 percent of the men saying they had been frequently overwhelmed, compared with 39 percent of the women.
There is also a gender gap, studies have shown, in the students who seek out college mental health services, with women making up 60 percent or more of the clients.
''Boys are socialized not to talk about their feelings or express stress, while girls are more likely to say they're having a tough time,'' said Perry C. Francis, coordinator for counseling services at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti. ''Guys might go out and do something destructive, or stupid, that might include property damage. Girls act out differently.''
Linda Sax, a professor of education at U.C.L.A. and former director of the freshman study who uses the data in research about college gender gaps, said the gap between men and women on emotional well-being was one of the largest in the survey.
''One aspect of it is how women and men spent their leisure time,'' she said. ''Men tend to find more time for leisure and activities that relieve stress, like exercise and sports, while women tend to take on more responsibilities, like volunteer work and helping out with their family, that don't relieve stress.''
In addition, Professor Sax has explored the role of the faculty in college students' emotional health, and found that interactions with faculty members were particularly salient for women. Negative interactions had a greater impact on their mental health.
''Women's sense of emotional well-being was more closely tied to how they felt the faculty treated them,'' she said. ''It wasn't so much the level of contact as whether they felt they were being taken seriously by the professor. If not, it was more detrimental to women than to men.''
She added: ''And while men who challenged their professor's ideas in class had a decline in stress, for women it was associated with a decline in well-being.''

HEADLINE: Dissenters Fault Report On Crisis In Finance

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The government commission's account of what caused the 2008 financial crisis offers a broad indictment of regulatory weakness, Wall Street avarice and corporate incompetence. But that narrative is competing with alternative views by the Republicans on the panel, who released their dissenting reports on Wednesday.
One dissent points to broad economic forces that contributed to the credit and housing bubbles that built up during the last decade, including a glut of savings in developing Asian countries that began accumulating in the late 1990s and provided the fuel for mortgage-backed investments in the United States and Europe. It does not focus on the culpability of government and business leaders, as the main report does. 
The other dissent argues that decades of government policies to promote homeownership are to blame for the creation of tens of millions of shoddy mortgages before the housing bubble burst in 2006-7. Though not the mainstream view, it could affect the looming debate over the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that have been in government conservatorship since 2008.
The disagreements threaten to blunt the impact of the main report. Those who had hoped for an authoritative account that would sear the public consciousness now seem pessimistic.
''I'm sad about it,'' said Kenneth T. Rosen, a business school economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who testified before the commission last year. ''This is a history, not a policy prescription. The fact that people read history so differently is a surprise to me. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised at anything going on in Washington right now.''
Steve Fraser, a Wall Street historian, said he did not think that the report would do much to stop the financial sector's return to business as usual.
''I am surprised -- more than surprised, shocked even -- that all that's transpired since 2007-8 has produced as little as it has, in terms of reckoning with how out of control this financial system was and the damage it's done,'' he said.
Mr. Fraser said the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law signed last July was helpful, but did not represent a far-reaching reassessment of the proper role of finance in American life.
''For a historian, it's a baffling moment,'' he said. ''All the stars seemed aligned to produce real, fundamental change in the direction of public policy, and yet here we are with an administration itself bending over backwards to make friends with the financial industry.''
The main report, a 576-page paperback due in bookstores Thursday and titled ''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report,'' offers ample ammunition for critics of Wall Street.
It cites ''pervasive permissiveness'' by regulators, ''dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management,'' and ''a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics.''
It compares the financial system before the crisis with ''a highway where there were neither speed limits nor neatly painted lines.'' And it finds fault with the deregulatory orthodoxies of the last 30 years, saying of regulators, ''The sentries were not at their posts, in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self-correcting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively police themselves.''
But that analysis is ''too broad,'' according to three Republican commission members: Bill Thomas, a former congressman from California and the vice chairman of the commission; Keith Hennessey, who was an economic adviser to President George W. Bush; and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
In a 25-page dissent, the three Republicans say the Democratic report ''is more an account of bad events than a focused explanation of what happened and why. When everything is important, nothing is.''
The three men say that some of the majority report's culprits -- excessive political influence of Wall Street, a deregulatory ideology and a flawed regulatory structure -- fail to account for the failure of financial institutions in Europe.
''By focusing too narrowly on U.S. regulatory policy and supervision, ignoring international parallels, emphasizing only arguments for greater regulation, failing to prioritize the causes and failing to distinguish sufficiently between causes and effects, the majority's report is unbalanced and leads to incorrect conclusions,'' they write.
The dissent also suggests that the Democrats were too quick to blame exotic financial instruments, like over-the-counter derivatives and collateralized debt obligations. The problem was not the instruments themselves, but a failure to use them appropriately, they write.
The dissenters also take a more charitable view of the pivotal decision in September 2008 by the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve to let Lehman Brothers fail. They say that three officials behind the decision -- Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary; Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman; and Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- ''would have saved Lehman if they thought they had a legal and viable option to do so'' and add, ''In hindsight, we also think they were right at the time.''
The fourth Republican, Peter J. Wallison, who was the chief lawyer for the Treasury Department and then the White House during the Reagan administration, is offering his own, 99-page dissent, which argues that government housing policies fostered the housing bubble and the creation of 27 million subprime and so-called alt-A loans.
It was the losses associated with these weak and risky loans that brought down financial institutions, not deregulation or predatory lending, Mr. Wallison, now at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, writes. He argues that the Dodd-Frank law ''seriously overreached'' and will ''have a major adverse effect on economic growth and job creation.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Mubarak Is Put on Notice

 BODY:
We sympathize with the frustration and anger that is drawing tens of thousands of Egyptians into the streets of Cairo and other cities this week, the country's largest demonstrations in years. Citizens of one of the Arab world's great nations, they struggle with poverty -- 40 percent live on less than $2 a day -- rising food prices, unemployment and political repression. 
Inspired by Tunisia's so-called Jasmine Revolution, they are demanding a government that respects its citizens' voices and is truly committed to improving their lives. Tunisia's revolution should be a warning to all rulers who cling to power for too long and ignore their people's demands. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt clearly hasn't figured that out.
After huge demonstrations on Tuesday, Egypt outlawed public gatherings on Wednesday -- but a large number of protestors defied the order and called again for Mr. Mubarak's ouster. According to news reports, the protestors came from all social classes and ideologies.
As authoritarian governments often do, the one in Cairo is deluding itself about the causes for the unrest, which had left two protestors and one policeman dead. Officials blamed the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition movement, which is formally banned but tolerated. Even if the Brotherhood had a role -- the group denies it; the truth seems more complex -- it is easy to understand why Egyptians are fed up.
Mr. Mubarak, 82 and in ill health, has been in power for three decades and is believed to be trying to fix it so his son Gamal can succeed him in elections expected later this year. Government projects that were supposed to benefit the poor only end up enriching the elite. Parliamentary elections in November were widely seen as fraudulent. Security forces, which beat and arrested hundreds of protestors, are widely seen as corrupt.
This is a delicate moment for the United States and Egypt, a crucial partner in Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
Mr. Mubarak may still have a chance to steer his country on a stable path without sacrificing it to extremist elements. That will require ordering security forces to exercise restraint against the protestors and -- even more importantly -- quickly offering Egyptians a credible, more democratic path forward.
President Obama was right to move beyond his predecessor's ''democracy'' agenda built around military intervention and empty rhetoric. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called publicly on Mr. Mubarak to make reforms and not to block peaceful protests. The administration needs to persuade him to accept the legitimacy and urgency behind the protests and begin talking to opposition groups. Egypt needs change. A peaceful transition would be best for everyone.

HEADLINE: The Permanent Collection May Not Be So Permanent

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
On Thursday at Sotheby's in New York, the Cleveland Museum of Art is putting 32 old-master paintings up for auction, and the J. Paul Getty Museum is offering 15. In the meantime the Pennsylvania Museum of Fine Arts and the Carnegie Museum of Art are selling five paintings each, and the Art Institute of Chicago is selling two Picassos, a Matisse and a Braque at Christie's in London. Last week the New Jersey Historical Society sold 17 items at Christie's in New York, including a 120-piece dinner service used to entertain President Martin Van Buren that went for $17,000.
A few years ago sales like these were likely to have gone unnoticed. Yet deaccessioning -- the art world term for selling pieces from a museum's collection -- has become a dirty word and the focus of increasingly intense attention. Cultural institutions like the National Academy Museum and the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University have generated controversy by selling or even considering selling items to cover operating costs, a practice forbidden by the professional association for art museum directors. 
So even though all of the sales -- with the exception of the historical society's -- are to be used to generate funds for future acquisitions, institutions that deaccession these days find themselves on the defensive. ''Part of the normal biological clock of museums is to examine their collections,'' said David Franklin, the director of the Cleveland Museum, which hopes to gain about $1 million from its sale. ''We should be constantly refining and upgrading. I've given the message to all the curators that I regard deaccessioning as a normal act, and I encourage them to reassess the collections constantly.''
Some curators and museum directors worry that the problematic practice has been conflated with the routine culling of collections integral to a museum's mission. Others protest that the entire profession is being tarred with the same brush, when the museums selling work to pay bills tend to be smaller institutions that are struggling to stay alive in an especially difficult economic climate.
In part the criticism surrounding deaccessioning has focused on whether museums have been open about selling work from their collections. The Indianapolis Museum of Art on its Web site, lists every object being sold, why it is being offered and the ultimate sale price or estimated value. The site has also begun to link newly acquired artworks to the sold objects that enabled their purchase. ''Without doing all of those steps, museums expose themselves to ridicule and risk unnecessarily,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson, the museum's director. ''There is nothing devious going on. They are just not handling it in a way that is candid and explained.''
The Metropolitan Museum of Art is required to list in its annual report the total cash proceeds from art sales each year and to itemize any deaccessioned objects valued at more than $50,000 each. It must also sell those pieces at auction and provide advance public notice of a work's being sold if it has been on view in the last 10 years. These rules were imposed by the state attorney general in 1972, after an investigation into the museum's sale of pieces from its modern art collection to help finance the purchase of Velazquez's ''Juan de Pareja.''
In the last three fiscal years the Met has sold close to $3.7 million worth of objects from its collection, including a statue of the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet, a first edition of Vitruvius's ''Ten Books on Architecture,'' and Albert Bierstadt's oil on canvas ''Rocky Mountain Goats.'' The museum used some of the proceeds from the Sekhmet to purchase other Egyptian pieces: a vizier statuette, a canopic jar and a sculpture of a king's head; the Vitruvius, sold with 26 other works, enabled the purchase of 19 objects, 8 of them leaves from an unpublished Italian manuscript copy of the ''Ten Books on Architecture''; the Bierstadt proceeds have yet to be used.
''It's sometimes portrayed in the press as if we're trading houses, with objects going in and going out,'' said the museum's director, Thomas P. Campbell. ''That's not the case. It's like a gardener pruning a tree over a long period of time. Deaccessioning is a healthy part of the management of any museum collection. We're not playing the market.''
A 1910 gift from Mrs. Russell Sage that formed the basis of the Met's American furniture holdings originally included 430 colonial pieces; now the cache numbers 190. ''In the intervening years more than 50 percent'' of that collection ''has been deaccessioned for reasons of quality or condition,'' Mr. Campbell said.
The Museum of Modern Art considers the review and revision of its collection part of its mandate. The museum's first major gift, in 1931 -- a group of works dominated by Cezannes from one of the museum's founders, Lillie P. Bliss -- came with the stipulation that the Modern should sell whatever it needed to buy works deemed more important (which it has). MoMA's first director, Alfred H. Barr Jr., described the museum as ''metabolic'' in terms of its programs and the changing nature of its holdings. ''We were predicated on an evolving collection,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, the museum's director. ''We seek to acquire broadly when it comes to contemporary art and let the next generation or even the generation after that determine what is essential.''
''Many of the greatest works in our collection are the result of deaccessioning,'' Mr. Lowry added, citing as examples Gerhard Richter's Baader-Meinhof series, Andy Warhol's Campbell's soup cans, van Gogh's ''Postman Joseph Roulin'' and Picasso's ''Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' all of which were bought with funds raised by selling other artworks.
The policies of each institution vary on selling works from their collections. If a living donor to the Met objects to his gift's being deaccessioned, the Met will honor that wish. The Modern takes the opposite tack, refusing any gift that prohibits a possible future sale. The Whitney Museum of American Art will not sell any work by a living artist because it could damage that artist's career. But it will trade a living artist's work for another piece by the same artist.
The Met did that last year, exchanging Pat Steir's oil on canvas ''The Water Series: The Port Reflected at Night in the Waterfall'' for her ''Sixteen Waterfalls of Dreams, Memories and Sentiment.'' Ms. Steir said it was her idea. ''I wanted them to have a better painting than the one they had,'' she said.
A few years ago the Whitney sold some ''secondary'' works by Marsden Hartley, said Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney's director, to get Hartley's portrait of a wrestler, ''Madawaska -- Acadian Light-Heavy.''
''The Whitney has a great collection of Hartley,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''One thing it did not have was a portrait.'' He added that the Whitney did the same thing with a John Sloan. ''One of the key reasons is to refine the collection, to make it a better, stronger example of a particular artist's work,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''At the end a museum collection is about quality.''
It was in part to protect this type of freedom that museums like the Whitney opposed temporary regulations from the New York State Board of Regents that imposed stricter guidelines in 2008 governing deaccessioning. ''They did not allow for that philosophical, aesthetic decision that is fundamental to the curatorial exercise of judgments of quality and improving a collection,'' Mr. Weinberg said. Under such regulations, he added, ''we could not have deaccessioned Hartleys for a better Hartley.''
While collections ''should be dynamic,'' Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, said, institutions should not be acquiring work with an eye toward trading up. ''It's not good to be thinking of the collection as a log-rolling exercise: 'I'll take two of that if you let me get one of those,''' he said. ''That's just not the way to make progress as a collecting institution.''
At most museums items designated for sale go through a rigorous evaluation process, starting with curators and ending with approval by the full board. Such sales are often precipitated by new galleries or building additions. The Cleveland Museum's coming sale, for example, was prompted in part by the reinstallation of its collection after a renovation. ''If you've determined that a work is less significant or in poor condition or never been on view, it becomes superfluous,'' said Mr. Franklin, the museum's director, ''and to store it becomes a luxury we can't afford.''
Deaccessioning is ''kind of a Humane Society,'' he added. ''Maybe some of these works can be loved by someone else.''

HEADLINE: HSBC Is Said to Be the Focus of a Tax-Evasion Investigation

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Federal authorities are considering whether to serve a broad legal summons on HSBC to ascertain whether it sold tax-evasion services to scores of wealthy American clients, people briefed on the matter said Wednesday.
The legal action was being considered as a federal indictment was announced Wednesday of an affluent client of an unidentified international bank on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States by keeping hidden bank accounts in India and the British Virgin Islands, an offshore tax haven, from about 2001 until this year.
The people who had been briefed on the matter said that the international bank was HSBC, which is based in London but has Swiss-style private banking operations around the world. 
The indictment, of Vaibhav Dahake, by federal prosecutors in United States District Court in Newark, said the unnamed bank had identified wealthy Indian-Americans as clients for undeclared offshore banking through N.R.I. Services, a United States division of the bank. The division, court papers said, encouraged United States citizens to open undeclared bank accounts in India.
Mr. Dahake, of Somerset, N.J., was born in India and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2006. He is a principal of Tricolor Inc., an information technology business in Somerset.
It was not clear how many client names would be covered under a summons, which would have to be issued by the Internal Revenue Service and enforced by the Justice Department. Last August, authorities dropped a similar summons against the Swiss bank giant UBS that had sought to require the bank to disclose the names of as many as 52,000 wealthy American clients.
HSBC said, ''HSBC does not condone tax evasion and fully supports the U.S. efforts to promote appropriate payment of taxes by U.S. taxpayers.''
In 2001, Mr. Dahake received from the international bank ''an unsolicited letter advertising bank accounts in India that paid high interest rates,'' court documents said.
The indictment cited as unindicted co-conspirators five unidentified bankers: three Americans, in New York and Fremont, Calif.; and two Indians, in Thane, near Mumbai, India.
One of the bankers advised Mr. Dahake to transfer money between his accounts in smaller amounts ''to stay below the radar'' of rules requiring banks to report to American customs officials transfers of $10,000 or more, according to the documents.
Other bankers advised him not to file required forms to the I.R.S declaring the money, and told him that money transferred between the British Virgin Islands account and the India account would not be processed through the United States banking system, further evading scrutiny.
One of the bankers told Mr. Dahake that he did not have to worry about bringing his money from the India account back to the United States because, according to court papers, the I.R.S. ''would be looking for undeclared accounts maintained in the Caribbean rather than in the Far East,'' and his ownership of and the structure of the British Virgin Islands account would be unknown to authorities.
The international bank, the papers said, also counseled Mr. Dahake about holding money in Singapore and Hong Kong, two Asian tax havens.
Lawrence S. Horn, a lawyer for Mr. Dahake, said in a statement on Wednesday that he saw the 10-page court document ''as something much more than just an indictment of Mr. Dahake.'' He added that ''the timing of this indictment appears to be a 'clubbed invitation' for American citizens with undisclosed accounts to apply for admission into the second initiative of the voluntary disclosure program or risk prosecution once that bank eventually discloses his or her name to the I.R.S.''
On Monday, the I.R.S. said that it would soon announce a new amnesty program aimed at encouraging wealthy Americans with hidden offshore bank accounts to come forward, declare their money and pay taxes owed in exchange for reduced fines and penalties.

HEADLINE: Report Offers Surprises on Muslims' Growth

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
A new report forecasts that the number of Muslims around the world will grow over the next 20 years at twice the rate of non-Muslims, but that the rapid growth will level off. With more Muslim women getting educations and jobs, people migrating to cities, and living standards improving, the report says, the birthrate in majority-Muslim countries will come to more closely resemble the pattern in other nations.
Predictions that Europe will become a majority-Muslim ''Eurabia'' are unfounded, according to the report by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life, a nonpartisan research group. 
Muslims in Europe made up only 6 percent of the population in 2010, and will grow to 8 percent by 2030, the report says. In France and Belgium, Muslims will be about 10 percent of the population in 20 years, and in Britain, 8 percent.
Globally, Muslims now make up 23.4 percent of the population, and if current trends continue, will be 26.4 percent by 2030. Such growth is not enough to create a drastic shift in the world's religious balance, experts said. The world's Christian population has been estimated in other reports to be 30 percent to 33 percent.
Amaney A. Jamal, associate professor of politics at Princeton and a consultant for Pew on global Islam, said that the report could challenge assertions by some scholars and far-right political parties about future demographic domination by Muslims.
''There's this overwhelming assumption that Muslims are populating the earth, and not only are they growing at this exponential rate in the Muslim world, they're going to be dominating Europe and, soon after, the United States,'' she said. ''But the figures don't even come close. I'm looking at all this and wondering, where is all the hysteria coming from?''
In the United States, the report found about 2.6 million Muslims in 2010, a number projected to rise to 6.2 million in 20 years. (The 2.6 million figure is far lower than the numbers claimed by some American Muslim groups, but not out of line with some previous studies.) At that rate of growth, Muslims would still be a religious minority in 2030, 1.7 percent of the American population -- about the equivalent of Jews in the United States today.
The report also finds that the so-called Muslim youth bulge -- the high percentage of Muslims worldwide in their teens and 20s -- has peaked. That trend could affect politics in countries with restive youthful populations.
Peter Mandaville, the director of the Center for Global Studies at George Mason University and the author of ''Global Political Islam,'' said: ''Over time, there will be a diminution of the youth bulge, but we're at the crisis level of it now. As events in Tunisia and Egypt show, the number of under-30s who are un- or underemployed is still enormous, and the possibility of that youth bulge producing political and economic tension is still very present.''
By 2030, Pakistan will have the largest Muslim population, surpassing Indonesia, and Nigeria will surpass Egypt.
The report suggests that economic and educational factors affect population growth rates among Muslims far more than the religious factor. In Iran, which encourages family planning and birth control, the fertility rate of only 1.7 children per woman resembles that of many European countries. It has the lowest fertility rate of any Muslim-majority nation, while Niger, a poor African nation, has the highest, at 6.9 children per woman. Iranian girls receive 15 years of schooling on average; in Niger, it is four years.

HEADLINE: To Expand, Airports May Need Radical Alterations, Report Says

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The New York region's two largest airports, already choked with crowds and delays, may need to be radically reconfigured so they can make way for vitally needed additional runways that would help accommodate a projected increase of almost 50 million air travelers per year within two or three decades, according to a new study.
The study, from the Regional Plan Association, calls for as much as $15 billion to be spent at Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports. At Newark, all three terminals would have to be at least partially razed, then rebuilt; at Kennedy, part of Jamaica Bay might have to be filled to create space for one or more new runways. 
The proposed expansions would amount to the most ambitious reshaping of any of the region's major airports in several decades. They would require significant changes in the region's airspace, a modernization of the system for controlling air traffic and at least one act of Congress.
If the proposals are accepted by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy, Newark and La Guardia Airports, they would surely encounter stiff resistance from local and national advocates for the environment, the report admits. They would also have to survive the political tug of war between the governors of New York and New Jersey, who jointly control the Port Authority.
The report, which was financed in part by the Port Authority, was scheduled to be presented at a daylong conference on the future of the airports in Manhattan on Thursday.
Christopher Ward, the executive director of the Port Authority, was scheduled to attend the conference and was expected to discuss the report as fodder for planning. Asked for comment, a spokesman for Mr. Ward said only that ''we look forward to examining this study.''
The study considered a spectrum of options that stretched to the fantastic: a new airport on an island in New York Bay. But the cost was deemed to be ''exorbitant.''
Elected officials and business leaders have discussed airport expansion for years, but have been reluctant to broach the idea publicly to avoid stirring up opposition too soon, said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City. But, Ms. Wylde added, ''It's become very clear that our economic future depends on investment both in the technology and facilities upgrades and runway expansion at the regional airports.''
For years, the local airspace has been too clogged to consider adding any more traffic. Indeed, federal regulators have placed limits on the number of flights each hour to and from the region's airports. But the federal government is planning to upgrade the nation's air traffic control system with a program known as NextGen that will allow more planes to squeeze into the region, said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a transportation analyst who is one of the report's authors.
Once the first phase of NextGen is in operation, the Port Authority should seek to have the caps on flights lifted and begin making room for new runways and gates to accommodate the increasing traffic, the report says. It estimates that traffic at the three airports will increase steadily from about 104 million passengers annually last year to 150 million passengers within 20 to 30 years. Mr. Zupan said that the airports currently cannot handle more than about 110 million passengers a year.
The Port Authority has been grappling with how to alleviate congestion at its major airports; in 2007, it acquired a long-term lease on Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, N.Y., with the purpose of making it the region's fourth major airport. That goal has yet to be realized, and the new plan suggests that the Port Authority's money and efforts would be better spent at Kennedy and Newark.
The question of the Port Authority's mission arose again this month when New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, asked for $1.8 billion to build and repair roads and bridges in North Jersey. New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, demanded that the Port Authority refuse that request, because, he said, the agency should devote its resources to grand plans that would benefit the economy of the entire region.
The cost estimates are preliminary and vary widely depending on which of several options for expanding Kennedy would be chosen, according to the report. The authors laid out seven proposals for adding runway space at Kennedy, some of which would require filling in more of the bay than others.
At Newark, they concluded, the only feasible way to expand would be to add a runway between the existing terminals and the two main runways in use there now. Doing that would require the demolition of all of Terminal B and parts of Terminals A and C, Mr. Zupan said.
Rebuilding the terminals in Newark could cost as much as $5 billion, which could raise the total cost of the expansion to $15 billion, the report says. But it estimates that not expanding the airports could cost the region $16 billion a year in lost airfare, as well as up to 125,000 jobs and $6 billion in annual wages.
At Kennedy, expansion could cost anywhere from $1 billion to $3.5 billion, depending on whether one or two runways are added and how they are configured, the report says. It lays out seven possible configurations at Kennedy, some of which involve reorienting the flight path into and out of the airport. Doing so would bring those flights into closer conflict with planes going to and from La Guardia, which the Federal Aviation Administration might find unacceptable, Mr. Zupan said.
Among the alternatives, he said, would be to fill in part of Jamaica Bay and construct a new runway parallel to the existing runway used by the giant trans-Atlantic passenger jets. Getting approval for that option would entail not only overcoming opposition from environmental groups but also changing the federal law that created the Gateway National Recreation Area, which explicitly prohibits expanding the airport into the bay.
A section of the bay known as Grassy Bay contains a deep trench that was dug during construction at the airport in the 1950s, the report says. That trench has some negative effects on the surrounding bay, which might be ameliorated if it were filled in during the construction of a runway, Mr. Zupan said.
But John Waldman, a professor of biology at Queens College, said he was skeptical about that trade-off and imagined it would not occur without a ''fierce battle.'' While he said that filling the trench to level the bottom of the bay probably would be beneficial, he said he could not see the benefits outweighing the cost of encroaching on one of the ''ecological jewels'' of the region.
''I don't see that as a clear trade of equal value,'' Professor Waldman said.

HEADLINE: A Favorite Dish Laden With Fat and Contradiction

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- There is no shortage of contradictions when it comes to this city. Like the rest of Germany, Berlin demands conformity to certain rules (think twice about crossing against the light), but leaves moral judgments up to the individual (no problem with nude bathing in public parks or gambling in storefront casinos).
Germans are largely blind to the contradictions, of course, because they are in concert with their tastes and values. But they can be jarring for newcomers, especially Americans, who are often cautioned to cast aside preconceptions, ignore the seemingly familiar terrain of the modern cityscape and brace for the unexpected.
That may be especially true when it comes to currywurst, the most popular fast food in the city, some say the nation. The dish, generally eaten from a paper plate with a tiny disposable fork while standing up, is itself a culinary contradiction: a greasy pile of pork sausage (very German), smothered in ketchup (quintessential American), sprinkled with curry powder (thank you, Britain, India). 
''Currywurst is a culinary symbol of Berlin and of all Germany,'' said Birgit Breloh, who said she eats currywurst once a week, stays fit by going to yoga class and is the director of the world's only Currywurst Museum, near the better known Checkpoint Charlie.
Germans, or at least Berliners, look a bit puzzled (maybe offended?) when asked how they could be so health conscious, with their regular walks and emphasis on organic foods, and yet devour the fat-laden dish, often accompanied by a shimmering pile of french fries doused in ketchup, mayonnaise or both. According to Ms. Breloh, currywurst is consumed in huge quantities, with Germany's 82 million people consuming 800 million curry sausages annually.
''You can eat a lot of currywurst without getting fat,'' said Mario Ziervogel, the strapping, svelte, owner of one of the most popular currywurst stands in the city, called Konnopke's, in the trendy neighborhood of Prenzelauer Berg. ''You have to move! If I sit and watch TV, all day, of course I will get fat.''
In many ways, Germans are misunderstood. From the historic -- ''How could such a civilized society have produced the Holocaust?'' -- to the contemporary assessment that Germany is the tightwad of the euro-zone, even while its own economy booms. People here are often determined to explain certain facts about the place as a way to help others understand; that Germans are very guarded about their privacy, for example, and proud of their collective discipline and focus on quality.
''It's true, they see themselves as being the only world-class economy, and maintaining their standards is important to their success,'' said John Kornblum, a former United States ambassador to Germany who still lives here and cautions newcomers not to try to psychoanalyze the place.
But how does this explain the love for fried pork sausage smothered in ketchup and curry powder?
''It is my favorite meal,'' said Peter Ossig, 55, a businessman from Stuttgart who barely paused to chat as he popped a steaming currywurst into his mouth. He happened to be quite trim in his full-length blue coat.
However, taste is not where the explanation ends, because currywurst is not merely extolled as a meal. It is a political statement, as well. Berlin, in particular, likes to see itself as egalitarian, and currywurst fits neatly with that image. It costs about $2 for a sausage, and the sloppy nature of the dish generally requires diners to stand together eating off chest-high snack tables on the sidewalks (though one restaurant in Dusseldorf supposedly sells the dish coated in gold leaf and accompanied by Champagne).
''Currywurst is very democratic, poor or rich love it the same way and at the booth, all people come together,'' said Ms. Breloh, as she gave a guided tour of the museum, which tended more toward the kitsch found along a beach boardwalk.
Like much of the substructure of modern Germany, currywurst has its roots in the last world war and its aftermath. Ms. Breloh of the museum says the dish was first fixed in 1949 by Herta Heuwer, a Berliner, who like many others in postwar Germany struggled to make ends meet.
Sausage, or wurst, has long been a staple, the hamburger of Deutschland. But Ms. Breloh said when Berlin was divided into occupied sectors, Germans saw Americans eating steak with ketchup. They could not afford steak, but they could manage to whip up ketchup.
Ms. Heuwer, a rather stout woman who despite her eating habits -- or perhaps because of them -- lived to 86 years old, traded some alcohol to someone in the British sector for curry powder, or at least that is how the story goes. There is some dispute about this, with Hamburg also claiming to be the birthplace of the now beloved dish.
The rest of the recipe is rather straightforward: Plop the sausage in oil and fry until crisp. Slice it into five chunks. Squirt on a mess of ketchup (Ms. Heuwer famously took her ketchup recipe to the grave.) and then shake on curry powder.
And that's it.
''It's good pork sausage, yes, yes, I have it three times a week,'' said Guido Neumann, a brick layer with multiple piercings, as he slowly lifted the morsels on his tiny fork during a lunch break.
There was a time, not long ago, when it appeared that currywurst might be knocked off its mantle as the most popular fast food, said Eberhard Seidel, who wrote a book about the challenger: the doner kebab, which is effectively the same as a Greek gyro, or a Middle Eastern shawarma, but retrofitted to German taste, slathered in a choice of sauces.
''The doner kebab is the story of the survival of the guest workers,'' Mr. Seidel said.
Germany has a large population of ethnic Turks, brought here as part of a guest worker program half a century ago. The guest workers became residents, had families and when their factory jobs started to disappear many began to sell a dish popular in Turkey, meat cooked on a rotating upright post, sliced off and packed with salad in doughy bread.
''It doesn't look pretty, but it's delicious,'' said Kemal Akar, 19, as he and a group of his buddies took a break from their studies recently to enjoy a cheap lunch of doner kebab in Mitte, the center of the city.
The doner is cheaper than currywurst but it ran into some public relations problems, Mr. Seidel said, amid cases of questionable quality meat. It remains popular, some say even more popular than currywurst, especially among students and the poor, but Mr. Seidel said it has slipped as Berlin has become more of an international city, and in some ways, a wealthier city. Now the kebab must compete with specialty soup shops, noodle houses and sushi vendors, to appeal to the taste of diners on the run.
But the currywurst continues to hold its own even as noodlebox shops become more popular.
''Currywurst,'' said David Schultze, 19, a high school student and friend of Mr. Akar, ''is a German tradition.''

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Reached a 47-Year Low in 2010

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buyers bought the fewest new homes last year in records going back 47 years, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
Sales for all of 2010 were 321,000, a drop of 14.4 percent from the 375,000 homes sold in 2009, the department said. It was the fifth consecutive year that sales declined after reaching record highs for the five previous years, when the housing market was booming.
The year ended on a stronger note. Buyers purchased new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 329,000 units in December, a 17.5 percent increase from the rate in November.
Still, economists say it could be years before sales rise to a healthy rate of 600,000 a year.
''The percentage rise in sales looks impressive,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, but even a large percentage ''of next to nothing is still next to nothing.'' He added, ''New-home sales are bouncing around the bottom, and we see no clear upward trend in the data yet.''
Builders of new homes are struggling to compete in markets saturated with foreclosures. High unemployment and uncertainty over home prices have kept many potential buyers from making purchases.
Home prices fell in November in 19 of 20 major cities measured by the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index, according to a report released Tuesday, and nine of those cities fell to their lowest point since the housing bust.
Economists expect prices to keep falling through the first six months of this year.

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
PUSHING BACK After being on the defensive for the last two years, there were signs that bankers attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, were pushing back more assertively against efforts by regulators. 
At one of the opening panels on Wednesday, top executives from Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered warned that new restrictions on their businesses were either irrelevant or threatened to hurt economic growth.
That is an argument bankers have been making for a long time, but the tone of the off-the-record session seemed more confident and less contrite than in recent years. JACK EWING SEEKING A VOICE Amid a climate of growing income inequality, a jobless recovery and growing tension between businesses and governments, some executives attending the forum are calling for their own global governance group to defend their interests and propose solutions.
''There is a G-20, but there is no B-20,'' Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising giant WPP, said after a much-attended session called The New Economic Reality. ''Business is not seen in a good light, and it's not just bankers. We need a voice.''
Mr. Sorrell and James Turley, chief executive of Ernst & Young, warned that politicians had been sending mixed messages that had not helped to reduce a broad sense of uncertainty in the business community about what policies were in the works, especially in Washington. KATRIN BENNHOLD
THE REAL DRAW The global brainstorming panels in Davos are largely a sideshow. The main reason that the world's top business leaders are there is not to listen to debates about whether China is growing too quickly. It's to conduct business. The main reason the world's top private equity executives are here is not to solve global warming. It's to conduct business.
A senior executive at a Fortune 500 company said that his boss trudged through Davos in his snow boots because he could efficiently hold meeting after meeting with his worldwide customer base. A founder of a successful technology company with backing from some of the world's largest banks and venture firms said that he did not go to any of the panels, because he had back-to-back-to-back meetings when he was attending the forum. PETER LATTMAN DEBT WORRIES The debt debacle that erupted last year in Greece and Ireland revived longstanding questions about whether the United States and Japan, weighed down by their own debt, were heading for a moment of truth.
Trapped by aging populations, underfunded pensions and social security commitments, their quandary is in sharp contrast to the vigor and youth of emerging economies. China and India may have growing pains -- but debt is not one of them.
This contrast is on display in Davos, where the forum has brought together confident representatives from emerging economies and increasingly worried members of the Western world's elite. LIZ ALDERMAN

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Is Split As It Weighs Military Cuts

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and THOM SHANKER; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- To hear the Republican leadership tell it, the once-sacred Pentagon budget, protected by the party for generations, is suddenly on the table. But a closer look shows that even as Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, insist on the need for military cuts, divisions have opened among Republicans about whether, and how much, to chop Pentagon spending that comes to more than a half trillion dollars a year.
Those differences were on display Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where the traditional Republican who now leads the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Howard P. McKeon, fought back against proposed cuts in the Pentagon budget even as fledgling committee members supported by the Tea Party said that the nation's debts amounted to a national security risk.
''I cannot say it strongly enough: I will not support any measures that stress our forces and jeopardize the lives of our men and women in uniform,'' Mr. McKeon said in an opening statement that followed up on a letter to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urging him not to stop work on the Marines' $14.4. billion Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, a combined landing craft and tank for amphibious assaults that Mr. Gates canceled this month. 
But Representative Chris Gibson, a Tea Party-endorsed freshman Republican and a retired Army colonel from New York's Hudson River Valley, made it clear that no part of the Pentagon's $550 billion budget -- some $700 billion including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- was immune.
''This deficit that we have threatens our very way of life, and everything needs to be on the table,'' Mr. Gibson told William J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, who testified at the hearing along with Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the vice chief of staff of the Army, and other service vice chiefs.
The discordant Republican voices on military spending have bred confusion on Capitol Hill, among military contractors and within the military itself, where no one is exactly sure what the members backed by the Tea Party will do. It also shows why taking on the military budget will be so hard, even though a widening deficit has led the president and the leaders of both parties to say this time they are serious.
Most Tea Party candidates spoke little about national security and the military in fall political campaigns focused on cutting spending over all. ''It's a mystery to me,'' General Chiarelli said of the newcomers' intention on the defense budget, but he said he was eager to sit down at the Pentagon for talks with the newcomers.
Mr. McKeon, for one, is concerned, and has quietly been meeting with the new members -- a number have no experience in government -- to educate them on national security. One Congressional staff member who closely monitors the military said, ''While McKeon would say that all members are entitled to advocate for positions they want to advocate, what he has been doing is working to educate new members on what the threats are, and why we need the defense budget close to where it is.'' The staff member asked for anonymity to discuss Mr. McKeon's private meetings.
This month Mr. Gates announced plans to cut military spending by $78 billion over five years, the first serious proposed reductions in the budget since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and a response to White House pressure to squeeze spending during what Mr. Gates called a time of ''extreme fiscal duress.'' But the Pentagon's operating budget for 2012 is expected to be about $553 billion, which would still reflect real growth. The growth would slow over the next several years and then stop by the 2015 fiscal year.
Dick Armey, a former Republican House majority leader and now a leader of the Tea Party movement, said in an interview that Tea Party-backed members of Congress would rigorously look for places to prune the Pentagon budget. ''A lot of people say if you cut defense, you're demonstrating less than a full commitment to our nation's security, and that's baloney,'' he said.
But so far, few Tea Party-backed members on the House Armed Services Committee have said specifically where they would cut. In public remarks at the hearing on Wednesday, several spoke up in favor of favorite military programs or of protecting military installations at home, illustrating the difficulty of balancing their overarching philosophy and goals with the immediate concerns of their districts.
Mr. McKeon, who represents a California district that is home to major defense contractors, was the single biggest recipient in the House of campaign contributions from military aerospace companies and their employees.
In an interview, Representative Vicky Hartzler, a freshman Republican from Missouri who was backed by former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, said that her priorities were jobs and ''reining in runaway spending.'' But when asked about the Pentagon budget, Ms. Hartzler, who defeated former Representative Ike Skelton, the longtime Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that ''now is not the time to talk about defense cuts while we are engaged in two theaters with men and women in harm's way.''
Ms. Hartzler said she questioned the $78 billion in cuts to the military budget over the next five years, and added, ''I will be a staunch defender of military installations in my district and across the country.'' Ms. Hartzler's district has two large military bases, Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base, home to the B-2 stealth bomber and a new ground-control station for unmanned Predator drones.
Representative Scott Rigell, a Republican newcomer from Virginia who at first sparred with the Tea Party but then signed a pledge supporting many of its positions, said that he, too, was committed to a strong military and the spending it required. In an interview after the hearing, he said that ''as a very first priority, it is our constitutional duty to stand an army.''
Mr. Rigell said he supported in the Pentagon budget ''any responsible, wise reduction that can clearly be identified as waste,'' but needed more specific information before he could judge where to cut. His son, he said, is a member of the Marine reserve and drives an amphibious assault vehicle, an earlier version of the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. On Mr. Gates's decision to eliminate the E.F.V., Mr. Rigell said, ''The abruptness of the decision is concerning me.''
Mr. Rigell, who represents a district that is economically dependent on its military installations, spoke against plans to move one of five nuclear aircraft carriers based in Norfolk to Florida, taking with it 10,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: A Reservist in a New War, Against Foreclosure

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
While Sgt. James B. Hurley was away at war, he lost a heartbreaking battle at home.
In violation of a law intended to protect active military personnel from creditors, agents of Deutsche Bank foreclosed on his small Michigan house, forcing Sergeant Hurley's wife, Brandie, and her two young children to move out and find shelter elsewhere.
When the sergeant returned in December 2005, he drove past the densely wooded riverfront property outside Hartford, Mich. The peaceful little home was still there -- winter birds still darted over the gazebo he had built near the water's edge -- but it almost certainly would never be his again. Less than two months before his return from the war, the bank's agents sold the property to a buyer in Chicago for $76,000.
Since then, Sergeant Hurley has been on an odyssey through the legal system, with little hope of a happy ending -- indeed, the foreclosure that cost him his home may also cost him his marriage. ''Brandie took this very badly,'' said Sergeant Hurley, 45, a plainspoken man who was disabled in Iraq and is now unemployed. ''We're trying to piece it together.'' 
In March 2009, a federal judge ruled that the bank's foreclosure in 2004 violated federal law but the battle did not end there for Sergeant Hurley.
Typically, banks respond quickly to public reports of errors affecting military families. But today, more than six years after the illegal foreclosure, Deutsche Bank Trust Company and its primary co-defendant, a Morgan Stanley subsidiary called Saxon Mortgage Services, are still in court disputing whether Sergeant Hurley is owed significant damages. Exhibits show that at least 100 other military mortgages are being serviced for Deutsche Bank, but it is not clear whether other service members have been affected by the policy that resulted in the Hurley foreclosure.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment, noting that Saxon had handled the litigation on its behalf. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley, which bought Saxon in 2006, said that Saxon had revised its policy to ensure that it complied with the law and was willing to make ''reasonable accommodations'' to settle disputes, ''especially for our servicemen and women.'' But the Hurley litigation has continued, he said, because of a ''fundamental disagreement between the parties over damages.''
In court papers, lawyers for Saxon and the bank assert the sergeant is entitled to recover no more than the fair market value of his lost home. His lawyers argue that the defendants should pay much more than that -- including an award of punitive damages to deter big lenders from future violations of the law. The law is called the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and it protects service members on active duty from many of the legal consequences of their forced absence.
Even though some of the nation's military families have been sending their breadwinners into war zones for almost a decade, some of the nation's biggest lenders are still fumbling one the basic elements of this law -- its foreclosure protections.
Under the law, only a judge can authorize a foreclosure on a protected service member's home, even in states where court orders are not required for civilian foreclosures, and the judge can act only after a hearing where the military homeowner is represented. The law also caps a protected service member's mortgage rate at 6 percent.
By 2005, violations of the civil relief act were being reported all across the country, some involving prominent banks like Wells Fargo and Citigroup. Publicity about the violations spared some military families from foreclosure, prompted both banks to promise better compliance and put lenders on notice that service members were entitled to special relief.
But the message apparently did not get through. By 2006, a Marine captain in South Carolina was doing battle with JPMorgan Chase to get the mortgage interest rate reductions the act requires. Chase eventually reviewed its policies and, earlier this month, acknowledged it had overcharged thousands of military families on their mortgages and improperly foreclosed on 14 of them. Before a public apology, Chase began mailing out about $2 million in refunds and working to reverse the foreclosures.
For armed forces in a war zone, a foreclosure back home is both a family crisis and a potentially deadly distraction from the military mission, military consumer advocates say.
''It can be devastating,'' said Holly Petraeus, the wife of Gen. David Petraeus and the leader of a team that is creating an office to serve military families within a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
''It is a terrible situation for the family at home and for the service member abroad, who feels helpless,'' Mrs. Petraeus said. ''I would hope that the recent problems will be a wake-up call for all banks to review their policies and be sure they comply with the act.''
Chase's response, however belated, is in sharp contrast to the approach taken by Deutsche Bank and Saxon in the Hurley case.
Sergeant Hurley bought the land in 1994 and ''was developing this property into something special,'' he said in a court affidavit. He put a double-wide manufactured home on the site and added a deck, hunting blinds, floating docks and storage buildings.
According to his lawyers, his financial troubles began in the summer of 2004, when his National Guard unit sent him to California to be trained to work as a power-generator mechanic in Iraq. Veterans of that duty advised him to buy certain tools not readily available in the war zone, he said in his affidavit. With that expense and his reduced income, he said, he fell behind on his mortgage -- a difficulty many part-time soldiers faced when reserve and National Guard units were mobilized.
Believing he was protected by the civil relief act -- as, indeed, he was, as of Sept. 11, 2004 -- his family repeatedly informed Saxon that Sergeant Hurley had been sent to Iraq. But Saxon refused to grant relief without copies of his individual military orders, which he did not yet have.
Although Saxon's demand would have been legitimate if Sergeant Hurley had been seeking a lower interest rate, the law did not require him to provide those orders to invoke his foreclosure protections.
Nevertheless, Saxon referred the case to its law firm, Orlans Associates in Troy, Mich., which completed the foreclosure without the court hearing required by law. The law firm filed an affidavit with the local sheriff saying there was no evidence Sergeant Hurley was on military duty. At a sheriff's sale in October 2004, the bank bought the property for $70,000, less than the $100,000 the sergeant owed on the mortgage.
Orlans acknowledged in a court filing that one of its lawyers learned in April 2005 that Sergeant Hurley had been on active duty since the previous October. Nevertheless, neither Saxon nor the law firm backtracked to ensure the foreclosure had been legal or took steps to prevent the seized property from being sold, according to the court record. Lawyers for Orlans Associates did not respond to a request for comment.
When Sergeant Hurley sued in May 2007, the defendants initially argued that he was not allowed to file a private lawsuit to enforce his rights under the civil relief act. Federal District Judge Gordon J. Quist agreed and threw the case out in the fall of 2008.
That drew a fierce reaction from Col. John S. Odom, Jr., a retired Air Force lawyer in Shreveport, La., who is working with Sergeant Hurley's local lawyer, Matthew R. Cooper, of Paw Paw, Mich.
Colonel Odom, recognized by Congress and the courts as an expert on the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, knew Judge Quist had missed a decision that overturned the one he had cited in his ruling. In December 2008, Colonel Odom appealed the ruling.
In March 2009, Judge Quist reversed himself, reinstated the Hurley case, ruled that the foreclosure had violated the civil relief act and found that punitive damages would be permitted, if warranted.
Despite that legal setback, the defendants soldiered on. As the court docket grew, they argued against allowing Sergeant Hurley to seek compensatory or punitive damages in the case. Judge Quist ruled last month that punitive damages were not warranted -- a ruling Colonel Odom has said he has challenged in court and, if necessary, will appeal.
''Nothing says you screwed up as clearly as a big punitive damages award,'' he said. ''They are a deterrence that warns others not to do the same thing.''
When the trial on damages begins in early March, Sergeant Hurley will have been fighting for almost four years over the illegal foreclosure, a fight he could not have waged without a legal team that will probably only be paid if the court orders the defendants to cover the legal bills.
Regardless of the trial outcome, Sergeant Hurley's dream home is likely to remain as far beyond his reach as it was when he was in Iraq. Its new owner has refused to entertain any offers for it and recently bought an adjoining lot.
Sergeant Hurley said he still loved the wooded refuge he drives past almost every day. ''I was hoping I could get the property back,'' he said. ''But they tell me there's just no way.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a legal dispute over the foreclosure of a former service member's home by agents of Deutsche Bank reported incorrectly the sequence of steps that JPMorgan Chase took to correct errors in its own handling of military mortgages. Chase began reversing its improper foreclosures before, not after, it issued its public apology in mid-January. The article also referred incorrectly in some editions to a military consumer protection team. It is based in the Treasury Department, not the White House.

HEADLINE: Fed Votes to Maintain Its Program of Bond Buying

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policy makers voted unanimously on Wednesday to continue the central bank's $600 billion plan to spur the recovery by buying government bonds.
They took note of a rise in commodity prices, but reiterated their view that long-term inflation expectations had been stable and inflation had trended downward. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation excludes food and energy, which tend to have volatile prices.
The mention of rising commodity prices was a slight but notable acknowledgement of concerns that the bond-buying plan could eventually touch off inflation -- concerns that the Fed deems to be unwarranted for now. 
As expected, the Fed left its benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, at which banks borrow from each other overnight -- at a range of 0 to 0.25 percent, unchanged since December 2008.
The unanimity within the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, was a welcome and somewhat surprising vote of confidence for the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who has favored aggressive and unconventional measures to stimulate the economy, even in the face of criticism.
Under a rotation system used by the committee, four different regional Fed presidents joined the panel as voting members this year: Charles I. Plosser of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas, Charles L. Evans of Chicago and Narayana R. Kocherlakota of Minneapolis.
Mr. Plosser, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Kocherlakota have all raised doubts about the bond-buying program, which the Fed announced in November after hinting about it since August. But for now, they are backing Mr. Bernanke.
The program is intended to lower long-term interest rates, give a lift to stocks and other assets, and ease the flow of credit. But skeptics fear that the bond-buying, which has the effect of further expanding the Fed's already large balance sheet, could lead to destabilizing asset bubbles or touch off inflation.
Mr. Bernanke and his allies, who represent a majority of the board, say they think that the program has been effective in meeting its goals and that the worries are exaggerated; they say the Fed is ready to step in to prevent inflation from igniting. The committee's periodic assessment of economic conditions was little changed from its meeting in December.
The panel said that the recovery continued, ''though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions.'' It continued to point to a ''depressed'' housing sector and household consumption ''constrained'' by high unemployment, modest income growth, the decline in home values and tight credit.
Victor E. Li, an economist at the Villanova School of Business, said that by not overreacting to recent improvements in employment and growth projections, the Fed seemed cautious. ''I would have thought the statement would have been more optimistic,'' he said.
The bond-buying plan put in place by the Fed is commonly known as QE2, because it is a second round of the asset-purchase practice known as quantitative easing. From December 2008 to March 2010, the Fed bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-related securities and Treasury securities to stabilize the housing market and provide support to an economy in the grip of recession.
The current round of easing -- $75 billion a month in bond purchases, starting in November -- is supposed to continue through June. The Fed could change that plan, and affirmed on Wednesday that it was ready to ''adjust the program as needed.'' (In a related, smaller effort begun in August, the Fed is using the proceeds from its mortgage-related holdings to buy Treasury securities, and that effort is also continuing.)
Difficult decisions loom for the Fed: whether to allow the program to continue through June, and also -- if the frail recovery should suffer a setback -- whether to expand it beyond the $600 billion or extend it into the second half of this year. Central bank officials are already turning their attention to those questions but have offered little indication of their leanings, preferring instead to wait and see whether the economy continues to improve.
The Fed's outlook seems neither too pessimistic nor optimistic, said Michael Dueker, head economist for North America at Russell Investments. ''Nothing in today's statement indicates that the Fed believes that additional quantitative easing will be necessary beyond June 2011,'' he said. ''And nothing indicates that the Fed is fazed by the so-called strong economic data as of late.''
Though the Dow Jones industrial average briefly hit 12,000 on Wednesday, a height not reached since 2008, investors seemed unsurprised by the Fed's announcement, which was in line with analysts' expectations.

HEADLINE: Obama, in Wisconsin, Picks Up Address's Refrain

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
MANITOWOC, Wis. -- President Obama loves sports metaphors, and they were flying on Wednesday when he came to Green Bay Packers country to tour three factories and expand on the ''winning the future'' theme of his State of the Union address the night before.
In that spirit, Mr. Obama seemed to be taking something of a victory lap as he strode each plant floor in turn, joking with employees and extolling their companies' successes -- after two years spent reassuring fearful Americans that recession and high unemployment did not portend a nation in decline. 
If Tuesday's speech was meant to sound a new, more optimistic note, Mr. Obama came to Wisconsin, a swing state in presidential elections, not only to repeat his message but also to illustrate it. While unemployment remains above 9 percent nationwide, in this town it is under 8 percent -- 4 points lower than a year ago -- partly because of hiring at the three factories, all of which have taken advantage of federal loans and tax incentives to retool, innovate and expand.
''When America is facing tougher competition from countries around the world than ever before, we've got to up our game,'' Mr. Obama told several hundred enthusiastic employees at Orion Energy Systems, which makes solar power and other energy-efficient technology for commercial customers, at a site once occupied by a company that relocated overseas.
Mr. Obama, a fan of his hometown Chicago Bears, was even game about the fact that his remarks about playing to win had a special resonance in this town, 40 miles from Green Bay, just days after the Packers defeated the Bears to secure a spot in the Super Bowl.
He accepted three green-and-gold Packers jerseys, including one that said ''Obama 1,'' and at Orion quoted the legendary Packers coach Vince Lombardi, for whom the Super Bowl trophy is named, saying, ''There is only one place in my game, and that's first place.''
''That's the kind of determination to win that America needs to show right now,'' Mr. Obama said to applause. ''We need to win the future.''
In an abbreviated version of his address to the joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama spelled out his vision that government has a role to play -- if much reduced from the emergency bailouts, stimulus spending and tax cuts of the past two years -- by fostering education, scientific research and modern infrastructure and, through federal loans and tax incentives, acting as a junior partner and investor in American entrepreneurs, like Orion's chief executive, Neal Verfuerth.
''It's one thing to have a good idea, but as Neal and I were talking, a lot of times Wall Street doesn't necessarily want to take a chance on a good idea until they've seen it proven,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Sometimes the research that's required, nobody wants to pay for it. And that's where we have to step in.''
Mr. Obama's call for increased government ''investments'' comes as he also is proposing to extend by two years a three-year freeze of spending in the slice of the federal budget that covers such domestic programs -- meaning cuts deeper than a freeze in other programs.
Congressional Republicans are calling for much deeper domestic reductions. Republicans have not spelled out those cuts.
The pressure on both parties to reduce the deficit was underscored Wednesday when the Congressional Budget Office reported that the deficit for this fiscal year would reach $1.5 trillion.
In one passage of his remarks to workers here, Mr. Obama acknowledged that ''taking responsibility for our deficits'' was also essential for the nation's future.

HEADLINE: Deficit Forecast Nears $1.5 Trillion, Fueling Partisan Battle on Federal Spending

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The government's budget deficit will soar to nearly $1.5 trillion this year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday, an anticipated but politically galvanizing calculation that further intensified the partisan battle over the nation's fiscal future.
The $1.5 trillion deficit projection is $414 billion higher than its previous estimate, in August, and reflects in part the tax cut deal last month between President Obama and Republicans. The deficit was $1.4 trillion in 2009 and $1.3 trillion in 2010. 
The new figures highlighted the need for action to raise the government's debt ceiling in coming months, by a sum of up to 13 figures, and the different approaches being taken by the two parties to address the problem.
Many Republicans are demanding steep, immediate cuts in federal spending, and Senate Republicans said they would press again for a constitutional amendment requiring balanced federal budgets.
Democrats, meanwhile, denounced the Republicans' suggested cuts, including a proposal by the conservative Republican Study Committee to slash $2.5 trillion over 10 years. Democrats said that plan would gut vital programs and eliminate more than one million jobs, including 4,000 agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 160,000 railroad jobs at Amtrak.
The shift into full battle mode on Capitol Hill came a day after President Obama, aiming to modulate the Republican demands for cuts, called in his State of the Union speech for a partial five-year freeze in domestic spending by the federal government -- a more gradual imposition of fiscal discipline, while still increasing some spending in education, research and other areas.
Republicans quickly rejected that idea as insufficient. ''Last night, the president spoke about our dangerous debt and his commitment to bringing it down,'' Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said at a news conference. ''But actions speak louder than words. He, unfortunately, recommitted to spending more money we don't have.''
Mr. Hatch added, ''It's time to cut spending, not freeze it at these bloated and unsustainable levels.''
Democrats, in turn, said the Republicans' ideas were reckless. ''As the president urged Congress to invest in education, innovation and rebuilding, the Republicans continued pushing a budget plan that calls for decimation, stagnation and complacency,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said at a news conference with other party leaders.
But even as the parties clashed anew, the Congressional Budget Office, which is an independent scorekeeper, injected fresh urgency into the debate over spending and fiscal policy, announcing updated projections that showed the country in a precarious condition, facing ''daunting economic and budgetary challenges.''
The budget office said the deficit would widen to nearly $1.5 trillion this year and said ''the deficits of $1.4 trillion in 2009 and $1.3 trillion in 2010 are, when measured as a share of gross domestic product, the largest since 1945 -- representing 10 percent and 8.9 percent of the nation's output.'' The budget officials also projected the deficit for 2012 would be $1.1 trillion.
The nation is nearing its current debt limit of $14.3 trillion, and the new figures now require an even bigger increase, forcing Republicans -- among them new lawmakers elected on a message of fiscal austerity -- to cast an extremely uncomfortable vote.
In a statement, the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, sought to put the onus of a debt limit increase on the White House. ''Earlier this month, the Obama administration asked Congress to raise the debt limit,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''Republicans responded by saying the American people won't tolerate such an increase unless it's accompanied by major spending cuts and spending reforms.''
The Congressional Budget Office report showed the deficit problems easing somewhat in the years ahead, but also purposely cast doubt on its own numbers, noting that the projections ''are based on the assumption that tax and spending policies unfold as specified in current law.''
That is highly unlikely, and the report detailed a long list of temporary fiscal measures that Congress will almost certainly find politically difficult to let expire.
These include the Bush-era income tax rates that were scheduled to expire at the start of this year but that Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans agreed to extend through 2012; a one-year payroll tax cut for most workers that was included in the same tax package; a sharp reduction in Medicare payment rates to doctors and other health care providers that would kick in at the end of 2011 but that Congress has routinely stepped in to avert; and a ''patch'' for the alternative minimum tax that prevents it from hitting millions more families that is also due to expire at the end of 2011 but Congress has consistently renewed.
The budget office report offered a sober assessment.
''The economy has struggled to recover from the recent recession, which was triggered by a large decline in house prices and a financial crisis, events unlike anything this country has seen since the Great Depression'' the report said. ''During the recovery, the pace of growth in the nation's output has been anemic compared with that during most other recoveries since World War II and the unemployment rate has remained quite high.''
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Budget Committee, described the new deficit figures as alarming. ''C.B.O.'s report should be another wake-up call to the nation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama's 'Win the Future' Challenge

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 26 editorial about President Obama's State of the Union address reminded me that on Tuesday night there were welcome traces of the man millions of us voted into office.
His sometimes obsessive ''come let us reason together'' approach of the last two years seemed to give way to articulated plans and ideas that he sounded willing to fight for against right-wing naysayers.
One hopes he finds the strength and zeal to hold to the courage of his convictions. We have nothing to lose except the greatness of our country. 
Theodore S. Voelker New York, Jan. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
The greatest threat to America's future is not the lack of dreams or desires but the failure to agree on a course to get there. For too long, our future has been governed by fits and starts.
The lack of a clear and reliable outside enemy has left us with only ourselves to chart our tomorrows.
No course will be perfect, but sacrifice by all with something to give, as well as organizations both private and public, will be needed to reach our better destiny. In the end, the question is whether we are responsible enough to prove that democracy, the idea that it is the governed who should govern, remains the best way forward.
Bruce Neuman Sag Harbor, N.Y., Jan. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
After hearing the latest State of the Union address, it is easy to wonder where the force for change I voted for in 2008 was Tuesday evening.
Frank DiMarco Portland, Ore., Jan. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
President Obama made a persuasive case for investing in those areas that will permit us to claim the mantle of exceptionalism once again.
Americans can't like hearing that our children have fallen behind academically; that our infrastructure is crumbling; that we spend an obscene amount of money on health care and yet our life expectancies are shorter than those of many other countries -- sobering statistics to be sure.
Extending tax cuts for the wealthiest among us does not move the country to the front of the line. Nor does saying ''no'' to spending. Research and development, making a college education available to every child in America, repairing infrastructure -- these require spending, but they are investments that also create jobs. Let's earn that pat on the back we like to give ourselves by choosing wisely what we do with our dollars.
Felicia Massarsky Hoboken, N.J., Jan. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
I was disappointed in both President Obama's address and Representative Paul D. Ryan's Republican response concerning the fiscal problems we now face, which will worsen with inaction. With everything played for political advantage, neither man was willing to jeopardize potential votes by stating unequivocally that there is no alternative to measured entitlement reductions and tax reform as the basis of a long-term plan for fiscal health.
The majority of voters already know that there is no painless remedy for our fiscal problems, yet politicians pander for votes by pretending that there are partisan solutions. I am a lifelong Democrat, but I would vote for any person at the local, state or national level who fulfilled his or her charge of public service by addressing fiscal problems and options in a straightforward manner.
The electorate is a modern-day Diogenes, searching in vain for an honest politician.
John Vasi Santa Barbara, Calif., Jan. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
In his State of the Union address, President Obama endorsed one of the conservatives' favorite nostrums -- that during a recession, the government must tighten its belt just as families do. Actually, during a recession is when government spending should be increased, to keep the economy going. During a boom is when government spending should be cut.
Moreover, during a recession families can do more than just tighten their belts. They can also ask the wealthiest family members to shoulder more of the load.
Richard Joffe New York, Jan. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
President Obama's full-throated endorsement of American exceptionalism in his State of the Union address puts the lie to the notion that the United States rejoined the family of nations with his inauguration two years ago.
Exceptionalism is nothing more than hubris and arrogance. The United States is a nation with its strengths and weaknesses, like any other, and no messianic right to lead or to impose its will and values on the rest of the world. Until it finally learns this lesson, it will not truly be a part of the international community.
John S. Koppel Bethesda, Md., Jan. 26, 2011
To the Editor:
President Obama's emphasis on education in his State of the Union address was most welcome. But his remarks were limited to educating our youth in math, science and technology. All important, but what about history, political science, literature, the arts and -- remember global competitiveness -- foreign languages? And on the graduate level, law, architecture, social work, teaching and -- global competitiveness again -- international relations?
Where will our future leaders in government and other public service come from? Surely they won't all emerge from the world of math, science and technology. And to build a robust, humane, aware-of-the-world society, we surely need a more broadly educated population.
Finally, the president urged young people to serve their country by becoming teachers. He must certainly know how many thousands of teachers have lost their jobs over the last year, with more teacher cuts to come in 2011. It's hard to become a teacher if you can't get a job.

HEADLINE: Boeing Forecasts a Hit to Profit, but Production Is Expected to Rise

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
Boeing predicted that its profit in 2011 would fall below analysts' estimates, mainly because of higher pension expenses and delays in finishing the 787 Dreamliner, setting off a 3 percent decline in its share price.
The company said it expected to deliver 25 to 40 of the 787s and the new 747-8 freighter before the year's end. During a conference call with analysts, the chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said about half of those planes would be Dreamliners.
To the surprise of some analysts, Mr. McNerney said the company expected to meet its plan for sharply expanding production of the Dreamliner over the next three years. 
Both the Dreamliner, the first passenger jet made substantially of lightweight carbon composites, and the 747-8 freighter have faced production problems. The Dreamliner -- which has more advance orders, 847, than any plane in history -- is running three years late. Boeing recently pushed back delivery of the first plane to the third quarter of this year.
As a result of the delays, and an increase of 58 cents a share in pension expenses this year, Boeing said that its net income would be $3.80 to $4 a share in 2011. That compared with an average estimate by analysts of $4.53 a share.
The company released its forecast as part of its fourth-quarter earnings report. Boeing said its profit fell 8 percent, to $1.17 billion, or $1.56 a share, in the period, down from $1.28 billion, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier. Revenue also fell 8 percent, to $16.55 billion from $17.94 billion.
Boeing, based in Chicago, said it earned $4.45 a share in 2010, in part because of a gain of 50 cents a share on a favorable tax settlement. It expected revenue of $68 billion to $71 billion in 2011, compared with $64.3 billion in 2010, as it begins delivering the new planes.
Boeing's shares had rallied about 10 percent since late December on hopes that the company was putting its problems behind it. The stock slipped by $2.22, or 3.1 percent, to $70.02 on Wednesday.
Mr. McNerney said Boeing had stepped up efforts to cut costs in its large military business as the Pentagon tightened spending.
But as air travel rebounds from the recession, Boeing should get a lift from its commercial operations. It expects to deliver 485 to 500 passenger jets in 2011, up from 462 in 2010. Its rival, Airbus, delivered 510 planes in 2010 and expects to increase that total this year.
Boeing is counting on the Dreamliner to give it an edge. Mr. McNerney said the company still believed that it could increase production to 10 planes a month by the end of 2013, from two now.
He told analysts that Boeing was reworking a number of poorly made parts from suppliers on the first 20 to 25 Dreamliners. But as it builds the 31st plane, he said, the problems are ''healing up,'' and the production line has become more stable.
Some analysts were surprised that the company still expected to deliver 12 to 20 Dreamliners this year. Robert Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note that he had thought Boeing would deliver six 787s and six 747-8s in 2011.
Mr. McNerney said that while the delays had pushed back the start of its production increase, company executives had built a cushion into their plans and had privately expected to begin building 10 Dreamliners a month well before the end of 2013.
''A lot of that margin is now eaten up by this latest delay,'' he said. ''But we are not changing significantly the trajectory of our ramp.''
Boeing's chief financial officer, James A. Bell, said the company was projecting an eventual profit on the Dreamliner, though it would not make money on the 787s and 747s delivered this year.
Mr. McNerney also said Boeing was likely to build a replacement for its best-selling 737 by 2020.

HEADLINE: At Forum, Medvedev Seeks to Reassure Foreign Investors

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia on Wednesday defended his efforts to modernize the country, in a speech intended to reassure foreign investors after a deadly attack at a Moscow airport renewed concerns about social unrest.
''Major changes have taken place in Russian society and the Russian economy,'' Mr. Medvedev said at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in this Swiss ski resort. ''We are developing and we are moving ahead.'' 
After several years in which the forum was dominated by the global financial and economic crisis, security issues have moved back up the list of global concerns this year, with corporate leaders and policy makers focusing on the Moscow bombing and turmoil in North Africa, among other places.
Mr. Medvedev shortened his stay in Davos after the airport attack, which killed 35 people. Originally set to last several days, the visit was cut to a few hours.
The attack put a damper on Mr. Medvedev's plan to present Russia as a modern, stable country that welcomed foreign investment. The Russian delegation has organized a prominent presence in Davos: Sberbank, a Russian bank, has bought up some of the prime billboard sites along the Promenade, the main street in Davos, with the tag line ''great country, great partner.''
Mr. Medvedev's visit was aimed at attracting foreign capital to Russia, after the country's budget deficit rose and financial reserves that piled up during the boom years, largely from exports of oil, dwindled.
The government has announced plans to privatize a number of state assets, including the bank VTB, shares in oil companies, hydroelectric dams and shipping lines. It also plans to sell new ruble-denominated bonds, and is wooing foreign investors for projects that even include ski area developments in the volatile Northern Caucasus region.
Analysts said investors were likely to look beyond terrorist attacks like the airport bombing, which, according to the government, has the hallmarks of militants from the Northern Caucasus.
''I don't think this plays into perceptions of Russia,'' said Roland Rechtsteiner, managing partner of corporate risk practice at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. ''The threat exists in the United States. It exists in the U.K. It exists in Germany. It exists everywhere.''
Investors are more concerned about issues like corruption, bureaucracy and legal certainty, Mr. Rechtsteiner said, as well as the ''social development'' of the country.
''It has to be attractive for people to live and work in Russia ,'' he said.
In his speech, Mr. Medvedev acknowledged these criticisms, but insisted that progress had been made.
''Today we are the way we are,'' he said. ''And let me tell you that Russia indeed faces many difficulties in creating the rule of law and building a modern economy. Russia has many social problems, although in recent years we have solved many.
''We are willing to receive friendly advice,'' he said. ''What we don't need is lecturing. We should be working together.''
As Mr. Medvedev traveled to Davos, he got some not-so-friendly advice, from a major opponent of the government, the jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In comments provided to several European newspapers, including The International Herald Tribune, Mr. Khodorkovsky, who is serving a prison sentence on fraud and tax evasion convictions that he says are politically motivated, renewed his criticism of the Russian legal system.
Analysts said there were some positive signals for foreign investors in recent months, including an oil exploration agreement between Rosneft of Russia and BP, the British oil company.
Jacques Der Megreditchian, deputy chief executive of Troika Dialog, a Moscow-based investment bank, said an assumption of political stability, with expectations that Mr. Medvedev and the prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, will remain in power after the president's term expires next year, could actually bolster investment. Russian public debt levels also remain relatively ''manageable'' compared with many European countries.
''In Davos, I think the corporate investors will listen to these pitches with some interest,'' he said.
Mr. Medvedev said the Russian government wants to create a single economy in the former Soviet states modeled on the European Union and stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Russia also plans to liberalize rules on capital and will not impose new taxes on banks, he added.
On the contrary, he said, Russia will not break with its G-20 partners on bank regulation. ''We have no intention to introduce any further restrictions on financial activities,'' he said.
Perhaps surprisingly, considering what critics say is Russia's increasing repression of free speech, Mr. Medvedev wielded an iPad on stage and professed to be a fan of social media sites like Twitter: ''Russia will not support initiatives that call into question the freedom of the Internet.''
''Russia, despite all its difficulties, is an open country that has already become part of the world community,'' Mr. Medvedev said, adding, ''All our efforts to further develop the economy would be futile if we failed to defeat terrorism and intolerance.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P.-Led Oversight Panel Tackles Bailouts With Vigor

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If Representative Darrell E. Issa, Republican of California, gets his wish, he will have only two years to serve as a chief tormenter of the Obama administration. So he was understandably eager to get started on Wednesday with his first hearing as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
In jumping into the complex issue of bank bailouts, the committee provided an object lesson in the flexibility of words, showing that statements on complex matters like how to resolve a financial crisis can often be open to competing interpretations. 
Mr. Issa began the hearing on ''bailouts and the foreclosure crisis'' by suggesting that the financial institutions that grew even larger during the crisis might be encouraged to break themselves up so that they would not find themselves, during a future crisis, in need of a bailout.
A former businessman who is known for his free-market leanings, Mr. Issa made the statement in response to an observation by Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, in a recent report. Mr. Barofsky wrote that the government's bailout of Citigroup in 2008 institutionalized the view among investors that large financial companies still enjoyed an implicit government guarantee that they were ''too big to fail.''
Mr. Issa noted that Bank of America, already one of the country's biggest banks, grew considerably larger during the financial crisis by first absorbing Countrywide and then Merrill Lynch.
''I'm not for breaking up companies or taking a heavy hand,'' Mr. Issa said. ''But if Bank of America is too big to fail, then shouldn't we be insisting that they be -- and I'm not suggesting this -- but shouldn't we be suggesting that they find a way to not be too big to fail in whatever kind of divestitures they need, rather than putting them in that category'' of companies that are ''effectively backstopped by the federal government?''
A spokesman for Mr. Issa said that the chairman was not saying that Bank of America should be broken up. Rather, he said, Mr. Issa wants the government to get out of the equation by not promising support for failing banks.
Likewise, a statement by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner in the Barofsky report was open to interpretation by Republicans on the committee.
In the statement, Mr. Geithner seemed to imply that future bailouts of big banks were a possibility -- a statement at odds with comments by President Obama and other Democrats that the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul enacted in July, guaranteed that failing banks would be closed down, not bailed out.
In 2008, ''the size of the shock that hit our financial system was larger than what caused the Great Depression,'' Mr. Geithner was quoted as saying. ''In the future we may have to do exceptional things again if we face a shock that large. You just don't know what's systemic and what's not until you know the nature of the shock. It depends on the state of the world -- how deep the recession is. We have better tools now, thanks to Dodd-Frank. But you have to know the nature of the shock.''
Republicans insisted that Mr. Geithner was holding out the possibility of further bailouts, and they repeatedly questioned Timothy G. Massad, who oversees TARP, about his boss's statement.
''What he was referring to was the ability to use the tools under Dodd-Frank to address this and the fact that we don't know exactly what the issue will be,'' Mr. Massad said. ''The rules under Dodd-Frank are flexible. We're not going to have just a set of immutable, quantitative criteria that say if you're above this amount of assets, you're too big to fail.''

HEADLINE: Concerns Over Europe's Debt Crisis Persist, and Optimism About U.S. Is Mild

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD; Liz Alderman and Jack Ewing contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland -- Perhaps the most telling detail of one well-attended session at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday was that the panel ''New Economic Reality'' had no representatives from any nation in the euro zone.
But everyone on that panel -- a Chinese, an Indian, an American, an Israeli and a Briton -- seemed concerned about the European sovereign debt crisis. 
''The euro zone is certainly one of the biggest risks to the global economy,'' said Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at New York University and one of the first to predict the American housing bust and ensuing crisis. ''The mood in the market is better, but the fundamental problems of the euro zone remain unresolved.''
Debt levels in some of the peripheral countries, notably Greece and Ireland, are now so high that de facto default is inevitable, Mr. Roubini predicted. He urged ''an early and orderly restructuring'' of their liabilities to avoid spreading the crisis to bigger countries, like Spain.
Zhu Min, the former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China who is now a special adviser to the International Monetary Fund, was among those who predicted that Europe's economic growth would trail that of the emerging markets and the United States this year.
''Last year, we had a two-speed recovery,'' Mr. Zhu said, pointing to an average of 2 percent growth in Western countries and more than 7 percent in emerging markets. ''This year, we'll have a three-speed'' recovery, with the United States pulling ahead of its European counterparts to an estimated growth rate of 3 percent.
During another panel discussion about the American economy with representatives from business and economics as well as from China, the consensus was that everyone, including Beijing, wanted the United States to succeed. But the panelists did not sound certain that it could.
''I think the rest of the world is waiting to see if the U.S. really restructures,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
There was praise for the work done by American corporations to cut their debt, and for the history of entrepreneurship in the United States. Mr. Bergsten said the American economy was ''a lot stronger than people realize.''
One theme appeared to resonate with executives and officials from the developed and the developing world alike: the potentially corrosive social effect of widening income inequality across and within many countries. Mr. Zhu called it ''the most serious challenge for the whole world.''
Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the advertising giant WPP, warned that the negative perception of highly paid bankers in the wake of the financial crisis was turning into a broader disaffection with the corporate elite. ''Business is not seen in a good light, and it's not just bankers,'' he said.
And James Turley, chief executive of the accounting firm Ernst & Young, spoke of ''rising tension between the public and the private sector.''
Despite breakneck growth, manufacturing muscle and a rising consumer class, China is already feeling growing pains that Chinese executives here said posed thorny issues for the government, now and in the coming decades. Chief among them are social tension and a looming demographic decline as a result of China's one-child policy.
''The last 30 years of China was about economic reform,'' said Zhang Xin, the chief executive of SOHO China, Beijing's largest real estate developer. ''The next 30 years will have to be about social reform.''
Despite these longer-term concerns, most people remained bullish about the capacity of China, the world's second-largest economy, to manage its rise in the immediate future.
Mr. Sorrell, a fan of soccer, ranks WPP's territories into four divisions of growth opportunities. In this virtual world of geo-economic soccer, China, India and Brazil are playing in the premier league, the United States is playing in the second division along with Germany and Russia, Britain is in the third division and Japan comes in last.
The rest of Europe, it seems, is still playing amateur soccer and is unlikely to raise its game anytime soon.

HEADLINE: Despite Politics, Oil Companies Are Lured by Russian Petroleum

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Exxon Mobil once was poised to acquire a stake in Russia's largest private oil company, only to have the deal fall apart when the Kremlin arrested the owner and the company went bankrupt.
A few years ago BP was squeezed out by its Russian partners, and its top executive was forced into hiding.
Yet both Exxon and BP are back big in Russia. So are some other large oil companies, which find the allure of Russian petroleum too strong to resist, whatever the political risks of dealing with the government or becoming partners with the country's notoriously tough billionaires. 
On Thursday, Exxon Mobil, America's largest oil company, signed a deal with the Russian state oil company, Rosneft, to explore offshore in the Black Sea. That came just two weeks after BP agreed to a share swap with Rosneft to form a joint venture to explore off the country's ice-bound northern coast.
Russia being Russia, though, BP is already in trouble over the new deal. On Thursday, its wealthy Russian partners in a separate, private venture filed an injunction in a London court to block BP's $16 billion Rosneft agreement.
Despite the risks, Russian oil is where the action is for the West. The country is now the world's largest oil-producing nation, pumping about 10 million barrels a day. That is currently more than Saudi Arabia's output, although the two countries frequently trade off for first place.
The bigger draw now, though, may be Russia's willingness to engage in offshore exploration. Onshore oil reserves around the world are gradually being depleted. And new offshore drilling in environmentally attuned countries like the United States are currently off limits. But Russia is open to deepwater development. In Exxon Mobil's case, that is in the Black Sea. With BP, it is even more on the cutting edge -- off the Continental shelf in the Russian Arctic.
Another big oil company, Chevron, also recently agreed to explore in Russia's coastal waters. And Royal Dutch Shell -- which in 2007 was forced to sell half of its $20 billion Sakhalin II oil and gas deepwater development to the state gas company, Gazprom -- has been invited back by Russia to join the Sakhalin III and Sakhalin IV projects in the Pacific Ocean.
The country's top energy official, Igor I. Sechin, at the signing ceremony with Exxon on Thursday, seemed eager to counter the lingering worry that Russia might nationalize its oil industry at any moment, saying it envisions its energy industry ''as a part of an integrated global marketplace.'' The signing was held in Davos, Switzerland, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.
At the ceremony, Rex W. Tillerson, the Exxon chief executive who punched his Russian oil card earlier in his career as a manager of the Sakhalin I development during the 1990s, praised his company's work with Rosneft as a ''successful relationship.''
The new deal-making by Rosneft is a matter of necessity, Valery Nesterov, oil and gas analyst at Troika Dialog investment bank in Moscow, said in a telephone interview. Russian law grants Rosneft exclusive rights to potentially rich offshore deposits. But it lacks the technology to develop them.
''The only option is to cooperate with foreign companies,'' Mr. Nesterov said.
Western executives are betting this time that their technical knowledge may insulate them from Russia's political and business vagaries.
The Exxon-Rosneft agreement commits Exxon to spend about $1 billion looking for oil off Russia's Black Sea coast, and holds the promise of sharing in the prize if it is discovered.
But Russian authorities have reneged on deals with Exxon in the past. Desperate for investments when oil prices sank in the 1990s, Russia agreed to give Exxon generous terms that exempted it from most taxes and allowed it to sell much of the oil it prospected. But in recent years, local authorities have interfered in operations.
In the early 2000s, Exxon was intent on acquiring a large stake in Yukos, once Russia's largest private oil company. But those efforts fell apart in 2003 when the Kremlin arrested Yukos's main shareholder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, in what has been viewed as a politically motivated effort to transfer Yukos assets to the state oil company, Rosneft.
BP is now trying to do business with the state-owned Rosneft over the protests of its private Russian partners in a joint venture known as TNK-BP.
BP's arctic deal with Rosneft, announced late on Jan. 14, would give BP as much offshore acreage as lies in the British sector of the North Sea. But BP's partners in the TNK-BP joint venture say the Rosneft deal violates their shareholder agreement.
According to the TNK partners, BP should have provided the joint venture's management with a detailed and written description of its arctic exploration plans before reaching the agreement with Rosneft. The venture has a right of first refusal for all BP work in the country, they say.
The partners also said BP trampled on their rights by forging a strategic alliance with another company in Russia. The TNK venture, they said, was supposed to be the British company's only major partner in the country.
''BP appears to have closed its eyes to its obligations to TNK-BP,'' the partners contend in their 28-page court filing in London, seeking an injunction against the Rosfneft deal.
A BP spokesman said the company was aware of the injunction filing, but thought that it had not violated the shareholder agreement with the partners.
It was unclear whether the legal action in London might be swiftly resolved, or whether this signified the opening moves in the type of protracted fight with TNK partners that plagued BP in Russia in 2008. Before that dispute, BP had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with another state energy giant, Gazprom, but that proved no help in what became a drawn-out battle with the BP's partners.
That dispute was resolved only when BP effectively surrendered management control of its Russian assets, while retaining the equity ownership in TNK-BP.
In that earlier fight, Robert Dudley, the current chief executive of BP, had served as head of TNK-BP before BP lost control of the company. He was compelled to flee Russia and went into hiding for several months after his work visa was revoked.

HEADLINE: A Bet on Natural Gas

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
CAMERON PARISH, La. -- The oil patch is a world of risk takers, but few are as daring as Charif Souki, the chairman and chief executive of Cheniere Energy.
A decade ago, Mr. Souki warned of an impending natural gas shortage, and set out to build a network of gas import terminals after none had been built in a generation. He lured Chevron and the French oil giant Total into signing long-term use agreements, and Cheniere's stock price rocketed from less than $1 a share in 2002 to more than $40 in three years.
But the sudden boom in gas drilling that took off around 2005 created a glut, ruining Mr. Souki's dream. Cheniere's stock price collapsed to $2. And he managed to complete only one terminal, at a cost of $1.4 billion, that stands idle much of the time.
Now he is trying to recoup his investment by making the opposite bet: that he can profitably export cheap American natural gas to Europe and Asia, where prices are roughly twice as high. 
Mr. Souki intends to sink at least another $3 billion into Cheniere's terminal of docks and storage tanks, located in an alligator-infested marsh here near the Texas border. Cheniere plans to install two, maybe four, giant refrigeration units capable of cooling methane gas into liquid for shipment on giant cargo ships. Currently, only one American terminal, built in Alaska 30 years ago, can do that.
''If you keep digging, digging, digging, you find something,'' said Mr. Souki, 58, who in a varied career has invested in real estate in Paris, hotels in Hawaii and natural gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico. A Lebanese immigrant and former investment banker with a taste for double-breasted suits in a world of cowboy boots, Mr. Souki thrives on the sheer excitement of speculation.
Citing a quote that he once heard, attributed to a racecar driver, Mr. Souki said, ''If I'm not making mistakes, I'm not driving fast enough.''
If Cheniere can obtain the necessary regulatory approval and financing, Mr. Souki says he can start exporting gas as early as 2015. He predicts he will eventually be able to export two billion cubic feet of liquefied natural gas a day from his facility, or about 3 percent of current domestic gas production. As other companies like Freeport LNG join Cheniere in exporting liquefied natural gas, Mr. Souki says the United States has the potential to become a premier global provider, capable of exporting 10 billion cubic feet a day, roughly the amount that Britain consumes.
Not surprisingly, some energy experts are snickering at Mr. Souki's latest plan to make a bundle from liquefied natural gas, also known as L.N.G.
''This is somebody who basically enjoys being on a roller coaster,'' said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''It is more likely to see snow in New York in July than to see exports of gas from L.N.G. terminals in the United States.''
But gas producers desperately looking for ways to raise prices view Mr. Souki as a hero, and enough investors like his ideas to reward Cheniere's stock with a modest rebound. Shares closed at $6.62 on Thursday.
''You have to have self-confidence to be out there alone when most people say you are wrong,'' said Aubrey K. McClendon, chief executive of the Chesapeake Energy Corporation, the second-biggest domestic gas producer, who has pledged large shipments for Cheniere to export. ''He's going to be successful and it's going to be great news for the U.S.''
When Mr. Souki set out to build at least three liquefied natural gas import terminals, bankers were so skeptical initially that he was forced to borrow $30,000 from Cheniere's president to meet payroll. The company persevered, but Mr. Souki had to settle for one terminal.
Over time, Sempra Energy and Exxon Mobil also bought into the idea of building terminals on the gulf, and Chevron and Total signed 20-year agreements guaranteeing Cheniere payments of more than $250 million a year for use of half the Louisiana terminal capacity.
The other half was intended to give Cheniere the opportunity to trade gas on the spot market.
But new drilling techniques opened up vast shale rock fields to gas prospecting over the last few years, bolstering domestic production and adding a century or more of reserves.
That has made the import terminal a disappointment. Meant to receive 30 tankers a month, it only received a dozen all of last year. Much of that business was simply temporarily storing gas for re-export.
Mr. Souki has plenty of excess capacity to provide similar long-term contracts to other companies interested in export. As long as he can complete definitive long-term agreements, he says, finding the financing to build out the terminal should be easy.
The central assumption behind the export strategy is simple: American gas prices are destined to be cheaper than European and Asian prices for years to come. At today's prices, companies would be able to buy American gas at $4.35 per million British thermal units, and then sell the same gas in Europe or Asia for roughly double that price, since long-term contracts globally are still largely tied to high benchmark oil prices.
With those spreads in mind, Morgan Stanley, ENN Energy of China, Gas Natural Fenosa of Spain, Sumitomo of Japan and EDF Trading of France have entered into memorandums of understanding with Cheniere to reserve processing capacity for export.
''We have more interest than capacity because the arbitrage is so clear,'' Mr. Souki said.
The Energy Department has granted Mr. Souki a permit to export gas to free trade partners, and is expected to grant him a second permit to export to other countries, including China, in the coming months. Other regulatory hurdles for construction will probably not be burdensome, he said, although at least one industrial consumer group is raising concerns that more exports could increase gas prices for Americans.
Mr. Souki's plan ''can be made to work,'' said Nikos Tsafos, a gas expert at PFC Energy, a consultancy firm. He warned, however, that as more companies began exporting American gas, it could pull the price of the commodity up in the United States and push it down in international markets.
Skeptics predict that the current gas glut in the United States will spread around the world as shale is drilled in Europe and Asia, major producers like Russia increase exports and more L.N.G. export terminals are built in the United States.
''For heaven's sake, Israel just discovered 16 trillion feet of gas,'' said Mr. Gheit. ''Indonesia, Qatar, Algeria, Nigeria and now Israel can all sell cheaper than the U.S.''
Still, Mr. Souki has made believers of some influential investors, like the Blackstone Group, which invested $250 million in the form of a convertible debt security in the company in 2008 and remains one of its largest share owners. ''You've got to give Charif credit,'' said Dwight Scott, a Blackstone senior managing director. ''He has built a very good asset there, and he has not let the changes in the market stop him.''
But even Mr. Souki admitted that the economics and global politics that underpin the spread between oil and gas prices were too unpredictable for him to pronounce complete confidence in his new plan.
The other day, as he stood in the terminal control room here watching operators working on a bank of computer monitors, he recalled that ''I was convinced we would use this facility at full capacity.''
''History has demonstrated that, with all the facts in, in two years I could be totally wrong,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Approves Genetically Modified Alfalfa

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced on Thursday that he would authorize the unrestricted commercial cultivation of genetically modified alfalfa, setting aside a controversial compromise that had generated stiff opposition.
In making the decision, Mr. Vilsack pulled back from a novel proposal that would have restricted the growing of genetically engineered alfalfa to protect organic farmers from so-called biotech contamination. That proposal drew criticism at a recent Congressional hearing and in public forums where Mr. Vilsack outlined the option.
Mr. Vilsack said Thursday that his department would take other measures, like conducting research and promoting dialogue, to make sure that pure, nonengineered alfalfa seed would remain available. 
''We want to expand and preserve choice for farmers,'' he told reporters. ''We think the decision reached today is a reflection of our commitment to choice and trust.''
Mr. Vilsack in recent months has been calling for coexistence among growers of genetically engineered crops, organic farmers and nonorganic farmers growing crops that have not been genetically altered.
Organic farmers can lose sales if genetic engineering is detected in their crops, which occurs through cross-pollination from a nearby field or through intermingling of seeds. And exports of nonorganic but nonengineered crops to certain countries can be jeopardized if genetically engineered material is detected in significant amounts.
The genetically modified crop -- developed by Monsanto and Forage Genetics, an alfalfa seed company that is owned by the Land O'Lakes farming and dairy cooperative -- contains a gene that makes the plant resistant to the herbicide Roundup. That allows farmers to spray the chemical to kill weeds without hurting the crop.
Alfalfa is grown mostly to make hay fed to dairy cows and horses. More than 20 million acres are grown in the United States; it is the nation's fourth-largest crop by acreage, behind corn, soybeans and wheat, with a value of about $8 billion. About 1 percent of alfalfa is organic.
In deciding whether to approve the genetically engineered alfalfa, the Agriculture Department was considering restricting areas where the crop could be planted. That, Mr. Vilsack argued, would help prevent litigation, like the lawsuits that have already delayed the approval of genetically altered alfalfa and sugar beets.
''The rapid adoption of G.E. crops has clashed with the rapid expansion of demand for organic and other non-G.E. products,'' Mr. Vilsack wrote in a letter issued by his department in December. ''This clash led to litigation and uncertainty. Such litigation will potentially lead to the courts' deciding who gets to farm their way and who will be prevented from doing so.''
But the proposal ran into considerable opposition in Congress and from some farm groups and biotechnology companies.
They argued that since the department's environmental impact statement had concluded that growing the alfalfa would be safe, the government was obligated to allow it to be grown without restrictions.
Introducing restrictions based on economic consequences of pollen drift ''politicizes the regulatory process and goes beyond your statutory authority,'' Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, who is the new chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, wrote to Mr. Vilsack on Jan. 19, before holding a hearing on the proposals the next day. The letter was also written by Republican Senators Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Pat Roberts of Kansas.
At the news conference on Thursday, Mr. Vilsack at one point said that the department did have the authority to restrict planting. But at another point, he said of the decision to allow unrestricted planting: ''We are working within the statutory and regulatory system we have available to us.''
Organic farmers and food companies said they were not pleased with the decision on Thursday. ''It was disappointing, but as you know, there is a tremendous amount of pressure here,'' said George Siemon, chief executive of Organic Valley, the nation's largest organic dairy cooperative. He said federal oversight was needed to keep organic crops free of genetically engineered material.
Critics of planting restrictions said they were concerned that the approach used in alfalfa would eventually be extended to other crops, causing restrictions on the growing of corn, soybeans and cotton, the vast majority of which are already genetically engineered.
''It's like a Pandora's box,'' said Keith Menchey, manager of science and environmental issues for the National Cotton Council of America.
Critics also said that restricting the growing of alfalfa would undermine Washington's efforts to persuade other countries to accept genetically modified crops.
The Agriculture Department first approved the commercial planting of the genetically engineered alfalfa in 2005. But some environmental groups and alfalfa seed producers sued.
In 2007, a federal judge rescinded the approval, saying the department had not adequately assessed the environmental impacts of the biotech crop, including the possible effect on organic and conventional farmers. The judge ordered the department to do a full environmental impact statement and banned further planting of the engineered seeds. The Supreme Court in 2010 overturned the ban on planting, but did not reinstate the approval of the crop, so no new seeds could be planted.
The final environmental impact statement, 2,300 pages long, was released last month. It said that the department would decide between two options: allowing unrestricted commercial growing or partly restricted growing.
The partial restriction would have prohibited growing the biotech alfalfa on about 20 percent of current alfalfa acreage nationwide, and about 50 percent in Western states, where most alfalfa seed is produced, according to Forage Genetics.
Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety, the advocacy group that organized the lawsuit against the Agriculture Department, said his group would soon ask the judge in the case to rule that the environmental impact statement was still inadequate.
''It's clear that Vilsack caved to pressure from the biotech industry and Monsanto,'' he said. ''We'll be back in court seeking to vacate this approval, as we have done in the past.''

HEADLINE: Crisis Panel's Report Parsed Far and Wide

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Susanne Craig contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Behind closed doors, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, called it ''the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression.''
He said that 12 of the country's 13 most important financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, had been on the verge of collapse ''within a week or two.'' (The apparent exception: JPMorgan Chase.)
Imagining the impact of a Citigroup bankruptcy, he recalled, was ''sort of like saying, 'Well, four out of your five heart ventricles are fine, and the fifth one is lousy.' '' (The human heart actually has two.)
Mr. Bernanke's remarks, from a November 2009 interview with government investigators, were among the fresh details in the blow-by-blow chronicle of regulatory negligence and Wall Street recklessness released Thursday by a federal commission. 
The report by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission draws on more than 700 interviews, millions of e-mail exchanges and other records that have not previously been disclosed.
While the official 633-page document comes after the Dodd-Frank law tightened up financial regulation, its findings are certain to be pored over for years -- and not just by historians.
On Wall Street, analysts were already scouring 1,200 supporting documents the panel released on its Web site; an additional 700 documents and some 300 transcripts of audio interviews are to be posted before the panel's mandate expires Feb. 13.
The report examined the risky mortgage loans that helped build the housing bubble; the packaging of those loans into exotic securities that were sold to investors; and the heedless placement of giant bets on those investments.
Enabling those developments, the panel found, were a bias toward deregulation by government officials, and mismanagement by financiers who failed to perceive the risks.
The Fed, under Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, failed to develop mortgage lending standards that could have stemmed the flow of bad mortgages into the financial pipeline, the panel found. ''The Federal Reserve was clearly the steward of lending standards in this country,'' said one commissioner, John W. Thompson, a technology executive. ''They chose not to act.''
Mr. Greenspan declined to comment.
Just as the 10-member commission splintered along partisan lines -- with the four Republican members offering two separate dissents -- so did the response to the document.
''We certainly applaud the efforts of the commission,'' the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said, in remarks echoed by Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
But Representative Spencer T. Bachus, Republican of Alabama and the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that the panel had ''failed to reach even a rough consensus on the causes of the financial crisis'' and that the Democratic majority had been ''minimizing the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in causing the crisis.''
Those two mortgage finance entities, the main report found, contributed to the 2008 crisis but were not among its chief causes.
It concluded that Fannie and Freddie had loosened underwriting standards, bought and guaranteed riskier loans and increased their purchases of mortgage-backed securities because they were fearful of losing more market share to Wall Street competitors.
The main report said that was not because of the government's affordable-housing goals, which conservatives like Peter J. Wallison, a Republican commissioner, believed were the primary culprit.
The culpability of the housing finance agencies is likely to influence debate in Congress over the future of housing finance. But the bulk of the report consists of a long, well-known narrative that is largely beyond dispute.
The report offered new details about how Citigroup and the American International Group, which received bailouts, were internally divided as the crisis worsened: some parts of each company continued to invest in housing-related investments even as others pulled away.
It offered new evidence that officials at Citigroup and Merrill Lynch had portrayed mortgage-related investments to investors as being safer than they really were. It noted -- Goldman's denials to the contrary -- that ''Goldman has been criticized -- and sued -- for selling its subprime mortgage securities to clients while simultaneously betting against those securities.''
It showed that the Fed and the Treasury Department had been plunged into uncertainty and hesitation after Bear Stearns was sold to JPMorgan Chase in March 2008, which contributed to a series of ''inconsistent'' bailout-related decisions later that year.
Neither the Fed nor the Treasury commented on the report, nor did most of the financial institutions mentioned in it, though a spokeswoman said Citigroup was ''a fundamentally different company today than it was before the crisis.''
Sprinkled throughout the report were vivid quotes from major players.
Sabeth Siddique, a top Fed regulator, described how his 2005 warnings about the surge in ''irresponsible loans'' had prompted an ''ideological turf war'' within the Fed -- and resistance from bankers who had accused him of ''denying the American dream'' to potential home borrowers.
The Office of Thrift Supervision, a soon-to-be-closed agency that was supposed to regulate A.I.G., was so outmatched that its former director, John M. Reich, compared it to ''a gnat on an elephant.''
Some bankers came across as simply bumbling. E. Stanley O'Neal, chief executive of Merrill Lynch, told the commission about a ''dawning awareness'' through September 2007 that mortgage securities had been causing disastrous losses at the firm; weeks later, the report noted, he walked away with a severance package worth $161.5 million.
The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008, which sent markets into a tailspin and led to a string of costly bailouts and was probably the most dramatic moment of the crisis, was reviewed in depth in the report.
The prominent Wall Street banking lawyer H. Rodgin Cohen, who represented Lehman among other big banks, said he thought the government, in refusing to bail out Lehman, had seemed that it was ''playing a game of chicken,'' hoping that other institutions would save Lehman.
The commission's chairman, Phil Angelides, said he hoped the report would help bear witness to a preventable catastrophe. ''Some on Wall Street and Washington with a stake in the status quo may be tempted to wipe from memory this crisis or to suggest again that no one could have seen or prevented it,'' he said.
But little on Wall Street has changed. One commissioner, Byron S. Georgiou, a Nevada lawyer, said the financial system was ''not really very different'' today from before the crisis.
''In fact, the concentration of financial assets in the largest commercial and investment banks is really significantly higher today than it was in the run-up to the crisis, as a result of the evisceration of some of the institutions, and the consolidation and merger of others into larger institutions,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama and Corporate America

 BODY:
President Obama is smart to extend an olive branch to American businesses. Our economic success depends on businesses investing, growing and creating new jobs. From expanding exports to improving infrastructure, government and businesses share important goals. 
From a purely pragmatic political standpoint, reaching an entente with corporate leaders will make it easer to defuse the hostility he has faced. Some of it has been purely partisan and ideological, from groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which deployed millions to unseat Democrats in the Congressional elections last year.
Still, Mr. Obama must take care not to let his agenda be taken over entirely by corporate interests. They do not belong to the only constituency he serves.
Appointing William Daley to be a business-friendly White House chief of staff seems a good idea; so does drafting Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric to lead his Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. It's fine to promise to weed out stupid business regulations, though past administrations that have done the same have found that most of the regulations aren't stupid.
But Mr. Obama should keep in mind that the interests of corporations and their bosses are not necessarily always aligned with those of the country. All he needs to do is look at the pile of uninvested cash on which nonfinancial businesses are sitting -- nearly $2 trillion -- while the national unemployment rate remains above 9 percent.
Satisfying business interests can be tricky. Mr. Obama wants, for example, to reduce the 35 percent top corporate tax rate. That might sound like music to corporate ears, but it could easily run into powerful opposition. That's because the president has rightly linked the reduction in the marginal tax rate to closing the loopholes in the tax code that allow many corporations to pay much less in taxes than they should.
Despite the high corporate tax rate, taxes on corporate income only raise an amount equal to 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product. That is way below the 3.5 percent of G.D.P. raised, on average, across the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It puts the United States near the bottom of industrial nations. Even the most promising areas for cooperation -- like increasing exports -- are tricky. Business groups are right to urge the administration to obtain Congressional approval for the trade agreements with Colombia and Panama that were signed during the administration of George W. Bush. But Mr. Obama has been unwilling to face down trade unions and has placed the deals on the back burner.
President Obama should bring his party on board and pass the trade agreements. He should consult closely with business on his plans to invest in public infrastructure. But this is a two-way street. Some business lobbying groups have fought Mr. Obama on ideological, not policy grounds, opposing major initiatives tooth and nail, including health care reform. As Mr. Obama reaches out to them, corporate interest groups must abandon the politics of division and gridlock and reach back out to him.

HEADLINE: Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Burke

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Every Thursday my gurus, Mr. Burke and Mr. Hamilton, get together at the Heavenly Rest to drink and talk politics. Mr. Burke prefers a whiskey and water, while Mr. Hamilton likes a good strong Sex on the Beach. This week, they ended up talking about President Obama.
Burke: I congratulate you. Your president is most prudent and wise. He has decided to focus on three things: education reform, infrastructure investment and scientific innovation. He's not wasting money on desperate schemes to pump up the employment rate before the next elections. He's thinking about the long-term prosperity of the nation. 
Moreover, his State of the Union address demonstrated an admirable sense of moderation and continuity. His competitiveness initiatives build intelligently on the ones Bill Clinton spoke of in 1996 and the ones George W. Bush mentioned in 2006. They also demonstrate an exquisite realism. With your nation so divided, he has plucked out the proposals on which there is some agreement. By working together on these things now, your leaders can establish the trust necessary to tackle bigger and tougher issues during Obama's second term.
Hamilton: You're mad, Burke! Obama has completely misread the national situation. The United States is careening toward disaster. The deficit this year is the highest in history: $1.48 trillion. In a mere eight years, the national debt will hit 90 percent of G.D.P. Interest payments alone on the debt will be $1 trillion! And he goes before the country with nostalgic happy talk and decides to spend the next two years treading water?
He pats himself on the back for a spending freeze projected to save $400 billion over 10 years. That's an infinitesimal sliver of the $45 trillion the government will be spending over that time.
Is he aware of the national bankruptcy rushing ever closer? Doesn't he see that the nation wants a fundamental change in Washington, not a few more tax credits for solar panels?
Obama is going to go down in history as the Nero who fiddled as Rome burned. He reformed health care without changing the ruinous incentives that were bankrupting the system. He submitted budgets that hastened the national collapse. The Republicans accuse him of being a socialist, but, the fact is, he's Mr. Status Quo.
Burke: My dear sir. He's an officeholder, not a think-tank Johnny. I know intellectuals are perpetually exercised by the crisis du jour, but the current deficits are not really that big. A tad more revenue and a normal bit of spending restraint will take care of them. Besides, look at Japan and Europe. They're in much worse fiscal shape. The world is happy to keep lending you money.
Obama has to deal with the country as it is. The electorate does not want entitlement cuts, which is why even the Republicans don't dare mention the word ''Medicare'' except to promise even more money for it. Do you know how many Republican activists support Medicare reforms? According to a survey by Conservative Home, it is 3 percent!
I'd say Obama is a practical realist, building gradually on America's present prosperity, not venturing out rashly in the grip of some abstract plan.
Hamilton: You vastly underestimate the structural problems leading to slowing growth rates, higher unemployment and higher inequality. I advise you to read Tyler Cowen's new e-book, ''The Great Stagnation,'' in which he argues that Americans have already picked the low-hanging economic fruit and now face an entirely set of difficult decisions. You also underestimate the dysfunction of the nation's government.
We're in the middle of a global race to see who can most intelligently reform the welfare state. The Simpson-Bowles commission put everything on the table, and far from seizing the opportunity to lead a national discussion on big things like fundamental tax and entitlement reform, he gave them the most cursory of mentions.
Besides, where is his vision? Is his entire philosophy encapsulated in the phrase, ''Light Rail?'' Does he realize that by being so modest he is ceding all momentum to the Republicans in Congress?
Burke: Ideologies are for theoreticians. President Obama will emerge as the mature moderate while the Republicans will seem unstable and dangerous. He will talk about realistic concrete improvements, like higher teacher salaries, while the Republicans will talk of unpopular and devastating spending cuts that never materialize. He will be optimistic while they will offer austerity and alarm. Have you seen that only 34 percent of Americans approve of the G.O.P. agenda, according to a PSRA/Pew poll.
Hamilton: You are wrong. Obama talks of a Sputnik moment as if NASA were a model for the future. He will be regarded as the embodiment of a government that is no longer working. As the unemployment rate hovers around 9 percent, and as problems accumulate, he will come to realize that he has sealed his doom.

HEADLINE: STATE'S SECRETS; Cables Show U.S. Tack on Egypt: Public Support, Private Pressure

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ANDREW W. LEHREN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was Hillary Rodham Clinton's first meeting as secretary of state with President Hosni Mubarak, in March 2009, and the Egyptians had an odd request: Mrs. Clinton should not thank Mr. Mubarak for releasing an opposition leader from prison because he was ill.
In fact, a confidential diplomatic cable signed by the American ambassador to Egypt, Margaret Scobey, advised Mrs. Clinton to avoid even mentioning the name of the man, Ayman Nour, even though his imprisonment in 2005 had been condemned worldwide, not least by the Bush administration.
The cable is among a trove of dispatches made public by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks that paint a vivid picture of the delicate dealings between the United States and Egypt, its staunchest Arab ally. They show in detail how diplomats repeatedly raised concerns with Egyptian officials about jailed dissidents and bloggers, and kept tabs on reports of torture by the police.
But they also reveal that relations with Mr. Mubarak warmed up because President Obama played down the public ''name and shame'' approach of the Bush administration. A cable prepared for a visit by Gen. David H. Petraeus in 2009 said the United States, while blunt in private, now avoided ''the public confrontations that had become routine over the past several years.'' 
This balancing of private pressure with strong public support for Mr. Mubarak has become increasingly tenuous in recent days. Throngs of angry Egyptians have taken to the streets and the White House, worried about being identified with a reviled regime, has challenged the president publicly.
On Thursday, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Mubarak as a partner but said he needed to undertake political and economic reforms. In an interview posted on YouTube, Mr. Obama said neither the police nor the protesters should resort to violence. ''It is very important,'' he added, ''that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances.''
It is not known what Mrs. Clinton said to Mr. Mubarak in their first meeting, at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik. But she set the public tone afterward, when she was asked by an Arab television journalist about a State Department report critical of Egypt's human rights record.
''We hope that it will be taken in the spirit in which it is offered, that we all have room for improvement,'' Mrs. Clinton said, adding that Mr. Mubarak and his wife, Suzanne, were friends of her family, and that it was up to the Egyptian people to decide the president's future.
The cables, which cover the first year of the Obama presidency, leave little doubt about how valuable an ally Mr. Mubarak has been, detailing how he backed the United States in its confrontation with Iran, played mediator between Israel and the Palestinians and supported Iraq's fledgling government, despite his opposition to the American-led war.
Privately, Ambassador Scobey pressed Egypt's interior minister to free three bloggers, as well as a Coptic priest who performed a wedding for a Christian convert, according to one of her cables to Washington. She also asked that three American pro-democracy groups be granted formal permission to operate in the country, a request the Egyptians rejected.
However effusive the Americans were about Mr. Mubarak in public, the cables offered a less flattering picture of Egypt's first lady, Suzanne Mubarak. During a visit to the Sinai, one reported, she commandeered a bus that had been bought with money from the United States Agency for International Development and that had been meant to carry children to school.
Egyptian state security was concerned enough about American activities in Sinai, according to another cable, that it surreptitiously recorded a meeting between diplomats and members of a local council.
Yet many more of the cables describe collaboration between the United States and Egypt. In her 2009 visit, Mrs. Clinton was trying to revive the moribund peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Mubarak was central to this: the cables detail his efforts to broker a cease-fire between Israelis and the militant group Hamas in Gaza, as well as American pressure on him to curb the smuggling of weapons to Hamas from Egypt through tunnels.
Mrs. Clinton was also laying out Mr. Obama's rationale for engaging Iran -- an overture, the cables report, that Mr. Mubarak predicted would fail. A May 2009 cable before Mr. Mubarak's first visit to the Obama White House noted that Egyptian officials told a visiting American diplomat, Dennis B. Ross, that ''we should prepare for confrontation through isolation.''
Like other Arab leaders, Mr. Mubarak is depicted in the cables as obsessed with Iran, which he told American diplomats was extending its tentacles from ''the Gulf to Morocco'' through proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah. He views these groups -- particularly Hamas, a ''brother'' of Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood -- as a direct threat to his own rule.
In a meeting with General Petraeus on June 29, 2009, Mr. Mubarak said the Iranian government wanted to establish ''pockets'' of influence inside Egypt, according to a cable. General Petraeus told him the United States was responding to similar fears among Persian Gulf states by deploying more Patriot missiles and upgrading its F-16 fighter jets stationed in the region.
Despite obvious American sympathy for Mr. Mubarak's security concerns, there is little evidence that the diplomats believed the president, now 82, was at risk of losing his grip on power. The May 2009 cable noted that riots over bread prices had broken out in Egypt in 2008 for the first time since 1977. And it said the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood had prompted the government to resort to ''heavy-handed tactics against individuals and groups.''
But the cable, again signed by Ambassador Scobey, portrayed Mr. Mubarak as the ultimate survivor, a ''tried and true realist'' who would rather ''let a few individuals suffer than risk chaos for society as a whole.''
''During his 28-year rule,'' the cable said, ''he survived at least three assassination attempts, maintained peace with Israel, weathered two wars in Iraq and post-2003 regional instability, intermittent economic downturns, and a manageable but chronic internal terrorist threat.''
Another cable, dated March 2009, offered a pessimistic analysis of the prospects for the ''April 6 Movement,'' a Facebook-based group of mostly young Egyptians that has received wide attention for its lively political debate and helped mobilize the protests that have swept Egypt in the last two days. Leaders of the group had been jailed and tortured by the police. There were also signs of internal divisions between secular and Islamist factions, it said.
The United States has defended bloggers with little success. When Ambassador Scobey raised several arrests with the interior minister, he replied that Egypt did not infringe on freedom of the press, but that it must respond when ''people are offended by blogs.'' An aide to the minister told the ambassador that The New York Times, which has reported on the treatment of bloggers in Egypt, was ''exaggerating the blogger issue,'' according to the cable.
American diplomats also cast a wide net to gather information on police brutality, the cables show. Through contacts with human rights lawyers, the embassy follows numerous cases, and raised some with the Interior Ministry. Among the most harrowing, according to a cable, was the treatment of several members of a Hezbollah cell detained by the police in late 2008.
Lawyers representing the men said they were subjected to electric shocks and sleep deprivation, which reduced them to a ''zombie state.'' They said the torture was more severe than what they normally witnessed.
To the extent that Mr. Mubarak has been willing to tolerate reforms, the cable said, it has been in areas not related to public security or stability. For example, he has given his wife latitude to campaign for women's rights and against practices like female genital mutilation and child labor, which are sanctioned by some conservative Islamic groups.
Still, Mr. Mubarak generally views broader reforms as an invitation to extremism. ''We have heard him lament the results of earlier U.S. efforts to encourage reform in the Islamic world,'' said a cable, noting that he often invoked the shah of Iran -- a secular leader who came under pressure from Washington, only to be replaced by an even more repressive, hostile government.
Even the private encounters with Mr. Mubarak have layers of sensitivity. While Mrs. Clinton was advised to steer clear of mentioning Ayman Nour, the cable signed by Ambassador Scobey suggested she might broach the topic of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian-American author and critic of Mr. Mubarak who fled Egypt after being found guilty of defaming the country.
''If you have any one-on-one opportunity with President Mubarak,'' the ambassador wrote, ''you may wish to suggest that annulling these cases and allowing him to return to Egypt would also be well received by the new administration.''
It is not clear whether Mrs. Clinton did so.
STATE'S SECRETS: Previous articles and text from a selection of the cables: nytimes.com/statessecrets ONLINE: Articles in this series will examine American diplomatic cables as a window on relations with the rest of the world in an age of war and terrorism.

HEADLINE: Their Own Private Europe

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
President Obama's State of the Union address was a ho-hum affair. But the official Republican response, from Representative Paul Ryan, was really interesting. And I don't mean that in a good way.
Mr. Ryan made highly dubious assertions about employment, health care and more. But what caught my eye, when I read the transcript, was what he said about other countries: ''Just take a look at what's happening to Greece, Ireland, the United Kingdom and other nations in Europe. They didn't act soon enough; and now their governments have been forced to impose painful austerity measures: large benefit cuts to seniors and huge tax increases on everybody.''
It's a good story: Europeans dithered on deficits, and that led to crisis. Unfortunately, while that's more or less true for Greece, it isn't at all what happened either in Ireland or in Britain, whose experience actually refutes the current Republican narrative. 
But then, American conservatives have long had their own private Europe of the imagination -- a place of economic stagnation and terrible health care, a collapsing society groaning under the weight of Big Government. The fact that Europe isn't actually like that -- did you know that adults in their prime working years are more likely to be employed in Europe than they are in the United States? -- hasn't deterred them. So we shouldn't be surprised by similar tall tales about European debt problems.
Let's talk about what really happened in Ireland and Britain.
On the eve of the financial crisis, conservatives had nothing but praise for Ireland, a low-tax, low-spending country by European standards. The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom ranked it above every other Western nation. In 2006, George Osborne, now Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, declared Ireland ''a shining example of the art of the possible in long-term economic policy making.'' And the truth was that in 2006-2007 Ireland was running a budget surplus, and had one of the lowest debt levels in the advanced world.
So what went wrong? The answer is: out-of-control banks; Irish banks ran wild during the good years, creating a huge property bubble. When the bubble burst, revenue collapsed, causing the deficit to surge, while public debt exploded because the government ended up taking over bank debts. And harsh spending cuts, while they have led to huge job losses, have failed to restore confidence.
The lesson of the Irish debacle, then, is very nearly the opposite of what Mr. Ryan would have us believe. It doesn't say ''cut spending now, or bad things will happen''; it says that balanced budgets won't protect you from crisis if you don't effectively regulate your banks -- a point made in the newly released report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which concludes that ''30 years of deregulation and reliance on self-regulation'' helped create our own catastrophe. Have I mentioned that Republicans are doing everything they can to undermine financial reform?
What about Britain? Well, contrary to what Mr. Ryan seemed to imply, Britain has not, in fact, suffered a debt crisis. True, David Cameron, who became prime minister last May, has made a sharp turn toward fiscal austerity. But that was a choice, not a response to market pressure.
And underlying that choice was the new British government's adherence to the same theory offered by Republicans to justify their demand for immediate spending cuts here -- the claim that slashing government spending in the face of a depressed economy will actually help growth rather than hurt it.
So how's that theory looking? Not good. The British economy, which seemed to be recovering earlier in 2010, turned down again in the fourth quarter. Yes, weather was a factor, and, no, you shouldn't read too much into one quarter's numbers. But there's certainly no sign of the surging private-sector confidence that was supposed to offset the direct effects of eliminating half-a-million government jobs. And, as a result, there's no comfort in the British experience for Republican claims that the United States needs spending cuts in the face of mass unemployment.
Which brings me back to Paul Ryan and his response to President Obama. Again, American conservatives have long used the myth of a failing Europe to argue against progressive policies in America. More recently, they have tried to appropriate Europe's debt problems on behalf of their own agenda, never mind the fact that events in Europe actually point the other way.
But Mr. Ryan is widely portrayed as an intellectual leader within the G.O.P., with special expertise on matters of debt and deficits. So the revelation that he literally doesn't know the first thing about the debt crises currently in progress is, as I said, interesting -- and not in a good way.

HEADLINE: For Desperate on Staten Island, a Worker of Last Resort

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
For emergencies, there is 911. For noise complaints, there is 311. For those in dire straits on Staten Island, there is Devorah Weiss, a social worker whose cellphone number is passed on as a last resort.
''I ask how they get my name, and it's always, 'My friend told me and her friend told her,' '' said Ms. Weiss, 55, the Staten Island social work liaison for Connect to Care, an initiative of UJA-Federation of New York aimed at helping the newly needy middle class.
Her social work services are also enlisted by the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation, and she has a desk at the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island. The posts keep her busy from the moment her phone starts ringing at 8 a.m. until it finally falls silent at 10 p.m.
''When you're really desperate, sometimes you just need someone to listen to you,'' she said one afternoon as she navigated the Staten Island streets in her beige minivan. She dresses modestly, all long skirts and covered elbows, in accordance with her Orthodox Jewish faith. 
''I may look conventional,'' she said in her gravelly, Bart Simpson-esque voice, ''but I'm a troublemaker.''
UJA-Federation is one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Ms. Weiss makes house calls, which allows clients to keep their financial distress under wraps. This being Staten Island, many of her clients live in suburban splendor, surrounded by the trappings of their wealth even after the crash drained their liquidity.
''She's embarrassed, because of her high recognition, to come to my office,'' Ms. Weiss said of her first client one afternoon late last year; she was an upper-middle-class housewife whose husband lost his business six months earlier. The spacious house was adorned with pink granite floors and Jerusalem stone, but it faced imminent foreclosure.
''She still dresses classy,'' Ms. Weiss said quietly; ''no one knows what her financial situation is. Her husband is in a depression.''
A few minutes later, Ms. Weiss's client, who insisted on anonymity, said: ''I felt helpless. I was never in this situation. But it's either I stay in the fire and burn, or I jump.''
She was juggling three part-time jobs when she called Ms. Weiss, ''the best call I ever made in my life,'' she said. Ms. Weiss, whom she calls ''my angel,'' helped her apply for a mortgage modification and referred her to a legal advocacy group. She called Ms. Weiss this day because she needed to scrape together $700 to pay her heat and water bills.
''People like me, we never knew these things existed,'' she said, referring to the social service programs Ms. Weiss taps into. ''I was always on the other side -- people would ask me for things.''
Each morning, Ms. Weiss, who has a master's degree in education and a social work degree from Yeshiva University, sets off from her home in central New Jersey with her Bluetooth device fixed in her ear, fielding calls all the way to Staten Island. Her first caller was concerned because her parents had received a utility shut-off notice in the mail. Ms. Weiss listened patiently and recommended a financial adviser before scheduling a home appointment. Another caller needed help finding a psychiatrist; her husband of 45 years had recently died.
Ms. Weiss ends each call the same way: ''If I don't get back to you by 6, call me back.''
Four new clients call each day, on average, and Ms. Weiss finds other clients by mining a stack of food pantry intake forms. She finds more clients by sifting through 50 e-mails a day. All of this is possible because she requires only five hours of sleep a night, she said.
''Even if I can't write a check for $10,000, I know I made a difference in terms of personal connection,'' she said.
Later that afternoon, a recently unemployed single mother of three, speaking through sobs as she sat in Ms. Weiss's tiny office at the Staten Island center, said: ''If I didn't have her, I don't know what I'd do. This is the scariest time of my life.''
Ms. Weiss offered a few quotations from ''The Secret,'' a best-selling financial self-help book by Rhonda Byrne.
''I come away from every case with a tremendous amount of gratitude,'' she said as she made her way to the day's final client, a homebound 84-year-old who subsists on whatever Ms. Weiss brings her from a food pantry.
''When you can wake up in the morning and go to the bathroom on your own and you're not hooked up to tubes and your bed is your own,'' she said, ''all is right with the world.''

HEADLINE: Weekly Jobless Claims Rise, and Factory Orders Fall

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New claims for jobless benefits surged last week as snowstorms in some parts of the United States kept workers at home, but the underlying trend pointed to a gradual labor market improvement. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 51,000 to a seasonally adjusted 454,000, the highest weekly total since late October, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That was the largest weekly increase since September 2005. The rise exceeded economists' expectations for a gain to 405,000.
The four-week moving average of unemployment claims, a better measure of underlying trends, rose 15,750 to 428,750 last week, implying a gradual labor market recovery that could compel the Federal Reserve to complete its $600 billion bond-buying program aimed at bolstering the economy.
''I'll buy that it can be blamed on the weather. But it does show that the recovery is growing in fits and starts,'' said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Va.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that orders for long-lasting manufactured goods dropped 2.5 percent in December, largely because of a nearly 100 percent drop in civilian aircraft orders.
Economists had expected orders to rise 1.5 percent.
Orders excluding transportation rose 0.5 percent, however, and a proxy for business spending increased 1.4 percent, indicating that the economic recovery was still gaining some momentum, though not enough to help the labor market.
Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday acknowledged the improvement in the economic picture, but said the rate of the recovery remained ''insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions.''
The number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid increased 94,000, to 3.99 million, in the week ended Jan 15. The numbers were above market expectations for a decline to 3.85 million and included the week for the household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived.
The previous week's number for the so-called continuing claims was revised up to 3.90 million from 3.86 million.
The number of people on emergency unemployment benefits rose 63,886, to 3.78 million, in the week ended Jan. 8, the latest week for which data is available.
A total of 9.4 million people were claiming unemployment benefits during that period under all programs.
In the latest snapshot of the housing sector, contracts for pending sales of previously owned homes rose faster than expected in December after the previous month's sales were revised lower, according to data from a real estate trade group.
The National Association of Realtors' index of pending home sales, which is based on contracts signed in December, was up 2 percent, to 93.7, from a downwardly revised reading of 91.9 in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected pending home sales to rise 1 percent.
The index has risen in five of the last six months, though it is still 4.2 percent lower than the 97.8 level of a year ago.
Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, said the latest sales figures suggested that activity was close to what he called a healthy level above five million units annually.
''Modest gains in the labor market and the improving economy are creating a more favorable backdrop for buyers,'' Mr. Yun said.

HEADLINE: Turns Out Sundance Thrives On More Than Just Money

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
PARK CITY, Utah -- Thirty years ago ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' was riding high at the box office, and American independent filmmaking was still an anomalous pursuit rather than a community, a recognized passion, a mark of cool. That year Charles Burnett won prizes at the Berlin Film Festival and the US Film Festival for ''Killer of Sheep'' but was unable to secure an American distributor for that masterpiece. The US Festival moved from Salt Lake City to this Utah ski town and was soon taken over by the Sundance Institute, founded by Robert Redford to support independent filmmakers.
In the years since, the Sundance Film Festival, like the American independent film scene, was discovered by Hollywood, enduring good times and bad. Recently, though, as myriad movie-industry casualties can attest, the lows seemed to outnumber the highs, as several major studios either shut down or scaled back their art-house divisions, and smaller companies went up in smoke. 
The old model of distribution, which allowed a landmark American independent like Jim Jarmusch's ''Stranger Than Paradise'' (1984) to find its audience slowly, began to disappear. Filmmakers turned to the Internet not only to sell their movies directly to the audience, but also for money and support. Crisis was the name of the game, and then suddenly it wasn't.
What happened? Put simply, filmmakers kept on making movies, if increasingly in affordable digital, and distributors, including new faces and studio veterans, found a way to put those moving pictures in front of the audience, both on the big screen and small. As it happens, viewers have developed a taste for noncorporate cinema. And despite the hard economic times they have continued to seek out movies like ''Winter's Bone'' and ''The Kids Are All Right,'' two Sundance breakout titles from last year that went on to find public and critical love and recently picked up a few major Oscar nods. Times are still tough, but American independent cinema turns out to be a movement defined by stubborn true belief and survival.
It's impossible to know if the brisk sales this year were due to the new optimism or, as one distribution veteran suggested, a fear of missing out on the next ''Winter's Bone.'' No film was as collectively adored as that 2010 favorite, but as title after title hit screens, the festival affirmed that independent cinema remains a pursuit of hearts and minds and not just a business opportunity or tabloid filler. With the crowds that sometimes gave Park City an unsettling frat house vibe now happily gone and the celebrity circus having pulled up stakes, both the streets and screens seemed newly revitalized and welcoming. Goodbye, Paris Hilton; hello, Brit Marling!
It's a sure bet that you will be reading more about Ms. Marling, a promising new talent and fashion-magazine-ready beauty who stars in and, with the director Mike Cahill, helped write ''Another Earth.'' (She also stars in and helped write ''Sound of My Voice,'' one of several movies here about cults.) A story about parallel alien worlds, those interpersonal as well as interplanetary, ''Another Earth'' centers on Rhoda (Ms. Marling), a bright young thing headed for M.I.T. who, on the same night that a new planet called Earth 2 is discovered, plows her car into a family, killing a pregnant woman and her young child.
Four years later Rhoda emerges from prison and reaches out to another survivor: the husband she made a widower (William Mapother as John). Out of this initially unlikely relationship, one that strains at reality even as it feels true, Mr. Cahill and his appealing leads create a lived-in, absorbing world. For all the far-out space talk -- true to its name, Earth 2 turns out to be a kind of mirror to the big blue marble where Rhoda has become somewhat of an alien presence -- the movie has the delicate and rough texture of real life. Even as Earth 2 hovers next to the Moon, either as threat or promise, yet more mysteries remain on Earth 1.
There's a suggestion that the end might be nigh in ''Another Earth,'' one of a large number of movies that, obliquely or directly, solemnly and sometimes irreverently, took on questions of faith. One such title is ''Red State,'' a crude misfire about homophobia and religious fanaticism from Kevin Smith, that high-profile Sundance alumnus (''Clerks'') turned one-man entertainment brand.
The story pivots on a trio of high-school boys who end up prisoners of an extremist religious sect that plans to eradicate homosexuality one cold body at a time. After warming up the story with his usual raunchy comedy, complete with the familiar gay-friendly jibes and sexist yuks, Mr. Smith loses his way amid a swamp of horror and action-flick cliches, all but turning the movie over to his charismatic villain (Michael Parks as the pastor).
(The character is based on Fred W. Phelps Sr., the pastor of a Kansas church that stages protests at military funerals to publicize its anti-gay campaign. Not surprisingly, they brought their pickets and invective to Park City for the first screening of the movie but didn't bother to stick around for the second.)
That old-time religion and some of its newer-age alternatives were central to films as dissimilar as ''Higher Ground,'' about a woman who, after evading a tragedy, joins a fundamentalist Christian group, and the amusingly eccentric ''Septien,'' about a family that drives out its demons with the help of a preacher. Making the most of his conspicuously modest budget, Michael Tully, who directed ''Septien'' and plays the family's newly returned youngest brother, creates a plausibly human if outrageous story in which belief is an occasion for comedy and dread. Vera Farmiga, meanwhile, working on a larger canvas as both the star and director of ''Higher Ground,'' manages to hold your attention through some awkward narrative turns with a character who loses and then finds both God and herself.
Whenever a strong theme emerges at a festival as sprawling and diverse as Sundance, with selections from around the globe, it can be attributed to the programming (or journalists grasping for a hook). Religion has long played a part in some national cinemas, so it's no surprise that fundamentalism has a role in the likeable, earnest Iranian lesbian love story, ''Circumstance.''
But the number of religious-theme American selections this year suggests that a minor cultural shift might be under way as filmmakers take one of the most important and, certainly in our mainstream cinema, under-addressed truths in people's lives: their struggle with God and issues of belief. If nothing else, a decade after Sept. 11 and the wrenching, discordant attention on the faith of other people, some Americans filmmakers have shifted their gaze closer to home.
This isn't to say that more traditional Sundance struggles were underrepresented, as the usual sampling of coming-of-age stories made clear. Two of the best were also my favorites in the festival: ''Terri,'' from Azazel Jacobs, who first showed up at Sundance in 2008 with ''Momma's Man''; and ''Pariah,'' from the talented comer Dee Rees, making her fiction feature debut. With a sensitive eye and an even more perceptive heart, Mr. Jacobs brings new life to the outsider's ordeal with a story about a large, lonely high-school boy (beautifully played by Jacob Wysocki) who discovers a sense of self-worth with the help of some charming oddballs. The outcast in Ms. Rees's movie (Adepero Oduye, in a heart-melting turn) travels an even more lonesome road as a lesbian high-school student finding her way against the odds.
This year's crop of documentaries didn't generate the noise or controversy that last year greeted ''Catfish'' and ''Exit Through the Gift Shop'' (which also snared an Oscar nomination), but there were films with voluble defenders and detractors. Audiences were left reeling by the emotional twists of ''Project Nim,'' a shocking movie from James Marsh (''Man on Wire'') about an experiment -- involving a chimp, some dubious science and a heroic Grateful Dead fan -- gone horribly wrong. Those lucky festivalgoers who accidentally wandered into the unannounced short ''Red Shirley,'' by the musician Lou Reed, were delighted by the pocket-size portrait of his then 101-year-old cousin, as well as the Q. and A. session with Mr. Reed that followed the screening.
That said, though no documentary dominated, one feature did generate a great deal of chatter: ''Page One: A Year Inside the New York Times.'' Directed by Andrew Rossi, who shares the writing credit with Kate Novack, this unexpectedly engaging if disappointingly superficial peek inside the newspaper covers a great deal of ground, some of which -- like the impact of the Internet on dead-tree journalism -- should be familiar to readers of the movie's improbable star, the media columnist and culture reporter David Carr. Nicely described in the movie as ''the most human of human beings,'' Mr. Carr, with his tough language and sense of journalistic honor, puts an irresistible, personal face on an institution that for many remains its own mysterious force.

HEADLINE: Snowstorm Forces Cancellation of January's Regents Exams in City and Suburbs

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
At Bronx Lab School in Williamsbridge, students studying for the United States history and government Regents exam took special prep classes and came in for extra help on Saturdays. At Millennium High School in Manhattan, administrators found money in a tight budget to pay for Regents test tutoring after school.
But for those students, and tens of thousands of others who fell asleep on Wednesday with their No. 2 pencils at the ready, weeks of preparation ended with a fizzle. Snow closed all New York City schools and forced the cancellation of Regents exams in six subjects citywide on Thursday, putting more pressure on students facing an already packed schedule of exams in June. 
''It's sort of like practicing for play for a month of two and then finding out that the production has been delayed for five or six months,'' said Robert Rhodes, the principal of Millennium High School. ''Everyone has to keep practicing.''
It is unclear exactly how many students would have taken the Regents in the city on Thursday, because the city only tracks the number of exams requested by schools, a higher number. Schools asked for 46,000 exams in United States history, 22,000 in geometry, 9,000 in chemistry, 1,800 in physics and 18,000 in skills tests for special-education students.
Tests were also canceled in towns and cities in Putnam and Westchester Counties and on Long Island, the state said.
To keep the exam questions secure, the state requires that all school districts give the exams at the same time on the same day. They are administered three times a year, in January, June and August. There are no extra versions for any particular date, because they are costly to create.
Following a 2004 precedent, when Regents exams were also canceled by snow, state officials announced a compromise for several hundred city students who were hoping to graduate this month but needed to pass one or more of Thursday's Regents tests to do so.
Those students may still graduate, with a so-called local diploma, as long as they had a passing grade in the related class. But students who want a Regents diploma, which represents a higher standard and is more attractive to some colleges, will have to take the June exam.
The United States history exam is one of five Regents the city requires for graduation, along with English, math, global history and science. For some, the January tests offer a chance to improve a poor score from a past year; for others, it is a practice exam. At Columbus High School in the Bronx, about 15 seniors who arrived in high school speaking no or limited English hoped to pass so they would have to take fewer exams in June, said Christine Rowland, one of their teachers.
Their native languages are as diverse as Creole, Wolof, Albanian and Arabic, but they now all have to face questions like: ''The presence of which pair of geographic conditions discouraged the development of a plantation economy in the New England colonies?'' (answer: rocky soil and short growing season).
''It means they are going to go all spring with the anxiety of not knowing if they are going to pass it,'' said Ms. Rowland said.
Asked about the pressure, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at his snow briefing: ''The state will figure out ways to work it out, for the kids who need to take the test. But learning the material is not a bad idea.''
Barely suppressing a smirk, he added, ''As a matter of fact, they've got the day free, they can go back to the books, and I'm sure most of them will want to spend this day doing that.''
High school students, posting on Twitter on Thursday, revealed some anguish, and some relief.
Sintayehu Dejene, 17, a junior at Bronx International High School, saw both sides. He immigrated from Ethiopia in the ninth grade speaking only Amharic, and was taking a shot at four Regents this week, even though his English is still far from perfect. In an e-mail, he said he understood why the Regents were canceled because none ''of us want to get out of our house in this snow.'' But he added that he was a little bit sad, ''because I was hoping to see if it is going to be hard or easy.''
Online Correction: January 28, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier headline on this article incorrectly described when Regents exams were canceled due to the snowstorm. The exams on Thursday, Jan. 27, were cancelled; the exams were not canceled for other days in January.

HEADLINE: Muni Bonds Vs. Treasuries

BYLINE: By RICHARD BEALES and IAN CAMPBELL

 BODY:
The budget shortfalls gripping many states have rattled the $3 trillion municipal bond market. Yet even with unfunded pensions added, their debt burdens are dwarfed by those of the federal government. There are big structural differences, but the evidence suggests investors should worry less about munis and more about Treasuries.
That's not to say states like Illinois and California don't face cash squeezes, though many smaller municipal borrowers appear to be in much worse shape. But on the numbers, Washington has the most work to do, and in areas President Obama avoided in his State of the Union address this week. 
Many of the 50 states have unfunded pension liabilities bigger than their straight long-term debt loads when discounted back to a single figure, according to a report from Moody's Investors Service. Some worst cases: In Hawaii, Mississippi and Connecticut, the combined total adds up to more than 15 percent of each state's gross domestic product. In Oregon, Colorado and Illinois, it's three times revenue, and in Connecticut, Hawaii and Massachusetts, it's more than $8,000 a person.
But consider the federal situation -- excluding, as with the state numbers, health care obligations. To the $9 trillion of debt at the end of the 2010 fiscal year, by the Congressional Budget Office's numbers, add the $5.4 trillion of unfunded Social Security obligations through 2084 as calculated by the trustees of the related funds. Combined, that's nearly 100 percent of American G.D.P. in 2010, or almost seven times federal revenue, according to the C.B.O., and just shy of $50,000 for every American.
Washington can print money, has greater power over taxation and spending than states, and in theory it can modify Social Security much more easily than states can adjust protected pension entitlements. Moreover, the pension reporting of states is fuzzy and may understate the reality. And of course, taxpayers and retirees will ultimately end up covering state and federal obligations alike.
But with nearly $5 trillion more debt expected to be issued by the federal government in the coming five years, it could be time to avoid Uncle Sam's debt and buy that of the states.
Japanese Lesson
A cut to Japan's credit rating may not seem to mean much when the country already appears to live in a world of its own. But if Japan can be downgraded, so can Italy, and the United States. Standard & Poor's downward revision of Japan is rightly reverberating globally as well as kicking the yen.
The country's debt is obscenely high. Including short-term borrowings, the burden rises to twice G.D.P. Greece's debt is 150 percent of G.D.P., and yet Japan has not required a rescue. Far from it. Japan 's 10-year bonds are yielding only about 1.25 percent. The huge pool of domestic savings means the country, unlike other indebted economies like the United States, does not need foreign savings. The Japanese government is therefore running a fiscal deficit of 9 percent of G.D.P. and issuing still more debt, as if there is no constraint on its profligacy.
S.& P.'s downgrade is a reminder that all bad things may come to an end. Japan's risks come in part from demographics and the world. The population is shrinking and aging. The old will have to be looked after. There will be fewer workers to do it.
The yen may fall further, helping to banish deflation and stimulate growth. But the slide would also carry a risk. A weaker currency and a stronger economy might mean that more of the rampant inflation the world is feeling will pass through to Japan.
A recovering world helps governments fiscally but can intensify debt pressures. For Japan, only a small increase in bond yields would make the government's fiscal position disastrous. The debt is so huge that a crisis wouldn't require the catalyst of near-double-digit yields that sent Greece and Ireland into the arms of rescuers.
This should be a warning to other large and small economies that don't take their debt seriously. The recent recession and deflation made the bonds of governments that were not at immediate risk of default appealing. It is now time for the market to reassess. RICHARD BEALES and IAN CAMPBELL

HEADLINE: Cutting Redevelopment Funds Could Affect a Lot More Than Redevelopment

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Seventeen police officers in Oakland's worst neighborhoods have an unusual and potentially doomed employer: the city redevelopment agency.
Facing a police shortage during a 2007 crime wave, Ron Dellums, then the mayor, pulled the officers from their post at Oakland International Airport and moved them into the streets. But the city could not afford the officers' salaries, which had been paid by the Port of Oakland. So officials devised a novel solution: They used redevelopment money to pay the officers.
Gov. Jerry Brown's plan to plug the state budget deficit with the help of $1.7 billion in property tax revenue that now goes to redevelopment agencies has municipal governments screaming foul. The pots of money were created to combat urban blight and pay for things like infrastructure improvements and lower-cost housing. Mr. Brown, during his eight years as Oakland mayor, relied on the funds to spur downtown revitalization. Redevelopment agencies across the state are now scurrying to spend the money before Mr. Brown can take it away.
But what has gone largely unnoticed is how hard-pressed cities like Oakland also rely on redevelopment money to cover myriad other expenses, including some that appear to be only tangentially related to redevelopment. Officials worry that those basic city services are in jeopardy because of Mr. Brown's proposal. 
Oakland's redevelopment agency is paying $3.5 million for the 17 police officers. It pays half of Mayor Jean Quan's $183,000 salary. It pays $1.65 million to cover the salaries of four City Council members and six of their staff members. Oakland's city administrator, the city attorney and several public works employees are also partially on the redevelopment agency's payroll.
All told, redevelopment funds cover about $14 million of Oakland's payroll. The same is true in many other cities across the state. In San Jose, the figure is $12 million, including $2.2 million for the City Council and mayor, and $4.4 million for the mayor's Gang Prevention Task Force, a program lauded by Attorney General Eric Holder. Top officials in Emeryville draw part of their salaries from redevelopment. Pittsburg has had one police officer on its redevelopment payroll.
''It's been used as sort of a slush fund to make up for revenue loss in other areas,'' said Karen Chapple, an associate professor specializing in community and economic development at the University of California, Berkeley. ''It's become more common in California since the crisis in the last 10 years. Cities have been very creative, and you have to give them credit for coming up with ways to cover budget shortfalls.''
The loss of redevelopment dollars would punch larger holes in the already gaping deficits that cities are facing. Oakland has a projected $40 million deficit for the coming year; San Jose, $110 million. (San Francisco's redevelopment agency has remained largely separate from the city's operating budget, according to city officials.)
Mr. Brown has said that once the state's books are balanced, the tax revenue will once again flow to local governments. But the percentage going to cities will be much lower, and some local leaders don't expect anything at all.
''I've been around California budgets for too long to believe that any of that money will come back to us,'' said the mayor of San Jose, Chuck Reed. ''I don't believe we'll see a nickel.''
A spokesman for Mr. Brown said that cities would do well in the end.
''It's clearly laid out in the budget that there's future revenue provided for local governments, and it's going to give local government more say in how the money is spent,'' said the spokesman, Evan Westrup.
California's redevelopment law lets city officials designate a zone as ''blighted'' and then earmark a portion of property taxes generated in that zone -- money that would otherwise be divided among the state, county and cities -- for redevelopment projects.
When Oakland moved those airport police officers onto the redevelopment payroll, it did so by classifying them as blight fighters and assigning them to redevelopment areas in East Oakland, Uptown, West Oakland and North Oakland. Along International Boulevard, the officers fight prostitution, drug dealers and counterfeiters. In West Oakland, they target violent crime. In North Oakland, they've been focusing on robberies.
''Those were police that we hired for the tougher retail neighborhoods in the city, so that people felt safe,'' said Ms. Quan, who served on the City Council for eight years before her election in November. ''Redevelopment is supposed to help blighted areas and some of the areas, especially along International and Foothill, were feeling less secure. Those officers walk in those areas to make them safer.''
Using redevelopment funds to pay other city workers is justified, she and other city officials say, because they are overseeing redevelopment projects.
In Oakland and San Jose, the mayors officially head the redevelopment agencies, and City Council members serve on the boards. ''Half of the work we do is redevelopment,'' Ms. Quan said.
But this budgeting tool isn't without critics. Some neighborhood activists in Oakland are still upset about the police deal.
''I don't think our redevelopment money should've been used to pay police,'' said Josephine Lee, a lifelong Oakland resident who sits on the redevelopment committee in North Oakland. ''It's for redevelopment; police officers should be paid for by the general fund.''
Ms. Lee said that Officer Mayumi Taylor had been helpful to the North Oakland area she patrols, responding quickly to a rash of robberies. At first Ms. Taylor was often called to other parts of the city, raising questions about whether the redevelopment financing was being used to blatantly plug budget holes, Ms. Lee said. But that has changed.
''Her work is good,'' said Ms. Lee. ''It's where the money is being taken from that's our main complaint.''
Brian Beveridge, a West Oakland resident who sits on the redevelopment committee for his neighborhood, said that new members often looked at the budget and asked why the mayor was getting half her salary from the redevelopment agency.
''If there's someone new in the room, they ask the question and we just roll our eyes,'' Mr. Beveridge said. ''They take their cut off the top, and we get what's left.''
In San Jose, Mr. Reed is particularly worried about the future of his Gang Prevention Task Force. Last May, Mr. Holder announced a federal gang-prevention initiative and pointed to the San Jose program -- which finances a mix of nonprofits and law enforcement to curb gang activity -- as a model to be replicated around the country.
The task force, created in 1991, is financed through some budgetary wizardry. Bob Brownstein, who worked for Susan Hammer, then the mayor, said they had come up with the idea to look through the city's budget for infrastructure projects, like street repaving or new signs and stoplights. The redevelopment agency reimburses the city for the projects, which then uses the money for gang prevention.
''Resources are skewed toward capital rather than operation,'' said Mr. Brownstein, who is now director of policy and research at Working Partnerships U.S.A., a nonprofit public policy and research institute. ''People have looked for every way they could find to get redevelopment dollars to be useful to city operating budgets.''
Mr. Reed said that he would cut into other departments if he has to find new financing. ''The gang-prevention program is not going to be cut,'' he said.
Mr. Reed was in Sacramento on Wednesday with other mayors to ask Mr. Brown to back off. If the proposal goes ahead in the State Legislature, financing for redevelopment agencies could end this summer. Several cities, including San Jose, are racing to commit the funds before that happens. But experts say it will be difficult to commit funds that are used to plug budget holes.
In Oakland, Ms. Quan said that more cuts would have to be made. The 17 police officers may be headed back to where they came from, Ms, Quan said.
That is, the airport.

HEADLINE: As Fears About Sovereign Debt Spread, S.&P. Reduces Credit Rating for Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI and BETTINA WASSENER; Bettina Wassener reported from Hong Kong. Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Davos, Switzerland, and Matthew Saltmarsh from Paris.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Standard & Poor's, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Japan's long-term sovereign debt on Thursday, a sharp reminder of the heavy burden plaguing the world's third-largest economy at levels that stand out even in an increasingly debt-ridden world.
S.& P. lowered its sovereign credit rating for Japan to AA- from AA. That is three levels below the highest possible rating, and S.& P.'s first downgrade of Japanese government debt since 2002. With the lower grade, Japan's debt rating is now on par with China's, which last year overtook Japan as the world's second-largest economy, after the United States. 
S.& P.'s move came just weeks after both it and its rival ratings agency, Moody's, cautioned that they might take a more negative stance on the United States. It highlighted just how deeply indebted many of the world's developed economies remain -- despite concerted efforts on the parts of governments to improve their balance sheets.
But by size, Japan's ballooning deficit is an anomaly. Japan's liabilities will hit 204 percent of its gross domestic product this year, overshadowing even the 137 percent for beleaguered Greece, according to figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Moody's affirmed its Aa2 rank for Japan, the third-highest grade.
S.& P., in downgrading Japan, warned that the Japanese government had no ''coherent strategy'' to address its ballooning deficit, and that its already high debt burden was likely to continue to rise further than it had anticipated before the financial crisis. A rapidly aging population is adding to the country's woes, raising the likelihood of increasing social security and pension obligations in the future.
S.& P. said it expected Japan's debt to continue rising until the middle of this decade, and ''we do not forecast the government achieving a primary balance before 2020, unless a significant fiscal consolidation program is implemented beforehand.''
Kaoru Yosano, Japan's newly installed economy minister, said that the S.& P. move was ''regrettable'' and that he believed the Japanese government's efforts to reduce the debt burden had not been fully understood.
''I believe confidence in Japan will not be shaken,'' he said late Thursday. The yen, which has been soaring -- another of Japan's burdens -- fell against the dollar on the news, reaching 83.22 yen to the dollar. It recovered somewhat later in the day, to 83.00 yen.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan had little reassurance to offer. ''I just heard that news,'' a flustered-looking Mr. Kan told reporters. ''I am a little ignorant on those kind of matters,'' he said. ''Let me look into it more.''
The United States, France, Germany and Britain are among major economies that retain AAA ratings, although some investors suspect that they, too, may become more vulnerable if growth slows anew or if their public finances fail to improve.
This month, Moody's and S.& P. both warned that the AAA rating for the United States could be reviewed in a couple of years if its debt kept growing. But a downgrade appears unlikely as long as the United States economy and the dollar retain their global dominance.
Meanwhile, the debt levels of several of Europe's smaller economies on the periphery of the euro zone have raised worries about possible defaults and more pain for the banking system. Since the onset of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone early last year, the main ratings agencies have downgraded the sovereign credit of a number of countries, including Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Belgium.
Speaking Thursday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, John Lipsky, first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, suggested the action highlighted debt problems in developed countries.
''All the advanced economies face long-term fiscal challenges,'' Mr. Lipsky said. ''These problems have been brought into focus by the crisis. These issues need to be addressed.''
Despite the staggering size of Japan's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio, most of Japan's debt is held domestically, unlike that of Greece. And Japan runs a current-account surplus in trade, putting it on a more stable financial footing.
Japan's borrowing costs remain among the lowest in the industrialized world. The yield on a benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond hovered around 1.25 percent late afternoon in Tokyo.

Re ''Republicans Try to Abolish Arts Groups'' (Arts, Briefly, Jan. 25):
I can't believe that the Republicans are now focused on eliminating both the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities as well as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as you report. Aside from showing their ignorance in matters cultural, they are not being good business people.
The arts in this country have made huge contributions to our economy, by boosting employment as well as adding richness to the cultural lives of all Americans!
What in the world are they thinking?

HEADLINE: G.M. Drops Application For Federal Energy Loan

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors said on Thursday that it was withdrawing its application to borrow $14.4 billion from a pool of federal money intended to help automakers build more fuel-efficient vehicles.
G.M., whose request had been pending with the Energy Department for 15 months, said the decision was based on improved cash reserves and a desire to avoid more debt. The company was profitable in 2010 and had $33.5 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30 -- much of it the result of federal loans related to its 2009 bankruptcy filing -- up from $22.8 billion a year ago.
''This decision is based on our confidence in G.M.'s overall progress and strong, global business performance,'' Christopher P. Liddell, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said in a statement. ''Withdrawing our D.O.E. loan application is consistent with our goal to carry minimal debt on our balance sheet.'' 
G.M. was unlikely to have received anything close to the full amount that it had originally sought. It would have been required to use the money to retool plants in the United States to make vehicles and parts with improved fuel economy.
Congress created the $25 billion fund in 2008, and the Energy Department has lent about $8.5 billion of it so far. The Ford Motor Company received $5.9 billion -- about half the amount it requested -- with smaller amounts going to Nissan, Tesla and Fisker.
The money is unrelated to the federal government's loans that G.M. and Chrysler received in 2008 and 2009 to prevent their collapse. G.M. received nearly $50 billion and repaid $6.7 billion of the amount. The rest was converted to an equity stake that was partly sold during the company's public stock offering in November, so it has no outstanding debt to the government.
Chrysler, which still owes more than $7 billion to the Treasury Department, is awaiting approval of its request for $3 billion from the Department of Energy fund, down from $8.55 billion initially. Its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, recently said he hoped to receive the money by March.
G.M. said that, even without the retooling loans, it had invested $3.4 billion in its American plants since emerging from bankruptcy, creating or retaining 11,000 jobs. Much of the upgrade was related to the manufacture of new high-mileage cars like the Chevrolet Cruze and Volt as well as batteries.
G.M. has yet to report its fourth-quarter results, but it earned $4.2 billion from January through September. Its operations generated $2.6 billion in positive cash flow in the third quarter.
''Our forgoing government loans will not slow our aggressive plans to bring more new vehicles and technologies to the market as quickly as we can,'' Mr. Liddell said. ''We will continue to make the necessary investments to assert our industry leadership in technology and fuel economy.''
Separately Thursday, G.M. said it was accelerating the introduction of the Volt, a plug-in hybrid, in response to customer demand. Dealers in all 50 states will be able to take orders in the second quarter and start receiving the cars in the second half of the year. Previously, G.M. had said the Volt would not be available nationwide until mid-2012.
The Volt went on sale in December but availability is currently limited to metropolitan Washington, as well as New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and Texas.

BYLINE: By JACK EWING, PETER LATTMAN, and KATRIN BEINHOLD

 BODY:
HEINEKEN'S INSIGHTS The World Economic Forum's annual meeting is taking place in Europe, but the real economic action is in emerging markets. So on Thursday executives got advice from an experienced hand on how to do business in those markets, an urgent question when growth in Europe and the United States remains tepid. 
Jean-Francois van Boxmeer, chief executive of Heineken, said at a breakfast at the forum, in Davos, Switzerland, that his company assessed countries according to a simple formula: population growth multiplied by economic growth times political stability. By that measure, Nigeria may be a safer place than Greece, he said -- at least for a beer maker. JACK EWING CLINTON'S WIDE RANGE If there is anyone who is tailor-made for the global talk-fest in Davos, it is Bill Clinton. On Thursday, Mr. Clinton, who first attended the forum a decade ago as president, took the main stage for an interview with Klaus Schwab, the founder of the conference. In a wide-ranging chat, he discussed topics including Haiti, American politics, the Middle East, particle physics and the Neanderthal genome project. PETER LATTMAN DEFENDING THE EUROThere is no shortage of euro skepticism at the forum, but the beleaguered currency had its defenders as well.
''To those who would bet against the euro, watch out for your money because we are fully determined to defend the euro,'' President Nicolas Sarkozy of France said in his typically impassioned style, adding that he was speaking not only for himself, but for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as well.
''We will never let the euro fall,'' he said. ''You have to understand, the euro is Europe. And Europe is 60 years of peace. We will never allow the euro to be destroyed.'' JACK EWING and KATRIN BEINHOLD

HEADLINE: Corporate Tax Code Is Resistant to Change

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Large trucking companies paid the government more than 30 percent of their income in 2009. Biotechnology companies paid less than 5 percent.
Such yawning gaps among industries have become a defining feature of the nation's corporate tax code, an unwieldy accretion of rules and exceptions that amount to a reward for some kinds of businesses and a rebuke for others.
President Obama on Tuesday added his name to the long list of politicians who have called for an overhaul of those rules, so that companies of all kinds pay the federal government a roughly equal share of their annual profits. 
''It makes no sense, and it has to change,'' Mr. Obama said in his State of the Union address. ''Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years -- without adding to our deficit. It can be done.''
But recent efforts to rationalize the code all have failed, and some members of both parties express skepticism that this time will be different. The problem, in a nutshell, is that the popular step of lowering taxes for industries like trucking requires the unpopular step of raising taxes for industries like biotech.
The very idea is already drawing howls from the corporate sector.
Moreover, many of the individual exceptions that allow corporations to shield profits from taxation actually enjoy broad popularity, like tax breaks to support domestic manufacturing, low-income housing and green energy.
There is also the chance of political gridlock. Senate Democrats and House Republicans are both holding hearings on tax reform. Both declare the subject a priority. But it is hardly clear that the two parties are talking about the same thing.
Many conservatives want Congress to cut the overall amount collected from corporations to spur economic growth.
Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who gave the party's response to the president's State of the Union address on Tuesday night, has proposed eliminating the corporate income tax. Mr. Ryan instead would impose a smaller 8.5 percent tax on business ''consumption'' -- a measure of income that excludes investment, meaning that the government would collect a much smaller share of a much smaller tax base.
Many liberal groups, meanwhile, see increasing corporate taxation by closing loopholes as a relatively painless way to reduce the federal deficit.
''It doesn't make a lot of sense to say that we're going to close loopholes and then give all the money back to corporations,'' said Steve Wamhoff of Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit group that favors increased corporate taxation. ''This would be one deficit reduction measure that would get the most support from the public.''
The United States imposes a top corporate tax rate of 35 percent. It is almost entirely a theoretical exercise. Various government and private studies have found that the average corporation generally pays about 25 percent of its income, thanks to a mix of deductions and ever-more-sophisticated tax avoidance strategies.
Google, saluted by the president on Tuesday as a paragon of American innovation, paid the government 22 percent of its income in 2009, according to its reports. The company reduced its tax bill by more than $1 billion, claiming deductions for research and investment and exploiting a popular corporate strategy by routing a large share of its income through Ireland.
Even more striking are the differences among industries. Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University who has researched the issue, said young high-tech companies often pay less than 10 percent of income in taxes, while old-line firms like railroads and utilities often pay more than 25 percent.
This inequality is one of the administration's major arguments for tax reform. But the idea is widely supported by economists and other academics for a different reason -- the concern that the current rules encourage companies to make bad choices.
The ability to deduct interest payments, for example, leads companies to borrow more money than they need. The rules governing real estate have long spurred new construction that would not be profitable without tax benefits.
''The tax code makes bad investments into good ones,'' Professor Damodaran said. ''Changing the tax code is going to create economically better decisions.''
A major stumbling block is that Congress -- often at the urging of presidents including Mr. Obama -- has regularly tinkered with the tax code to effect policies. On Tuesday, Mr. Obama charged that ''a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries.''
But many of the largest loopholes were designed by the government. A tax break to encourage domestic manufacturing costs will reduce tax collections by $10 billion this year, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Tax breaks to support research will cost about $8 billion. A tax break for companies that invest in low-income housing will cost about $6 billion.
There are some signs that Congress is willing to rethink its ways. Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who leads the Finance Committee, has been influenced in his thinking by conversations with corporate leaders who told him they would prefer the certainty of a lower tax rate to the uncertain application of various deductions. Mr. Baucus is now holding a series of hearings on the tax code.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, said after the State of the Union address that he believed the entire tax code should be cleaned up -- in part because many small businesses actually are taxed as individuals.
''The president is right that our nation's corporate tax rate, the second-highest in the world, is an impediment to economic growth and a significant drag on our economic competitiveness,'' Mr. Hatch said in a statement.
Representative Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is planning a series of hearings on broader tax reform starting Thursday.
But in a sign of the disagreements lurking just beneath the surface, Mr. Camp emphasized that his hearing was focused in part on reducing ''the cost burdens of the current code.'' He described the president's proposals as ''a few token gestures.''

HEADLINE: Mubarak Orders Crackdown, With Revolt Sweeping Egypt

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Reporting was contributed by Kareem Fahim, Mona El-Naggar, Liam Stack and Dawlat Magdy from Cairo, Anthony Shadid from Beirut, Lebanon, Alan Cowell from Paris, and Maria Newman and Christine Hauser from New York.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- With police stations and the governing party's headquarters in flames, and much of this crucial Middle Eastern nation in open revolt, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt deployed the nation's military and imposed a near-total blackout on communications to save his authoritarian government of nearly 30 years.
Protesters continued to defy a nationwide curfew in the early hours of Saturday, as Mr. Mubarak, 82, breaking days of silence, appeared on national television, promising to replace the ministers in his government, but calling popular protests ''part of bigger plot to shake the stability'' of Egypt. He refused calls, shouted by huge, angry crowds in the central squares of Cairo, the northern port of Alexandria and the canal city of Suez, for him to resign.
''I will not shy away from taking any decision that maintains the security of every Egyptian,'' he vowed, as gunfire rang out around Cairo. 
Whether his infamously efficient security apparatus and well-financed but politicized military could enforce that order -- and whether it would stay loyal to him even if it came to shedding blood -- was the main question for many Egyptians.
It was also a pressing concern for the White House, where President Obama called Mr. Mubarak and then, in his own Friday television appearance, urged him to take ''concrete steps'' toward the political and economic reform that the stalwart American ally had repeatedly failed to deliver.
Whatever the fallout from the protests -- be it change that comes suddenly or unfolds over years -- the upheaval at the heart of the Arab world has vast repercussions for the status quo in the region, including tolerance for secular dictators by a new generation of frustrated youth, the viability of opposition that had been kept mute or locked up for years and the orientation of regional governments toward the United States and Israel, which had long counted Egypt as its most important friend in the region.
Many regional experts were still predicting that the wily Mr. Mubarak, who has outmaneuvered domestic political rivals and Egypt's Islamic movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, for decades, would find a way to suppress dissent and restore control. But the apparently spontaneous, nonideological and youthful protesters also posed a new kind of challenge to a state security system focused on more traditional threats from organized religious groups and terrorists.
Friday's protests were the largest and most diverse yet, including young and old, women with Louis Vuitton bags and men in galabeyas, factory workers and film stars. All came surging out of mosques after midday prayers headed for Tahrir Square, and their clashes with the police left clouds of tear gas wafting through empty streets.
For the first time since the 1980s, Mr. Mubarak felt compelled to call the military into the streets of the major cities to restore order and enforce a national 6 p.m. curfew. He also ordered that Egypt be essentially severed from the global Internet and telecommunications systems. Even so, videos from Cairo and other major cities showed protesters openly defying the curfew and few efforts being made to enforce it.
Street battles unfolded throughout the day Friday, as hundreds of thousands of people streamed out of mosques after noon prayers on Friday in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and other cities around the country.
By nightfall, the protesters had burned down the ruling party's headquarters in Cairo, and looters marched away with computers, briefcases and other equipment emblazoned with the party's logo. Other groups assaulted the Interior Ministry and the state television headquarters, until after dark when the military occupied both buildings and regained control. At one point, the American Embassy came under attack.
Six Cairo police stations and several police cars were in flames, and stations in Suez and other cities were burning as well. Office equipment and police vehicles burned, and the police seemed to have retreated from Cairo's main streets. Brigades of riot police officers deployed at mosques, bridges and intersections, and they battered the protesters with tear gas, water, rubber-coated bullets and, by day's end, live ammunition.
With the help of five armored trucks and at least two fire trucks, more than a thousand riot police officers fought most of the day to hold the central Kasr al-Nil bridge. But, after hours of advances and retreats, by nightfall a crowd of at least twice as many protesters broke through. The Interior Ministry said nearly 900 were injured there and in the neighboring Giza area, with more than 400 hospitalized with critical injuries. State television said 13 were killed in Suez and 75 injured; a total of at least six were dead in Cairo and Giza.
The uprising here was also the biggest outbreak yet in a wave of youth-led revolts around the region since the Jan. 14 ouster of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia -- a country with just half Cairo's population of 20 million. ''Tunis, Tunis, Tunis,'' protesters chanted outside the Tunisian Embassy here.
''Egyptians right now are not afraid at all,'' said Walid Rachid, a student taking refuge from tear gas inside a Giza mosque. ''It may take time, but our goal will come, an end to this regime. I want to say to this regime: 30 years is more than enough. Our country is going down and down because of your policies.''
Mr. Mubarak, in his televised address, said he was working to open up democracy and to fight ''corruption,'' and he said he understood the hardships facing the Egyptian people. But, he said, ''a very thin line separates freedom from chaos.''
His offer to replace his cabinet is unlikely to be viewed as a major concession; Mr. Mubarak often changes ministers without undertaking fundamental reforms.
A crowd of young men who had gathered around car radios on a bridge in downtown Cairo to listen to the speech said they were enraged by it, saying that they had heard it before and wanted him to go. ''Leave, leave,'' they chanted, vowing to return to the streets the next day. ''Down, down with Mubarak.''
A bonfire of office furniture from the ruling party headquarters was burning nearby, and the carcasses of police vehicles were still smoldering. The police appeared to have retreated from large parts of the city.
Protesters throughout the day spoke of the military's eventual deployment as a foregone conclusion, given the scale of the uprising and Egyptian history. The military remains one of Egypt's most esteemed institutions, a source of nationalist pride.
It was military officers who led the coup that toppled the British-backed monarch here in 1952, and all three Egypt's presidents, including Mr. Mubarak, a former air force commander, have risen to power through the ranks of the military. It has historically been a decisive factor in Egyptian politics and has become a major player -- a business owner -- in the economy as well.
Some protesters seemed to welcome the soldiers, even expressing hopes that the military would somehow take over and potentially oust Mr. Mubarak. Others said they despaired that, unlike the relatively small and apolitical army in Tunisia, the Egyptian military was loyal first of all to its own institutions and alumni, including Mr. Mubarak.
''Will they stage a coup?'' asked Hosam Sowilan, a retired general and a former director of a military research center here. ''This will never happen.'' He added: ''The army in Tunisia put pressure on Ben Ali to leave. We are not going to do that here. The army here is loyal to this country and to the regime.''
One of the protesters leaving a mosque near Cairo was Mohamed ElBaradei, an Egyptian who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has since emerged as a leading critic of the government.
''This is the work of a barbaric regime that is in my view doomed,'' he said after being sprayed by a water cannon.
Now, he said, ''it is the people versus the thugs.''
The Muslim Brotherhood, for decades Egypt's only viable opposition movement, had taken a backseat to the youth protest on Tuesday. But, perhaps stunned at the scale of that uprising, it called its supporters to the streets in full force on Friday.
Many protesters shouted religious slogans that were absent on Tuesday, though not the Brotherhood's trademark ''Islam is the solution.'' Instead, the crowds seemed so large and diverse that it was impossible to gauge what proportion might have subscribed to the Brotherhood's Islamist ideology.
''We decided to participate in full force today because we felt that the people were starting to respond,'' said Gamal Tag Eddin, a middle-aged lawyer and a member of the Brotherhood. ''We could not participate alone because the government uses us to scare people here and abroad. Now that the people have moved, the Brotherhood are in with all their members in order to bring down this oppressive regime.''
Several others said they felt shame that their homeland -- the cradle of civilization and a onetime leader of the Arab world -- had slipped toward backwardness and irrelevance, eclipsed by the rise of the Persian Gulf states. Some said they felt outdone by tiny Tunisia.
Mohamed Fouad, sitting near the Ramses Hilton nursing a wound from a rubber-coated bullet in the middle of his forehead, wondered how long it would take to dislodge Mr. Mubarak. ''In Tunis, they protested for a month,'' he said. ''But they have 11 million people. We have 85 million.''

HEADLINE: CITY ROOM; A Week for Big (and Trivial) Thinking, With French and English Accents

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Let's see now: cheveux, nuage and poulet.
City Room's French is rusty, but not that rusty. (See above, proudly written from memory. Honest.) City Room has been to other cities, like Paris. But this is the week when City Room won't have to go that far to hear some serious French. That is because the French Council of Artistic Creation, established in 2009 by President Nicolas Sarkozy, has reached across the sea to put on a series of round-table discussions and smaller sessions on things as varied as ''the magical side of celebrity'' and ''the state and surveillance: fear and control.'' 
The series, ''Walls and Bridges: Transatlantic Insights,'' began on Friday afternoon (snow delayed its planned Thursday start) at the New York Public Library. Sessions are scheduled through next Friday, with two more installments in the series later this year, in the spring and the fall. The sites for the next week vary and include Joe's Pub, the French Institute Alliance Francaise, galleries and bookstores.
''The quality of French intellectual activity in the field of the human and social sciences is indisputable,'' said Marin Karmitz, a cinematographer who is the general representative of the Council of Artistic Creation. ''On the other hand, making this work known across the Atlantic'' has been difficult.
So, he said, the council is spreading the word by ''working with American intellectuals'' and discovering ''what issues they are currently interested in and making these the foundation for exchange with their French counterparts.''
Et voila: thought-and-discourse-provoking salons on the subjects of hair, clouds and chicken - again, see above. A press release for ''Walls and Bridges'' describes them, in English, as ''three overfamiliar and undertheorized objects of study that are perfectly suited to create a conversation that draws on social, literary, artistic, political and economic sources.'' Hair will be on the agenda on Sunday. Clouds will be the subject at a session in the spring, and chicken next fall.
The hair, chicken and cloud symposiums - a tiny fraction of the programming curated by Villa Gillet, a French research center ''dedicated to thought in all its forms'' - will take place in a series of ''stalls'' where visitors can have short, spontaneous one-on-one conversations with leading thinkers.
The Hair Fair will be held at the winter headquarters of the Brooklyn Flea, in the old Williamsburg Bank tower at One Hanson Place in Brooklyn. The presenters - three French and two American - will include Laurel Braitman, who will come prepared to discuss ''hair plucking'' among anxious captive animals, including gorillas, mice and parrots; and Justin Smith, a philosopher, who will explore the ways hairlessness has come to signify rationality in the history of philosophy.
The spring event about clouds will be held in a restaurant, where the thinkers will serve up discussion as they serve the appetizers and entrees.
To maximize the ''je ne sais quoi'' factor, the organizers plan to hold the session about chicken in a laundromat.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Republicans Resist Closing Prisons, Cuomo Is Said to Scale Back Plan

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and THOMAS KAPLAN; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Nearly a month ago, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomomade a call to close some prisons an emotional capstone of his first annual address to the Legislature, vowing, to sustained applause from fellow Democrats, that underused prisons would no longer be ''an employment program'' for upstate New York.
The issue has long prompted resentment, particularly for families of New York City residents who are shipped hours north of the city to be incarcerated, to places like the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, which is perched in the northern Adirondacks. 
But now Mr. Cuomo appears to be, at least partly, in retreat.
The governor and his staff had considered closing or consolidating potentially 10 or more adult and youth prisons and other facilities controlled by the corrections department, but they have faced stiff resistance from Senate Republicans, who are trying to fend off the loss of hundreds of state jobs in some of their upstate districts.
Now the governor appears to be scaling back his ambitions, those with knowledge of his plans said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk on the record about the governor's budget deliberations ahead of the budget's completion.
Any plan to shutter specific prisons is unlikely to be included in the budget Mr. Cuomo releases on Tuesday and will be left to negotiations with the Legislature as it hammers out a final budget over the next two months.
The governor's office has already signaled a willingness to accommodate Republicans; a plan floated on Friday in The New York Post suggests as few as six prisons would be closed, three of them in New York City, including two that house work-release programs.
If the new strategy holds, it would sharply curtail Mr. Cuomo's ambition and could ultimately even increase the proportion of prisoners sent upstate.
In his Jan. 5 address to the Legislature, Mr. Cuomo said that ''an incarceration program is not an employment program.''
''If people need jobs, let's get people jobs,'' he added. ''Don't put other people in prison to give some people jobs. Don't put other people in juvenile justice facilities to give some people jobs. That's not what this state is all about, and that has to end this session.''
On Friday, his administration had little to say publicly on the matter.
''While any speculation about the budget is premature,'' Mr. Cuomo's deputy communications director, Josh Vlasto, said, ''prisons with very significant vacancy rates should be evaluated and potentially considered for closure given the state's fiscal condition.''
Mr. Vlasto also said there was never a plan to close only upstate facilities.
Republicans have certainly made their feelings clear about any potential closings.
''We recognize that this is going to be a tough budget with real cuts, and we just hope that these cuts are equally distributed around the state,'' said Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Binghamton Republican and the deputy majority leader.
''I do think the governor understands the prison issue,'' he added. ''I know he understands the prison issue is always a sensitive one to upstate.''
Leaders of the legislative committees that oversee prisons said Friday that they had not been briefed by Mr. Cuomo or his aides on what closings might be part of his budget.
The chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Correction, Jeffrion L. Aubry, Democrat of Queens, expressed concerns about possible closings of prisons in New York City that have work-release programs. ''We believe in work release,'' he said. ''We would not want to see a diminution of work release in the city of New York, where a large majority of the prisoners come from.''
''If you close them in the city of New York, where are you going to have those inmates functioning out of?'' he added. ''Is it going to be some place that's close to employment?''
Mr. Aubry also rejected the idea of balancing prison closings based on geography. ''That's not good policy,'' he said. ''That's just politics.''
Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit prison-monitoring and advocacy group, said he would be disappointed if only six facilities were closed and half were in New York City.
''The totally legitimate corrections wisdom is it's important to locate prisons in communities that are close to where the people come from that are locked up,'' Mr. Gangi said. ''The evidence and the research show that when prisoners are able to maintain ties with their family, they cope better with their prison experience and they have a lower recidivism rate.''
But Senator Betty Little, a Republican whose district includes much of the Adirondacks, said the economic effects had to be considered. ''The area I represent is northern New York, it's very rural, and we built an economy around these facilities, first of all because no one else wanted them in their neighborhoods and because the land was cheap,'' she said. ''Hopefully when they look at closure, they look at economic impact. I'm not trying to create inmates to keep these places open, but we need to look at the whole picture.''
Senator Ruth Hassell-Thompson, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County and is chairwoman of the Legislature's Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus, said: ''So many of our inmates are already separated by vast distances from their families. And this decision must be carefully thought through with a focus not only on the financial savings, but also, on the impact on our local communities.''

HEADLINE: Unrest in Egypt Scares Investors Worldwide

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Escalating protests in Egypt jarred world financial markets on Friday. Stocks fell while the dollar, Treasuries and gold rose as investors sought to reduce their exposure to risk.
The Egyptian government's response to widespread street protests unnerved investors. The military was deployed in an effort to quell the protests, and the headquarters of the ruling party was on fire. Thousands of people defied a curfew, and Internet and cellphone service was cut off in Egypt.
Earlier, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and used water cannons to disperse crowds that had gathered in the largest challenge to President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule. The fall of the Tunisian government two weeks ago has raised concerns that other authoritarian governments in the Middle East could also be toppled. 
''The safety trade is back,'' said Jeffrey Frankel, president of the broker Stuart Frankel & Company. ''Gold is up. Oil is up. Anything related to overseas is getting hit.''
Prices of Treasury bonds, considered one of the safest assets, rose sharply. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note jumped 17/32, to 94 7/32, and the yield fell to 3.32 percent, from 3.39 percent late Thursday.
The dollar rose 0.5 percent against an index of six other currencies as investors sought safety. Gold rose 1.7 percent, to settle at $1,336.75 and crude oil rose 3.7 percent, to $89.34 a barrel.
The Egyptian stock market is not open on Fridays. The market's main index fell 10.5 percent Thursday.
The MSCI World Market index, the broadest measure of the world's stock markets, slumped 1.4 percent.
''Traders are watching this flare-up in the Middle East and using it as a reason to take profits,'' said Doug Godine, managing director at Signal Hill, an investment bank.
Of the 30 large company stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, 28 fell. The two exceptions, Procter & Gamble and DuPont, were flat.
The Dow fell 166.13 points, or 1.39 percent, to 11,823.70. The Dow lost 0.4 percent for the week after eight consecutive weeks of gains.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 23.20 points, or 1.79 percent, to 1,276.34. All 10 company groups within the S.& P. index fell. The S.& P. fell 0.5 percent for the week.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 68.39 points, or 2.48 percent, to 2,686.89. The Nasdaq lost 0.1 percent for the week.
Five stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Disappointing earnings reports also rattled investors, said Brian Wenzinger, a portfolio manager at Aronson Johnson Ortiz in Philadelphia. ''Some companies like Apple are doing well, but the bulk are not being too optimistic,'' Mr. Wenzinger said.
Ford fell 13 percent after its earnings came up short of Wall Street's projections. Amazon.com fell 7 percent after reporting that higher costs cut its profit margins. Microsoft lost 4 percent after it said that the profitability of its Windows division was falling.
A lower-than-expected report on the United States economy helped lead to a market sell-off as well. The Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter. That was below the 3.5 percent that analysts had forecast.
Sara Lee fell 2.7 percent after announcing a plan to split into two companies. One, a food and retail business, will keep the Sara Lee name and operate the Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farms businesses. The other, which has yet to be named, will hold the current company's beverages and baked goods lines.

HEADLINE: Car Pools, Passe As Hitchhiking

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and ROBERT GEBELOFF; Sabrina Tavernise reported from Woodbridge, Va., and Robert Gebeloff from New York.

 BODY:
WOODBRIDGE, Va. -- Remember the 1970s? Watergate, disco, oil embargoes and, of course, car-pooling. Many big companies organized group rides for their employees, and roughly one in four Americans who drove to work shared a ride with others.
But now far more people are driving alone, as companies have spread out, Americans are wealthier and cars have become cheaper to own. The percentage of workers who car-pool has dropped by almost half since 1980, the first time the Census Bureau started systematically tracking the numbers, according to new data from the bureau.
The sharp decline has confounded efforts by urban planners, who over the years have tried to encourage the practice by setting aside highway lanes for car-poolers, as well as offering incentives like discounted parking.
They thought they were getting some help from amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990 that would have required many companies to develop plans to increase car-pooling and mass transit use. But Congress, after hearing from critics who said the proposal was unworkable, scrapped the idea in the mid-'90s. 
Today, advocates point to the increase in social networking tools that would make it easier to identify potential ride-sharing mates -- yet the national car-pooling rate continues to fall, and today it is below 12 percent of all drivers.
The drop has occurred in cities across the country. For example, the car-pooling rate fell by more than half since 1980 in Rochester and its suburbs, as well as in Worcester County, Mass., and in the suburbs of Kansas City. Even in San Diego County, Calif., the state where modern car-pooling began, the rate was down by more than a third.
Here in the fast-growing suburbs of Washington, the number of people driving alone has more than doubled since 1980. That is a sharp contrast from a generation ago, when Washington had one of the highest car-pooling rates in the nation, with one person car-pooling for every two driving to work alone. Today, for every one car-pooler, there are six solo drivers. This trend crawls to life every weekday morning before dawn, when a stretch of Interstate 95 turns into a glittering river of headlights moving so slowly that drivers need to leave up to two hours to cover a 30-mile trip.
''Painful,'' said a 55-year-old accounting firm employee who tries to pick up other riders at designated places in Woodbridge so she can use the restricted, faster lanes.
''Books on tape, music, it doesn't help,'' she said about the daily trip (most of the commuters interviewed here asked that their names not be used). ''All I'm thinking is, 'Oh, God, this is going to hurt.' ''
The grind of the drive provokes such frustration that commuters do odd things to stay calm. One commuter waiting for a ride at a meeting point here said that one driver had become notorious among the regulars -- ''the puppet guy,'' who apparently used hand puppets to act out arguments to manage his anger over being stuck in traffic.
The population of the Washington suburbs has exploded in recent years, up by more than 60 percent since 1980. Still, the congestion has not served as an impetus for car-poolers, whose numbers, as a portion of all drivers, have fallen.
In fast-growing Prince William County, where Woodbridge is located, the number of car-poolers has actually grown, but not nearly as much as number of people driving alone, which has tripled since 1980.
The census data also show that different races car-pool at different rates. According to the census, black, Hispanic and Asian commuters car-pool far more than white workers.
In 2000, the car-pool rate for Hispanic workers was 28 percent, double the rate for whites, partly because of new immigrants sharing rides to jobs at construction sites or factories. But even Hispanics are relying less on group rides: by 2009, the rate for Hispanics had fallen to 19 percent.
''As cars became more affordable and life became easier, the big car pools broke up,'' said Alan Pisarski, a consultant who studies transportation trends.
Car-pooling first cropped up as a policy idea in the United States in the 1940s, when oil and rubber shortages limited the use of personal cars, according to Erik Ferguson, a professor of urban planning and the author of a 1997 article called ''The Rise and Fall of the American Carpool.''
Car-pooling was first seriously studied by academics and urban planners in the 1970s, the decade of the oil embargo, ''a time of great hope for car-pool enthusiasts,'' Mr. Ferguson wrote.
Lew Pratsch, who organized shared rides for federal workers while working for the Energy Department in the 1970s, remembers that decade as a golden era for car-pooling, when big companies like Xerox and Chevron organized car pools for their employees. He picked up his future wife on their first date with a car-pool van.
But since then, profound demographic and economic shifts occurred. Companies spread out more, and the workday became less predictable. Women went to work in large numbers, raising the incomes of households as well as their ability to own a car.
''It's economic,'' said Roger F. Teal, a former professor of civil engineering whose Illinois software company, DemandTrans Solutions, helps municipalities with transportation issues. ''If people have a car available, they will use it.''
With today's high levels of car ownership, ''the strongest motivation for people to car-pool disappeared,'' said Mr. Teal, who conducted one of the early comprehensive studies of car-pooling. Car ownership has outstripped even population growth, as the number of cars parked in American driveways has risen by nearly 60 percent since 1980, while the number of Americans has grown by a third.
What remains, of course, is traffic, and in places like Washington, where it adds hours to commutes, people car-pool to take advantage of the fast-track car-pooling lanes.
People car-pool here with strangers in a practice called ''slugging'' -- the term comes from fake bus tokens, because bus drivers sometimes mistake car-poolers, who often wait near bus stops, for bus riders. Each waiting spot has its own destination, like the Pentagon or L'Enfant Plaza, and drivers call them out as they drive up.
The practice can bring surprises, some more welcome than others. One commuter said she picked up some great financial advice from her carmates.
But another said she once had to defend a fellow passenger after the driver started lecturing her about Christianity. ''It's O.K. to spread the word of God, but technically he was holding her hostage,'' she said.
As car-pooling has continued to decline, mass transit use has increased in the past decade. In the Washington area, it represents about 14 percent of commuters, compared with 11 percent in 2000, according to the data.
Another big change has been the number of people working from home at least one day a week, which has tripled since 1998, to about 600,000, according to Nicholas Ramfos, director of Commuter Connections, a network of agencies and local governments that coordinates ride-sharing programs.
Some car-pool enthusiasts remain hopeful that the shared rides will grow more popular. For example, at the annual meeting of the National Transportation Research Board this week in Washington, the schedule of panels included ''How We Double Ride-Sharing in 10 Years.''
But Mr. Teal, who attended the meeting, said he has heard such bold claims before, but does not believe them.
''The belief was that if you created the right incentives, it was something just waiting to happen,'' he said. ''Well, it didn't.''

HEADLINE: Gays Seeking Asylum in U.S. Encounter A New Hurdle

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
Romulo Castro considered attending his asylum interview in Rosedale, Queens, dressed as Fidela Castro, a towering drag queen in six-inch stilettos, a bright green poodle skirt and a mane of strawberry blond hair. In the end, Mr. Castro, 34, opted for what he described as understatement: pink eye shadow, a bright pink V-neck shirt and intermittent outbursts of tears.
After years of trying to conceal his sexual orientation back home in Brazil (where Fidela never made an appearance), Mr. Castro had been advised by his immigration lawyer that flaunting it was now his best weapon against deportation.
''I was persecuted for being fruity, a boy-girl, a fatso, a faggot -- I felt like a monster,'' said Mr. Castro, who reported being raped by an uncle at age 12, sexually abused by two police officers, and hounded and beaten by his peers before fleeing to the United States in 2000. ''Here, being gay was my salvation. So I knew I had to put on the performance of my life.'' 
Amid international outcry over news of the Czech Republic's testing the veracity of claims of purportedly gay asylum seekers by attaching genital cuffs to monitor their arousal while they watched pornography, some gay refugees and their advocates in New York are complaining that they can be penalized for not outwardly expressing their sexuality. While asylum-seekers and rights groups here expressed relief that use of the so-called erotic lie detector is impossible to imagine in the United States, some lamented in recent interviews that here too, homosexuals seeking asylum may risk being dismissed as not being gay enough.
The very notion of ''gay enough,'' of course, or proving one's sexuality through appearance, dress and demeanor, can be offensive -- and increasingly androgynous fashions and the social trend known as metrosexuality have blurred identities in many people's minds.
''Judges and immigration officials are adding a new hurdle in gay asylum cases that an applicant's homosexuality must be socially visible,'' said Lori Adams, a lawyer at Human Rights First, a nonprofit group, who advises people seeking asylum based on sexuality. ''The rationale is that if you don't look obviously gay, you can go home and hide your sexuality and don't need to be worried about being persecuted.''
Jhuan Marrero, 18, who was born in Venezuela but has lived -- illegally -- in New York since he was 4, said the immigration officer at his asylum interview last week challenged him about his macho demeanor.
''I was brought up by my parents to walk and talk like a man,'' said Mr. Marrero, who volunteers at the Queens Pride House, a gay and lesbian center in Jackson Heights.
''The officer said: 'You're not a transsexual. You don't look gay. How are you at risk?' I insisted that if I was sent back to Venezuela, I would speak out about being gay and suffer the consequences.''
Victoria Neilson, legal director of the New York-based Immigration Equality, which provides assistance to asylum seekers, recalled the case of a 21-year-old lesbian who had been threatened with gang rape in her native Albania to cure her of her sexual orientation, but was initially denied asylum, Ms. Neilson said, because she was young, attractive and single, apparently not conforming to the officer's stereotype of a lesbian. (A judge later granted her asylum, Ms. Neilson said.)
Chris Rhatigan, a spokeswoman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, said each case is examined individually, both for evidence of sexual orientation and the conditions of the country of origin. While she declined to comment specifically on the examples cited by Mr. Marrero and Ms. Neilson, Ms. Rhatigan said such behavior by immigration officers would not be condoned.
''We don't say that someone is insufficiently gay or homosexual, whatever that would mean, or that he or she could be saved by hiding his or her homosexuality,'' Ms. Rhatigan said. ''Sexual preference is an immutable characteristic. It is something an individual can't or shouldn't change.''
Citizenship and Immigration Services received 38,000 asylum applications between October 2009 and September 2010, but the agency does not track how many cite being gay or lesbian as a reason. People may qualify for asylum if they can demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on membership in a particular social group; in 1994, the scope of the law was expanded to specifically include homosexuals.
Illegal immigrants seeking asylum are interviewed by immigration officers, who can either approve their applications or refer them to an immigration judge. Gay applicants must marshal evidence of their sexual orientation and their risk of persecution, like affidavits from same-sex partners or police and medical reports of abuse. But legal experts said that the burden of proof can be difficult for people from places like Saudi Arabia or Iran where homosexuality is punishable by death and it can be dangerous to be openly gay or report an anti-gay hate crime -- or from Western countries that are believed to be sexually tolerant.
Advocates said the situation had gotten worse amid the troubled economy and high unemployment rates, citing anti-immigrant sentiments and a desperation that had led some straight immigrants to feign being gay in hopes of winning asylum.
One lawyer recalled a recent client who applied for asylum on the basis of sexual orientation, then showed up a few weeks later with his wife, seeking help with a green card. In 2009, Steven and Helena Mahoney of Kent, Wash., pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a consulting business in which, among other things, they coached straight people on how to file gay asylum claims.
For fees of up to $4,000, the Mahoneys provided asylum seekers with dramatic (if fictional) stories of anti-gay persecution, along with lists of gay bars and maps of the gay pride parade route in Seattle to help them pass as gay, according to federal prosecutors. Mr. Mahoney was sentenced to 18 months in prison, Mrs. Mahoney, to 6 months.
Ms. Rhatigan, the immigration spokeswoman, said that judges and immigration officers were highly trained to assess the evidence in asylum cases, and that each case was carefully scrutinized for signs of fraud.
Even in cases where the persecution is real, experts said, coming from a country perceived as sexually liberal can be a disadvantage.
Mr. Castro, the son of an army officer in a staunchly conservative Roman Catholic family, said he was initially advised by immigration lawyers in Washington and New York not to bother applying for asylum since he came from Brazil, a country that has developed a reputation for gay pride parades, Carnival pageantry and drag queens.
In 1999, Mr. Castro was accosted by two police officers after leaving a gay club in the northeastern city of Sao Luis, Maranhao, according to his asylum application. He said they forced him to perform oral sex. When he started to sob, he said, one of the officers dangled a bag of cocaine and threatened to frame him.
Depressed and despondent, Mr. Castro said he considered the priesthood, and prayed every day; he also tried to date women. After a year, he decided to flee to the United States. He obtained a tourist visa, which he overstayed by eight years.
Last year, Mr. Castro, now a massage therapist living in Jackson Heights, decided to apply for asylum so that he would not have to live in fear of being deported.
The day of his interview in 2009, he was shaking. ''I thought, 'They will never let me stay,' '' he said. ''I cried.''
He said the officer was initially unsmiling and intimidating. ''I figured I was doomed,'' he said.
He showed her the affidavit his older brother had written begging the United States to keep Romulo ''forever away from us'' to prevent him from shaming the family. He shared a letter from his psychiatrist confirming that he took antidepressants for the post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his abuse. He came armed with a thick stack of articles detailing episodes of persecution of gays in Brazil.
Coached by his lawyer to be anything but bashful, he also produced several photographs at the end of the interview of his alter ego, Fidela, decked out in a tiny, strapless, black-satin cocktail dress dangling a stiletto heel from atop a giant pink float.
In June 2009, he was awarded asylum. He got a green card last summer.

 BODY:
8 P.M. (HBO) REPO MEN (2010) In this dystopic satire, adapted from the novel ''The Repossession Mambo,'' by Eric Garcia (who wrote the screenplay with Garrett Lerner), and set 20 years in the future, Jude Law, above, stars as Remy, an employee of a corporation called the Union. The company has developed synthetic, life-extending prostheses known as artiforgs for every body part. The implants can cost nearly $600,000 each and are sold by zealous door-to-door insurance salesmen. If someone falls too far behind in his payments, a repo man arrives on the scene with a body scanner and a scalpel, the better to detect company property and cut it out. 
But when Remy tries to reclaim the artificial heart of a musician named T-Bone (the rapper RZA), he's knocked unconscious from an electric shock and emerges from a coma to discover that he, too, has been implanted with a fake pumper. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said that ''as a recession-era satire,'' this nasty, comic thriller from Miguel Sapochnik ''strikes a very bitter chord.'' He added: ''In today's climate of widespread home foreclosures in which most banks refuse to modify the terms of mortgages, the movie offers a grotesque funhouse reflection of this scarily Darwinian environment. Then there is the matter of escalating health care costs and the insurance industry's resistance to reform. We are halfway there already.''

HEADLINE: Team May Want a Sale, But What's in It for a Buyer?

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Alison Leigh Cowan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fred Wilpon, who said Friday that he was looking to sell a minority stake in the Mets, has been talking to friends and business associates about it for several weeks. He has been unable to find any takers, which prompted him to cast the net wider, according to several sports bankers.
Given the concentration of wealthy individuals and companies in New York, and the scarcity of professional teams for sale in the country's largest city, the Mets should find no shortage of potential suitors. A sale, though, depends on what the Mets are willing to sell and under what conditions. 
''There are plenty of people who want to be aligned with a glamour team like the Mets and New York,'' said Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp, a consultant. ''The key question is what is going to be sold.''
The Mets were worth $858 million last year, according to Forbes magazine, making them the third-most valuable major league franchise after the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. But the club has significant debts associated with its stadium and television network. In a conference call with reporters, Wilpon, who is the Mets' chairman, said he hoped to sell 20 to 25 percent of the team, which in theory would bring in about $170 million before taxes.
But Fred Wilpon's son Jeff, who is the team's chief operating officer, said SNY, the team's profitable cable network, was not for sale. Because SNY is healthy and growing, its exclusion from the sale significantly dilutes the offers the Wilpons may be able to attract.
Potential owners would almost certainly want immunity from any litigation related to the Wilpons' investments with Bernard L. Madoff, who admitted conducting a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. Steve Greenberg, who is advising the Mets in seeking minority owners, told reporters on the conference call that potential buyers would do their own due diligence. Greenberg would not say whether any buyer would have to make cash calls when the team needed extra money.
''You're asking us to lay out the whole deal,'' Greenberg said. ''It's a little premature to get into that now.''
Then there is the question of whether a new owner would want someday to increase his or her stake. During the conference call, Fred Wilpon was asked if he might consider selling a controlling interest in the team and replied: ''I don't see that at all.''
Andrew Murstein, president of Medallion Financial Corp., which has invested in sports teams, said that a 25 percent stake in the team without any control would be less attractive to potential buyers. ''People who buy teams want to put their imprints on them, and without control, you can't do that,'' Murstein said.
The Mets could seek partners who bring more than money to the table. Time Warner Cable and Comcast, for instance, already own part of SNY. Cablevision, another cable company that used to carry Mets games, may show interest, despite owning a rival network.
There are plenty of wealthy Mets fans, including the comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who could be approached, Ganis said. Of course, the economic downturn has whittled the list of high rollers, and sports teams are not growing in value as fast as they were before the recession.
Wilpon has sought investors before this. In 2001, before Nelson Doubleday sold his half-share of the team, The New York Times reported that Fred Wilpon solicited interest in 10 percent shares in the team among widely known New Yorkers, primarily fellow real estate entrepreneurs. Among the prospective minority owners were members of the Rudin family, Donald Zucker and Bob Tisch, who was co-owner of the Giants football team.
On Friday, Jeff Wilpon said that the Mets could raise money in other ways, including approaching banks or insurers. But in the wake of the financial crisis, banks have tightened their lending standards.
So the Mets will have to choose carefully, whatever route they take. They have operated the team like a family business for years, and Fred Wilpon has been grooming Jeff to take over the club one day. If the Mets are unable to find investors willing to follow their plan, sports bankers say they may be forced to sell a lot more of the club than they hoped, just as Tom Hicks did last year with the Texas Rangers. And at that point, investors will sense the Wilpons' desperation and seek to drive the price down.
''This may feel like it's a distressed situation, and because the Madoff thing is so high-profile, you hate to sell equity in a situation like this,'' said Don Cornwell, a sports investment banker at Morgan Stanley who said he had received a few inquiries about the Mets already. ''You like to sell it at the top. The ideal is you sell equity when you've won the World Series. And now, people know they need the money.''

HEADLINE: Near Newspaper Row Of Years Gone By, The Media Return

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
In the late 19th century, a cluster of buildings along or near Park Row, close to those busy news engines, City Hall and the city's courts, housed almost every daily newspaper in town -- The Herald, The Sun, The Tribune, The World, The Journal and The Times.
Formidable editors and publishers like Charles Anderson Dana and Joseph Pulitzer lorded over newsrooms where gaslight was shifting to electric, while spittoons, hand-cranked telephones and suspenders were still commonplace.
Most of the city's commerce and government, as well as much of its housing, was within blocks of those newspapers. Reporters could get to the scene of a story quickly, by foot, horse car or the new elevated steam trains, which were being built for a booming, self-important city that unimaginably swarmed with a million and a half people. 
The era, and its charm, were captured in ''Park Row,'' a history written in 1958 by Allen Churchill. ''Newspaper Row of the day was populated by redoubtable figures who wrote noble, Shakespeare-tinted prose about routine fires or edited copy with diminishing whiskey bottle close at hand,'' he wrote, in a flair of aggrandizement.
Those kinds of ''Front Page'' characters have been missing from Lower Manhattan for decades. But as financial firms stream out of the neighborhood, taking advantage of lower commercial rents uptown, the current lords of journalism -- now known as ''the media'' -- are pouring back into downtown offices.
The migration is not quite a recreation of New York's old Newspaper Row. For one thing, no giant presses will be heard rumbling from ground floors. Visitors, in fact, will be hard-pressed to find any actual newsprint. This is a news haven for the digital age.
The Alliance for Downtown New York counted 60 media companies now in or moving to the area below Chambers Street. Conde Nast, The Daily News, U.S. News & World Report, Newsweek, The Daily Beast and The National Enquirer have announced plans to move their offices from Midtown to the financial district and the World Trade Center neighborhood, where they will be joining The Forward, Inc., Fast Company and Men's Fitness, the music-rights organization BMI, and others. The Downtown Alliance estimates that there will soon be 5,375 media employees working downtown, not including Conde Nast.
What kind of neighborhood will these news folks find? One more in tune with the character of today's news professionals, some longtime New York journalists said.
''The days of reporters drinking and brawling together after work are gone,'' Helen Kennedy, a reporter for The Daily News, lamented in an e-mail. ''Everyone goes to the gym now, or home to their 2.5 kids.''
In Lower Manhattan they will feel right at home. With the addition of hundreds of apartments in Battery Park City and in the financial district, including some on the shadowy, narrow blocks around Wall Street, the residential population below Chambers Street has more than doubled since 2001 and now stands at 55,000, according to the Downtown Alliance.
The streets are populated by joggers and people pushing baby strollers, weaving their way through crowds of government workers and commuters.
Building owners and real estate developers, hoping to keep their office buildings populated, have been offering rent deals and promoting the area to media companies -- sometimes at the expense of other neighborhoods.
''Can you name a bar in Midtown where a self-respecting reporter would want to go in?'' asked John N. Lieber, president of the World Trade Center Properties division of Silverstein Properties, which developed 7 World Trade Center and is building three other towers at ground zero. ''But if you come downtown, the bars, the restaurants, the night life are the New York we grew up in.''
The neighborhood is easy to reach from Williamsburg or Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn, places where the salaries of journalists and Web designers often take them.
And no longer is the neighborhood a ghost town after 5 p.m. on Fridays, said Eric Wong, who designs applications for the Web and who moved to an apartment near Broad Street in 2007.
Jane Berentson, editor of Inc., a magazine that, like Fast Company, is published by Mansueto Ventures, said she could leave her office at 7 World Trade Center and walk a few blocks for lunch at Robert De Niro's Locanda Verde. Three Danny Meyer restaurants will soon open opposite the World Trade Center. And not too far away, a lively restaurant row has blossomed on Stone Street, a narrow alley of low brick buildings reminiscent of 19th-century London.
''It's an extremely family-friendly neighborhood with a lot of that grittiness that we New Yorkers know and love,'' Ms. Berentson said. ''And it has the river.''
Actually two rivers and a large bay, whose bordering parks and paths are well used.
It is a far cry from the 1960s, when the area, like the rest of the city, was in decline. By then, the only general-interest newspapers left in Lower Manhattan were the afternoon dailies, with The New York Post and the now-defunct World Telegram & The Sun and The Journal-American garrisoned along the rivers.
The atmosphere could sometimes be eerie, almost film noir, said Anthony Mancini, who worked at The Post from 1958 until the late 1970s, an era when reporters at Remingtons and Smith Coronas wrote on ''copy books'' of typing paper interlaced with carbon paper, and unacceptable articles were spiked on an actual spike.
''It wasn't downtown like downtown today,'' he said. ''There was no TriBeCa, no Battery Park City. It was dismal and scary. A lot of the women used to complain about it. It was a good thing the subway was nearby.''
By 1995, all three of the city's remaining daily newspapers were publishing in Midtown, joined tellingly a few years later by The Wall Street Journal.
Yet real estate forces, and tastes, are cyclical -- while downtown's allure for news people has hardly changed.
''What are the big stories these days?'' asked Elizabeth H. Berger, president of the Downtown Alliance. ''The economy and government, and it's less than a half mile from City Hall to Wall Street.''
The alliance has helped to feed the migration. Fourteen months ago, it opened the Hive at 55, where 90 writers, Web designers and publishing employees pay fees by the day or month to share an office suite at 55 Broad Street. The Hive was seeded with $100,000 in city money as a way of incubating a media industry downtown.
Del Bryant, president of BMI, which monitors airplay so composers and performers can collect royalties, said Midtown had nothing on downtown, where ''your sense of old New York, the history, is palpable.''
And while it was once essential to be in Midtown to sign up new clients, that is no longer so. ''Now people find you online,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Cabbies, a Time to Stretch Muscles and Mind

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgf1@columbia.edu

 BODY:
Thomas Lowery clomped down the hallway in his jeans and Timberland boots, 6-feet-2 and 290 pounds and 54 years old, until he reached the classroom. It was an improbably delicate place, a dance studio with blond wood and mirrored walls. Mr. Lowery cut down his strides to pick a path between the nine purple mats arranged on the floor.
''Taxi Yoga,'' declared the flier in his hand. ''No more Road Rage. Become a Road Sage!''
The man depicted on the flier, Andrew Vollo, stood at the front of the studio, clad in black from head to bare feet. ''How you doing?'' he asked Mr. Lowery and the other students as they assembled. One of them replied, wearily, ''Managing, managing.'' 
The flier was one of more than 3,000 that Mr. Vollo had sent or handed out to promote the class. He had visited mosques, Sikh gurdwaras, Hindu temples and had been interviewed on the cable show ''India Talks.'' For this has been his mission for the past seven years, to help New York City's taxi drivers manage the physical and psychic toll of their job by means of yoga.
Earthy and ethereal in equal measure, Mr. Vollo teaches the Taxi Yoga class as an administrator at LaGuardia Community College in Queens. Sometimes, when his Astoria accent gets the best of his enthusiasm, he calls it ''yoger.'' His students include, he said, those ''who think yoga is something like yogurt'' as well as observant Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists who incorporate what they learn into their existing faith lives.
Mr. Vollo's ''dese'' and ''dem'' lexicon is part of his skill set as the de facto guru for some unlikely disciples. The son of a welder, the veteran of years behind a taxi's wheel, Mr. Vollo embodies the spread of yoga across traditional barriers of gender and class.
His course, in turn, shows how what has commonly been a religious practice can ultimately infuse popular culture with a more general sense of Eastern spirituality. While a public college like LaGuardia can hardly offer a class that compels worship of a deity, Taxi Yoga fits into a more contemporary and amorphous realm of mind-body harmony and meditative practice.
''I really think I'm chipping away,'' Mr. Vollo, 56, said of the blue-collar aversion to yoga as stuff for hipsters, yuppies and space cadets. ''If I get nine people in a class, that's fantastic. They'll learn enough exercises to loosen their back and legs. I'll tell them how to eat better, give them breathing exercises. Because if you're driving in pain, you're going to be a nasty person.''
Strange as it may sound, yoga's history does sort of lead to Mr. Vollo and his cabbies. In postwar America, amid the counterculture and New Age movements, the lines have often blurred between physiology and theology. ''The question is: Are psychology and spirituality on a continuum? And I think they are,'' said Stefanie Syman, the author of ''The Subtle Body,'' a history of yoga in the United States. ''It's difficult to be receptive to deeper levels of self-transformation if you're exhausted and stressed and uncomfortable.''
The number of yoga practitioners in America has risen to 16 million today, from 5 million in 1976, according to Ms. Syman's research. But while what she terms the ''tougher yoga'' styles like Bikram and Ashtanga have attracted an increasing number of men in the last generation, economic class has remained an obstacle.
Mr. Vollo discovered that resistance firsthand over the course of his career. He had begun studying yoga, as well as tai chi, when he was driving a cab as a college student in the 1970s. In the process he moved from the Roman Catholic observance of his youth to considering himself a Taoist, albeit one who still attends Mass with his wife and son.
Intermittently over the decades, he tried to evangelize for yoga among drivers, sometimes persuading three or four to study together for a few sessions, then having years pass without any interest. In 2004, as the director of LaGuardia Community College's educational program for taxi drivers, he gave another push.
He passed out fliers to dispatchers and brokers and at driving schools. People laughed. People ignored him. One office manager kicked him out. But somehow he got his first four students to enroll.
''I don't do the chanting, the Om, the religion,'' he would assure them. ''It's pure exercise.''
If so, it was exercise aimed at a demographic niche that needed it. A 2008 study of New York cabdrivers conducted jointly by the National Institute of Occupational Health and the New York Taxi Workers Alliance found that three-quarters of drivers suffered back pain, more than half had neck pain, and substantial numbers had sore heels, knees and feet. With the typical workweek about 60 hours -- 60 sedentary hours -- more than half the drivers are overweight.
Mr. Lowery, Mr. Vollo's student, put it in personal terms: ''We're out there 12 hours a day, and we don't have time to do anything besides go to McDonald's or grab a cup of coffee, and then we're back behind the wheel. You're sitting like a pretzel, like a pretzel in a tin can.
''You get neck spasms, back pain, cramped legs. And the strangest part is my eyes, from all the intense staring. They get really red. You can see the veins standing out. It scares me sometimes. I just wonder.''
He wondered enough to pay attention to the Taxi Yoga flier he had recently received in the mail and, along with eight other drivers, to attend a recent Monday night class. They supplied a fair cross section of the taxi work force -- immigrants from Colombia, China, Ghana and Pakistan, and a couple of lifelong New Yorkers. Some, like Cesar Calderon, had begun with grander plans; he was trained to be a chemical engineer. Most now shared a particular slouch and dark-rimmed eyes, the evidence of all those 5-to-5 shifts.
So Mr. Vollo played the hack whisperer, coaxing them into stretches and swivels and twists. He guided them onto their backs, then their stomachs; he demonstrated an exercise for eye muscles. He reminded them not to drive with a wallet in the back pocket: ''Bad for your spine.''
The hour ended. Several drivers paid $20 for the full series of four classes. Mr. Vollo promised breathing exercises next time. The drivers gathered up the change that had slipped out of their pockets -- ''Cesar, you're losing all your tips,'' Mr. Vollo chided -- and tugged socks and shoes back on.
All, that is, except for Mr. Lowery. He had never removed those Timberlands. ''I don't know if I feel good,'' he said with a hint of marvel in his voice. ''But I feel something.''

HEADLINE: As Benefits Go Paperless, Check-Day Rituals Vanish

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
A rooster is crowing, and an alarm clock chimes. ''Wake up, wake up, wake up, it's the first of the month,'' the rap song by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony goes. ''To get up, get up, get up, so cash your checks and get up.''
Immortalized in rap songs, examined in books on inner city life and discussed on Facebook, the federal benefits check has developed into a social and cultural icon. The checks have generated a ''first of the month'' economy in some places, as lottery revenue increases and lines at liquor stores and discount retailers swell. And in some communities, the checks serve as security to borrow cars, get a loan or sleep for a few days in someone's house in hard times, said Sudhir Venkatesh, a professor of sociology at Columbia University. 
But now, the days for such rituals are numbered.
In May, the government will no longer pay someone eligible for benefits with a mailed check. Instead, the money will be electronically deposited directly into a bank account or made accessible by a debit card. And by March 2013, the 10 million people who receive checks, out of 70 million people in all, must switch over to direct deposit or use a card.
For the government, the policy is in line with a trend toward paperless banking that will curb theft and save $120 million a year in costs.
But the first of the month won't be the same anymore.
The change will have social and cultural impact. Some recipients have resisted it because they cannot open an account, or simply because they feel more comfortable with a check in hand.
Robert A. Caciopoli, a 72-year-old retired schoolteacher, was one of the holdouts. Every month, he takes his Social Security check to the local bank in Bridgeport, Conn. He socializes with the tellers, some of them former students, and watches them count out his cash.
''I like my money in my hand once, before everybody and his brother gets their hands on it,'' Mr. Caciopoli said.
But Mr. Caciopoli said he was reluctantly switching to direct deposit for his Social Security checks because he had no choice. ''That is the new wave of things so they can have their hands on your money,'' he said. ''It drives you crazy just trying to figure out who is getting what and when.''
The paper check has been synonymous with Social Security since the first recurring payment was mailed to Ida May Fuller in 1940, an event deemed such a milestone that the Social Security Administration archived a photograph of her posing with the $22.54 check next to her mailbox in Brattleboro, Vt.
Many older adults lament the new rule as another step, like automated switchboards, toward impersonal banking. And without a check to hold, they feel they will have less control over their finances. But government officials counter that criminals have long preyed on vulnerable individuals, and the online system provides extra security.
Treasury officials say electronic deposits will eliminate the $93 million in Treasury checks of all kinds that were fraudulently endorsed and cashed in 2010. David A. Lebryk, commissioner of the department's Financial Management Service, said direct deposit payments would be accessible even in natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, when mail delivery is impossible.
While direct deposit of government checks is already widespread in states like Florida, where there are large populations of retirees, the decision puts the spotlight on places that do not have banks or where people have little access to the Internet.
In Elsa, Tex., given the state's low literacy rate, some older adults rely on relatives, local stores or senior centers for cashing services.
''Some people did hard labor all their time and they just never learned how to print their name,'' said Armando Garza, a former mayor. ''They just put the X.''
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said 9.5 percent of Southern households did not have bank accounts -- higher than any other region.
Recipients can choose debit cards instead, but that, too, will take some adjustment. Under the program, which will be administered for the government by the financial services company Comerica, recipients will have access to more than 50,000 A.T.M.'s around the country for one free withdrawal a month and 90 cents for additional transactions. If one of the A.T.M.'s is not in their area, they may end up paying fees at other A.T.M.'s.
Some see the decision as government meddling and say they fear their spending habits may be traced. But Mr. Lebryk, the Treasury official, said that information could be obtained only with a court order in a ''rare exception.''
He said the department expected to keep mailing checks for people in some areas, including overseas, in remote parts of Alaska and on some Indian reservations.
Government agencies, sheriffs and banks are preparing for the changes.
Lawrence Grimaldi, a spokesman with the Rhode Island Department of Elderly Affairs, said the department had directed social workers to help older adults who might not drive anymore to get state identification cards so they could open accounts.
People's United Bank in Bridgeport has been holding ''senior appreciation'' sessions in supermarkets to help older adults, over coffee and cookies, understand online banking and practice using A.T.M.'s. ''I know this is a hard sell to a lot of seniors,'' said Angela DeLeon, a crime prevention specialist who works with the bank.
In some areas, the new policy may have more of a social impact than an economic one.
At a New York City housing complex, tenants meet in lobbies to wait for mail delivery on check day. Some escort older adults to cashing facilities, wary of the opportunists who may circle on the first of the month. On a remote Indian reservation in South Dakota, residents of the Rosebud Sioux tribe assemble at the post office for the arrival of ''first class,'' the slang for mailed federal checks.
Those casual gatherings could taper off as benefits are instead electronically deposited into individual accounts.
But other rituals may well survive. There are few places to spend money in Rosebud, S.D., so the group shopping pilgrimages to Nebraska are likely to carry on -- once a month.
''It is more or less like a big exodus,'' said Perry DeCory, a communications specialist for the tribe.

HEADLINE: A Little Place That Finds Itself Receiving Big Money

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
Parshall, a town of about 1,000 in the vast empty of western North Dakota, has been invaded time and time again in recent years.
First came the oil surveyors, and on their heels, the landmen and rig hands and welders and everyone else needed to build an oil drilling business. They populated the formerly sleepy motel and filled up the new restaurant on Main Street.
The cameras of ''Boomtown'' land sometime in the middle of this big oil versus small town face-off, and yet instead of friction, find transactions smoothed by money and imperfect information. 
Parshall is one of several towns sitting atop the Bakken Formation, one of the most significant sources of crude in the continental United States. ''Oil guys are calling it the Saudi Arabia of North America,'' the mayor, Richard Bolkan, tells a local news crew.
Given the scale of this incursion, this modest, largely emotionless docu-series, which begins on Saturday night with the first two installments of five, feels remote and, like many of the Parshall residents it follows, sometimes awestruck by the sheer size of the transformation to this forgotten spit of land.
Many scenes are filmed with an absorbing stillness, an inheritor of the distant, sometimes cold style codified by ''The Hills'' and its offspring, as well as the rural-decay wistfulness of ''Friday Night Lights.'' It's camerawork that suggests large forces at play, impossible to outmaneuver.
They're pretty, these shots of vast, seemingly underproductive farmland, and a Main Street in decline. Even prettier are the shots of the majestic oil well pumps, silently poking into the ground over and over again, gnawing away at this small town's stasis.
But there are actual seismic changes afoot: payments of five, six and seven digits to town residents who might not earn money of that magnitude in a decade. Nevertheless, ''Boomtown'' remains unhurried, unflustered, regarding the newly wealthy townfolk with equanimity. (In fairness, though, these inadvertent moguls are as aww-shucks about instant wealth as about the humdrum that preceded it.)
One exception is the hangdog mayor, Richard, who owns the town grocery store and initially has no oil income; in his free time, he consults maps of active wells, wondering when he might strike it rich. By the second episode, though, his rig has come in: he buys ice-fishing equipment, a flat-screen TV and a vacation to Costa Rica. He considers hiring a manager for the grocery store. He smiles a bit.
Still, wealth doesn't appear to be corrupting him, not yet. The most disruption on display is in the fragile romance between Jeanette, who owns the town's motel, and Larry, a widower and welder who started as a boarder and now lives, as he puts it, ''in the big house.'' The oil company hasn't paid him for work done on their rigs, even as it's paying mineral-rights owners, and he's considering resuming his itinerant lifestyle: his last job had been in Afghanistan, where's he's threatening to return.
In the peculiar logic of ''Boomtown,'' Larry feels like more of a threat than the oil company representatives who, with slicker hair and clothes than the townies, aren't painted as bad guys so much as benevolent conquerors. They arrive, flush with cash, Hoovering up mineral rights and shrugging, gosh, isn't it just great that you don't have to work for this money?
Only Donny, a rancher who owns his land but not the minerals beneath, strikes a note of real dissent in the first two episodes, suggesting that collateral damage from the drilling might render his land worthless. Visiting a neighbor with similar concerns, he scoops up some dust, puts it to his tongue and pronounces it ''salty.'' (Saltwater is a byproduct of oil drilling.)
As articulate dissent goes, on ''Boomtown,'' this is it. So unbiased are the cameras that the show has little to say about the struggle between small-town values and big-industry hunger, or about whether the temporary cash dump into Parshall might in fact be a long-term improvement over the slow decline of the town's farming economy.
Such reserve is unexpected, given this show's home on Planet Green, a Discovery Communications network devoted to sustainability. (One of its two Web sites is called TreeHugger.com.) On the show's Web site, there are links to articles, including ''20 Ways to Reduce Our Dependence on Oil'' and ''Energized Ideas for Surpassing Petroleum (Slideshow),'' as well as ''Gulf Oil Spill: Amazing and Devastating Photos.''
The BP oil spill is the invisible backdrop for this series (which began filming in late 2009, months before the Gulf disaster). Nowhere in this country is oil a neutral topic right now. But what ''Boomtown'' has really captured, more than a battleground, is something more troubling: the malleability of a lonely place that considers itself off the grid. At a city council meeting, the mayor tells a visiting oil executive that he's ''just glad to hear that somebody's interested in Parshall'' -- a town waiting for someone else to set its course.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economic Growth Bounces Back to Rate Seen Before Recession

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Peter Lattman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With a little more money in their wallets and a little less fear in their hearts, American consumers helped pull the economy up by its bootstraps in the final months of last year.
The gross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced in the country, grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 2.6 percent in the previous period, according to a Commerce Department report released Friday.
Because of this slightly speedier expansion, the nation's overall economic output has finally matched its peak before the recession. Still, given the millions of jobless American workers, the economy has fallen far short of what it could be if it were healthy, economists said. 
''Things are better, but they're not anywhere near where they need to be to make major inroads into unemployment,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.
Thanks to modestly higher paychecks and swelled investment portfolios, Americans appeared more comfortable buying again and stashing away a little less in savings.
Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 4.4 percent in the October-December period, its quickest pace in nearly five years and almost double the growth rate from the previous quarter.
The payroll tax cut and the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, both passed in December, are expected to further buoy consumer spending, which many economists predict will grow at an annual pace of about 3 or 3.5 percent this year.
The shrinking trade deficit also helped the economy regain some momentum in the final months of the year.
Economic growth, after a surge in late 2009, began to sputter in the spring of last year. The slowdown was largely the result of rocketing growth in imports, which are subtracted from the government's calculations of gross domestic product. In the fourth quarter, however, a combination of rising exports and shrinking imports helped the economy expand at a faster pace. ''In the middle of last year, imports showed the biggest drag on G.D.P. growth in more than 60 years,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. ''That kind of rise in imports just wasn't sustainable.''
Businesses also increased their spending on equipment and software as the year concluded, though not quite at the double-digit growth rates shown earlier in the year. Economists are hoping that these types of investments -- and a replenishing of inventories, which ran low at the end of the last quarter -- will soon be matched by investments in new workers as well.
''Firms have the cash to hire,'' said Augustine Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody's Analytics. ''They just need the confidence to do so, and that could develop quickly.''
The overall economic growth rate came in slightly below analysts' expectations, which was an annual pace of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter. The preliminary number released by the Commerce Department on Friday was about apace with forecasts for the full year. The Congressional Budget Officeforecast that the economy would grow 3.1 percent in 2011, a figure echoed by many Wall Street analysts.
While that rate would be faster than last year's, it is still probably not robust enough to make a significant dent in the unemployment rate, which stood at 9.4 percent in December. In the couple of years before the recession, which began in December 2007, the American jobless rate was less than half that level.
''We're still very much below the output growth rate needed to absorb the slack in labor market,'' said Prajakta Bhide, a research analyst for the United States economy at Roubini Global Economics. ''We're expecting to end the year with an unemployment rate of 9 percent.''
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, speaking in an interview Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said that ''brutal'' job cuts early in the recession ''consign us to a tragically more moderate reduction in unemployment as the economy recovers.'' But he said he had growing confidence that the United States economy would continue to expand.
The International Monetary Fund has predicted that other rich countries, like those in the euro zone, will have modest growth in the coming year, while China will surge ahead with growth nearing 10 percent. Though the rapid-fire growth in emerging markets may push the prices of food and energy higher, these developing countries could help increase global growth by encouraging more trade.
''There are concerns here that China is managing its exchange rate, and that does limit the upside for U.S. exporters,'' said Paul Ashworth, a senior United States economist at Capital Economics. ''But in general, stronger growth in developing countries, as long as it's sustainable and not the result of a credit boom that could come crashing down, should benefit developed countries like the United States as well.''

HEADLINE: The S.&P. Meanders Back To 1,300

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks first reached 1,300 nearly 12 years ago. This week, it did it again.
In the interim, there have been two recessions and two deep bear markets. The market is now nearly twice as high as it was at the most recent bottom, less than two years ago. 
That second bear market wounded the confidence, born by the extended bull markets of the 1980s and 1990s, that stocks were certain to be a good long-term investment. Many investors cut back on stocks during the financial crisis, and over all the public has been slow to return. For most of 2010, mutual funds that invest in American stocks experienced net withdrawals, leaving them with no new money to invest.
Only in recent weeks did money begin to return to those funds.
The accompanying chart shows the course of the S.& P. 500 from the trading day before the index first hit 1,300 through Thursday, when the index traded above that level for the first time in 2011. It also shows the widely varying performance of the 10 industry sectors whose movements the S.& P. calculates. The overall stock market may have gone nowhere, but parts of it are very different than they were.
The conventional wisdom in 1999 was that we were entering the information age, and that stodgy companies that made things, or, worse yet, mined things, were simply not going to keep up. It turned out the opposite was true, The rise of China and other emerging economies increased demand for commodities. The best sectors over the period were energy, materials and industrials.
Who would have thought in 1999 that 12 years later an investment in United States Steel would be up almost 150 percent, while Microsoft would have lost nearly a third of its value?
The information technology sector, which was extremely popular with investors in 1999, was decimated by the plunge that began in 2000 and ended in 2002. It remains about 10 percent below where it was when the index first hit 1,300.
That performance is much better than the other sector that was very popular then, telecommunication companies. Those stocks benefited then from expectations that they would be dominant players in the new information society. It did not work out that way, and the sector index has lost more than half its value.
Even the financial sector has done better than that. It is about a third lower than it was 12 years ago, but it also has more than doubled since it hit bottom in the midst of the financial crisis.
The stock market has had such long pauses before, but they were less important because far fewer people were dependent on stock market returns. In 1982, just before a great bull market began, the S.& P. 500 was lower than it had been in 1968, 14 years earlier, but most Americans with savings had them in banks, where interest rates were high.
Even the current crisis in finances of many states and cities can be blamed in part on the failure of the stock market to rise. Some states borrowed money to put in pension funds, expecting profits from investments to more than cover the interest on the bonds. The funds typically assumed that their investments would rise about 8 percent a year, something that did not happen.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Getting Nowhere in 12 Years: The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index touched 1,300 this week, a level it first reached in 1999. Its two round trips -- it peaked above 1,500 in 2000, fell below 800 in 2002, climbed back past 1,500 in 2007 and fell below 700 in 2009 -- appear to have damaged investor faith in stocks, and the lack of gain over that long period has hurt many pension funds. Within the market, financials, telecommunications and information technology stocks -- each an investor favorite at one point, did the worst over the span of nearly a dozen years. The best performing sectors -- energy, materials and industrials -- were all unpopular in 1999. The charts, using weekly data, show the percent change of each index from March 12, 1999, the Friday before the index first exceeded 1,300. (Source: Bloomberg)

HEADLINE: With Euro in Crisis, European Leaders Still Differ on How to Save It

BYLINE: By JACK EWING; Liz Alderman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DAVOS, Switzerland - To listen to the talk here this week, everyone is determined - really, really determined - to save the euro. But no one seems to know quite how.
One leader after another marched before audiences at the World Economic Forum to declare an unshakable will to overcome the euro area's sovereign debt crisis and restore confidence in the common currency.
The euro ''is more than a currency,'' Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said in a speech in Davos on Friday. ''It is Europe. If the euro fails, Europe fails.'' 
Her speech came after an almost identical oath of allegiance to the euro during the last week by the president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy.
But there still seems to be deep division among European leaders, as well as the big thinkers from economics and academia, about what policies would remove doubts about the euro's future.
Buy back Greek bonds? Increase the size of the European rescue fund? Allow Greece to default? Or just keep muddling through?
''If they're not willing just to write blank checks to the peripheral countries, I don't see what their strategy is,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
Even though many of the key figures in the debate are at Davos, no clear solutions have emerged. In fact, much of the rest of the world seems to have moved on. The most intense economic discussion seems to be about how to resolve the tensions created by the trade deficit of the United States and China's surplus.
Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, told an audience Friday that the European sovereign debt crisis hurt the United States economy last year when it caused a plunge in stock prices but that the effect was short-lived.
''I think it had a significant effect on slowing the recovery at a delicate point,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''After a brief loss of momentum, the U.S. started to recover.''
There does seem to be some marginal progress on what to do about Greece. George A. Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, said in Davos on Friday that he expected the European Union and the I.M.F. to grant the country more time to pay back the money it owed them.
''This will be a major asset for calming markets,'' he said.
Mr. Papandreou also said officials were discussing how to strengthen the European Financial Stability Facility, which is administering a $604 billion rescue fund.
One proposal is to give the facility the power to buy government bonds, or to buy Greek debt at depressed market values in a kind of stealth restructuring. The European Central Bank has been buying Greek, Irish and Portuguese bonds to stabilize markets but has made it clear that it wants political leaders to take over the heavy lifting.
''There is a strong will to think about how the E.F.S.F. can be more robust,'' Mr. Papandreou said.
But he continued to reject suggestions that Greece default on its debt or restructure its obligations so that it has more time to pay - measures that Mr. Rogoff and many other economists say are inevitable.
Instead, Mr. Papandreou and his finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, insisted that Greece would modernize its tourism and agriculture to restore growth. In addition, they said, Greece will increase revenue by combating rampant tax evasion by the seizing the yachts of wealthy deadbeats, going after assets hidden in foreign banks and other measures.
''We sometimes underestimate the capabilities we have,'' Mr. Papandreou said. Such measures helped Greece increase revenue 5.5 percent last year, according to government figures.
Mr. Rogoff, who has studied the history of sovereign defaults, said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum that Greece might be able to get its debt under control someday but that it would require years of sacrifice that few political systems can endure.
The only precedent for such long-term suffering in the service of debt repayment is Romania in the 1980s, Mr. Rogoff said. At the time, the country's dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, imposed a draconian austerity program on the Romanian people, who later rose up and executed him.
Even among the stars of the economics world who have congregated at Davos, there is disagreement about if and when Greece should default.
Some advocate a restructuring as soon as possible. ''The longer you delay it, the higher the stakes,'' said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research organization in Brussels. ''An orderly default of Greece is not such a bad thing. But do this now.''
Others fear that a restructuring would heighten fears that Ireland, Portugal and even Spain could also default, alarming markets and risking a much bigger crisis.
''To me the precedent of a default of a euro country is pretty bad,'' said Robert J. Shiller, professor of economics at Yale.
There is one solution that everyone agrees would work, at least in the short term. Other European countries would simply give Greece and Ireland money to pay off their debts.
But that solution is considered politically unacceptable in Germany. Many economists agree that letting Greece off the hook would reward bad fiscal behavior, raise borrowing costs for other countries and eventually destabilize the European monetary union.
''It means that the incentive for Greeks to get their house in order is lowered,'' said Dennis J. Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Kiel, Germany. ''Ultimately if any country misbehaves, then the risk premium in other countries rises because they are among those who pay for the mess.''
There was, at least, no shortage in Davos of moral support for the beleaguered euro area.
''Britain has a real interest in the euro succeeding,'' David Cameron, the prime minister of Britain, said at the forum on Friday. Noting that euro members account for 44 percent of British exports, Mr. Cameron said, ''A weak euro zone that doesn't confront its difficulties is not good for us.'' But he also sounded glad that Britain still has its own currency.
''There are times when different countries need different monetary policies,'' he said, ''and I want us to have a monetary policy that suits our needs.''
Liz Alderman contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Don't Know Much About History

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS. 
Bob Herbert is off today.

 BODY:
Is Michele Bachmann the new Sarah Palin?
And do we really need a new Sarah Palin? Shouldn't the first one be made to go away before we start considering replacements?
Bachmann, the superconservative member of Congress from Minnesota, made a big splash on Tuesday night with her Tea Party response to the State of the Union address. True, the placement of the cameras made her look as if she was talking to an invisible friend, and her eye makeup had a peculiar zombie aspect to it. But the next day all the attention was on her and not the official Republican response by Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman.
And the Republicans were afraid to complain! One congressman from Utah told Politico that he thought ''to try to upend Paul Ryan was just wrong.'' Hours later he issued a retraction -- through Bachmann's office. 
On one level, Bachmann is just a third-term representative who only gets attention whenever she does something newsworthy, like claiming the Constitution says she doesn't have to tell a census taker anything but how many people live in her home. She was passed over in a try for a minor post in House leadership.
Yet, at her invitation, Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court came trotting over to the Capitol to lecture the House freshmen this week about the true meaning of the Constitution. And she makes the leaders who snubbed her quake with terror. What if she rallies her fellow Tea Partiers into a rebellion over, say, raising the debt limit, and the economy collapses?
She does have a history of single-mindedness. Back when Bachmann was a state senator in Minnesota, her colleagues complained that they couldn't get a budget done because she insisted on bringing everything to a screeching halt to argue about same-sex marriage. It was a controversy marked by her usual flair. ''In 2005, she claimed to have been held against her will in a restaurant bathroom by two critics of an amendment banning same-sex marriage; they said they'd merely buttonholed her to talk,'' reported The Minneapolis Star Tribune in a profile. ''Then foes claimed that Bachmann hid behind some bushes to spy on a gay-rights rally; she said she was merely checking the turnout.''
Bushes aside, Bachmann is a much more serious person than Palin, whose response to the State of the Union address was to focus on the title, ''Winning the Future.'' (''There were a lot of W.T.F. moments throughout that speech.'') If Palin and Bachmann were your co-workers, Palin would be the one sneaking out early to go bowling, while Bachmann would stay late to reorganize the office seating chart to reflect her own personal opinion of who most deserves to be near the water cooler.
History is superimportant to Bachmann, who claims that she left the Democratic Party when she was a college senior, after reading ''Burr,'' Gore Vidal's caustic historical novel. ''He was kind of mocking the founding fathers, and I just thought 'what a snot,' '' Bachmann told The Star Tribune. It was, she said, a transformational moment so critical to her worldview that she can still remember what she was wearing. (''A tan trench coat, blue pin-striped shirt, like a tailored shirt, and dress slacks.'')
It's not everybody who switches political parties over a historical novel, but Bachmann's vision of the past is the core to her ideology. The men who created the Constitution were perfect heroes, so infallible that they fully understood the right to bear arms would someday include semiautomatic pistols capable of firing 30 bullets in 10 seconds.
Last week, Bachmann was in Iowa, setting off alarm bells about her possible presidential ambitions and delivering a speech in which she claimed that the founding fathers had ''worked tirelessly'' to eradicate slavery. She then cited John Quincy Adams, who was not a founding father.
Bachmann is not a zealous fact-checker, as we learned when she claimed the president's trip to India would cost the taxpayers $200 million a day, based on an Indian newspaper report quoting an unnamed provincial official. In the real world, many founders, like Thomas Jefferson, expressed reservations about slavery but still kept hundreds of slaves, who were the basis of their personal wealth. Others, like John Adams, never owned slaves and opposed the institution but compromised on the matter of all men actually being created equal in order to bring the southern states into the union. And not a single one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence envisioned in any way, shape or form a democracy in which people of Michele Bachmann's gender would sit in the halls of Congress.
But Bachmann was speaking to the lore of the far right, which strips the founding fathers of their raw, fallible humanity and ignores the fact that, in some ways, we're wiser.
Maybe she'll make Sarah Palin look good.

HEADLINE: Emanuel, Back in the Race, Is Also Back on the Trail

BYLINE: By EMMA GRAVES FITZSIMMONS

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- The candidates for mayor of Chicago were back on the campaign trail on Friday, arguing about tax policy, a day after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, could be included on the ballot.
With early voting starting here on Monday, the six candidates have limited time to make their appeal to voters now that the controversy over Mr. Emanuel's Chicago residency has been resolved. 
One candidate, Gery Chico, held a news conference at a South Side barbershop to criticize Mr. Emanuel's sales tax proposals. Without mentioning the other hopefuls, Mr. Chico, a former chief of staff to Richard M. Daley, the departing mayor, took aim at Mr. Emanuel, calling his idea to tax some luxury goods ''dangerous and harmful.''
Reporters asked Mr. Chico about a new Emanuel campaign advertisement featuring President Obama. In a speech at Mr. Emanuel's farewell news conference last fall at the White House, when Mr. Emanuel was about to return to Chicago, the president said that he considered him a ''great friend'' and ''selfless public servant.''
The ad also employs a quotation from the president's farewell to Mr. Emanuel that offers voters an explanation for his absence from Chicago: ''There was no candidate for the job of chief of staff who would meet the bill as well as Rahm Emanuel,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's why I told him he had no choice in the matter. He was not allowed to say no.''
At his news conference in the narrow barbershop, which was crammed with more than a dozen reporters, as well as three customers getting haircuts, Mr. Chico said that he, too, had received support from a prominent politician. ''Mayor Daley praised me a few days after the campaign started,'' he said.
Taking a serious, and combative, tone, Mr. Chico said that he had plenty of time to get his message out to voters before the election on Feb. 22.
In its ruling on Thursday, the Illinois Supreme Court found that Mr. Emanuel had not given up his residency status when he worked at the White House. Candidates for mayor are required by state law to have resided in Chicago for at least a year before an election.
The question of whether Mr. Emanuel's name would appear on the ballot consumed the race this week after the Illinois Appellate Court ruled Monday that Mr. Emanuel did not qualify to run.
Some voters at a coffee shop in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood said that the long legal battle had probably helped Mr. Emanuel. Bruce Williams, 42, who is unemployed and was there Friday afternoon studying for a course he is taking, said that the residency issue had benefited Mr. Emanuel, who has been seen as the front-runner.
''It might have made a candidate with a $10 million war chest perhaps look a little sympathetic,'' Mr. Williams said.
Tom Haverly, an Episcopal priest, agreed. ''Now he doesn't look like this unstoppable force,'' he said.
Mr. Haverly said that he was glad Mr. Emanuel had been allowed on the ballot, but that he still had not decided which candidate to support. ''Earlier, there were too many candidates,'' he said. ''Now I've got time to look at where they stand on the issues.''
Across town, on the North Side, Mr. Emanuel held a meeting at a gay community center in the morning and greeted voters at fire stations and train stops. His campaign had more events planned for the weekend, including a fund-raising concert on Sunday by Jeff Tweedy, a member of the Chicago band Wilco.

HEADLINE: Obama Cautions Embattled Egyptian Ally Against Violent Repression

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Helene Cooper and Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Friday put Egypt's embattled leader, Hosni Mubarak, on notice that he should not use his soldiers and the police in a bloody crackdown on the protests in Egypt, edging away from a close American ally whose cities have erupted in protest.
Addressing the nation from the White House after a day of rage across Egypt, Mr. Obama said he called Mr. Mubarak and told him ''to refrain from any violence against peaceful protesters'' and to turn a ''moment of volatility'' into a ''moment of promise.'' Declaring that the protesters have universal rights, he said, ''The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people.'' 
Mr. Obama's brief remarks came as a blunt reply to Mr. Mubarak, who spoke to his own people just one hour before and mixed conciliation with defiance as he dismissed his government but vowed to stay in office to stabilize Egypt.
Faced with images of riot police officers using tear gas and water cannons against protesters, the Obama administration has moved from tentative support to distancing itself from Mr. Mubarak, its staunchest Arab ally, saying it would review $1.5 billion in American aid and warning him that he must confront the grievances of his people.
Mr. Obama noted that in Mr. Mubarak's speech, he promised to expand democracy and economic opportunity. ''He has a responsibility to give meaning to those words,'' Mr. Obama said. He called on Mr. Mubarak to open a dialogue with the demonstrators, though he did not go as far as to urge free and fair elections.
Illustrating the delicate balance that the administration faces with Egypt, Mr. Obama referred to the joint projects of the two countries. He also urged the demonstrators to ''express themselves peacefully.''
But the firmness of the president's comments signaled that the crisis in Egypt had passed a ''critical turning point,'' in the words of one senior American official. Regardless of whether Mr. Mubarak survives, this official said, the upheaval has already transformed Egyptian politics and how the United States will handle a leader long seen as a stable anchor in a turbulent region.
The announcement that the administration would review its aid was the first tangible sign that the United States was keeping Mr. Mubarak at arm's length. The White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, declined to give details about the review, except to say that the American ''assistance posture'' would depend on events ''now, and in the coming days.''
Egypt is the fourth-largest recipient of American foreign aid, after Afghanistan, Pakistan and Israel, and just ahead of Iraq. It is a critical partner on issues like the Israel-Palestinian peace process and a bulwark against Islamic extremism in the Arab world. The administration has also relied on Egypt to give an Arab stamp of approval to Iraq's fledgling government.
The mushrooming protests confront the administration with one of the most nettlesome foreign policy dilemmas it has faced, forcing it to abandon the careful balance that Mr. Obama and his predecessors have struck between supporting the democratic aspirations of the Egyptian people while reaffirming ties with Mr. Mubarak. This same calculation has governed American dealings with other Arab allies led by entrenched autocratic rulers, notably Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
In each case, the overriding concern is that the same people who are clamoring for change could choose leaders who are hostile to the United States, or are even extremists.
Still, standing by Mr. Mubarak for fear of what could come after him could lead to ''resentment towards the United States that could last another three decades, like Iran,'' said Martin S. Indyk, a Middle East peace negotiator in the Clinton administration. Laying out the American dilemma, Mr. Indyk said, ''If we don't back Mubarak and the regime falls, and the Muslim Brotherhood takes control of Egypt and breaks the peace treaty with Israel, then it could have dramatic negative ramifications for American interests in the Middle East.''
The administration also reacted sharply to the Egyptian government's extraordinary move to shut down the Internet, social networking Web sites, texting and other wireless communications. Mr. Obama called on the government to reverse the steps, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described as ''unprecedented.''
American officials tried to call the Egyptian Ministry of Communications for an explanation on Friday, but they were unable to reach anyone on a landline phone, said a senior administration official.
At the White House on Friday afternoon, Mr. Obama dropped in on a meeting of his top national security advisers in the Situation Room. The group included Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mrs. Clinton and Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser. During that session, Mr. Obama decided to call Mr. Mubarak and address the American people.
Also on Friday, the State Department issued a travel alert, warning American citizens to avoid going to Egypt, or if there, to stay in one place.
Officials from the Pentagon were consulting with their Egyptian military counterparts, Mr. Gibbs said. The role of the military, officials said, was most likely to be decisive in the coming days -- in particular, if the protests continue and the government orders soldiers to open fire on civilians.
Senior Egyptian military commanders cut short a visit to the Pentagon on Friday and were headed to Cairo as the Egyptian Army was deployed to put down protests in the country's streets, American military officials said.
The chief of staff of Egypt's armed forces, Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan, was due to meet this Monday with Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and remain with his delegation in Washington through next Wednesday. But as the protests intensified on Friday, he and his group headed for the airport.
On Thursday, Mr. Biden said he did not consider Mr. Mubarak a ''dictator'' and stopped short of calling him to step down. He said the Egyptian government should respond to demands that are ''legitimate,'' drawing criticism from those who said he was calling their legitimacy into question.
On Friday evening, Mr. Obama avoided the question of whether Mr. Mubarak needed to go. ''Ultimately,'' he said, ''the future of Egypt will be decided by the Egyptian people.''

HEADLINE: For Governors of Both Parties, Medicaid Looks Ripe to Slash

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Hamstrung by federal prohibitions against lowering Medicaid eligibility, governors from both parties are exercising their remaining options in proposing bone-deep cuts to the program during the fourth consecutive year of brutal economic conditions.
Because states confront budget gaps estimated at $125 billion, few essential services -- schools, roads, parks -- are likely to escape the ax. But the election of tough-minded governors, the evaporation of federal aid, the relentless growth of Medicaid rolls and the exhaustion of alternatives have made the program, which primarily covers low-income children and disabled adults, an outsize target.
In Arizona, which last year ended Medicaid payments for some organ transplants, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, is asking the Obama administration to waive a provision of the new health care law so that the state can remove 280,000 adults from the program's rolls. In California, the newly elected governor, Jerry Brown, a Democrat, proposes cutting Medicaid by $1.7 billion, in part by limiting the beneficiaries to 10 doctor visits a year and six prescriptions a month.
In the budget he will unveil on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is expected to propose cutting even more -- at least $2 billion from projected state spending on Medicaid, which totaled about $14 billion this year. 
And Gov. Nathan Deal, the new Republican leader of Georgia, proposed this month to end Medicaid coverage of dental, vision and podiatry treatments for adults. South Carolina is considering going a step further by also eliminating hospice care.
The governors are taking little joy in their proposals. And many of them, particularly the Republicans, are complaining about provisions of last year's health care overhaul, and of the stimulus package before it, that require the states to maintain eligibility levels in order to keep their federal Medicaid dollars.
''Please know that I understand fully the impacts of this rollback, and it is with a heavy heart that I make this request,'' Ms. Brewer wrote this week in seeking a waiver, the first of its kind, from Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. ''However, I am left with no other viable alternative.''
The shrinking of Medicaid programs, if approved by the state legislatures, would come at a tenuous moment for the Obama administration. Starting in 2014, the health care law calls for an enormous expansion of Medicaid eligibility that is expected to add 16 million beneficiaries by 2019.
Some states are now cutting benefits like prescription drugs and mental health treatment that will be required then. The federal government will cover the entire cost of the expansion through 2016, when states must gradually pick up a share, peaking at 10 percent in 2020 and remaining there.
Governors have known that this precipice was near for close to two years.
Medicaid, which covered 48.5 million people in 2009, up 8 percent in a year, is a joint state and federal program. The federal government provides the lion's share of the money and sets minimum standards for eligibility and benefits that states may exceed if they wish.
In 2009, Congress provided about $90 billion for states in the stimulus package to offset the cost of surging Medicaid rolls. Last August, it extended the aid at a reduced level, adding $15 billion over six months. The relief raised the federal share to between 65 percent and 82 percent, depending on the state, up from between 50 percent and 75 percent.
While that money is widely credited with staving off catastrophe, deficits were so deep that 39 states cut Medicaid payments to providers in 2010, and 20 states pared benefits, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
On July 1, the enhanced federal aid will disappear, causing an overnight increase of between one-fourth and one-third in each state's share of Medicaid's costs. But because of the federal eligibility restrictions, the options for states are largely limited to cutting benefits that are not federally required; reducing payments to doctors, hospitals and nursing homes; and raising taxes on those providers.
''States have already cut payments to health care providers and scaled back benefits over the last few years, so these new proposed cuts are much more painful,'' said Edwin Park, a health expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group.
A number of states, Texas and California among them, are considering further reductions of as much as 10 percent in payments to providers. Medicaid reimbursement is already so low that many physicians refuse to accept the coverage.
Several states also plan to raise co-payments for beneficiaries. And a number of governors, notably Rick Scott in Florida, are considering vast expansions of managed care plans in an attempt to control costs.
Mr. Brown's proposed cap on doctors' visits in California would affect only 10 percent of Medicaid recipients, said Toby Douglas, the state's Medicaid director. But many of them would be among the sickest beneficiaries. Mr. Brown also has suggested eliminating an adult day care program that serves 27,000 people who might otherwise end up in nursing homes.
''We are having to make proposals that are not the best choices for our most vulnerable beneficiaries,'' Mr. Douglas said. ''But given our limited resources, they are the best choices for the State of California.''
Lawmakers in a few states have discussed withdrawing from Medicaid, although Texas officials recently concluded that the loss of federal matching dollars would make it impractical. In at least one state, Minnesota, officials are expanding Medicaid eligibility to some childless adults before 2014, largely to win federal dollars for coverage that was being provided by the state.
Arizona's waiver request will be a test of the new health care law's flexibility, and of the White House's disposition. Other states are watching. Twenty-nine Republican governors wrote Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders this month to urge repeal of the prohibition, which they called ''unconscionable.''
Jessica Santillo, a spokeswoman for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency would not comment on Arizona's pending request or the administration's approach to waivers. ''We want to continue our close partnership with the states and our nation's governors,'' she said.
Arizona is asking to remove 250,000 childless adults and 30,000 parents from Medicaid. They were granted eligibility by a 2000 referendum that made Arizona one of the few states to cover low-income childless adults.
The expansion was financed with proceeds from cigarette taxes and a tobacco lawsuit, but that money became insufficient in 2004. The state's general fund has been making up the difference ever since. Eliminating the coverage would save $541 million, closing nearly half of the budget gap for the coming year.
In her letter to Ms. Sebelius, Ms. Brewer noted that Medicaid consumed 30 percent of her state's general fund, up from 17 percent in 2007. And she emphasized that Arizona's coverage was more generous than that in most states, a pointed reference to Kansas, where Ms. Sebelius was governor until two years ago.

HEADLINE: Boosting America, in Her Own Fashion

BYLINE: By KATE BETTS. 
Kate Betts is the author of the forthcoming ''Everyday Icon: , Michelle Obama and the Power of Style.''

 BODY:
THERE'S the State of the Union address, and then there's the State of the Union dress. Does anyone care if the president wore a suit by the presidential tailor Georges de Paris on Tuesday night? Of course not. His speech, and issues like job creation, tax cuts, climate change and gun control, are more pressing than his fashion choices.
But let's be honest, many of us want to discuss the first lady's dress, too: Did it fit well? Was the color right? Why didn't she wear a belt? Whether she likes it or not, her message of optimism and inclusiveness is often transmitted through her appearance. Many of her predecessors put their political and social causes first: Lady Bird Johnson kept America beautiful, Nancy Reagan just said no, Hillary Clinton pushed for health care. Michelle Obama herself fights against childhood obesity. But more than any first lady since Jacqueline Kennedy, she also captures our attention with her fashion. 
As a result, everyone becomes a fashion critic when Mrs. Obama makes an appearance in the House of Representatives chamber or on the North Portico steps. The fashion commentary follows her even on less formal occasions, as when she strides across the South Lawn or steps off Air Force One. Beige leggings? Hiking shorts? Bare feet? Every body part and frock elicits an opinion.
Just last week her choice to wear a British-designed red organza dress for the state dinner honoring Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, caused a furor among fashion industry leaders. Oscar de la Renta, Diane von Furstenberg and the Council of Fashion Designers of America all weighed in, saying they were a little disappointed with the first lady for not supporting the American garment industry. In Women's Wear Daily, Bridget Foley wrote, ''To wear something other than American at this particular trade-centric mega-fete embarrasses a major U.S. industry that continues to need all the help it can get.''
Perhaps they are missing the point.
Michelle Obama's impact on fashion extends far beyond the ''made in America'' label stitched into her dress. The optimism, glamour and accessibility that she communicates through her style of dressing transcends cultural borders and economic boundaries. Yes, she is sometimes an ambassador for American designers, but more important, she is an ambassador for the self-possession that defines American style.
Maybe she chose not to promote a specific American brand at the state dinner last week, but she certainly promotes a healthy sense of enjoyment and individuality in fashion. With her brio and idiosyncratic clothing choices, Mrs. Obama has rewritten the dress code for women who work. We wear cardigans now instead of always jackets, flats instead of impossibly high platform heels. We have a little fun with fashion, even to the point of being more frivolous.
And, most important, we dress for ourselves, something the first lady does so effortlessly it's hard to imagine that there had ever been any dress code for her position. With her floral prints and hula hoops, she's not afraid to flaunt her femininity -- so why should the rest of us be?
No matter what hopes we pin on her husband, or disappointments we suffer, Americans look to Michelle Obama to set the emotional tone of his administration. As we are with all first ladies, we are subconsciously invested in her looking good -- it's almost as if there's some sort of national pride at stake. But her decision to wear an American-designed dress doesn't make it easier for American designers to sell more clothes in the Chinese market.
After all the discussion of the red dress at the state dinner, Mrs. Obama stepped into the House chamber on Tuesday for the State of the Union address in a silvery-white sheath by the American designer Rachel Roy. Its color and simplicity signaled fresh beginnings -- as did that inaugural gown she wore in January two years ago. For this there was not so much criticism. Only a lot of American women silently thinking about where they might find a simple, pale sheath dress.
Correction: February 3, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Op-Ed article on Saturday, about Michelle Obama's style, misspelled the name of a Washington tailor. He is Georges de Paris, not George des Paris.

HEADLINE: Hard-Knock (Hardly Acknowledged) Life

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
President Obama made history on Tuesday.
It was only the second time since Harry S. Truman's State of the Union address in 1948 that such a speech by a Democratic president did not include a single mention of poverty or the plight of the poor.
The closest Obama got to a mention was his confirmation for ''Americans who've seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear'' that, indeed, ''the world has changed. The competition for jobs is real.'' I'm sure they appreciated that. 
The only other Democrat not to mention poverty in the speech was Jimmy Carter in 1980, but even he was able to squeeze in one reference to at least a portion of the poor and disenfranchised, stressing the continuation of jobs programs to ''provide training and work for our young people, especially minority youth.'' (Carter did mention the poor in a written version that he submitted to Congress.)
John F. Kennedy didn't say the specific words ''poor'' or ''poverty'' in his first State of the Union, but he talked at length about providing ''more food for the families of the unemployed, and to aid their needy children,'' securing ''more purchasing power for our lowest-paid workers by raising and expanding the minimum wage'' and of a new housing program to address the problem of ''cities being engulfed in squalor.''
So how is it that this Democratic president has the temerity to deliver a State of the Union address that completely neglects any explicit mention of the calamitous conditions now afflicting his staunchest supporters: the poor?
(In 2008, Obama won 73 percent of the vote of those earning less than $15,000 a year, 60 percent of those earning between $15,000 and $30,000 and 55 percent of the vote of those earning $30,000 to $50,000. Those were his widest margins of victory of any income group and helped to propel him to victory.)
He talked at length about education (the most inspiring part of the speech) and about civility and his repackaged bromides of global competitiveness and investments in the future. And, of course, there were cautious mentions of programs that benefit seniors and the need to protect and secure them. Can't forget the plea to the old people.
Protecting programs for seniors strikes the right chord morally and politically, but the data show that seniors are not the ones feeling the majority of the pain these days.
According to data from the Census Bureau, the percent of people ages 18 to 64 who were living in poverty in 2009 was higher than it had been in any year since 1959, while the percent of seniors living in poverty was lower than it had been in any year since at least 1959.
(By the way, voters over 65 were the only age group that Obama lost in 2008.)
I, for one, refuse to believe that this is an either-or proposition. We can make smart choices about protecting seniors and supporting younger Americans in need at the same time. We don't have to ignore the Annies among us to court the Miss Daisys.
For the poor, this is the Obama Conundrum. He was obviously the best choice in 2008. And judging by the current cast of Republican presidential contenders, he could well be the best choice in 2012. But does that give him license to obviate his moral responsibility to his electoral devotees? Can and should they take his snubs as a necessary consequence of political warfare as he makes every effort to tack back to the middle and reconnect with those whose opinion of him vacillates between contempt on a bad day and sufferance on a good one? Does keeping him in the White House dictate keeping them in the shadows?
And things could get even worse for the poor if the president feels the need to cut too many deals with the new Republican-led House in order to appear more centrist.
According to Brian Miller, the executive director of the nonpartisan and Boston-based group United for a Fair Economy and co-author of the group's report entitled ''State of the Dream 2011: Austerity for Whom?'' released earlier this month, ''austerity measures based on the conservative tenets of less government and lower taxes will ratchet down the standard of living for all Americans, while simultaneously widening our nation's racial and economic divide.''
As Miller put it, deficits that tax cuts for the rich helped to create ''are being used to justify a host of austerity measures that will harm Americans of all races but will hit blacks and Latinos the hardest.''
According to Miller, ''With 42 percent of blacks and 37 percent of Latinos lacking the funds to meet minimal household expenses for even three months should they become unemployed, cutting public assistance programs will have devastating impacts on black and Latino workers.''
(Obama won 95 percent of the black vote and 67 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2008.)
Even as my respect for this president as a shrewd politician has begun to rebound, my faith in him as a fervent crusader for the poor and disenfranchised has taken yet another nose dive. One's tone-deafness -- or blatant indifference -- to the poor has to be at Black American Express status to brag that ''the stock market has come roaring back'' and ''corporate profits are up'' and not even mention the unemployment rate or the continuing foreclosure crisis.
I want to believe that President Obama's speech omissions were oversights, not acts of arrogance. But I'm not sure.
President Truman wrote in 1953 that, ''ultimately, no President can master his responsibilities, save as his fellow citizens -- indeed, the whole people -- comprehend the challenge of our times and move, with him, to meet it.'' But, it is sometimes hard to follow -- indeed, to chase -- a president who appears to be moving, often at a full sprint, away from the people who once carried him.

HEADLINE: Washington and Mr. Mubarak

 BODY:
Both President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, in power for three decades, and Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen, in power for 23 years, should have seen this coming. They didn't -- or didn't care. Both countries share similar pressures: huge numbers of young people without jobs, growing outrage over abusive security forces, corrupt leaders, repressive political systems.
Their people are right to demand more from their governments. The status quo is unsustainable and the result, perhaps inevitable, has been an explosion of protests and rioting in the streets of both countries. 
Egypt, with Mr. Mubarak in charge, is an American ally and a recipient of nearly $1.5 billion in aid annually. It is the biggest country in the Arab world and was the first to make peace with Israel. Yemen is home to a dangerous Al Qaeda affiliate and has given the United States pretty much free rein to go after the extremists.
All of which leaves Washington in a quandary, trying to balance national security concerns and its moral responsibility to stand with those who have the courage to oppose authoritarian rulers. American officials must already be wondering what will happen to the fight against Al Qaeda if Mr. Saleh is deposed. And what will happen to efforts to counter Iran and promote Arab-Israeli peace if Mr. Mubarak is suddenly gone?
We won't try to game Yemen's politics. Even in Egypt, it's impossible to know who might succeed Mr. Mubarak. He has made sure that there is no loyal opposition and little in the way of democratic institutions.
In the past, Washington has often pulled its punches on human rights and democracy to protect unholy security alliances with dictators, like Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. There came a time when it was obvious that the Marcos tie was damaging American security interests and President Ronald Reagan -- along with a people power revolution -- played a role in easing him peacefully out of power.
Whether that point comes with Mr. Mubarak is now up to him. So far, he has shown arrogance and tone-deafness. He has met the spiraling protests with spiraling levels of force and repression. On Friday, in a sign more of weakness than strength, the government shut down Internet access and cellphone service. The protestors were undeterred.
Early Saturday, Mr. Mubarak ordered all of his ministers to resign and said his new government would accelerate reforms. He would be far more persuasive if he lifted the communications blackout, reeled in his security forces, allowed credible candidates to compete for president this year, and ensured a free and fair election.
Cables released by WikiLeaks show that the Obama administration has been privately pushing Mr. Mubarak to wake up, release jailed dissidents and pursue reforms. Unfortunately, those private exhortations did not get very far.
The administration struggled to get its public message right this week. On Thursday, it made clear that while Mr. Mubarak is a valuable ally, it is not taking sides but is trying to work with both the government and the protesters. By Friday, the White House said it was ready to ''review'' aid to Egypt -- after Mr. Mubarak cut most communications, called out the army and effectively put Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading opposition figure and former leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency, under house arrest.
Mr. Obama will have to be willing to actually cut that aid if Mr. Mubarak turns the protests into a bloodbath and fails to open up Egypt's political system.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Is Missing Bottom Line

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
There was something almost comical about the way the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission released its report on Thursday morning.
About a week ago, reporters were told they would get a sneak preview of the report the morning of its release. The location was undisclosed. Over the next few days, further details emerged. Washington-based reporters were directed to a building at George Washington University; for those of us in New York, the offices of PublicAffairs, which was publishing the report as a paperback book, would serve as our safehouse. The doors would open at 7:20 a.m., we were instructed, but the report was embargoed until 10 a.m., when the Democratic commissioners would officially unveil it at a press conference.
I got to PublicAffairs a little after 7:30, where I was handed a nondisclosure form and asked to turn in my cellphone. Then my minders gave me a thick, 545-page paperback -- the report! -- and I joined four other journalists in a small conference room, where I poured myself some coffee and turned on my laptop to take notes. It goes without saying that Internet access was blocked. 
Never mind that earlier in the week, Sewell Chan of The New York Times had reviewed the report for a front-page article that laid out many of the commission's conclusions. Or that Peter Wallison, the American Enterprise Institute scholar and the fourth Republican F.C.I.C. commissioner, had already released his own, one-man dissent -- a lonely, loony cri de coeur that placed the blame for the financial crisis entirely on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and federal home ownership policies, a position so contrary to the facts that even his fellow Republican commissioners did not agree with him.
Silly though the secrecy was, it was easy to understand how the commissioners might get a little carried away. They had spent nearly a year and a half immersed in the financial crisis, trying to tickle out its causes. They had interviewed 700 witnesses and reviewed countless documents. They felt they had something important to say. A little cloak and dagger might give the release some extra P.R. oomph.
But it didn't take long to realize that this was hardly the financial equivalent of the WikiLeaks cables. The F.C.I.C. report has its strengths -- and its weaknesses. It adds color to the fraudulent actions, regulatory missteps and Wall Street mendacity that we've long known about. What it doesn't do, though, is propose a satisfying theory that explains why so many people did so many wrong, and wrong-headed, things in the years leading up to the financial crisis.
Partly, I wound up thinking, it's because the events of September 2008 are still too raw and recent; truly, it will be decades before we can achieve anything approaching real perspective. But there is a second reason as well: the ''why'' is so obvious that it remains hidden in plain sight.
First, the strengths of the report. ''There is a great deal of new depth to many of the events that people know about,'' said Phil Angelides, the chairman of the commission, when I spoke to him late Thursday. He's right about that. The commission's investigators made good use of all those documents they gathered. It is not news that Angelo Mozilo of Countrywide sometimes worried about his company's dive into subprime mortgages; what is news is that as early as 2004, he was predicting that ''the unprecedented stretching of all aspects of credit standards could cause a bump in the road that could bring with it catastrophic consequences,'' according to a Mozilo e-mail released by the F.C.I.C.
The commission report does a nice job analyzing one synthetic collateralized debt obligation, as a way to represent all the problems caused by these financial Frankenstein monsters. (It also makes the point -- of which I have long been convinced -- that synthetic C.D.O.'s both extended and amplified the crisis, because they made it possible for Wall Street to bet on particularly toxic tranches of mortgage-backed securities over and over again.)
The commission's analysis of the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- a hotly contested battleground -- is utterly persuasive. You may recall a few months ago, when I scoffed at Mr. Wallison's contention that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were ground zero for the financial crisis, he told me that he had seen internal documents that would prove him right. His dissent does not deliver the goods. Instead, it is the report itself that is chock-a-block with internal documents conclusively showing that the two government-sponsored entities followed Wall Street and the subprime companies off the cliff, rather than the other way around.
The F.C.I.C. is the first to take a close look at the missteps at Citigroup, which virtually every book about the financial crisis has overlooked. It is a devastating portrait of negligence at the top -- including the once sainted Robert Rubin. It homes in on the unconscionable willingness of federal regulators to look the other way at destructive subprime lending practices. It digs into A.I.G., Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Moody's, the Federal Reserve, Countrywide, Ameriquest and others. It's a very long list.
Which is also one of its key weaknesses: the report has a kitchen sink quality that actually detracts from our ability to truly understand why the crisis took place. In their joint dissent, the three Republican commissioners complain that the report ''is more an account of bad events than a focused explanation of what happened and why. When everything is important, nothing is.'' The commission, they argue, could have done with less investigation and more analysis. Having plowed through all 545 pages, I'd have to say that they have a point.
The Republicans point out, for instance, that the abolition of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had separated commercial banking from Wall Street businesses like securities underwriting, really had nothing to do with the crisis, nor did derivatives not related to credit -- yet both are discussed in the report. They complain that fraud alone is an inadequate explanation for the rise of the subprime industry. They criticize the majority for being so narrowly focused on America -- which does little to explain why so many European nations, many of them with no subprime machinery, also had a housing bubble.
Yet the Republican 30,000-foot view of the crisis has its own drawback: it's so bloodless it's almost as if they are saying nobody is responsible for the bad things that took place in the years leading up to the crisis. When I spoke to Keith Hennessey, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and one of the co-authors of the Republican dissent, he told me that he and the other Republicans agreed with many of the investigative thrusts of the final reports. (It didn't help that the Republicans had only 27 pages to express their views, compared to the Democrats' 500-plus pages.)
The question, he said, wasn't whether there were bad actors or fraudulent practices -- ''of course there were, and they did awful things,'' he said -- but whether the particular actions of particular people had been the primary reasons for the financial crisis. ''If you take that view, then you are saying that the crisis was foreseeable and preventable. I think the real answer is: we don't know,'' Mr. Hennessey said. The inability of the Democrats and Republicans on the panel to agree on this question was one of the primary reasons the Republicans split from the Democratic majority and wrote a dissent.
At the press conference introducing the report, Mr. Angelides made no bones about where he stood on this question: ''This was an avoidable crisis,'' he said bluntly. As the report puts it, ''The crisis was the result of human action and inaction, not of Mother Nature or computer models gone haywire.'' If only regulators had been willing to regulate; if only Wall Street had done proper due diligence on the mortgages it was securitizing; if only subprime companies had acted more honorably; if only the credit ratings agencies had said ''no'' when asked to slap triple-A ratings on subprime junk. If only, if only, if only.
But I wonder. Had there been a Dutch Tulip Inquiry Commission nearly four centuries ago, it would no doubt have found tulip salesmen who fraudulently persuaded people to borrow money they could never pay back to buy tulips. It would have criticized the regulators who looked the other way at the sleazy practices of tulip growers. It would have found speculators trying to corner the tulip market. But centuries later, we all understand that the roots of tulipmania were less the actions of particular Dutchmen than the fact that the entire society was suffering under the delusion that tulip prices could only go up. That's what bubbles are: they're examples of mass delusions.
Was it really any different this time? In truth, it wasn't. To have so many people acting so foolishly required the same kind of delusion, only this time around, it was about housing prices. Getting to the bottom of that requires less the skills of an investigator than the talents of a psychologist.
There is a telling moment in the commission's report, when some A.I.G. executives are questioning whether they should stop insuring triple-A tranches of C.D.O.'s, which have become increasingly risky. In search of answers, they visit a housing analyst at Bear Stearns. One A.I.G. consultant later recalled that ''the analyst was so optimistic about the housing market that they thought he was 'out of his mind' and 'must be on drugs or something.' '' But of course he wasn't on drugs. His hallucinogen was the housing bubble.
In pushing the idea that the crisis was avoidable, Mr. Angelides is also trying to make an additional point: if we just do it better next time, we will avoid the next crisis. I'm all for holding the bad actors accountable, and to the extent the F.C.I.C. has done that, I tip my hat. But mass delusions, alas, are part of the human condition, and no report, no matter how scathing, is going to change that.
And thus the question really isn't whether it will happen again. It's when.

HEADLINE: A Lavish Lifestyle, and Now Renters, Too

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
THE William Beaver House, at the intersection of William and Beaver Streets in the financial district, is an eye-catching 47-story building, its facade flecked with panels of yellow brick that, architecturally speaking, give it the look of a taxicab amid a fleet of limousines.
Inside, the lavish amenities include a 40-seat screening room, a lap pool, a basketball court with stadium lighting, and a landscaped dog run. It also has a ''lifestyle manager,'' who bristles at the title ''concierge,'' which, she said she associated with polyester neckties, not the high-level services she provides for Beaver House residents. 
Now those residents will include not only owners, but also renters. In December, the CIM Group, a real estate investment company based in Los Angeles, stepped in to bail out Tamir Sapir, the Georgian emigre who developed the 320-unit building as a condominium.
As part of the $66 million deal, CIM took possession of the building's 209 unsold units. Almost immediately, the company made them available for rent. Tenants are being offered one-year leases, though the sales manager, Edward Azria of Rose Associates, said that a lease term of 18 or 24 months ''would be a negotiable item.''
The 209 rental units are scattered throughout the building; they include one-bedrooms starting at $3,200 a month and studios at $3,550. (The smaller units command higher prices because they are on higher floors, according to Mr. Azria.) There are also several two-bedrooms, starting at $4,800, and three-bedrooms, at $8,500.
Back in 2007 the developer, armed with a sexy marketing campaign, hoped to sell the units at prices ranging from $900,000 to well over $2 million. About 100 closings took place in 2008 and 2009, according to PropertyShark. But after the market took a nosedive, Mr. Sapir's company, the Sapir Organization, was reportedly unable to make payments on a $66 million loan. That's when CIM stepped in, paying off the loan to acquire the units for an average of just over $300,000 each.
The building was conceived by the hotelier Andre Balazs and aimed at the kind of young sybarites who stay in his hotels, including the Standard in Manhattan and the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. To design the building Mr. Balazs selected Calvin Tsao and Zack McKown, of Tsao & McKown Architects, known for the refined detailing of their homes for well-heeled clients like Meryl Streep and Mr. Balazs's sometime competitor Ian Schrager.
Tsao & McKown gave the bathrooms louvered doors that open to expose the tubs to the bedrooms (and, in many cases, to spectacular New York Harbor views). There are also large showers behind glass panels, where Tsao & McKown addressed a problem many other designers have ignored: a hole in the glass lets you reach the faucet -- adjusting temperature and pressure -- before you step into the shower.
Tsao & McKown also designed what Mr. Azria calls ''Murphy offices'' installed behind sliding closet doors, with woodwork as well crafted as anything on an oligarch's yacht. Equally refined are the ''Murphy kitchens,'' compact units of sleek cabinets and appliances, extremely handsome but with precious little work space. Mr. Tsao said: ''The bathrooms are bigger than the kitchens, but that's how people live. You come home from work not to cook a meal, but to decompress. It's the mise-en-scene of a contemporary life.''
Mr. Tsao, told that some units would be rented out, said potential tenants ''are lucky that, because of economic hardship, they can get something built'' at a time when developers were competing to create the most luxurious buildings. ''Rentals,'' he said, ''are never built to that standard.''
Still, not all the building's planned amenities have materialized. What was going to be a Dean & DeLuca store off the lobby is still a vacant space. (Mr. Mendel said CIM was seeking a ''first-class restaurant or food and beverage operator.'') Mr. Balazs also failed to win approval for a 195-space parking garage below the building. (CIM hopes to correct that, too.) And a conversation pit, on original lobby renderings, has yet to be installed. Mr. Tsao said the pit, ''constructed by a wonderful cabinetmaker that I found in China,'' was being stored, in pieces, in a warehouse in Long Island City. ''I hope they put it in,'' he said.

HEADLINE: THE BLOG; Seeking a Speed Record With Steam

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
On Tuesday, Cyclone Power Technologies of Pompano Beach, Fla., announced that it would attempt to break the land-speed record for an unlikely race class: steam cars.
A British team set the existing record of 148.308 miles per hour in 2009. The prior record holder? A 1906 Stanley Steamer. 
Spearheading the attempt is Chuk Williams, an engineer who has built a pair of steam-powered vehicles, including a dragster. Mr. Williams is building the chassis and body for the racecar, while Cyclone is supplying the engine.
The Cyclone unit, purpose-built as a power source for passenger cars, is described as a Rankine Cycle heat-regenerative external combustion engine and is the invention of Harry Schoell, Cyclone's chief executive. The engine can burn multiple fuels, even simultaneously, in its centrifugal combustion chamber, which heats water contained in coils to 1,200 degrees in as few as five seconds. A cam and valve system controls the flow of steam to six radial-configured cylinders. Steam escapes the cylinders through exhaust ports and then is cooled in a condenser before being returned to the engine's water reservoir.
According to Mr. Schoell, the Cyclone engine burns fuel at atmospheric pressure, so combustion temperatures are relatively low and NOx emissions are virtually zero. A long combustion time results in a complete burn and low emissions without after-treatment, and because the engine can burn 100 percent biofuel in a minimally refined state, the resulting carbon footprint is reportedly lower than that of an engine requiring heavily refined fuel.
''Our calculations show that we can break this record with our stock automotive engine,'' said Mr. Schoell in a telephone interview. The engine produces 850 pound-feet of torque on start-up and ultimately achieves 100 horsepower at 3,600 r.p.m., with 140 pound-feet of torque. ''We can turn higher r.p.m. levels at the same torque figure and will do so in the racecar,'' Mr. Schoell said.
''We look at this as a halo product for steam power,'' added Christopher Nelson, a Cyclone team member. ''We think it hasn't gotten a fair shake.''
The preproduction Cyclone engine is undergoing testing, and the body and frame are about two-thirds complete. Mr. Nelson said they hoped to begin testing the racecar in North Carolina this spring before tackling the record in August at Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

THE NEOCONSERVATIVE PERSUASION
Selected Essays, 1942-2009
By Irving Kristol
Edited by Gertrude Himmelfarb. Foreword by William Kristol.
390 pp. Basic Books. $29.95.
Irving Kristol, who died in 2009, is sometimes called the ''godfather'' or even ''father'' of neoconservatism, and the patriarchal honorific, like a well-worn hat, sits comfortably atop ''The Neoconservative Persuasion: Selected Essays, 1942-2009.'' The book is strictly a family enterprise. It has been lovingly edited by Kristol's widow, the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, and carries a prefatory funeral eulogy by their sorrowful son, the Republican journalist William Kristol. Even the selection of essays reflects a uniquely familial degree of intimacy. 
Himmelfarb recounts in her introduction that while ''rummaging among old files'' after her husband's death, she discovered tattered copies of a short-lived and wholly forgotten little magazine called Enquiry: A Journal of Independent Radical Thought. Her husband and some of his young friends founded the magazine in 1942, the year of her marriage, and they kept it afloat for eight issues, until the young friends and Kristol himself disappeared into the Army. Himmelfarb has reproduced the cover of Vol. 1, No. 1 -- austere, elegant, partly sans-serif in the 1940s style, 10 cents a copy -- and the sight of the magazine does conjure an era.
Kristol in 1942 was just two years out of New York's City College, working as a machinist in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and he still bore the marks of his student Trotskyism. Russian revolutionaries in the time of the czars used to adopt noms de guerre to outwit the police, and at City College in the 1930s, earnest young Trotskyists did the same. Irving Kristol renamed himself ''William Ferry'' (which, if I may add a detail, was an undergraduate in-joke aimed at one of American Trotskyism's adult leaders, who, not being a college man himself, was unable to pronounce correctly the word ''periphery''). And sure enough, at the foot of Enquiry's inaugural cover, you can see the name ''William Ferry'' listed as the author of a piece on W. H. Auden.
Himmelfarb has reprinted the essay. It is bristly with words like ''hypostasizing'' -- a commentary by a wisp of a lad who is trying in vain to appear as solid and august as Lionel Trilling, the literary critic. Still, the essay makes good reading, and this is precisely because young Kristol, in his boyish impressionability, was alive to the intellectual tremors of his own moment, which were huge.
Teenage Trotskyism, back in the '30s, had rested on a series of firm beliefs and alarming realities. The student rebels noticed that at home in America, capitalism had pretty much collapsed, which made free-market conservatism or any other kind of conservatism out of the question. Europe had absolutely collapsed. Communism and the Soviet Union advertised themselves as the answer to everything. The young Trotskyists knew too much about Stalin to believe any such thing. Trotskyism's big idea was to hold out for a better sort of revolutionary left, under the leadership of Leon Trotsky himself. This did not seem altogether impossible, for a while. Then the Spanish Civil War turned out badly. The Spanish left went down to defeat. In 1940 Trotsky was assassinated. And revolutionary leftism retreated from the zones of plausibility to the zone of mere speculation.
Kristol's essays in Enquiry magazine in the 1940s show that even so, he went on clinging to the speculative option, for a time. The philosopher Sidney Hook tried to persuade America's antiwar intellectuals to come out in favor of American participation in World War II, which meant giving up on ultra-left-wing recriminations and fantasies. Young Kristol, replying in one of the Enquiry essays reprinted here, instructed Hook that America was a force for imperialism and racism, engaged in ''a completely reactionary crusade'' against Japan. But Kristol himself seems to have recognized how ridiculous his sloganeering sounded.
Mostly in those early essays he showed a sophisticated comprehension of his own predicament, which was hopelessly complicated. Every single one of the grand certainties of the 1930s had disintegrated, which meant that for his own little circle of friends, a time of doubt had arrived. Unfortunately the '40s were also, as Hook explained, a time for war -- therefore no time to retreat into private rumination. Kristol understood this. ''The crisis in conscience is deep and enduring and any renewal of heart will have to accept it as a fellow-traveler,'' wrote ''William Ferry'' in his essay on Auden, sounding very mature indeed. ''On the other hand, to elevate doubt into a political program is distinctly impracticable.''
To be filled with gloomy doubt, and to go limping forward, even so, in search of practical solutions, perhaps even harboring some last shrunken hope for a better world, like a man cupping a match -- this was the animating inspiration of Kristol's generation of intellectuals in their postcollege years. They cultivated a spirit of ambivalence and modesty. They were alert to subtleties and nuances of life and the soul of a sort that might be addressed by literature, or even by a religious-minded literature, but not normally by politics.
Saul Bellow, five years older than Kristol, expressed the mood in ''Dangling Man,'' which describes a disillusioned young leftist in circumstances rather like Kristol's, except in Chicago instead of Brooklyn. Bellow's narrator says, ''This would probably be a condemned age. But . . . it might be a mistake to think of it in that way.'' Kristol's City College mates, Irving Howe and Daniel Bell, spent the 1950s writing books in the shadow of that same idea, discouraged but averse to despair -- Howe's ''Politics and the Novel''(on the corrosive effects of radical political movements on their own members, among other topics, as shown by Dostoyevsky and Hawthorne and other novelists), and Bell's ''Marxian Socialism in the United States''and ''The End of Ideology'' (on Marxism's failure to take the measure of the modern world), not to mention nearly everything else those men went on to write.
The essays by Kristol from the 1940s and '50s in this new, posthumous collection make me suppose that he, too, could have written a book like theirs, if he had set his mind to it. He took a philosophical interest in the mendacities and profundities of political rhetoric, and he took a historical interest in the American past, and it is easy to imagine that if he had allowed those interests to fertilize each other, his own 1940s inspiration might have blossomed eventually into something sturdier and more ambitious than a scattered set of slender magazine commentaries.
He did give book writing a try, but his patience gave out after three months. Then he decided, as he recounts in still another of the essays here, that his own talents pointed to editing and magazine writing. He and Bell founded another little magazine, The Public Interest, in 1965, which was designed to bring something of the 1940s skepticism, in a social science version, to questions of public policy in the United States. And the magazine prospered. Kristol was in good form. He wrote a pretty shrewd analysis of student leftism in that same year called ''What's Bugging the Students?'' from the standpoint of his own, by then middle-age generation.
Something happened to Kristol, though, or so it seems to me. Bell and Howe and some other people from that generation never did give up on their 1940s ambivalences -- even if the student rebellions of the '60s were aimed directly at them, which could not have been a pleasant experience. In Himmelfarb's interpretation, Kristol, too, faithfully clung to his earliest inspirations. ''The Neoconservative Persuasion'' persuades me otherwise. Kristol, to my eyes, looks a little like Norman Mailer, another 1940s personality who, in the course of the '60s, decided to shuck off his old thoughtfulness in favor of something new -- though of course Mailer, the hipster, defected to the counterculture, and Kristol, the square, took up the anti-counterculture.
Anti-counterculturalism relieved him of the burdens of uncertainty. ''The Quality of Doubt'' was the subtitle of his 1942 Auden essay. But the Irving Kristol who began to emerge in the 1970s exuded the quality of dogmatism, which he labeled ''conservative.'' Himmelfarb, in her introduction, cites with approval a Partisan Review commentary, included in the book, in which Kristol laid out several of his newly ''conservative'' dogmas. He wrote:
''I have reached certain conclusions: that Jane Austen is a greater novelist than Proust or Joyce; that Raphael is a greater painter than Picasso; that T. S. Eliot's later, Christian poetry is much superior to his earlier; that C. S. Lewis is a finer literary and cultural critic than Edmund Wilson; that Aristotle is more worthy of careful study than Marx; that we have more to learn from Tocqueville than from Max Weber; that Adam Smith makes a lot more economic sense than any economist since; that the Founders had a better understanding of democracy than any political scientists since; that . . . well, enough.''
Or more than enough. List making is fun at parties. But Kristol in that passage lays out, with a peremptory air, an orthodoxy, sometimes on reasonable grounds (not even Karl Marx would dispute that Aristotle outranks Marx), sometimes on questionable grounds (suppose you wanted to read about the events of Marx's lifetime -- what good would Aristotle do you, then?), but always emphatically.
nd, in this new spirit, he plunged into his magnum opus, which, instead of a book, was the constructing of something called ''neoconservatism.'' This was intended to be a new kind of political inspiration, different from the old-fashioned Main Street, balance-the-budget, isolationist conservatism of the past, and different from the right-wing radicalism of people who used to read books like ''The Income Tax: The Root of All Evil.'' Readers who want to unravel the mystery of Kristol's new idea will naturally turn to the title essay of the book, ''The Neoconservative Persuasion,'' from 2003, in which he summarizes his principles. These turn out to be, in his presentation: a cheerful zest for economic growth; a comfortable acceptance of the large modern state, inherited from Franklin Roosevelt; a worried fear of moral and cultural decline; and no particular doctrine on foreign affairs, apart from a conviction that America's power and prosperity require an active role in world events. (Conspiracy theorists will be disappointed. They will ask, where are the Judeo-Satanic hidden goals? -- and will go thumbing through Kristol's book in vain.)
The book contains almost 50 essays, though, and apart from the handful of writings from the 1940s, and another handful, mostly admirable, from his phase as a cold war liberal and incipient political philosopher in the '50s, the greatest number of those essays, if you put them together, add up to an extended tirade against American liberalism, which I think should figure as still another of neoconservatism's principles -- the largest and most energetic principle of all, judging by the evidence here. The tirade rested on two main inspirations, neither of which can be dismissed out of hand. Kristol repeatedly argued that American liberalism, in its domestic programs, has relied on a parched and narrow vision of human nature, which attributes too much importance to material conditions and not enough to moral and religious considerations.
His argument drew on the old 1940s instinct to look to literature and even to religion for insights -- to think about the soul, and not just about dollars and social structures. Thinking about some nonmaterial factors led, in the pages of The Public Interest, to shrewd criticisms of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and various faddish social reform projects of the big foundations. Then again, the habit of adverting to spiritual questions and the soul allowed Kristol, as the years advanced, to speak ever more warmly, though not always convincingly, about evangelical Christian movements as a preferable alternative to government-sponsored social reform.
Still, the largest of his inspirations was an insistent nostalgia for the America of his own youth -- even if, in the title essay, he explicitly repudiated anything of the sort. But who in the world of sophisticated thinkers does not repudiate nostalgia? And who does not end up yearning, even so, for various Golden Ages of yore? Kristol's yearnings were relentless, though. In his picture of American life, the virtues of long ago invariably seem more virtuous than the virtues of the present, and even the vices of the past turn out to be roguishly preferable to vices of more recent times.
America as a whole used to be more public spirited. In New York City, ''street crime was practically unheard of.'' Religious sermons used to be more challenging; trade unions less selfish; schools, untroubled. ''In general, the political handling of controversial religious and moral issues in the United States prior to World War II was a triumph of reasoned experience over abstract dogmatism'' -- a sentence from an essay provocatively called ''On the Political Stupidity of the Jews'' (whose stupidity consists, it would seem, of failing to agree with Kristol that life in America was better back in the days when anti-Semitism was still an acceptable prejudice).
On the side of vice, Las Vegas used to be more attractively seedy than it later became. And the arts have steadily declined, morally speaking, ever since the 19th century. (The superiority of T. S. Eliot's later poetry to his earlier poetry appears to be an anomaly.) ''The feminization of social policy'' has undermined the previously superior, ''masculine'' welfare state. The decline of Greek and Latin instruction seems to him catastrophic: ''Future historians may yet decide that one of the crucial events of our century, perhaps decisive for its cultural and political destiny, was the gradual dissolution and abandonment of the study of the classics as the core of the school curriculum.''
The passion that he brought to these arguments seems to have left him, at times, a little unhinged, such that, like a desperate man fending off a mob, he ends up hurling everything in sight at the hated liberals. In an essay called, slightly paranoically, '' 'Human Rights': The Hidden Agenda,'' from 1986-87, he presents the human rights movement as a cryptofriend of Communism, dedicated to weakening America -- from which you would never guess that, in 1989, the human rights movement's closest allies in Eastern Europe would end up leading the pro-American revolutions that overthrew Communism. Still another essay deplores ''the secular, social democratic'' notion of the welfare state in the 20th century, which, upon being put into effect, strikes him as potentially ''the saddest of political tragedies in our tragic century'' -- though he adds, by way of nuance (as if troubled by the absurdity of what he had just written), ''not the bloodiest, of course, but merely the saddest.''
There is sometimes a charm in Kristol's prose, once he had gotten past his pompous Lionel Trilling period -- a wry, man-of-the-people modesty, nicely joined with a genuine talent for summarizing ideas. Then again, he tried to capitalize on his Everyman sonority by claiming to speak on behalf of ''the majority of Americans'' or even ''the overwhelming majority of Americans,'' and sometimes ''the American people'' altogether, which, to my mind, undercuts the charm. In the course of an otherwise intelligent essay about Communism and McCarthyism as long ago as 1952, he wrote: ''For there is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy; he, like them, is unequivocally anti-Communist. About the spokesmen for American liberalism, they feel they know no such thing.''
The remark is one of Kristol's most famous, if only because his enemies have been quoting it back at him for almost 60 years. The habit of invoking the American people served him well, even so. Some of the more talented leaders of the Republican Party eventually cocked an ear in his direction, in search of oratorical and political and programmatic possibilities. And the alliance was formed.
Himmelfarb has thoughtfully filled ''The Neoconservative Persuasion'' with pieces that, with one exception, have not appeared in previous collections. The subtitle, ''Selected Essays,'' might lead readers to suppose that here must surely be Kristol's Greatest Hits -- the best and most popular of his essays. But Kristol himself gathered together his Greatest Hits in an anthology in 1995 called ''Neoconservatism: The Autobiography of an Idea.''
The new book ought to be regarded, instead, as a Volume 2. It is faithful to his ideas and their evolution. And it offers an opportunity to evaluate his abilities as an essayist -- his achievements as a thinker and writer within the little world known as the ''New York intellectuals.'' The achievements do not seem to me large. Kristol was not a Trilling, a Hook, a Howe or a Bell. For that matter, he never produced anything as substantial as his wife's scholarly meditations on English history.
But it is true that unlike any of those other talented people, Kristol, with his tirades and simplicities, helped found a political movement. And under the name of ''neoconservatism,'' his movement invigorated the party of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush and, for better and for worse, wreaked enormous changes on America and the world.

HEADLINE: Washington's Financial Disaster

BYLINE: By FRANK PARTNOY. 
Frank Partnoy is a law professor at the University of San Diego and the author of ''The Match King: Ivar Kreuger, the Financial Genius Behind a Century of Wall Street Scandals.''

 BODY:
San Diego
THE long-awaited Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report, finally published on Thursday, was supposed to be the economic equivalent of the 9/11 commission report. But instead of a lucid narrative explaining what happened when the economy imploded in 2008, why, and who was to blame, the report is a confusing and contradictory mess, part rehash, part mishmash, as impenetrable as the collateralized debt obligations at the core of the crisis.
The main reason so much time, money and ink were wasted -- politics -- is apparent just from eyeballing the report, or really the three reports. There is a 410-page volume signed by the commission's six Democrats, a leaner 10-pronged dissent from three of the four Republicans, and a nearly 100-page dissent-from-the-dissent filed by Peter J. Wallison, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The primary volume contains familiar vignettes on topics like deregulation, excess pay and poor risk management, and is infused with populist rhetoric and an anti-Wall Street tone. The dissent, which explores such root causes as the housing bubble and excess debt, is less lively. And then there is Mr. Wallison's screed against the government's subsidizing of mortgage loans. 
These documents resemble not an investigative trilogy but a left-leaning essay collection, a right-leaning PowerPoint presentation and a colorful far-right magazine. And the confusion only continued during a press conference on Thursday in which the commissioners had little to show and nothing to tell. There was certainly no Richard Feynman dipping an O ring in ice water to show how the space shuttle Challenger went down.
That we ended up with a political split is not entirely surprising, given the structure and composition of the commission. Congress shackled it by requiring bipartisan approval for subpoenas, yet also appointed strongly partisan figures. It was only a matter of time before the group fractured. When Republicans proposed removing the term ''Wall Street'' from the report, saying it was too pejorative and imprecise, the peace ended. And the public is still without a full factual account.
For example, most experts say credit ratings and derivatives were central to the crisis. Yet on these issues, the reports are like three blind men feeling different parts of an elephant. The Democrats focused on the credit rating agencies' conflicts of interest; the Republicans blamed investors for not looking beyond ratings. The Democrats stressed the dangers of deregulated shadow markets; the Republicans blamed contagion, the risk that the failure of one derivatives counterparty could cause the other banks to topple. Mr. Wallison played down both topics. None of these ideas is new. All are incomplete.
Another problem was the commission's sprawling, ambiguous mission. Congress required that it study 22 topics, but appropriated just $8 million for the job. The pressure to cover this wide turf was intense and led to infighting and resignations. The 19 hearings themselves were unfocused, more theater than investigation.
In the end, the commission was the opposite of Ferdinand Pecora's famous Congressional investigation in 1933. Pecora's 10-day inquisition of banking leaders was supposed to be this commission's exemplar. But Pecora, a former assistant district attorney from New York, was backed by new evidence of widespread fraud and insider dealings, shocking documents that the public had never seen or imagined. His fierce cross-examination of Charles E. Mitchell, the head of National City Bank, Citigroup's predecessor, put a face on the crisis.
This commission's investigation was spiritless and sometimes plain wrong. Richard Fuld, the former head of Lehman Brothers, was thrown softballs, like ''Can you talk a bit about the risk management practices at Lehman Brothers, and why you didn't see this coming?'' Other bankers were scolded, as when Phil Angelides, the commission's chairman, admonished Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, for practices akin to ''selling a car with faulty brakes and then buying an insurance policy on the buyer of those cars.'' But he couldn't back up this rebuke with new evidence.
The report then oversteps the facts in its demonization of Goldman, claiming that Goldman ''retained'' $2.9 billion of the A.I.G. bailout money as ''proprietary trades.'' Few dispute that Goldman, on behalf of its clients, took both sides of trades and benefited from the A.I.G. bailout. But a Goldman spokesman told me that the report's assertion was false and that these trades were neither proprietary nor a windfall. The commission's staff apparently didn't consider Goldman's losing trades with other clients, because they were focused only on deals with A.I.G. If they wanted to tar Mr. Blankfein, they should have gotten their facts right.
Lawmakers would have been wiser to listen to Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who in early 2009 proposed a bipartisan investigation by the banking committee. That way seasoned prosecutors could have issued subpoenas, cross-examined witnesses and developed cases. Instead, a few months later, Congress opted for this commission, the last act of which was to coyly recommend a few cases to prosecutors, who already have been accumulating evidence the commissioners have never seen.
There is still hope. Few people remember that the early investigations of the 1929 crash also failed due to political battles and ambiguous missions. Ferdinand Pecora was Congress's fourth chief counsel, not its first, and he did not complete his work until five years after the crisis. Congress should try again.

HEADLINE: Famed Ghosts And Their Diligent Keeper

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
LOOK toward the ceiling from your seat in the Kaufmann Concert Hall at the 92nd Street Y, and you encounter a roll call of heroic names, etched in gold on the walnut paneling along the top edges of the walls. David, Moses and Isaiah appear over the stage. To the right, Jefferson, Shakespeare, Dante, Goethe and Maimonides. To the left, Washington, Lincoln, Beethoven, Bach and Brahms. Behind you, Emerson, Einstein and Spinoza. The list is a constant reminder of the mission of the Y, which was founded in 1874 as a nonprofit Jewish community and cultural center.
But the institution also has a second pantheon, comprising Artur Schnabel, Andres Segovia, the Budapest String Quartet and other legendary musicians, who began to appear there in the 1930s: its ghosts, as Steven Isserlis, an English cellist who frequently performs at the Y, put it in his introduction to a guide to concert halls.
''You feel this sort of spirit,'' Mr. Isserlis said by telephone from London. ''It can happen quite quickly. In quite a new hall you can already get the feel of ghosts: the atmosphere of exciting concerts that have happened and the people who've played there. I feel that in the Y, and I love that. It's just a sense of history.'' 
Tending to the Y's ghosts, and to their living successors, has waxed and waned over the years. Since 2000, their care has been entrusted to Hanna Arie-Gaifman, who was appointed that year as the director of the Tisch Center for the Arts. Her mandate was to revitalize the Y's musical offerings, both classical and popular, while nurturing the health of its successful Unterberg Poetry Center.
Ms. Arie-Gaifman (pronounced AH-ree-eh-GAYF-mahn), now 61, was ideally qualified for that dual task. A pianist, scholar and administrator born in Czechoslovakia, she earned degrees in literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Stanford University, and held executive posts at the Czech Philharmonic, the Sandor Vegh Chamber Music Academy and the Musica Judaica Festival in Prague.
Erudite, quick-witted and insatiably curious, Ms. Arie-Gaifman, in a recent interview, cited what she viewed as the core values behind the Y's mission: ''enrichment, growth, enjoyment and what's called tikkun: improvement of the world.''
''And ultimately,'' she added, ''there is always the method of learning, which in Judaism is asking questions. It's the question answered which leads to another question.''
That tradition shapes her artistic planning, she said. ''If you want to program interestingly, you have to constantly question if what we're doing is the right thing.''
Evidence suggests that Ms. Arie-Gaifman has asked the right questions over the last decade as she put her stamp on the Y's offerings. Her dual expertise in music and literature helped to foster striking collaborations between musicians and writers, like a 2010 event shared by the pianist Andras Schiff and the author Peter Esterhazy.
The Y has become a valuable resource for underexposed ensembles like the Nash Ensemble and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and a home for strong personalities like the pianist and scholar Charles Rosen, the oboist Heinz Holliger and Mr. Isserlis, who regularly presents both illuminating recitals and engaging children's concerts based on his books for young readers.
''For me, it's sort of a New York version of the Wigmore Hall,'' Mr. Isserlis said, referring to the renowned London establishment. ''It's very different in many ways, but there's that sort of seriousness of programming. And I think the audiences are getting better and better.''
He cited the concert he gave with the pianist Jeremy Denk in December. Much of the program consisted of demanding modern works, including pieces by the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag.
''It's almost inaudible music, and I don't know that many places where the audience would have listened as quietly as they listened at the Y,'' Mr. Isserlis said. ''That's not something that struck me at first when I played at the Y. I think that's something that's grown.''
Ms. Arie-Gaifman has nurtured a new generation of performers as well. Jennifer Koh, a vibrant, inquisitive violinist, will present a daring program of unaccompanied works at the Y on Sunday. And since 2001, Benjamin Hochman, an eloquent pianist (and Ms. Koh's husband), has appeared repeatedly in a variety of settings, including concerts with the violinist Pinchas Zukerman, the cellist Miklos Perenyi and the baritone Sanford Sylvan. ''It's rather unusual to find a presenter who identifies young performers and really supports their careers,'' Mr. Hochman said by telephone. ''Not only does she engage young artists, but she also makes an effort to sustain her interest in artists over time.''
For Mr. Hochman's solo recital this April, the Y commissioned a new piece by the composer David Ludwig at Mr. Hochman's request.
Sol Adler, the executive director of the Y, credits Ms. Arie-Gaifman's innovations with having helped to steady the organization's fortunes during uncertain economic times. When he went to the Y as a comptroller in 1978, he said, subscriptions accounted for 80 percent of ticket sales.
''You can't really sell a distinguished-artists series the way we used to, where people would buy 12 concerts many months before the season started,'' he said. ''Today, each and every day, there are enormous distractions, there are enormous other opportunities, and so it's much more competitive. Hanna has kept us doing very well in that new environment.''
Ms. Arie-Gaifman's programming for the 2011-12 season, to be announced imminently, shows that she has no intention of playing things safe. Included are concerts by the engrossing pianist Paul Lewis and the distinguished period-instrument ensemble Quatuor Mosaiques. Mr. Isserlis will offer a Beethoven cycle with the fortepianist Robert Levin. Especially close to Ms. Arie-Gaifman's heart is ''Will to Create, Will to Live: The Music of Terezin,'' an extensive multidisciplinary series in which the Nash Ensemble and other performers will play music by composers who were imprisoned in the Terezin internment camp in Czechoslovakia during World War II, many of whom later perished at the Nazis' hands.
That most of the musicians imprisoned at Terezin -- including Ms. Arie-Gaifman's piano teacher, Alice Herz-Sommer, at 107 the world's oldest Holocaust survivor -- were Jews speaks to the Y's mission, Ms. Arie-Gaifman noted. But in this, as in everything she presents, she takes a broader view.
''I think it's something that people need to know,'' she said. ''It's a program honoring something that we all could learn from.''

The Wicked Lives and Surprising Adventures of Three Notorious Counterfeiters
By Ben Tarnoff
Illustrated. 369 pp. The Penguin Press. $27.95.
In the midst of the current economic chaos, our faith in that most modest of financial instruments -- the dollar bill -- has remained unchanged. Not the mass dollar, that abstract plurality, ebbing and ebbing again, but the Federal Reserve notes in your pocket. Your dollars may lose value, but at least they are real.
Such confidence is a recent luxury, Ben Tarnoff observes in ''Moneymakers: The Wicked Lives and Surprising Adventures of Three Notorious Counterfeiters.'' ''By the time the federal government began regulating the money supply,'' Tarnoff writes, ''there were more than 10,000 different kinds of notes circulating in the United States.'' With so much paper being issued -- from state-chartered institutions like banks, railroads and insurance companies -- even the savviest merchants could not keep up with the proliferation of legal currencies, let alone identify counterfeits. In this wealth of confusion, lasting from the colonial period until after the Civil War, counterfeiters thrived. 
In a country where the prevailing national fantasy was -- and remains -- that you make your own luck, the counterfeiter exerted powerful charm. Self-made men in a class-bound nation, counterfeiters were a roguish personification of the American dream. Tarnoff, a first-time author, expertly sketches biographical vignettes; beguiling and clever, counterfeiters not only mastered the art of forgery and the con, but often ingratiated themselves with their marks. Tarnoff doesn't linger over the mechanics of counterfeiting. The process lacks sex appeal. Unlike, say, art forgers, counterfeiters were usually disgruntled printers or metalworkers. Rather, he concentrates on career trajectories. Counterfeiters typically passed bills for several years before being caught, were sometimes celebrated, and then hanged or mutilated with branding irons.
Samuel Upham took a different path. A gold prospector turned Philadelphia shop owner, Upham obtained a set of plates for manufacturing Confederate money during the Civil War. These legal ''curiosities'' made their way South, typically in the pockets of Union soldiers, flooding the Confederate economy. Upham retired after an imitator destroyed his profit margin but before Confederate spies convinced Union authorities that his rival was printing real Confederate currency, effectively stanching the flow of counterfeits.
Absorbing material, yes, but what elevates ''Moneymakers'' from the novelty shelf is Tarnoff's skillful interweaving of the counterfeiter's work and America's revolving enchantment with and disavowal of paper money. Alongside tales of jailbreaks and executions, he examines the nation's changing relationship to federalism and the democratization of the means of exchange. For example, David Lewis would cheat the poor but was said to often refund their losses after a successful day of bilking the rich. This dramatic sensibility converged with the emerging Jacksonian populism, and its attendant dissatisfaction with a centralized banking authority, to fashion the counterfeiter as an American Robin Hood.
Counterfeiters were, according to Tarnoff, America's ''shadow financiers.'' For much of the nation's history, wealth was tied to gold and silver, ensuring that access to currency remained in the hands of the prosperous. Legitimate paper money, though prone to forgery and overnight collapse, was also scarce. Consequently, merchants and tradesmen were often left without a means to pay for goods or taxes. The public effectively became counterfeiters' partner in profit; the origin of a bank note, real or fake, didn't matter if it could be exchanged for necessities. In such a climate, crime becomes a legitimate species of entrepreneurship.
''Moneymakers'' isn't analytical, and Tarnoff pulps a lot of history to streamline his tale. The book's implicit argument -- that an economy corruptible by an individual in a face-to-face encounter is in many ways preferable to the abstract fleecing of today -- feels as right as it feels romantic. This is no faint praise in our world, where most that seems solid can melt so swiftly into air.

THE HAVES AND THE HAVE-NOTS
A Brief and Idiosyncratic History of Global Inequality
By Branko Milanovic
258 pp. Basic Books. $27.95.
Who needs to keep up with the Joneses? What people really care about is keeping up with the Rockefellers. That's the main theme of ''The Haves and the Have-Nots,'' an eclectic book on inequality that attempts to document the long history of coveting by the poor, and the grim consequences of that coveting.
Written by the World Bank economist and development specialist Branko Milanovic, this survey of income distribution past and present is constructed as a sort of textbook-almanac hybrid. It revolves around three technical essays summarizing the academic literature on inequality, which are each followed by a series of quick-hit vignettes about quirkier subjects, like how living standards in 19th-century Russia may have influenced Anna Karenina's doomed romance, or who the richest person in history was. 
The first essay is a primer on how economists think about income inequality within a country -- in particular, how it is measured, and how it is related to a country's overall economic health. At a very basic, agrarian level of development, Milanovic explains, people's incomes are relatively equal; everyone is living at or close to subsistence level. But as more advanced technologies become available and enable workers to differentiate their skills, a gulf between rich and poor becomes possible.
This section also gingerly approaches the contentious debate over whether inequality is good or bad for economic growth, but ultimately quibbles with the question itself. ''There is 'good' and 'bad' inequality,'' Milanovic writes, ''just as there is good and bad cholesterol.'' The possibility of unequal economic outcomes motivates people to work harder, he argues, although at some point it can lead to the preservation of acquired positions, which causes economies to stagnate.
In his second and third essays, Milanovic switches to his obvious passion: inequality around the world. These sections encourage readers to better appreciate their own living standards and to think more skeptically about who is responsible for their success.
As Milanovic notes, an astounding 60 percent of a person's income is determined merely by where she was born (and an additional 20 percent is dictated by how rich her parents were). He also makes interesting international comparisons. The typical person in the top 5 percent of the Indian population, for example, makes the same as or less than the typical person in the bottom 5 percent of the American population. That's right: America's poorest are, on average, richer than India's richest -- extravagant Mumbai mansions notwithstanding.
It is no wonder then, Milanovic says, that so many from the third world risk life and limb to sneak into the first. A recent World Bank survey suggested that ''countries that have done economically poorly would, if free migration were allowed, remain perhaps without half or more of their populations.'' Mass-migration attempts are met with sealed borders in the developed world, which then results in the deaths of thousands of anonymous indigents journeying to promised lands only to be swallowed up by the Mediterranean or charred in the Arizona desert.
But while Milanovic demonstrates that inequality between countries is unquestionably toxic, he is less persuasive about the effects of inequality within countries. He frequently assumes that this kind of inequality is by its very nature problematic, but provides scant historical evidence about why, particularly if mobility is possible.
In general, mobility -- and the policies that promote it -- are given disappointingly little space. The same goes for how income inequality might affect the functioning of a democracy.
As a result of such blind spots, ''The Haves and the Have-Nots'' can feel somewhat patchy or disorganized at times. Milanovic's more colorful vignettes, on the other hand, are almost uniformly delightful. No matter where you are on the income ladder, Milanovic's examination of whether Bill Gates is richer than Nero makes for great cocktail party conversation.

HEADLINE: Robert D. LiMandri

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. LiMandri, 45, is the commissioner of the Department of Buildings, which oversees nearly a million properties in New York City, by enforcing various building codes and laws. He was appointed in 2008, after the resignation of Patricia J. Lancaster, following a series of construction accidents, including a crane collapse in Manhattan that killed seven people.
Q The department just released its 2010 annual report. Can you discuss some of the numbers? 
A There are 975,000 buildings and properties in New York City and we have 1,109 employees, 337 of whom are inspectors. We performed 335,449 inspections last year; issued 136,294 construction permits and 1,517 new building permits and 67,069 violations.
What many people don't realize is that we do about 450,000 plan reviews a year. Last year it was 457,375. That rivals some of the largest architectural firms.
Q Do you have more or fewer inspectors now?
A Slightly fewer, through attrition and budget cuts. But we're doing more with less and using technology to be more efficient.
Q How so?
A We've been trying to make it easier for people to get permits, to do plan reviews, online. Electricians can go online as of last year: they put in their ID numbers, pay for the permit online and print it. Construction permits will also go online this year.
The other piece is dealing with plans online. We hope to pilot that by the end of this year. You would submit your plans -- the simplest plans, not the big complicated ones. You open an account with us, send it to us electronically. We look at it when we're available -- we might ask questions or note objections -- and e-mail it back to you.
Q Could this work with the big developers?
A The number of large buildings that get built every year is like 200 to 300. So if you are a large developer/owner like the Rudins or the Resnicks, you're doing these kinds of filings on a regular basis. Instead of hiring someone to drop off stuff for us to look at, they can save transaction time.
Q How much time?
A We saw that when they went online for electrical permits, the processing time went from days or weeks to minutes.
Q Getting back to the annual report, what does it tell us about the city's recovery?
A It's in pockets. Permits for new buildings and major alterations fell around 19 percent last year, to 13,000 from 16,000. But permits for small-scale alterations -- like moving a wall -- rose 6 percent, to nearly 103,000. People are still doing smaller work, and that drives the economy as well.
We're starting to see pockets of demolitions. We just had seven or eight sites in the last couple of weeks. When you see demolitions come back, it's a leading indicator that development is coming.
Also, in Manhattan there are four or five large sites, where maybe they slowed construction, that are starting to pick up. It's the heart of the winter so it's going to be slow anyway, but we're hoping that the spring will bring a set of new buildings.
Q It's been over two years since you took office. What are some of your biggest accomplishments?
A We've been working on transforming this department -- making it more accountable and instilling confidence in our training programs. We put G.P.S. tracking on our 337 inspectors, so we know where our people are. We conducted a facade safety initiative, and we investigated illegally converted apartments. We used Craigslist and posed as tenants.
Q Have you been able to curb construction accidents?
A We had a reduction in 2010 from the year before by about 28 percent. Clearly there's been less large-scale construction, but also I am very satisfied that the industry has heard us and responded.
Contractors are using cocoon-netting systems to protect the top four floors during the very early stages of construction. These innovative systems prevent people from falling, as well as falling debris. I'm hoping it will become a city standard.
Building a building is complex, and there are a lot of people you depend on to do it well, and it takes just one of them not to do their job for things to go awry. Our job is to make sure that they put safety ahead of profit.
Q Let's talk about some of the new regulations for this year.
A The big thing that's coming down the pike is the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan, which will rank buildings by energy efficiency. Owners have to benchmark their buildings -- if they're over 50,000 square feet -- and upload information about utility bills into a federal Web site by May 1. The next step is that every 10 years they will have to go through an audit process.

HEADLINE: You Don't Have to Pay It

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
PRICES in the New York real estate market may rise and fall, and trends in housing may come and go, but one number has remained largely unaffected: the 6 percent broker commission.
But lately that figure is under attack by buyers and sellers looking to save money in a tough economy, and by an array of alternative real estate business models that offer an a la carte menu of services to clients willing to do some of the work themselves.
For as little as a few hundred dollars a month, sellers can pay an agent to post their listing on broker databases and to handle some of the negotiating. And agents -- even those from larger firms -- may settle for 5 percent, or occasionally 4 percent, to get a deal done.
Nationwide, the average commission in 2009 was 5.36 percent, according to data collected by Real Trends, a real estate research firm, indicating that there is room for negotiation. ''The standard 6 percent went out the window a long time ago,'' said Steve Murray, the editor of Real Trends. The New York City market is no different from the national one, he said. 
Of course, many agents defend the 6 percent commission, saying that for that amount, a full-service broker will land a higher price, market a property more comprehensively, and insulate sellers from the often emotional process of negotiating and closing a sale.
But, as Mr. Murray said, ''For certain kinds of property at certain times, New York City brokers are cutting their commission to get a deal like everyone else.''
Many brokers are reluctant to speak publicly about commissions; representatives from Halstead Property, the Corcoran Group and Prudential Douglas Elliman declined to discuss the topic. But it is hardly a secret that an agent may accept a 5 percent listing if the seller is a repeat customer, a friend or family member, or buying through the agent as well as selling. That lower number is also more common when the agent does not have to split the commission with a buyer's broker, or for properties in the multimillion-dollar range.
''At a certain price point, 6 percent just feels vulgar,'' said Kathy Braddock, a founder of Rutenberg Realty. ''I would say there's negotiability in the higher numbers.''
Like many agents, Ms. Braddock emphasized that there were no hard and fast rules as to when a lower commission may be offered, but she said market conditions and a listing's appeal played large roles.
''It's not only about price point,'' she said. ''It also depends on how difficult a property is to sell.''
Another factor is what percentage of the commission the listing agent has to hand over to his or her employer; at large firms, less experienced or less productive agents may not pocket even half of the commission they earn. So for a $1 million property, a 6 percent commission of $60,000 split first with a buyer's broker and then an employer may mean the selling agent earns $15,000. And that's before expenses like marketing.
Rutenberg Realty follows a different model, with agents paying $99 per month to be part of the company, then $1,000 on deals involving properties that sell for $1.5 million or less and $2,000 for sales above that amount. This arrangement gives agents more flexibility to set their own commissions, since they don't have to get approval from a manager, Ms. Braddock said, though she stressed that Rutenberg does not consider itself a ''cutting commissions'' firm.
Doug Heddings, who started the Heddings Property Group in 2009 after working at Prudential Douglas Elliman, says commissions ''have always been negotiable.'' But now that he is an independent broker, he said, he has more freedom to set his fee than when he worked for a large firm.
Still, Mr. Heddings sees the 6 percent commission as justified by the money and time he spends marketing a property. And, he said, he is more likely to cut a deal on his commission during the negotiating process to bridge a gap between the buyer and the seller.
''If we're $10,000 or $15,000 apart,'' he said, ''I'll do what I can with a commission to make sure a deal happens.''
One of the sticky wickets in any discussion of commissions is that legally, the industry cannot mandate a 6 percent commission because it would be price fixing, a violation of antitrust laws. But Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said 6 percent was fair, given increasing marketing costs and the complexities of navigating hurdles like co-op board approvals. He also pointed out that agents earn a commission only when a property sells -- and that this process can take a year or more.
''Brokers are not paid for their marketing costs,'' Mr. Willkie said. ''They're not paid for their time. They're paid for results.''
Still, for some sellers, a commission of tens of thousands of dollars to sell a property seems too steep, especially as they cannot expect to make as big a profit as they might have a few years ago -- if any at all.
Debra Pohl and her husband, Daniel, opted to list their two-bedroom Morningside Heights apartment last January with an agent who offered an alternative to the standard commission. The agent, Keith Burkhardt, the president of the Burkhardt Group, charged the Pohls a flat rate of $1,000 to submit their listing to real estate databases. The couple handled all the open houses, showings and deal negotiation themselves.
Although they advertised that they would pay a buyer's agent a 2.5 percent commission, all of their offers came from people who were not working with brokers.
''We sold our place for $520,000,'' Ms. Pohl said. ''At 6 percent, that would've been over $30,000, and we did it for $1,000, so the savings was really, really important to us.''
Ms. Pohl said she and her husband had sold a previous home in New Jersey themselves but decided to list their apartment with Mr. Burkhardt because at the time, Web sites like StreetEasy did not allow for-sale-by-owner listings. It has since changed its policy.
She said she did not believe that a full-service agent could have secured a higher price -- one of the main arguments brokers make to sellers.
''We ended up selling our apartment for slightly more than the bank evaluated it at,'' she said, ''so we feel we did pretty well. That tells me that we couldn't have gotten more with a broker.''
The Pohls also worked with Mr. Burkhardt last year when they bought an apartment for $750,000 on the Upper West Side. They went with him then because he offers buyers a rebate of up to two-thirds of his commission, based on a similar self-service model. Clients search for apartments and visit open houses on their own, putting Mr. Burkhardt's name down as their broker, and he helps out by booking other appointments and offering advice during negotiations.
These days, Mr. Burkhardt considers himself mostly a buyer's broker, describing his niche as that subset of real estate enthusiasts who are glued to sites like StreetEasy and don't need a lot of hand-holding while visiting Sunday open houses, a task that can take up a lot of a broker's time.
''They're doing, let's say 60 percent of the research themselves,'' he said, ''and they want to be compensated for that.''
He acknowledged, however, that setups like his had yet to catch on in a big way.
''People like to complain about broker commissions,'' he said, ''but they're afraid to break ranks with the status quo and go with a firm or a model that is different than what everybody accepts.''
Another company offering a hybrid service is RealDirect, which charges sellers $395 per month, or a 1 percent commission, to distribute a listing to major real estate databases; owners handle open houses and showings themselves. Sellers can pay a 2 percent commission for what RealDirect calls ''broker-managed service,'' including pricing and staging advice, and the handling of negotiations.
Doug Perlson, the chief executive of RealDirect, said 3 of the 13 apartments listed through the company, which started last summer, had sold or were in contract.
One of those properties is a one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment owned by Colleen Gray, which is scheduled to close in mid-February. The listing price was $920,000.
Ms. Gray said she listed her apartment with RealDirect in late October after having tried to sell it herself for about a month. She went with RealDirect because she did not feel her previous real estate agents had earned their commissions.
''I have a very desirable apartment, in a good building, and I work from home,'' Ms. Gray said, explaining that these factors made it easier for her to opt for a no-frills agency. ''I was available at the drop of a hat for a showing. Realtors, on the other hand, have their own schedule.''
RealDirect offers clients some professional backup, an advantage over the lonely sale-by-owner transaction if things go amiss (Mr. Perlson is a member of the Real Estate Board of New York). However, the 3 percent commission that sellers often offer buyers' agents to encourage showings can take a bite out of the potential for significant savings.
D. J. Jaffe, a retired advertising executive, is selling the two-bedroom apartment at West 27th Street that he has owned for 20 years. He chose RealDirect for reasons similar to Ms. Gray's: he has the time -- and the enthusiasm -- to do some of the work himself. He is asking $899,000.
At an open house in early January, Mr. Jaffe welcomed a steady stream of prospective buyers, talking up the apartment's features (which walls could be altered, where a second bathroom could be added) and the neighborhood's appeal (good transportation, a Whole Foods), as well as playing with visitors' dogs (the building is pet-friendly).
All three sellers who declined the standard commission model said anyone considering this option should be prepared to invest a lot of time in the sale, and to develop a thick skin for comments made during showings and the back-and-forth of negotiations.
Mr. Murray of Real Trends said he believed cultural reticence about haggling had helped to preserve the traditional broker commission.
''Will we see more options? Yes,'' he said. ''Will consumers take advantage of them? Some will. But I think a lot of Americans don't have the personal skills or even the desire to negotiate a deal.''
Let's Make A Deal: SELLERS may be able to reduce the broker's commission. Here are some strategies:
Interview several agents before signing a listing agreement, and ask if they will accept less than 6 percent.
If the buyer does not have an agent, negotiate a reduced commission -- for instance 5 percent.
Engage the same agent to sell your current home and to buy your next one.
Choose an agency that offers fewer services and do some -- or most -- of the work yourself.
Use an independent agent who does not have to split commissions with a large company. SUSAN STELLIN

To the Sports Editor:
Re ''Pitcher Spurns $12 Million, to Keep Self-Respect,'' Jan. 27: In the baseball world where players ask for and get exorbitant salaries, it was refreshing to read that Gil Meche retired rather than stay on with the Kansas City Royals in a lesser capacity and collect $12 million. 
Meche said that when he signed his contract it was his main goal to earn it. And what a superb lesson this is for our children: work hard and earn your salary. Alas, most professions do not pay workers millions of dollars, but the lesson is still the same.
I am rooting for Meche and wish him a happy retirement and time with his children. He did something positive to promote baseball's image.
Jennifer Dorn
New York
To the Sports Editor:
The bizarre behavior of Gil Meche, who gave up $12 million because he ''felt bad'' about taking money he had not earned, is a slap in the face to those toilers in the finance industry who courageously set aside their moral scruples and accept multimillion-dollar bonuses in the face of an economic crisis of their own making. It is to be hoped that Meche, in light of the example of those whose Ivy League degrees attest to a deeper understanding of this sort of moral and ethical quandary, will change his mind.
If he does, I would like to recommend some very nice Portuguese municipal bonds, rated AAA.

HEADLINE: White Paint, Chocolate, And Postmodern Ghosts

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
SURVEYING the row of door buzzers outside the hulking Brooklyn building where the artist Sue de Beer works, it somehow seems fitting to find a lone occupant listed on the building's top floor, with no further explanation: ''GOD.''
''I don't know who that is or what they do,'' Ms. de Beer said, breaking into a laugh when a reporter pointed out the small handwritten label next to the buzzer. ''I've never really been up to that floor.''
But given the nature of her work and especially her most recent creation -- a lush, frankly mystical video piece called ''The Ghosts'' that will have its debut Thursday in an unlikely place, one of the stately period rooms at the Park Avenue Armory -- it is tempting to imagine the Holy Ghost himself at work up there in an old warehouse on the Red Hook flatlands, not far from a dingy bus depot, an Ikea and a discount store called 99 Cent Dreams. 
Over the last decade Ms. de Beer has built a cult following for the dark and often disturbing ways that she mixes the profane and the sacred -- or at least a postmodern version of the sacred, a longing to escape the confines of ordinary consciousness for something perhaps more beautiful or true.
The exhibition at the Armory and a show of related sculpture to open Feb. 18 at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in Chelsea are the most prominent presentation of Ms. de Beer's work in the United States since she first became known through her inclusion in the 2004 Whitney Biennial and entered many prominent public collections, like those of the Museum of Modern Art and the New Museum of Contemporary Art.
In the work for which she is best known, videos that have mined the underbelly of youth culture -- a critic once described her as ''the pre-eminent auteur of teen angst'' -- the supernatural, or at least supranormal, has never been quite so front and center as it is in ''The Ghosts,'' which Ms. de Beer describes as a turning point, three years in the making.
But it has never been far outside the frame. The adolescent bedrooms that so often serve as the centerpieces of her creations, cluttered with posters and guitars and packs of cigarettes, have seemed at times like existential anterooms, where the occupants await some kind of apotheosis with the help of love or drugs or other mechanisms for escape.
Like, for instance, the sensory deprivation tank in which Ms. de Beer spent many dark, quiet hours when she lived in Berlin, with a pyramid above it for energy-channeling. (''It was kind of hokey,'' she said.) Or the hypnotists she began to visit there and in New York, who informed the creation of the central character in ''The Ghosts,'' a hollow-cheeked hypnotist convincingly played by a fellow artist, Jutta Koether, a painter and musician.
''What I wanted was some kind of a nonverbal, non-narrative experience outside myself, something like a state of total belief without having to articulate a belief system,'' Ms. de Beer, 37, said in a recent interview in her studio, where she shot much of the new video in small rooms with the windows blacked out. ''But I don't know if I ever got there.''
The new 30-minute two-screen video grew out of a period of desperation in her life, after a year in which she made no art at all. At that time, in 2007, she was traveling almost nonstop, mostly between Berlin, where she lived for several years, and New York, where she is now an assistant professor at New York University.
''I was burned out to the point where I just couldn't do anything creative, and so I actually kind of gave up, and it was liberating,'' said Ms. de Beer, who, despite the Stygian nature of her fascinations, is engaging and open in person, exuding a kind of rock-geek cool.
In the winter of her bad year, the sun would set in Berlin before 4 in the afternoon, she said. She started venturing out only at night, riding the U-Bahn subway trains alone with a notebook, trying to write. Then for two months she locked herself in a room with only a desk, a chair and a blanket, rarely coming out.
When she did, she had written the basic script for ''The Ghosts,'' which follows three characters -- a young woman, a record-store clerk and a money manager (played by Jon Spencer, singer and guitarist for the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, whom Ms. de Beer persuaded to act for the first time) -- as they seek the help of the hypnotist to deal with loss and longing.
In doing so, they conjure up ghosts -- frightening-looking ones, who owe a visual debt to Ms. de Beer's long fascination with horror films and, lately, to the particularly bloody 1970s Italian subgenre known as giallo. The ghosts seem to be challenging the viewer to decide whether they are mere memories or phantasms of a more substantial sort -- or whether, in the end, it really matters.
In her early years Ms. de Beer was often identified among the practitioners of a death-haunted, neo-Gothic strain of contemporary art that emerged after 9/11, a list that included Banks Violette and David Altmejd. But the new work, while playing with those expectations, owes a lot more to Proust than to Poe, as a wrenching examination of memory and the ways it shapes identity.
''I think that over the last several years she's developed a signature style and voice that's all her own,'' said Lauren Ross, the curator and director of arts programs for the High Line and a former chief curator at White Columns, who has followed Ms. de Beer's work. ''It's always seemed to me that she is after a certain kind of character, one constantly in danger of losing control of the self. I think she's very interested in how thin that line is.''
She added: ''I've always found her work to be extremely unsettling, It's always taken me out of my comfort zone.''
Doreen Remen, one of the founders of the Art Production Fund, the nonprofit organization that is bringing the video to the Armory with the help of Sotheby's, the event's sponsor, said the fund was interested in helping stage a video project in New York partly because ''video has the ability to bridge a kind of audience gap that exists in contemporary art.''
''And,'' she added, ''I think that with this work, Sue is playing more with the conventions of movie entertainment in a way that is going to grab people, even though it's not a conventional movie by any means.''
Because of great difficulty finding production money for the video in 2008 as the economy plunged, Ms. de Beer's ghosts were whipped up mostly on the cheap, using naked actresses spray-painted white, head to toe, and chocolate sauce for the blood that oozes from the mouth of one of them, all of it transformed later in the editing room, where she spent months shaping two terabyte hard drives full of footage.
''I was doing all this research on how to make a ghost on essentially a two-dollar budget without making it look just laughably hilarious,'' she said.
Her sets, which have always worn their high-school-play artificiality proudly, in this case really needed to do so because of budget concerns. A few helpers built a late '70s Trans Am from wood -- complete with the phoenix hood decal known in its day as the screaming chicken -- spending little money except on a certain smokeable substance to make the experience more enjoyable. The only real splurge, Ms. de Beer said, was hiring a cat trainer and a large white Persian cat named Snoebell, indulging a visual fascination she finds hard to explain. (Snoebell also appeared in a 2009 video.)
Ms. de Beer met Mr. Spencer through the members of a German band called the Cobra Killers. He said he became involved partly because she described the project as a horror film and he is a fan of the genre. But during the shooting, which he squeezed into an exhausting Australian tour schedule, he was unsure at times what he had gotten himself into.
''Things were always a little vague, even sometimes the address where I was supposed to show up,'' he said. ''I don't know if she was doing this to increase my sense of disorientation, to keep me in the dark. But I guess if she was, in some ways it kind of worked. It was a strange experience all around.''
Ms. de Beer, who doesn't like to use trained actors in her works, said she was drawn to Mr. Spencer mostly because of his weathered voice and ''world-weary face'' and was pleased with the character he helped bring to life, a businessman who seems to be trying to exorcise a lost love by summoning her from the dead only so that he can leave her, repaying her for abandoning him. (The dreamlike dialogue in the video was written by Alissa Bennett, who has collaborated with Ms. de Beer before, and by Ms. Koether.)
Ms. de Beer said during the interview in her studio one blustery afternoon that the video was ''really very personal for me, partly because I had benched myself.''
''When I finished with the initial script, it felt very important to me to make it,'' she said.
Growing up in a rambling Victorian house with a widow's walk in Salem, Mass., which still exudes an air of its witchy past, she felt that mysticism was a kind of birthright, and it has been a more prominent element of her work in recent years. A 2006 video, ''The Quickening,'' set in a cartoon-ish Puritan New England, delved into the spiritual seeking of the French novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans and quoted from the sermon ''Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,'' putting the Jonathan Edwards warhorse to work in probably the strangest context it has ever found itself. Ms. de Beer has also borrowed from the dark, violent post-religious mysticism of the novelist Dennis Cooper. (From his novel ''Period,'' used in a 2005 de Beer video: ''I could open the other dimension right now if I wanted. Or I could stay here with you. I'm kind of like a god.'')
But Ms. de Beer said that her fascination with ghosts is in one sense simply about finding a way to explore how we all must deal with the past and with loss as we grow older, a struggle that finds a metaphor in the artistic process itself.
''As an artist, you shed all these objects which were the 'you' back in the moment when you made them,'' she said. ''And then you go back and hardly recognize them and feel like the person who made them wasn't you but someone else, like a sister or something. And you wonder 'What was she like?' ''

HEADLINE: Astaire The Artist, Even in Blackface

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
HOW should we react today to ''Bojangles of Harlem,'' the extended solo in the 1936 film ''Swing Time'' in which Fred Astaire, then at the height of his fame, wears blackface to evoke the African-American dancer Bill Robinson? No pat answer occurs.
The opening image is a coarse Robinson caricature: gigantic shoe soles are upended to show a thick-lipped black face, topped by a derby and above a dotted bow tie. Then the women of a chorus tug the shoes apart to reveal giant trousered legs -- at the end of which sits Astaire. The women bear those legs away. Astaire bursts forth, dancing.
What follows, though, is no traditional blackface number. For one thing, his white lips and eyes aren't enlarged with makeup, unlike, say, Al Jolson's in ''The Jazz Singer.'' In ''Bojangles of Harlem,'' Astaire is far less like a cartoon than that sole-face suggested. For another, after the chorus dances in alternating black and white costumes as if to make a point about race, Astaire builds rhythmic complexity to peak upon peak of glory in the last three minutes. 
On the occasion of the reissues of the two most indispensable books about Astaire, it's worth taking another look at ''Bojangles.'' Though blackface certainly often expressed racist sentiment -- I shudder to recall the TV ''Black-and-White Minstrel Show'' of my youth -- it was often used subversively. Here Astaire is subverting racist caricature to celebrate the black tradition of tap dance. His is not a specific imitation of Robinson: Astaire's torso moves a great deal, whereas Robinson's deportment was far more upright. In fact, there were black tap dancers whom Astaire admired much more than Robinson: notably John W. Bubbles, whom he found truly great. But Robinson, thanks to his movies with Shirley Temple (''Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm'' and more), was the most famous black tap dancer in the world; this ''Bojangles'' song congratulated his achievement.
''Swing Time'' was released in 1936. That same year, ''Gone With the Wind'' was published, with its sympathetic treatment of the Ku Klux Klan, and Josephine Baker returned to America, partnered by white men in a Balanchine number, only to be ostracized by several white co-stars and censured by the New York critics. In view of those white American attitudes toward blacks in this era, the nature of Astaire's tribute in ''Bojangles'' becomes much clearer. He and the chorus begin with a gestural motif, waving their hands in their air, palms facing the audience, in a strikingly specific jazz reference.
One person who posted a YouTube clip of ''Bojangles'' prefaced it with the comment ''Please read this before crying 'Racist!' '' But even if you remain bothered by its blackface aspect, ''Bojangles'' should be watched time and again, because it's one of Astaire's most rhythmically imaginative solos.
No performer in dance is more refreshing than Astaire. And no better companions to his art exist than the two reissues from the Educational Publisher: ''The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book'' by Arlene Croce (originally from 1972) and ''Astaire Dancing: The Musical Films'' by John Mueller (1985).
Ms. Croce's book is a marvel of economy, eloquence, historical grasp and feeling. While Astaire was always hailed as a great dancer, it was largely Ms. Croce who drew attention to his greatness as a choreographer and the expressive qualities of his duets with Rogers. On the counterrhythms of Astaire's ''Bojangles,'' she comments, ''The man who has been called the Mozart of dancers here turns Stravinskian.''
Of the Astaire books that have followed hers, Mr. Mueller's stands as the most definitive. Surveying all 31 of Astaire's dance films, with a rich supply of photographs, it is a model of scrutiny and research. I derive much of my own contextual information about ''Bojangles'' and more from it.
Today the pre-eminence of black tap dancers is indisputable. That's excellent, but it's regrettable that Astaire and other white tappers are sometimes omitted from pantheons of tap dancers, as happened in the 1995 tap-history show ''Bring In 'da Noise, Bring In 'da Funk.'' Recently, I was dismayed when an editor said she didn't think of Astaire as a tap dancer.
Sure, Astaire's dancing went way beyond tap -- like so many virtuosos, white or black, he resisted categorization -- but what he's doing in ''Bojangles'' and many other solos sure as hell ain't ballroom. In 1981, on the occasion of his American Film Institute lifetime achievement award, he recalled how he'd ''beat the floor to a pulp.'' He remains a surpassing tap stylist for many reasons: the way he incorporated his upper body into the movement; his collaborations with George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and other composers; and the duets in which he used tap as romantic expression.
Here I draw attention to the 21 movies without Ginger Rogers in which Astaire dances, alone or with others: they include several of the most astounding dances ever made. Irksomely, some of the best still have not materialized on DVD or on-demand. So thank Heaven for YouTube. There at least you can find his great solos in ''Nice Work if You Can Get It'' (from ''A Damsel in Distress,'' 1937) and ''One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)'' (from ''The Sky's the Limit,'' 1943). No two numbers better show how Astaire went on extending his art beyond the heights of his work with Rogers.
''Nice Work'' is one of the rare but dazzling examples in which he managed to capture the dance in one unbroken take. As if that weren't challenge enough, it's also the dance in which Astaire chooses extreme spatial constriction -- and makes himself a percussionist, too. He dances in the narrow arc created by a drum set, and those drums -- which he plays both with sticks and his jumping or kicking feet -- become part of the soundscape.
As Mr. Mueller remarks, the dance is also ''a visual treat'' -- with Astaire's limbs moving in different directions in unpredictable sequences. One of its best movements, near the beginning, comes when Astaire ''seems to let the sound of a cow bell ripple through his body.'' (The ripple passes upward, and fast.)
''Damsel'' in general and ''Nice Work'' in particular extend an idea that was already a winner in ''Top Hat'': Astaire is the subversive American whose gunfire-like feet and jazzy rhythms undermine the well-ordered politeness of English high society. (They remind me of Balanchine's wicked explanation of about why he was probably not dignified enough to have settled in England: there, ''if you are awake, it is already vulgar.'')
Talk about subversive! Astaire's face in ''Nice Work'' is a wide-eyed bubble -- you really can see here why he had often been compared to Mickey Mouse -- and his carriage is sometimes the epitome of ballroom elegance. Yet his whole body is merrily lashing out every which way.
What was subversive in the 1930s became abrasive or explosive in the 1940s. That's when he took percussiveness in his solos to new extremes. And he found characterizations to match. In ''One for My Baby,'' he -- formerly so bright and sweet -- has turned dark and bitter. During his tap dance, he breaks glasses and shatters a mirror by hurling a stool at it -- but this ferocity seems directed at himself. One of his three ''drunk'' dances of that era, this is an expressive high point of his career -- and therefore of all dance history. Its force remains shocking.

HEADLINE: Serious In Singapore

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Singapore
I am in the Gan Eng Seng Primary School in a middle-class neighborhood of Singapore, and the principal, A. W. Ai Ling, has me visiting a fifth-grade science class. All the 11-year-old boys and girls are wearing junior white lab coats with their names on them. Outside in the hall, yellow police tape has blocked off a ''crime scene'' and lying on a floor, bloodied, is a fake body that has been murdered. The class is learning about DNA through the use of fingerprints, and their science teacher has turned the students into little C.S.I. detectives. They have to collect fingerprints from the scene and then break them down.
I missed that DNA lesson when I was in fifth grade. When I asked the principal whether this was part of the national curriculum, she said no. She just had a great science teacher, she said, and was aware that Singapore was making a big push to expand its biotech industries and thought it would be good to push her students in the same direction early. A couple of them checked my fingerprints. I was innocent -- but impressed. 
This was just an average public school, but the principal had made her own connections between ''what world am I living in,'' ''where is my country trying to go in that world'' and, therefore, ''what should I teach in fifth-grade science.''
I was struck because that kind of linkage is so often missing in U.S. politics today. Republicans favor deep cuts in government spending, while so far exempting Medicare, Social Security and the defense budget. Not only is that not realistic, but it basically says that our nation's priorities should be to fund retirement homes for older people rather than better schools for younger people and that we should build new schools in Afghanistan before Alabama.
President Obama just laid out a smart and compelling vision of where our priorities should be. But he did not spell out how and where we will have to both cut and invest -- really intelligently and at a large scale -- to deliver on his vision.
Singapore is tiny and by no means a U.S.-style democracy. Yet, like America, it has a multiethnic population -- Chinese, Indian and Malay -- with a big working class. It has no natural resources and even has to import sand for building. But today its per capita income is just below U.S. levels, built with high-end manufacturing, services and exports. The country's economy grew last year at 14.7 percent, led by biomedical exports. How?
If Singapore has one thing to teach America, it is about taking governing seriously, relentlessly asking: What world are we living in and how do we adapt to thrive. ''We're like someone living in a hut without any insulation,'' explained Tan Kong Yam, an economist. ''We feel every change in the wind or the temperature and have to adapt. You Americans are still living in a brick house with central heating and don't have to be so responsive.'' And we have not been.
Singapore probably has the freest market in the world; it doesn't believe in import tariffs, minimum wages or unemployment insurance. But it believes regulators need to make sure markets work properly -- because they can't on their own -- and it subsidizes homeownership and education to give everyone a foundation to become self-reliant. Singapore copied the German model that strives to put everyone who graduates from high school on a track for higher education, but only about 40 percent go to universities. Others are tracked to polytechnics or vocational institutes, so the vast majority graduate with the skills to get a job, whether it be as a plumber or a scientist.
Explained Ravi Menon, the Permanent Secretary of Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry: ''The two 'isms' that perhaps best describe Singapore's approach are: pragmatism -- an emphasis on what works in practice rather than abstract theory; and eclecticism -- a willingness to adapt to the local context best practices from around the world.''
It is a sophisticated mix of radical free-market and nanny state that requires sophisticated policy makers to implement, which is why politics here is not treated as sports or entertainment. Top bureaucrats and cabinet ministers have their pay linked to top private sector wages, so most make well over $1 million a year, and their bonuses are tied to the country's annual G.D.P. growth rate. It means the government can attract high-quality professionals and corruption is low.
America never would or should copy Singapore's less-than-free politics. But Singapore has something to teach us about ''attitude'' -- about taking governing seriously and thinking strategically. We used to do that and must again because our little brick house with central heating is not going to be resistant to the storms much longer.
''There is real puzzlement here about America today,'' said Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, ''because we learned all about what it takes to build a well-functioning society from you. Many of our top officials are graduates of the Kennedy School at Harvard. They just came back home and applied its lessons vigorously.''

HEADLINE: Few Californians Understand the State's Tax System. Fact.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEBER. 
Jonathan Weber is editor in chief of The Bay Citizen. Jweber@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Jonathan Weber writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
Buried in a major new poll on Californians' attitudes toward government is a finding that explains many things: Only six percent of adults can identify where the bulk of the state's money comes from, and how it is spent.
If you don't understand the tax system, or how your tax dollars are being used, you're not going to be very comfortable with tax increases, or spending cuts, or anything else politicians might do to try to solve the state budget crisis. 
But you can't blame the public for not being able to follow the money. State and local finance in the state has become so byzantine that even the professionals barely understand it. Here, then, is an attempt to sort some of the myths from the facts.
MYTH The state budget crisis is the result of Proposition 13's limits on property taxes, combined with spendthrift politicians and greedy public employee unions.
FACT The state budget crisis is mainly the result of a crushing fall in revenue. In the pre-meltdown days of late 2007, the state legislative analyst's five-year forecast projected that in the 2011-12 fiscal year, the state would have revenue of about $125 billion. Now, revenue for that year is projected to be $83.5 billion. The dropoff results from lower income tax and sales tax collections, which account for more than two-thirds of all state revenue.
MYTH Local governments and schools are mostly financed by local property tax revenue.
FACT Proposition 13, by limiting local property taxes so dramatically, forced the state to step in as the main funder of many services. By way of example, Alameda County gets almost 30 percent of its total budget from the state, and an additional 18 percent from the federal government. Only 13 percent comes from property taxes. The city of Fremont, in Alameda County, gets about half its general fund revenue from property taxes, 16 percent from sales taxes, and the rest from a grab-bag of smaller revenue sources. (More than 75 percent of the city's budget is spent on police and fire protection.) The Fremont school district gets 29 percent of its funding directly from property taxes, with the bulk of its money coming from the state.
MYTH Local officials can decide how to spend local property tax revenue.
FACT Proposition 13 established a formula for divvying up property tax revenue among counties, cities, schools and assorted special districts. This formula varies by locality, but whatever the split was in 1978, when the landmark initiative was passed, remains the split today; the rules establishing this were part of the implementation of Proposition 13.
MYTH Proposition 13 has de-funded government across the board, forcing permanent, dramatic reductions in government services.
FACT California has high income and sales tax rates, and the state ranks in the upper tier nationally in overall tax burden. Both of these tax sources are much more volatile than property taxes, however, and decline much more quickly when the economy goes south.
MYTH Tinkering with Proposition 13 is political poison, and there is no chance anyone will take on this issue.
FACT Proposition 13 has been tinkered with many times, mainly to expand it (by allowing low tax assessments to be passed on within a family, for example). There is growing sentiment that applying Proposition 13 to business property, and maintaining the crazy-quilt of money flows among government entities that Proposition 13 has created, should be reconsidered.
MYTH Californians simply do not want to pay more taxes, routinely rejecting any ballot measure calling for tax increases.
FACT Many of the tax measures on local ballots in recent years -- especially so-called parcel taxes (a form of property tax) to bolster school funding -- have passed. The Public Policy Institute of California poll released last week found that a remarkable 71 percent of adults favor tax increases to help close the budget gap and prevent further cuts in education funding. Of course, how Californians will vote on Gov. Jerry Brown's proposal to extend a series of temporary tax increases remains to be seen.
Mr. Brown is determined to push many state government services to the local level, with the goal of creating a more direct connection between taxes paid and services received. This will take time -- but it's one key to heightening taxpayers' understanding and bringing rationality to state and local finances.

HEADLINE: PUSH COMES TO SHOVE: Technology helps ignite change (as in Tunisia). Except when it bolsters oppression (as in Iran).

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE. 
Scott Shane, a reporter in The Times's Washngton bureau, is the author of ''Dismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Fear is the dictator's traditional tool for keeping the people in check. But by cutting off Egypt's Internet and wireless service late last week in the face of huge street protests, President Hosni Mubarak betrayed his own fear -- that Facebook, Twitter, laptops and smartphones could empower his opponents, expose his weakness to the world and topple his regime.
There was reason for Mr. Mubarak to be shaken. By many accounts, the new arsenal of social networking helped accelerate Tunisia's revolution, driving the country's ruler of 23 years, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, into ignominious exile and igniting a conflagration that has spread across the Arab world at breathtaking speed. It was an apt symbol that a dissident blogger with thousands of followers on Twitter, Slim Amamou, was catapulted in a matter of days from the interrogation chambers of Mr. Ben Ali's regime to a new government post as minister for youth and sports. It was a marker of the uncertainty in Tunis that he had stepped down from the government by Thursday. 
Tunisia's uprising offers the latest encouragement for a comforting notion: that the same Web tools that so many Americans use to keep up with college pals and post passing thoughts have a more noble role as well, as a scourge of despotism. It was just 18 months ago, after all, that the same technologies were hailed as a factor in Iran's Green Revolution, the stirring street protests that followed the disputed presidential election.
But since that revolt collapsed, Iran has become a cautionary tale. The Iranian police eagerly followed the electronic trails left by activists, which assisted them in making thousands of arrests in the crackdown that followed. The government even crowd-sourced its hunt for enemies, posting on the Web the photos of unidentified demonstrators and inviting Iranians to identify them.
''The Iranian government has become much more adept at using the Internet to go after activists,'' said Faraz Sanei, who tracks Iran at Human Rights Watch. The Revolutionary Guard, the powerful political and economic force that protects the ayatollahs' regime, has created an online surveillance center and is believed to be behind a ''cyberarmy'' of hackers that it can unleash against opponents, he said.
Repressive regimes around the world may have fallen behind their opponents in recent years in exploiting new technologies -- not unexpected when aging autocrats face younger, more tech-savvy opponents. But in Minsk and Moscow, Tehran and Beijing, governments have begun to climb the steep learning curve and turn the new Internet tools to their own, antidemocratic purposes.
The countertrend has sparked a debate over whether the conventional wisdom that the Internet and social networking inherently tip the balance of power in favor of democracy is mistaken. A new book, ''The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom,'' by a young Belarus-born American scholar, Evgeny Morozov, has made the case most provocatively, describing instance after instance of strongmen finding ways to use new media to their advantage.
After all, the very factors that have brought Facebook and similar sites such commercial success have huge appeal for a secret police force. A dissident's social networking and Twitter feed is a handy guide to his political views, his career, his personal habits and his network of like-thinking allies, friends and family. A cybersurfing policeman can compile a dossier on a regime opponent without the trouble of the street surveillance and telephone tapping required in a pre-Net world.
If Mr. Mubarak's Egypt has resorted to the traditional blunt instrument against dissent in a crisis -- cutting off communications altogether -- other countries have shown greater sophistication. In Belarus, officers of the K.G.B. -- the secret police agency has preserved its Soviet-era name -- now routinely quote activists' comments on Facebook and other sites during interrogations, said Alexander Lukashuk, director of the Belarus service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Last month, he said, investigators appearing at the apartment of a Belarusian photojournalist mocked her by declaring that since she had written online that they usually conducted their searches at night, they had decided to come in the morning.
In Syria, ''Facebook is a great database for the government now,'' said Ahed al-Hindi, a Syrian activist who was arrested at an Internet cafe in Damascus in 2006 and left his country after being released from jail. Mr. Hindi, now with the United States-based group CyberDissidents.org, said he believes that Facebook is doing more good than harm, helping activists form virtual organizations that could never survive if they met face to face. But users must be aware that they are speaking to their oppressors as well as their friends, he said.
Widney Brown, senior director of international law and policy at Amnesty International, said the popular networking services, like most technologies, are politically neutral.
''There's nothing deterministic about these tools -- Gutenberg's press, or fax machines or Facebook,'' Ms. Brown said. ''They can be used to promote human rights or to undermine human rights.''
This is the point of Mr. Morozov, 26, a visiting scholar at Stanford. In ''The Net Delusion,'' he presents an answer to the ''cyberutopians'' who assume that the Internet inevitably fuels democracy. He coined the term ''spinternet'' to capture the spin applied to the Web by governments that are beginning to master it.
In China, Mr. Morozov said, thousands of commentators are trained and paid -- hence their nickname, the 50-Cent Party -- to post pro-government comments on the Web and steer online opinion away from criticism of the Communist Party. In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez, after first denouncing hostile Twitter comments as ''terrorism,'' created his own Twitter feed -- an entertaining mix of politics and self-promotion that now has 1.2 million followers.
In Russia, Mr. Morozov noted, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin has managed to co-opt several prominent new-media entrepreneurs, including Konstantin Rykov, whose many Web sites now skew strongly pro-Putin and whose anti-Georgia documentary about the Russia-Georgia war of 2008 went viral on the Web.
Mr. Morozov acknowledges that social networking ''definitely helps protesters to mobilize.''
''But is it making protest more likely? I don't think so.''
In Egypt, it appears, at least some activists share Mr. Morozov's wariness about the double-edged nature of new media. An anonymous 26-page leaflet that appeared in Cairo with practical advice for demonstrators last week, The Guardian reported, instructed activists to pass it on by e-mail and photocopy -- but not by Facebook and Twitter, because they were being monitored by the government.
Then Mr. Mubarak's government, evidently concluding that it was too late for mere monitoring, unplugged his country from the Internet altogether. It was a desperate move from an autocrat who had not learned to harness the tools his opponents have embraced.

HEADLINE: Lockout Is Strategy With Risks For Owners

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
The N.F.L. has never been more popular. Both conference championship games last Sunday drew more than 50 million viewers, or twice the number who tuned into the season debut of ''American Idol.'' The N.F.L. has never generated more revenue -- commanding $4 billion from its broadcast partners and raking in nearly $9 billion in 2010 for what is inarguably the nation's favorite sport.
When Green Bay meets Pittsburgh in Super Bowl XLV next Sunday in Arlington, Tex., it is a good bet that it will become the most-watched television show in American broadcast history, surpassing last year's record 106.5 million viewers who tuned in to watch the New Orleans Saints win their first Super Bowl.
But to hear N.F.L. officials describe it as a March 3 deadline approaches to reach a collective bargaining agreement with its players, the league stands on an economic precipice. 
''The time to address the adjustment in your business model is now, not when you are driving off the cliff,'' said Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, who built the $1.2 billion Cowboys Stadium that is hosting the Super Bowl.
It is not only the first time in the history of the N.F.L.'s labor strife that owners are willing to lock out their players, but also the first time they have acknowledged that they made a bad deal. The owners are on the offensive because they want to reclaim 18 percent of the revenue -- or $1 billion -- that they currently share with the players, as well as lengthen the season to 18 games.
To veterans of these sports labor battles, it is a risky strategy because the N.F.L must explain to fans who have paid exorbitant sums for personal seat licenses and season tickets why it is willing to risk closing down its business when business is good.
''What happens in these disputes is that economic issues are presented as moral issues -- good versus evil,'' said Fay Vincent, a former commissioner of Major League Baseball who presided over the 1990 lockout. ''But it's hard to look at these circumstances and not see a case of owners' wanting their cake and eating it, too.''
The three previous N.F.L. work stoppages, in 1974, 1982 and 1987, were prompted by the players who went on strike. The arguments then were centered on free agency and were more theoretical, according to Michael MacCambridge, the author of ''America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation.''
''Since '93, of course, one of the strengths of the N.F.L. was that there was very little posturing at all,'' he said. ''The '93 deal had a poison pill for both sides, giving each an incentive to renew prior to the deal going into its last year, and so the deal was often renewed before the time it would become a public concern.
''This was a very good thing for the league, because it's spared the N.F.L. all of the self-inflicted wounds that the other leagues suffered over the same period.''
In 2008, N.F.L. owners unanimously voted to opt out of the current deal and have been raising the specter of a lockout ever since. Lately, they have been taking the fight to their fans. Commissioner Roger Goodell warned five million N.F.L. fans in an e-mail that the economics ''have changed dramatically'' since the last contract was negotiated in 2006 and a ''10 percent unemployment rate hurts us all.'' Goodell has vowed to cut his salary to $1 if a settlement is not reached before the current deal expires.
The league and the union have employed Twitter, Facebook and Web sites devoted to the possible lockout in an effort to win the hearts and minds of the fans. Just as the union has struggled to keep its 1,500 members in line, the N.F.L has struggled to keep the owners of its 32 teams on message.
The Pittsburgh Steelers' Dan Rooney, one of the most respected owners in the league, said last week that he was against the management position that an 18-game regular season is necessary and that the extra revenue it would generate would facilitate a deal.
''We play enough games,'' said Rooney, the United States ambassador to Ireland. ''You have a system that works. Why add them?''
And for every hard-line owner like Jones or Jerry Richardson of the Carolina Panthers, there is an Arthur Blank, who owns the Atlanta Falcons and wants to build a stadium to replace the 18-year-old Georgia Dome.
''It's not a matter of it being sick,'' Blank said of the N.F.L. ''It's a matter of creating a model that is a sustainable one for the long-term health of the industry and for the game for all the fans and stakeholders.''
Currently, 10 N.F.L. stadiums are 100 percent publicly financed and 19 are at least 75 percent publicly financed. Next Sunday, however, a global audience will get a look at Cowboys Stadium, which is also commonly referred to as the Death Star. Owners see their own stadium as a way to improve their business and generate more revenue, but they risk alienating fans who see a monument to the N.F.L.'s boom times.
Jeff Pash, an N.F.L. executive vice president and the lead negotiator, said that the league expected the fans to grasp what -- up to this point at least -- the union has not: ''We have healthy revenue, but it's not endless.''
The Green Bay Packers are publicly held and the only franchise to release its financial records. The team's operating profit fell 71 percent to $9.8 million in the year ended last March 31 from $34.2 million in the year ended March 31, 2007 -- the start of the current collective bargaining agreement.
Even though revenue rose 18 percent in that period to $257.9 million, player salaries and benefits swelled to $160.8 million from $110.7 million and reduced overall profit.
''Every fan in America sits down every night and balances their budgets and expenses,'' Pash said. ''I think fans understand that the worst thing you can do is pretend that the problem doesn't exist and kick the can down the road five years. We're saying the status quo is not acceptable.''
John Clark, a professor of sport management at Robert Morris University near Pittsburgh, says he is not certain average fans can equate how they manage their own budget with owners trying to claw savings out of an average N.F.L. franchise, which is now worth $1.02 billion, according to Forbes.
''They have enumerated their points to people's sense of running a more sound business,'' Clark said. ''When you talk about that much money, I'm not sure anyone is buying it.''
Whether the N.F.L owners are grandstanding or indeed willing to sideline their golden goose remains to be seen. But for N.F.L. fans who are the engine of the league's growth, their last look at an N.F.L. game for the foreseeable future might come next Sunday.
Vincent, the former baseball commissioner, wondered if the risk they appear willing to take is truly worth it.
''The N.F.L. is the premier sports business in the country by a large margin,'' Vincent said. ''There is only one way to go, and that is down. It's pretty dangerous to tamper with fans' passion and good will.''

AFGHANS TO STOP RECRUITING
Children for Police Force
Stung by its inclusion in the United Nations' blacklist of countries where child soldiers are commonly used, Afghanistan is expected to sign a formal agreement with the United Nations to stop the recruitment of children into its police forces and ban the common practice of boys' being used as sex slaves by military commanders, according to Afghan and United Nations officials. With the agreement on an action plan to combat the problem, the government will for the first time officially acknowledge the problem of child sex slaves. Page 4

HEADLINE: READERS COMMENTS; To Serve More Air Travelers, Think High-Speed Rail

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The New York region's two largest airports, already choked with crowds and delays, may need to be radically reconfigured so they can make way for vitally needed additional runways that would help accommodate a projected increase of almost 50 million air travelers per year within two or three decades, according to a new study.
The study, from the Regional Plan Association, calls for as much as $15 billion to be spent at Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports. At Newark, all three terminals would have to be at least partially razed, then rebuilt; at Kennedy, part of Jamaica Bay might have to be filled to create space for one or more new runways. 
The proposed expansions would amount to the most ambitious reshaping of any of the region's major airports in several decades. They would require significant changes in the region's airspace, a modernization of the system for controlling air traffic and at least one act of Congress.
If the proposals are accepted by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy, Newark and La Guardia Airports, they would surely encounter stiff resistance from local and national advocates for the environment, the report admits. They would also have to survive the political tug of war between the governors of New York and New Jersey, who jointly control the Port Authority.
The report, which was financed in part by the Port Authority, was scheduled to be presented at a daylong conference on the future of the airports in Manhattan on Thursday.
Christopher Ward, the executive director of the Port Authority, was scheduled to attend the conference and was expected to discuss the report as fodder for planning. Asked for comment, a spokesman for Mr. Ward said only that ''we look forward to examining this study.''
The study considered a spectrum of options that stretched to the fantastic: a new airport on an island in New York Bay. But the cost was deemed to be ''exorbitant.''
Elected officials and business leaders have discussed airport expansion for years, but have been reluctant to broach the idea publicly to avoid stirring up opposition too soon, said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City. But, Ms. Wylde added, ''It's become very clear that our economic future depends on investment both in the technology and facilities upgrades and runway expansion at the regional airports.''
For years, the local airspace has been too clogged to consider adding any more traffic. Indeed, federal regulators have placed limits on the number of flights each hour to and from the region's airports. But the federal government is planning to upgrade the nation's air traffic control system with a program known as NextGen that will allow more planes to squeeze into the region, said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a transportation analyst who is one of the report's authors.
Once the first phase of NextGen is in operation, the Port Authority should seek to have the caps on flights lifted and begin making room for new runways and gates to accommodate the increasing traffic, the report says. It estimates that traffic at the three airports will increase steadily from about 104 million passengers annually last year to 150 million passengers within 20 to 30 years. Mr. Zupan said that the airports currently cannot handle more than about 110 million passengers a year.
The Port Authority has been grappling with how to alleviate congestion at its major airports; in 2007, it acquired a long-term lease on Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, N.Y., with the purpose of making it the region's fourth major airport. That goal has yet to be realized, and the new plan suggests that the Port Authority's money and efforts would be better spent at Kennedy and Newark.
The question of the Port Authority's mission arose again this month when New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, asked for $1.8 billion to build and repair roads and bridges in North Jersey. New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, demanded that the Port Authority refuse that request, because, he said, the agency should devote its resources to grand plans that would benefit the economy of the entire region.
The cost estimates are preliminary and vary widely depending on which of several options for expanding Kennedy would be chosen, according to the report. The authors laid out seven proposals for adding runway space at Kennedy, some of which would require filling in more of the bay than others.
At Newark, they concluded, the only feasible way to expand would be to add a runway between the existing terminals and the two main runways in use there now. Doing that would require the demolition of all of Terminal B and parts of Terminals A and C, Mr. Zupan said.
Rebuilding the terminals in Newark could cost as much as $5 billion, which could raise the total cost of the expansion to $15 billion, the report says. But it estimates that not expanding the airports could cost the region $16 billion a year in lost airfare, as well as up to 125,000 jobs and $6 billion in annual wages.
At Kennedy, expansion could cost anywhere from $1 billion to $3.5 billion, depending on whether one or two runways are added and how they are configured, the report says. It lays out seven possible configurations at Kennedy, some of which involve reorienting the flight path into and out of the airport. Doing so would bring those flights into closer conflict with planes going to and from La Guardia, which the Federal Aviation Administration might find unacceptable, Mr. Zupan said.
Among the alternatives, he said, would be to fill in part of Jamaica Bay and construct a new runway parallel to the existing runway used by the giant trans-Atlantic passenger jets. Getting approval for that option would entail not only overcoming opposition from environmental groups but also changing the federal law that created the Gateway National Recreation Area, which explicitly prohibits expanding the airport into the bay.
A section of the bay known as Grassy Bay contains a deep trench that was dug during construction at the airport in the 1950s, the report says. That trench has some negative effects on the surrounding bay, which might be ameliorated if it were filled in during the construction of a runway, Mr. Zupan said.
But John Waldman, a professor of biology at Queens College, said he was skeptical about that trade-off and imagined it would not occur without a ''fierce battle.'' While he said that filling the trench to level the bottom of the bay probably would be beneficial, he said he could not see the benefits outweighing the cost of encroaching on one of the ''ecological jewels'' of the region.
''I don't see that as a clear trade of equal value,'' Professor Waldman said.

HEADLINE: Curbing Closing Costs

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
BORROWERS have some weapons for keeping closing costs down, the result of recent guidelines requiring lenders to disclose certain fees, but perhaps the most underutilized consumer tool simply involves old-fashioned haggling.
Good-faith estimate rules, part of a tougher Truth in Lending Act that emerged from the mortgage crisis, mean that lenders must provide a clear picture of the costs involved in buying or refinancing a home. Yet consumers may not realize that some of those numbers are actually negotiable, mortgage experts say.
''There's a lot of room for negotiation in the costs of closing,'' said Barry Zigas, the director of housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer advocacy group, ''and consumers should examine every charge and not hesitate to challenge them and try to bring them down.'' 
Closing costs can run a borrower 3 to 6 percent of the price of a property, according to the Federal Reserve. In 2010, the average cost for a $200,000 purchase rose by nearly 37 percent, to $3,741, according to Bankrate.com, a financial data publisher; the average in New York State was $5,623.
Most borrowers pay less attention to closing costs, focusing instead on the interest rate offered by a lender. But because many of the fees associated with closing are not set in stone, mortgage experts say, consumers should review the line-by-line estimates with a view toward challenging them. Lenders are required to outline all the estimated closing costs within three days of receiving a loan application.
The standard good-faith-estimate form used by lenders makes it easier to compare the terms offered by lenders, and it lists the services a borrower can shop around for, versus those selected by the lender.
John T. Mechem, the vice president for public affairs of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said borrowers should ''simply ask the lender which fees are negotiable and which are fixed.''
''Sometimes a borrower can shop for individual services and find a cheaper alternative to the provider that the lender uses,'' Mr. Mechem said.
Mr. Zigas agreed. ''Ask, 'Who is getting paid this fee, and why am I being asked to pay it?' '' he said.
The good-faith-estimate rules say that certain charges cannot increase at closing, including those for loan origination and points paid to the lender to reduce a locked interest rate, with 1 point equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. But borrowers can negotiate those charges.
Some other charges can rise up to 10 percent, including title services and appraisals, regardless of whether the borrower chooses providers listed by the lender or shops around. In general, charges for any required services that the lender selects or that the borrower shops around for, using companies selected by the lender, can rise 10 percent.
For a $200,000 home with a 5 percent down payment, the settlement costs of that $190,000 loan, not including reserves for property taxes and down payment, typically range from $6,235 to $19,930, according to the Federal Reserve. The loan origination fee can range from $2,130 to $3,105; the application fee, typically from $65 to $640; and points can add $5,700.
While regulators discourage lenders from overestimating costs, they don't penalize them for doing so.
Therefore, borrowers should understand that ''it's not a time to be polite,'' said Kathleen Day, a spokeswoman for the Center for Responsible Lending, an advocacy group. ''You have to have a strong stomach and a stiff spine and not bow to pressure from the other side of the table to close the deal,'' she said, even in this tight credit environment.
For a refinancing of your primary residence, you can generally cancel your mortgage application for up to three days after closing, with fees refunded.

HEADLINE: Report Tracks Increasing Anxiety

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
Garden City
DR. BRUCE STILLMAN, the president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, hires a lot of scientists. But most of the 1,130 postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, medical doctors and others don't live on the Island. They commute from Brooklyn or Manhattan.
''They don't want to live on the two acres or the quarter acre'' that typifies suburban plots, Dr. Stillman said. The 24- to 32-year-olds entering the work force after a decade in higher education aren't ready to ''spend their weekends mowing the lawn.'' 
Instead, this global cache of high-tech workers ''want to live in other communities with people like them,'' cities or villages with ''cool downtowns.'' On the Island, such places are scarce.
Dr. Stillman discussed these issues on Jan. 20 at Adelphi University in Garden City, at the unveiling of the Long Island Index 2011 Report on the Island's economy and quality of life. As a housing problem emblematic of the area, the lab's residential angst seemed relevant to an event titled ''Getting It Done: Aligning Long Island's Development Processes with Sustainable Economic Growth.''
''If we can't provide the housing the scientists need and the types of vibrant communities that young researchers want,'' Dr. Stillman said, ''we will face barriers to success that should not exist.'' Unsuitable housing, he said, might keep spin-off companies out of the area, or hinder the research center's plan to team with Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory on an innovation center. Moving forward, Dr. Stillman said, he hopes housing challenges will not become ''our Achilles' heel.''
The report -- prepared by the Regional Plan Association and relying on surveys of planning and building officials in towns, cities and incorporated villages -- confirmed that with 20 percent of its housing as rental units, the Island has a smaller stock of rental housing ''than any other part of the metropolitan region.''
Ann Golob, the director of the Index, put it this way: ''We are the king of the single-family home, with few rentals, condos, town houses or garden apartments as options for those who don't want, or can't afford, a single-family home.''
Long Islanders are ever more anxious about how they can maintain their lifestyle, the report found. An affordable home -- defined as costing no more than $254,500, or two and a half times the 2009 median income for the region -- ''has become a rare commodity.'' Average pay is at a 10-year low, down 3 percent from 2000, while average wages across the nation have grown 4 percent.
Leonie Huddy, the director of the Center for Survey Research at Stony Brook University, which conducted the poll, compared the Island with other suburbs. ''Taxes always come up as the single most important problem,'' she said, adding that 81 percent of Long Islanders describe property taxes as a serious or extremely serious issue.
''We also have angst about young people leaving the Island,'' she said, noting that 75 percent of those surveyed called the problem serious, versus 48 percent in Westchester County and 44 percent in New Jersey. There are 15 percent fewer 25- to 34-year-olds on the Island than in 2000; the decline is the largest in the region.
More than 60 percent of Long Islanders cited lack of affordable housing as a very or extremely serious problem, and 50 percent reported having trouble paying the rent or mortgage. Substantially more people see these as troublesome issues in Long Island than in northern New Jersey, Westchester or Connecticut.
Also, only 21 percent of those neighboring suburbs rated the Island as an excellent or good place to live. ''In the 1950s,'' Ms. Golob said, ''we were the most desirable suburban location, envied by our neighbors for our affordability, beauty and jobs. No more. Our neighbors are disenchanted with our traffic, high taxes and expensive cost of living.''
Nancy Rauch Douzinas, the president of the Rauch Foundation, which sponsors the Index, said that previously it had studied how reconfiguring downtown areas could ease the Island's housing, job and tax woes with minor impact on single-family neighborhoods or open space. Last year it identified 8,300 acres of potential land in more than 150 downtowns and rail station areas, mostly in parking lots.
''We need 21st-century solutions to replace the 1950s ones,'' Ms. Douzinas said, ''and we need to revise, redesign and adapt our habitat for living.''
This time, with the focus on planning, the Index drew up a Top 10 list of impediments to downtown development. Among them, it found, ''No two municipalities function the same.'' Because of the tangled web of incorporated and unincorporated villages, towns, cities and counties, ''different rules, different processes, different staffing levels'' make it hard to get things done.
How long does it take to move through the approval process?
''Seventy percent of jurisdictions do not set target dates for planning reviews,'' Ms. Golob said, adding that ''timelines for project approvals and building reviews are indefinite and variable,'' hampering ''even the most well-designed projects.''
Successful revitalization projects studied by the Index's researchers ''started with a comprehensive plan defining what the residents wanted,'' she added. They ''did not start with a proposal from a developer that then had to be tweaked, changed, argued, bargained about.''
The low number of rental units isn't surprising. Rental units are not allowed without a special permit; in 45 percent of villages they aren't allowed at all. Accessory housing is prohibited in 70 percent of villages. ''Our codes make it hard or downright impossible to build them,'' Ms. Golob said.

SCORECASTING
The Hidden Influences Behind How Sports Are Played and Games Are Won
By Tobias J. Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim
278 pp. Crown Archetype. $26.
Defense doesn't win championships. Teamwork isn't what it's cracked up to be. Momentum is a myth. And the Chicago Cubs aren't cursed; they just stink.
Conventional wisdom, sports division, takes a beating in ''Scorecasting,'' a book aimed at unsettling serious fans with essays that debunk ingrained strategy (punting on fourth down is largely a waste); malign the approach of champion athletes (Tiger Woods is foolishly less aggressive when he's putting for birdie than for par); and offer a number of otherwise eye-opening assertions (officials in all sports are biased). For their arguments, the authors, Tobias J. Moskowitz, a behavioral economist at the University of Chicago, and L. Jon Wertheim, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated, have whipped up a recipe that includes statistical analysis, psychological theory, creative sociology and a brash confidence in circumstantial evidence. If that sounds a little familiar, well, they owe a debt to Malcolm Gladwell and the ''Freakonomics'' boys. 
In any case, the results are alternately irritating, vexing, provocative and entertaining -- and convincing more often than not. Indeed, for most readers the fun will involve sputtering ''But, but, but . . .'' and mustering counterarguments.
For example, in a chapter titled ''The Myth of the Hot Hand,'' the authors declare that in sports, momentum, a k a ''Old Mo,'' doesn't really exist, that no matter how many home runs a slugger belts in a week, no matter how many games in a row a team wins, the likelihood of success in the next at-bat or the next game is no different than it is when no hot streak exists. Statistics prove this is so; the numbers say that a streak of any sort is simply an expected variation in an extended, observable pattern of events, the way a coin is likely to come up heads 10 times in a row at some point if you toss it 10,000 times.
For this reason and a few others, the authors say, the basketball strategy of passing to a shooter on a hot streak is more often than not a loser. They argue interestingly (and sensibly) that one thing that happens to shooters on a streak is that they succumb to hubris and begin taking more difficult shots. Fair enough. Still, even if a streak is not a predictor of future success, does that mean that no momentum existed while the streak was going on? That for a period of time whose length was unforeseeable, a player saw the basket with enhanced clarity or a team played with special cohesion and confidence? Doesn't that constitute momentum? And for coaches, who are supposed to be experienced observers of their players, isn't it a reasonable gamble to play a hunch from time to time and feed the hot hand?
Some of the subjects taken up in ''Scorecasting'' are less worthwhile than others. That a blocked shot in basketball that goes out of bounds is less valuable to the team on defense than a blocked shot that lands in the hands of a teammate strikes me as self-evident. And that defense wins championships, or that, in any sport, defense is more important than offense, is the sort of nonsensical tenet that doesn't need disproving any more than, say, ''Life is like a box of chocolates.'' The authors spend several pages disproving it nonetheless. Anyway, the issue was better and more succinctly settled in a quip often (though perhaps not accurately) attributed to Casey Stengel: ''Good pitching will always stop good hitting -- and vice versa.''
The authors are at their most titillating -- and, unfortunately, their most smug -- when they're playing shrink, attributing quite a number of statistically quantifiable sports phenomena to certain psychological concepts.
One says that humans are more likely to judge an act of commission -- for instance, a referee's calling a penalty -- to be intrusive or consequential than they are an act of restraint. So even though the ref who doesn't throw a flag can be just as wrong as the ref who does, and even though his nonact can put an equivalent skew on the game, we judge him -- and he judges himself -- less harshly. This so-called omission bias is borne out statistically in several sports, the authors demonstrate, citing umpires who call fewer strikes when the hitter already has two and basketball referees who call fewer loose-ball fouls on star players than on nonstars.
The authors also place great stock in what psychologists call risk aversion, or loss aversion, which states that humans are motivated more forcefully by a fear of losing than by a desire for winning. When a coach always employs well-worn strategies on the field; when an owner declines to hire a successful but unconventional coach; when a golfer takes a firmer stroke on a par putt to fight off a bogey than he does on a birdie putt because he is still safely under par, he is being risk averse, often to his detriment. Statistics (and one brave high school coach in Arkansas) show, for example, that over the long haul, punting on fourth down is a fool's errand; as for golf, a putt is a stroke, no matter what the circumstances.
By far the most startling and resonant chapters in the book deal with the authors' search for the reasons behind home-field advantage, which the numbers prove exists across all sports. Using clever techniques to isolate elements of the game that can be accurately measured, they manage to dismiss some conventional explanations -- that players respond to the cheers and jeers of the crowd, for one.
In the end, they determine, stunningly, that home-field advantage in virtually all sports is largely due to the bias of officials toward the home team. Soccer referees call more penalties against the visitors and allow more injury time when the home team is behind. In baseball, though the authors are a little naive about the art of calling balls and strikes (no one, not even the players, wants or expects the umpires to call a strict rule-book strike), their numbers are, well, striking: fewer called strikes, especially in crucial situations, against the home team. In basketball, the authors write, ''the chance of a visiting player getting called for traveling is 15 percent higher than it is for a home-team player.''
The authors attribute this not to a widespread conspiracy but to a common psychological trope: people want to be liked and to be confirmed in their judgments. Maybe so. I do wish the authors had been less rhetorically presumptuous in attributing behavioral predilections to groups of people and even individuals on circumstantial grounds. Most of their conclusions are, after all, subject to debate.
To wit: Moskowitz and Wertheim's study of icing the place-kicker -- that is, calling timeout to ratchet up the pressure on him -- concluded that the strategy is ineffectual; kickers kick successfully to virtually the same percentage whether iced or not. In December, however, The New York Times reported on a different study that had found otherwise, that iced kickers are less successful than room-temperature ones.

HEADLINE: Messages From the Wilderness, via Satellite

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG. 
E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AH, wilderness. The great outdoors, the fresh air -- and the spotty cellphone coverage. But hikers, adventurers and others in remote places who want to send messages now have a new alternative when the signal vanishes: they can send texts using a satellite network instead.
You can't send your version of ''War and Peace'' -- the limits of the messages are typically 41 to 120 characters -- but you can send dispatches from the woods announcing: ''Chain on bike broke, will be late'' or ''Pick me up. I'm not having fun.'' And you can make specific requests for emergency help if necessary. 
For the last several years, people heading to remote areas have been able to buy an device from a company called Spot that sends requests for help via satellite. The device also allows people to add a preprogrammed message, but it cannot send an original text.
Now, new hand-held devices from Spot allow people in the wild to compose and beam short, original text messages via satellite, and even send e-mail, Twitter feeds and Facebook updates. Other companies, too, have introduced text messengers that work via satellite.
And while it has been possible for some time to make voice calls in remote areas with satellite telephones, their use has been limited because of their high cost.
The new message technology provides a more economical alternative. It offers an additional layer of security in the wilderness so long as you use it properly, said Jason Stevenson of Lancaster, Pa., author of ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Backpacking and Hiking.''
''The problem with cellphones is reliability in back country, miles from the road,'' Mr. Stevenson said. ''That's why these new satellite devices are so helpful. They work just about everywhere so long as you have a clear line of sight to the sky,'' and no narrow canyon wall or dense foliage that blocks the satellite links required for a connection.
But before setting out with the new gadgets, users should take time to understand the technology and its limits. ''The mechanics of using a satellite-connected device in the woods are not as simple as whipping out your cellphone and calling,'' he said.
To send messages, users key the text into a GPS unit or a smartphone linked to a transmitter, which sends the message skyward to the satellite system. A GPS receiver from DeLorme, the Earthmate PN-60w, sold as a pair with the Spot Satellite Communicator, costs $549.95 at L.L. Bean. Users must also pay for satellite service ($99.99 for a year) and the sending of original messages ($50 for 500), said Derek Moore, a spokesman for Spot, which is a subsidiary of Globalstar, a satellite network company in Covington, La. The system is one-way; users can send texts but not receive them.
In February, Spot will introduce a free smartphone application to be paired with another Spot transmitter called the Spot Connect ($150). Users type their text messages on Android-based phones linked wirelessly by Bluetooth to the Spot Connect device, Mr. Moore said. An app for iPhones will be arriving shortly, he said. The basic service charge will be $99.99 a year.
Before they head for the forest, users must go to the Spot Web site and set up contact information for the people they may want to reach, said Tim Flight, editor of GPSReview.net in Carrabassett Valley, Me. Once on the trail, the DeLorme GPS unit shows the contacts' names. ''You pick the people and key in your message,'' he said.
For an additional $50 a year, Spot will track users' routes, reporting their locations every 10 minutes on Google maps on the Web site, Mr. Moore said.
Michael Bramel, a volunteer overseer for the Appalachian Trail who lives in Gettysburg, Pa., likes the service.
''My wife can go to the Web site and see how far I've gotten,'' he said. His mother likes it, too. On his way to visit her over the holidays, he put the Spot into the car, and ''she could click on the Web site and see how close I was,'' he said.
Messages sent by the new satellite systems fill an unusual niche, said Jonathan Dorn, editor of Backpacker magazine, who has been testing the Spot-DeLorme pair.
''Hikers love to tell stories,'' he said. ''Historically, we have to wait until we get home.'' Now some of those stories can be told in real time. ''It's wonderful to be able to communicate spontaneously this way with a device that fits in the palm of your hand,'' he said.
GeoPro of Mississauga, Ontario, offers a satellite-based device that allows users not only to send texts but also to receive them, said Morris Shawn, the company's president. The cost varies from $600 to $700 for the device, he said, with monthly fees for service through Iridium's satellite network typically $35 to $50.
And if texting is not enough, the classic solution, a satellite telephone, is available at a price. For example, a lightweight Iridium 9555 satellite telephone is a best seller at www.globalcomsatphone.com, said Steve Manley, the site's president ($1,268 plus service; one option is $39 a month, plus $1.39 a minute). The phone works anywhere with a view of the sky, he said. Mr. Manley, who flies a plane in his free time, has the phone on board -- and a Spot on the dashboard so his family can follow his route online.

HEADLINE: Revitalizing the Arts Scene in an Effort to Rejuvenate the Town

BYLINE: By REEVE HAMILTON. 
rhamilton@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Disclosure: My great-grandfather was in the movie business.
That is, he owned and operated the Mission Theatre in Menard, a town on the edge of West Texas whose population peaked at 2,674 nearly six decades ago. The building has been mostly dormant since he closed the theater in 1953. It flooded in 1980, and a decade later the roof collapsed. In the years before a new one could be put on, trees began to grow through the floor.
In 2010, Kaci Kothmann formed the Mission Theatre Restoration Foundation, a small band of Menard residents who hope to reopen the theater. ''It would be fantastic for the community,'' Ms. Kothmann said. ''To help create business, create revenue, create some interest and hopefully put Menard a little bit more on the map.''
That statement is music to the ears of Amy Barbee, the executive director at the Texas Cultural Trust, which is leading a push to redefine the state's understanding of the role of the arts as a driver of economic growth, not just cultural niceties. With financial hardships making people keep their wallets snapped shut, and as the Legislature looks to scale back the state's spending by up to $27 billion over the next two years, expenditures that are seen as luxuries may quickly be cut. 
''It's more than fluff,'' Ms. Barbee said. ''We want to tell the qualitative and quantitative story that the arts truly are economic development.''
Creative industries -- from advertising to dance companies to book publishing -- generate $4.5 billion per year in economic activity for Texas. To highlight that fact, the trust, in association with the Texas Commission on the Arts, is releasing a new report this week, prepared by TXP Inc., an Austin-based consulting firm, and paid for with federal stimulus dollars.
''The Art of Economic Development,'' as it is called, looks at five arts-driven economies in Texas. Austin's many music festivals, Houston's thriving theater scene and the Dallas Arts District are not among them. Instead, in order to provide models that any locality could follow, the report features more unlikely communities like Amarillo, El Paso, Rockport, Texarkana and a tiny town in Bosque County in north central Texas that Ms. Barbee said might be Menard's best model: Clifton, population 3,795.
''When I moved here in 2001, this downtown was basically dead,'' Fred Volcansek, the mayor of Clifton, said over coffee in the White Horse Station, a spacious diner and gallery space since 2007 -- before that, a building on the verge of being condemned. The rest of the block and the surrounding downtown area have been similarly refurbished, including the Cliftex Theatre, the state's oldest continuously operated movie theater. The local arts center now attracts more than triple the town's population each year. ''Less and less am I hearing, 'Where's Clifton?' '' Mr. Volcansek said.
''My view is that the arts have always been in Bosque County,'' said George Larson, the director of the Bosque Museum in Clifton. ''It's been kind of sub rosa.''
Clifton has served as the quiet home for a small, growing band of the state's most respected Western artists since James Boren and Melvin Warren, a favorite of President Lyndon B. Johnson, moved there in the 1960s.
Recently a coordinated effort that Mr. Volcansek describes as ''picking the low-hanging fruit'' has brought the arts decidedly to the fore. In its report, TXP estimates that approximately 20 percent of the tourism and visitor spending in Clifton is art- and culture-related. In 2009, the report says, this directly generated $2.4 million in economic activity, $1.1 million in earnings and about 36 permanent jobs.
Clifton's art scene is not immune to the economic crunch, though. Smokey Kettler, who runs a downtown gallery, said business had been slow. The thing about art, he said, is that ''you can't eat it, and you can't put it in your gas tank.'' To get by, Mr. Kettler runs a real estate office out of the same building.
But other businesses are trying to leverage the arts indirectly. In January, Gary McKibben opened the Red Caboose Winery near downtown Clifton. He also has plans for a restaurant and a hotel, but that depends on the success of the wine business.
He distinguishes his wine by labeling the bottles with paintings by local artists. ''Not only will the wine have literal roots here,'' he said. ''We're incorporating the local art and giving it a real regional, Clifton identity.''
Now Clifton is in the process of taking its case to the state in hopes of being designated a Cultural District, of which there are currently 12 in the state -- including 2 in Houston. ''Can you imagine sitting and saying Clifton in the same breath with Houston?'' Mr. Volcansek said. ''Those are all the things that help us be stronger and more effective.''
In 2005, the Texas Legislature passed a bill authored by State Representative Larry Phillips, Republican of Sherman, that created the concept of Cultural Districts. It was just, as Mr. Phillips said, ''base legislation'' that did not come with any financing. The designation comes with recognition, a large dose of free advertising by the state and eligibility for certain grants from the Texas Commission on the Arts and the Texas Historical Commission.
But the designation does not come with any state money. Carlton Schwab, president and chief executive of the Texas Economic Development Council, put it bluntly: getting the legislators to fork over more money for the arts, he said, ''ain't gonna happen.'' Currently, Texas is ranked 46th in legislative appropriations (per capita) by the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies.
That ranking is not likely to change -- unless, of course, it gets lower. ''At the end of the day,'' Mr. Phillips said, ''we have to take care of education and some of the priorities we all know are priorities.''
The draft budgets currently circulating in the Capitol, at first glance, appear to increase financing for the Texas Commission on the Arts. But that's misleading, said Jim Bob McMillan, the commission's deputy director, because the state's financing has been increasingly supplemented by an endowment that was recently dissolved.
While the draft budget looks like an increase, Mr. McMillan said, ''it's about half of what it was before. If it goes forward like this, we'll reduce staff and how we spend those dollars.'' Specifically, money that the commission gets from the Texas Department of Transportation to promote tourism, which is currently used for the Cultural District initiative, would be lost.
Ultimately, said Travis James, a vice president at TXP, the key for these communities lies in public-private partnerships between regional organizations. ''Neither side can do it on their own,'' he said. He cited Amarillo, where private donations exceeding $30 million helped build a new performing arts facility, the Globe-News Center, which is now run by the city. In 2009, the center generated $3.8 million in economic activity.
Woody Hunt, an El Paso businessman whom Texas Monthly recently named one of the state's 25 most powerful people, agreed.
''It goes hand in hand with being able to attract and retain a work force with high levels of education,'' he said. ''You have to create circumstances for them to want to be there -- art being a good example.''
That's what Ms. Kothmann hopes to bring to Menard. The Mission Theatre Restoration Foundation, she said, is just starting.
''A lot of people think it happens overnight, but it certainly takes a long time.'' Mr. Volcansek said. ''There's an opportunity there, but you've got to work at it. You've got to make it happen.''

COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- In another time or place, the game of ''What Are You?'' that was played one night last fall at the University of Maryland might have been mean, or menacing: Laura Wood's peers were picking apart her every feature in an effort to guess her race.
''How many mixtures do you have?'' one young man asked above the chatter of about 50 students. With her tan skin and curly brown hair, Ms. Wood's ancestry could have spanned the globe.
''I'm mixed with two things,'' she said politely. 
''Are you mulatto?'' asked Paul Skym, another student, using a word once tinged with shame that is enjoying a comeback in some young circles. When Ms. Wood confirmed that she is indeed black and white, Mr. Skym, who is Asian and white, boasted, ''Now that's what I'm talking about!'' in affirmation of their mutual mixed lineage.
Then the group of friends -- formally, the Multiracial and Biracial Student Association -- erupted into laughter and cheers, a routine show of their mixed-race pride.
The crop of students moving through college right now includes the largest group of mixed-race people ever to come of age in the United States, and they are only the vanguard: the country is in the midst of a demographic shift driven by immigration and intermarriage.
One in seven new marriages is between spouses of different races or ethnicities, according to data from 2008 and 2009 that was analyzed by the Pew Research Center. Multiracial and multiethnic Americans (usually grouped together as ''mixed race'') are one of the country's fastest-growing demographic groups. And experts expect the racial results of the 2010 census, which will start to be released next month, to show the trend continuing or accelerating.
Many young adults of mixed backgrounds are rejecting the color lines that have defined Americans for generations in favor of a much more fluid sense of identity. Ask Michelle Lopez-Mullins, a 20-year-old junior and the president of the Multiracial and Biracial Student Association, how she marks her race on forms like the census, and she says, ''It depends on the day, and it depends on the options.''
They are also using the strength in their growing numbers to affirm roots that were once portrayed as tragic or pitiable.
''I think it's really important to acknowledge who you are and everything that makes you that,'' said Ms. Wood, the 19-year-old vice president of the group. ''If someone tries to call me black I say, 'yes -- and white.' People have the right not to acknowledge everything, but don't do it because society tells you that you can't.''
No one knows quite how the growth of the multiracial population will change the country. Optimists say the blending of the races is a step toward transcending race, to a place where America is free of bigotry, prejudice and programs like affirmative action.
Pessimists say that a more powerful multiracial movement will lead to more stratification and come at the expense of the number and influence of other minority groups, particularly African-Americans.
And some sociologists say that grouping all multiracial people together glosses over differences in circumstances between someone who is, say, black and Latino, and someone who is Asian and white. (Among interracial couples, white-Asian pairings tend to be better educated and have higher incomes, according to Reynolds Farley, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan.)
Along those lines, it is telling that the rates of intermarriage are lowest between blacks and whites, indicative of the enduring economic and social distance between them.
Prof. Rainier Spencer, director of the Afro-American Studies Program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the author of ''Reproducing Race: The Paradox of Generation Mix,'' says he believes that there is too much ''emotional investment'' in the notion of multiracialism as a panacea for the nation's age-old divisions. ''The mixed-race identity is not a transcendence of race, it's a new tribe,'' he said. ''A new Balkanization of race.''
But for many of the University of Maryland students, that is not the point. They are asserting their freedom to identify as they choose.
''All society is trying to tear you apart and make you pick a side,'' Ms. Wood said. ''I want us to have a say.''
The Way We Were
Americans mostly think of themselves in singular racial terms. Witness President Obama's answer to the race question on the 2010 census: Although his mother was white and his father was black, Mr. Obama checked only one box, black, even though he could have checked both races.
Some proportion of the country's population has been mixed-race since the first white settlers had children with Native Americans. What has changed is how mixed-race Americans are defined and counted.
Long ago, the nation saw itself in more hues than black and white: the 1890 census included categories for racial mixtures such as quadroon (one-fourth black) and octoroon (one-eighth black). With the exception of one survey from 1850 to 1920, the census included a mulatto category, which was for people who had any perceptible trace of African blood.
But by the 1930 census, terms for mixed-race people had all disappeared, replaced by the so-called one-drop rule, an antebellum convention that held that anyone with a trace of African ancestry was only black. (Similarly, people who were ''white and Indian'' were generally to be counted as Indian.)
It was the census enumerator who decided.
By the 1970s, Americans were expected to designate themselves as members of one officially recognized racial group: black, white, American Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Korean or ''other,'' an option used frequently by people of Hispanic origin. (The census recognizes Hispanic as an ethnicity, not a race.)
Starting with the 2000 census, Americans were allowed to mark one or more races.
The multiracial option came after years of complaints and lobbying, mostly by the white mothers of biracial children who objected to their children being allowed to check only one race. In 2000, seven million people -- about 2.4 percent of the population -- reported being more than one race.
According to estimates from the Census Bureau, the mixed-race population has grown by roughly 35 percent since 2000.
And many researchers think the census and other surveys undercount the mixed population.
The 2010 mixed-race statistics will be released, state by state, over the first half of the year.
''There could be some big surprises,'' said Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, meaning that the number of mixed-race Americans could be high. ''There's not only less stigma to being in these groups, there's even positive cachet.''
Moving Forward
The faces of mixed-race America are not just on college campuses. They are in politics, business and sports. And the ethnically ambiguous are especially ubiquitous in movies, television shows and advertising. There are news, social networking and dating Web sites focusing on the mixed-race audience, and even consumer products like shampoo. There are mixed-race film festivals and conferences. And student groups like the one at Maryland, offering peer support and activism, are more common.
Such a club would not have existed a generation ago -- when the question at the center of the ''What Are You?'' game would have been a provocation rather than an icebreaker.
''It's kind of a taking-back in a way, taking the reins,'' Ms. Lopez-Mullins said. ''We don't always have to let it get us down,'' she added, referring to the question multiracial people have heard for generations.
''The No. 1 reason why we exist is to give people who feel like they don't want to choose a side, that don't want to label themselves based on other people's interpretations of who they are, to give them a place, that safe space,'' she said. Ms. Lopez-Mullins is Chinese and Peruvian on one side, and white and American Indian on the other.
That safe space did not exist amid the neo-Classical style buildings of the campus when Warren Kelley enrolled in 1974. Though his mother is Japanese and his father is African-American, he had basically one choice when it came to his racial identity. ''I was black and proud to be black,'' Dr. Kelley said. ''There was no notion that I might be multiracial. Or that the public discourse on college campuses recognized the multiracial community.''
Almost 40 years later, Dr. Kelley is the assistant vice president for student affairs at the university and faculty adviser to the multiracial club, and he is often in awe of the change on this campus.
When the multiracial group was founded in 2002, Dr. Kelley said, ''There was an instant audience.''
They did not just want to hold parties. The group sponsored an annual weeklong program of discussions intended to raise awareness of multiracial identities -- called Mixed Madness -- and conceived a new class on the experience of mixed-race Asian-Americans that was made part of the curriculum last year.
''Even if someone had formed a mixed-race group in the '70s, would I have joined?'' Dr. Kelley said. ''I don't know. My multiracial identity wasn't prominent at the time. I don't think I even conceptualized the idea.''
By the 2000 census, Dr. Kelley's notion of his racial identity had evolved to include his mother's Asian heritage; he modified his race officially on the form. After a lifetime of checking black, he checked Asian and black.
(Dr. Kelley's mother was born in Kyoto. She met her future husband, a black soldier from Alabama, while he was serving in the Pacific during World War II.)
Checking both races was not an easy choice, Dr. Kelley said, ''as a black man, with all that means in terms of pride in that heritage as well as reasons to give back and be part of progress forward.''
''As I moved into adulthood and got a professional job, I started to respect my parents more and see the amount of my mom's culture that's reflected in me,'' he said. ''Society itself also moved.''
Finding Camaraderie
In fall 2009, a question tugged at Sabrina Garcia, then a freshman at Maryland, a public university with 26,500 undergraduates: ''Where will I fit in?'' recalled Ms. Garcia, who is Palestinian and Salvadoran.
''I considered the Latina student union, but I'm only half,'' she said. ''I didn't want to feel like I was hiding any part of me. I went to an M.B.S.A. meeting and it was really great. I really feel like part of a group that understands.''
The group holds weekly meetings, in addition to hosting movie nights, dinners, parties and, occasionally, posts broadcasts on YouTube.
Not all of its 100 or so members consider themselves mixed race, and the club welcomes everyone.
At a meeting in the fall, David Banda, who is Hispanic, and Julicia Coleman, who is black, came just to unwind among supportive listeners. They discussed the frustrations of being an interracial couple, even today, especially back in their hometown, Upper Marlboro, Md.
''When we go back home, let's say for a weekend or to the mall, they see us walking and I get this look, you know, sort of giving me the idea: 'Why are you with her? You're not black, so she should be with a black person.' Or comments,'' Mr. Banda, 20, said at a meeting of the group. ''Even some of my friends tell me, 'Why don't you date a Hispanic girl?' ''
Mr. Banda and Ms. Coleman are thinking about having children someday. ''One of the main reasons I joined is to see the struggles mixed people go through,'' he said, ''so we can be prepared when that time comes.''
And despite the growth of the mixed-race population, there are struggles.
Ian Winchester, a junior who is part Ghanaian, part Scottish-Norwegian, said he felt lucky and torn being biracial. His Scottish grandfather was keen on dressing him in kilts as a boy. The other side of the family would put him in a dashiki. ''I do feel empowered being biracial,'' he said. ''The ability to question your identity -- identity in general -- is really a gift.''
But, he continued, ''I don't even like to identify myself as a race anymore. My family has been pulling me in two directions about what I am. I just want to be a person.''
Similarly, Ms. Lopez-Mullins sees herself largely in nonracial terms.
''I hadn't even learned the word 'Hispanic' until I came home from school one day and asked my dad what I should refer to him as, to express what I am,'' she said. ''Growing up with my parents, I never thought we were different from any other family.''
But it was not long before Ms. Lopez-Mullins came to detest what was the most common question put to her in grade school, even from friends. ''What are you?'' they asked, and ''Where are you from?'' They were fascinated by her father, a Latino with Asian roots, and her mother with the long blond hair, who was mostly European in ancestry, although mixed with some Cherokee and Shawnee.
''I was always having to explain where my parents are from because just saying 'I'm from Takoma Park, Maryland,' was not enough,'' she said. ''Saying 'I'm an American' wasn't enough.''
''Now when people ask what I am, I say, 'How much time do you have?' '' she said. ''Race will not automatically tell you my story.''
What box does she check on forms like the census? ''Hispanic, white, Asian American, Native American,'' she said. ''I'm pretty much checking everything.''
At one meeting of the Multiracial and Biracial Student Association, Ms. Wood shared a story about surprises and coming to terms with them. ''Until I was 8 years old, I thought I was white,'' she told the group. ''My mother and aunt sat me down and said the guy I'd been calling Dad was not my father. I started crying. And she said, 'Your real father is black.' ''
Ms. Wood's mother, Catherine Bandele, who is white, and her biological father split up before she was born. Facing economic troubles and resistance from her family about raising a mixed-race child, Ms. Bandele gave her daughter up for adoption to a couple who had requested a biracial baby. But after two weeks, she changed her mind. ''I had to fight to get her back, but I got her,'' Ms. Bandele said. ''And we're so proud of Laura.''
Eventually Ms. Wood's closest relatives softened, embracing her.
But more distant relatives never came around. ''They can't see past the color of my skin and accept me even though I share DNA with them,'' she said. ''It hurts a lot because I don't even know my father's side of the family.''
Ms. Wood has searched the Internet for her father, to no avail.
''Being in M.B.S.A., it really helps with that,'' she said. ''Finding a group of people who can accept you for who you are and being able to accept yourself, to just be able to look in the mirror and say, 'I'm O.K. just the way I am!' -- honestly, I feel that it's a blessing.''
''It took a long time,'' she said.
Now Ms. Wood is one of the group's foremost advocates.
Over dinner with Ms. Lopez-Mullins one night, she wondered: ''What if Obama had checked white? There would have been an uproar because he's the first 'black president,' even though he's mixed. I would like to have a conversation with him about why he did that.''
Absent that opportunity, Ms. Wood took her concerns about what Mr. Obama checked to a meeting of the campus chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. last year. Vicky Key, a past president of the Multiracial and Biracial Student Association, who is Greek and black, joined her. The question for discussion was whether Mr. Obama is the first black president or the first multiracial president.
Ms. Key, a senior, remembered someone answering the question without much discussion: ''One-drop rule, he's black.''
''But we were like, 'Wait!' '' she said. ''That's offensive to us. We sat there and tried to advocate, but they said, 'No, he's black and that's it.' Then someone said, 'Stop taking away our black president.' I didn't understand where they were coming from, and they didn't understand me.''
Whether Mr. Obama is considered black or multiracial, there is a wider debate among mixed-race people about what the long-term goals of their advocacy should be, both on campus and off.
''I don't want a color-blind society at all,'' Ms. Wood said. ''I just want both my races to be acknowledged.''
Ms. Lopez-Mullins countered, ''I want mine not to matter.''

The rates of intermarriage vary widely depending on gender, race or ethnicity. Gender differences are most pronounced among blacks and Asians. Black men marry someone from a different group twice as often as black women do, while among Asians, the gender pattern is reversed. Over all, black Hispanics and American Indians have the highest rates of intermarriage, and American Indians tend to marry a white person just as often as they marry another American Indian. For Asians and white Hispanics, the rates of intermarriage have remained static or decreased since 1980.

HEADLINE: Crowd-Pleasing Composition in 3 Movements

BYLINE: By JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to describing precisely what makes the 2011 Hyundai Sonata so undeniably excellent, the structural metaphor that applies best is, obviously, the crunchy taco.
What makes a great taco is its shell. If the shell is fresh, crisp and robust, it doesn't get soggy quickly or crack and crumble, and the flavor of what's inside will shine. Chicken, steak or pork carnitas, it's all tastier when served in a perfectly fried corn tortilla taco shell.
Before Hyundai stuffed the all-new version of its midsize front-drive sedan, it built a great shell. By forgoing the option of a V-6 engine (unlike most of its rivals, as well as the previous-generation Sonata), the car's basic structure could be optimized around 4-cylinder engines, which take up less space.
So the nose doesn't have to cover a wider V-6, the engine bay doesn't require the strength to carry a heavier V-6 and room need not be made for an exhaust system evacuating two banks of cylinders. Dozens of other less obvious challenges were also avoided. By sticking with 4-cylinder engines -- in mild naturally aspirated, spicy turbocharged and righteous hybrid flavors -- Hyundai made it easier to engineer a relatively lightweight, rigid and efficient shell. 
There's nothing exotic or even clever about the Sonata's structure. It's a standard steel unibody with a pair of MacPherson struts constituting the front suspension and a multilink independent rear suspension. Hyundai has just sweated the details better this time than it ever has before.
Size-wise, the new Sonata's dimensions are almost right atop the Honda Accord sedan; the Hyundai's 110-inch wheelbase is just 0.2 inch shorter than the Honda's and the Sonata is within a half-inch of the Accord in overall width, height and wheel track. The ''almost'' lies in overall length, where the Sonata's 189.8 inches is 4.3 inches shorter than the Accord. But despite that, the Sonata offers virtually the same interior room (the back seat is a little tighter) and 16.4 cubic feet of trunk space compared with the Accord's 14.
Based on the interior volume, the Environmental Protection Agency rates the Sonata, like the Accord, a ''large'' car. But the Sonata, styled in Hyundai's California studio, is a swoopy, sleek, streamlined looker compared with the aging Accord, which is blandly boxy from the blunt face of its fuddy to the trailing edge of its duddy.
The Sonata has the ''four-door coupe'' profile of a Mercedes-Benz CLS or a Volkswagen CC, without those cars' compromised interior space. That's a slick trick.
Fortunately, Hyundai didn't stop thinking when it stuffed the Sonata's shell. Even the base GLS, which starts at $19,915, includes nice touches like a pull-down handle built into the trunk lid and, below the ventilation controls, two easily accessible 12-volt power points, a USB port and an audio jack. The ventilation controls themselves are neat, featuring a human pictograph for choosing where the flow of air should be directed.
There's a thoughtfulness that runs throughout every 2011 Sonata that pays off in nearly perfect ergonomics, nicely shaped seats, easily scanned instrumentation, standard Bluetooth cellphone integration with the sound system and an overall feeling of quality that Hyundai has frankly never even approached before.
This isn't a small step forward for the South Korean company; the made-in-Alabama Sonata is a thumping bound to the front of its class.
The standard Sonata engine is a direct-gasoline injection 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with variable valve timing, a sky-high 11.3:1 compression ratio and a relatively long crank stroke for better torque production. Rated at 198 horsepower in the GLS and the more luxurious Limited, and at 200 in the sporty-trim SE, the engine is sweet natured until about 5,000 r.p.m. -- after which it gets a bit ragged.
But the slick part of the Sonata's drivetrain is the transmission. A 6-speed manual is standard on the base car, the GLS, but virtually all buyers will take the 6-speed automatic. Built by Hyundai itself, that transmission is a paragon of electronically controlled self-shifting virtue; the gears are perfectly spaced with fifth a 1:1 direct drive and sixth an overdrive. The transmission can be shifted manually using the floor-mounted shifter, but why bother?
Combine the GLS automatic's modest 3,199-pound unloaded weight (about 80 pounds less than a comparable Accord) with the drivetrain's talents and the result is a federal rating of 22 miles per gallon in the city, 35 on the highway and 28 combined -- again slightly better than the Accord.
Car and Driver magazine tested a Sonata SE with the automatic and it waltzed to 60 m.p.h. in 7.8 seconds -- nearly a second quicker than the 2010 Accord EX to which it was compared.
The real treat, however, lies in the new turbocharged Sonata 2.0T. Using a shorter stroke, smaller bore, 2-liter version of the same direct-injection engine, the intercooled turbocharger installation whips the output up to a robust 274 horsepower with outstanding torque from off-idle to the 6,500 r.p.m. red line -- and does so on regular-grade gas.
No, the turbo 4 is not as silken as the V-6s from Honda or Toyota, but operating through the 6-speed automatic produces effortless thrust, excellent acceleration (0-60 in 6.2 seconds, again according to Car and Driver) and impressive fuel economy. The E.P.A. rates the Sonata 2.0T at 22 m.p.g. in town and a noteworthy 33 on the highway.
All that additional power does, however, point up some of the weaker elements. The suspension is a touch too soft and the speed-proportional electric power steering seems to vary its assist a half-beat behind the driver's moves.
And since the turbo engine is available only in SE and Limited models, prices start at a dizzier $24,865. Yet considering the amount of equipment aboard, that still seems like a bargain.
The final variation on the Sonata theme is the Hybrid. The hybrid system itself is technically interesting and the redecoration of the car's nose is pure funk, but the most significant element in how it drives is the same 6-speed automatic used in other Sonatas.
While most hybrids use a continuously variable transmission without fixed gears, the Sonata's conventional gearbox makes for a more conventional driving experience. The Sonata Hybrid's recalibrated version of the same 2.4-liter decelerates with the gear changes. For those of us who despise the engine drone associated with CVTs, that sound is a relief. Otherwise, the drivetrain machinations of the Hyundai hybrid system are almost invisible as long as the car is driven moderately.
In fact, if it weren't for the electro-luminescent instrument panel and the liquid-crystal display between the tachometer and speedometer that graphically encourages economical driving, many drivers wouldn't notice much difference between the Hybrid, with 206 horsepower (166 horses for the gas engine and 40 more for the electric motor) and the regular Sonata GLS. But they will notice the Hybrid's stunning E.P.A. rating: 40 m.p.g. on the highway and 36 in the city.
The Sonata Hybrid just went on sale at a starting price of $26,545 -- almost $1,000 less than the Toyota Camry Hybrid, which isn't as well equipped and has a lower mileage rating.
Of course the Sonata isn't perfect. Some will find its high beltline -- the line below the side windows -- disconcerting. The turbo model's lack of a manual transmission keeps it from being a performance leader. And there are still some interior switches that operate raggedly. But this is the first car Hyundai has sold in America that's so good and so keenly priced that any buyer shopping in its market segment must seriously consider it. It's the first unavoidable Hyundai.
That's why it is doing so well. Some 200,000 of the new Sonatas have been sold so far, Hyundai says. After all, everyone loves a tasty taco.
INSIDE TRACK: Hyundai builds the self-assured sedan its competitors always feared it could.

HEADLINE: Stocks and Bonds, Parting Ways

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SINCE the financial crisis, bad news for the bond market has generally meant trouble for stocks.
That's because equity investors have looked to corporate and foreign bonds to gauge the health of the global economy. Last spring, for example, when the debt crisis in Europe erupted -- casting doubt on an economic recovery -- the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank more than 16 percent.
But in recent weeks, this relationship appears to have broken off. 
Stocks have been rallying in the face of declines in bonds, which have been prompted in part by growing concerns surrounding the finances of local and state governments. Since the start of December, municipal, foreign and long-term Treasury bond funds have lost value, on average. And investors have yanked nearly $18 billion from their fixed-income portfolios, according to the Investment Company Institute. Yet, during that same stretch, the S.& P. 500 has risen more than 8 percent.
Why are these markets heading in different directions? It could be a sign that stock investors have grown confident enough in the health of the economy to stop taking their cues from the fixed-income market.
Consumer confidence is relatively high, and economists have started to ratchet up their expectations for economic growth. The economic forecasting firm IHS Global Insight, for example, now says it believes that gross domestic product in the United States will jump 3.2 percent this year over last year. That's up significantly from the firm's previous estimate of 2.4-percent.
''It's hard not to notice that the economy is improving and companies are reporting strong earnings,'' said Russel Kinnel, director of mutual fund research at Morningstar in Chicago.
Of course, there's another -- and more direct -- explanation for why stocks have lately been feeding off the bad news for bonds.
''The money that's been leaving bonds has to go somewhere,'' said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
And the best guess is that it's been heading into stocks. Indeed, since Dec. 1, nearly $15 billion of net new money has flowed into stock mutual funds -- a stark contrast to the net redemptions that stock portfolios had been experiencing since the start of the 2008.
There's no way to say with certainty that the money leaving bonds is being redirected into equities. But one indication, Mr. Luschini said, is the performance of big blue-chip stocks.
''If investors are going to extend out on the risk branch, what's their next step after bonds?'' he asked. ''Stocks. But which type? It will probably be blue-chip, quality names that pay dividends and offer conservative investors some comfort.''
Sure enough, large-capitalization shares have been the best-performing part of the domestic stock market of late. The Dow Jones industrial average, representing shares of 30 of the country's biggest companies, has climbed 2.1 percent since the start of the year. At the same time, the Russell 2000 small-stock index has fallen 1.1 percent.
Concerns about the health of municipal finances are just one factor that's been driving money out of bonds.
In taxable bonds, it's not the economic health of issuers that's troubling investors. Instead, it's the possibility of rising interest rates and a jump in inflation -- both signs of an improving economy -- that have been making investors jittery.
''They think all of the money that was printed to stimulate the economy will be inflationary, and that's bad for corporate bonds,'' said Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management, a fixed-income manager based in Los Angeles. Bond investors are particularly sensitive to inflation, which threatens to eat away at a large chunk of the modest gains that such investors have historically enjoyed.
Inflation could ultimately be bad for stocks, too, but Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P., notes that equities have historically thrived in periods of rising prices. ''Some inflation is actually preferred,'' he said, so long as it does not grow faster than around 4 percent annually.
Stock investors don't necessarily think that the economy is completely out of the woods.
Chris Leavy, chief investment officer at BlackRock's actively managed equity fund group, said that any further negative news about the credit health of European governments or municipal borrowers later this year could threaten confidence in the stock market.
It all depends on how serious the credit problems are, Mr. Leavy said.
Still, since the worst days of the financial crisis, he said, ''the stock market is much better prepared to handle bad news.''
