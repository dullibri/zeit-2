HEADLINE: Skipping Spouse to Spouse Isn't Just a Man's Game

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
In the United States and much of the Western world, when a couple divorces, the average income of the woman and her dependent children often plunges by 20 percent or more, while that of her now unfettered ex, who had been the family's primary breadwinner but who rarely ends up paying in child support what he had contributed to the household till, climbs accordingly. The born-again bachelor is therefore perfectly positioned to attract a new, younger wife and begin building another family. 
 Small wonder that many Darwinian-minded observers of human mating customs have long contended that serial monogamy is really just a socially sanctioned version of harem-building. By this conventional evolutionary psychology script, the man who skips from one nubile spouse to another over time is, like the sultan who hoards the local maidenry in a single convenient location, simply seeking to ''maximize his reproductive fitness,'' to sire as many children as possible with as many wives as possible. It is the preferred male strategy, especially for powerful men, right? Sequentially or synchronously, he-men consort polygynously. 
 Women, by contrast, are not thought to be natural serializers. Sure, a gal might date around when young, but once she starts a family, she is assumed to crave stability. After all, she can bear only so many children in her lifetime, and divorce raises her risk of poverty. Unless forced to because some bounder has abandoned her, why would any sane woman choose another trot down the aisle -- for another Rachael Ray spatula set? Spare me extra candlesticks, I'm a one-trick monogamist. 
 Yet in a report published in the summer issue of the journal Human Nature, Monique Borgerhoff Mulder of the University of California, Davis, presents compelling evidence that at least in some non-Western cultures where conditions are harsh and mothers must fight to keep their children alive, serial monogamy is by no means a man's game, finessed by him and foisted on her. To the contrary, Dr. Borgerhoff Mulder said, among the Pimbwe people of Tanzania, whose lives and loves she has been following for about 15 years, serial monogamy looks less like polygyny than like a strategic beast that some evolutionary psychologists dismiss as quasi-fantastical: polyandry, one woman making the most of multiple mates. 
 In her analysis, Dr. Borgerhoff Mulder found that although Pimbwe men were somewhat more likely than their female counterparts to marry multiple times, women held their own and even outshone men in the upper Zsa Zsa Gabor end of the scale, of five consecutive spouses and counting. And when Dr. Borgerhoff Mulder looked at who extracted the greatest reproductive payoff from serial monogamy, as measured by who had the most children survive past the first five hazardous years of life, she found a small but significant advantage female. Women who worked their way through more than two husbands had, on average, higher reproductive success, a greater number of surviving children, than either the more sedately mating women, or than men regardless of wifetime total. 
 Provocatively, the character sketches of the male versus female serialists proved to be inversely related. Among the women, those with the greatest number of spouses were themselves considered high-quality mates, the hardest working, the most reliable, with scant taste for the strong maize beer the Pimbwe famously brew. Among the men, by contrast, the higher the nuptial count, the lower the customer ranking, and the likelier the men were to be layabout drunks. 
 ''We're so wedded to the model that men will benefit from multiple marriages and women won't, that women are victims of the game,'' Dr. Borgerhoff Mulder said. ''But what my data suggest is that Pimbwe women are strategically choosing men, abandoning men and remarrying men as their economic situation goes up and down.''
 The new analysis, though preliminary, is derived from one of the more comprehensive and painstaking data sets yet gathered of marriage and reproduction patterns in a non-Western culture. The results underscore the importance of avoiding the breezy generalities of what might be called Evolution Lite, an enterprise too often devoted to proclaiming universal truths about deep human nature based on how college students respond to their professors' questionnaires. Throughout history and cross-culturally, Dr. Borgerhoff Mulder said, ''there has been fantastic variability in women's reproductive strategies.''
 Geoffrey F. Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of New Mexico, agreed. ''Evolutionary psychology and anthropology really need to take women's perspective seriously in all its dimensions,'' Dr. Miller said. ''You can construe sequential relationships as being driven by male choice, in which case you'd call it polygyny, or by female choice, in which case you'd call it polyandry, but the capacity of women across cultures to dissolve relationships that aren't working has been much underestimated.''
 Pimbwe culture has been too disrupted over the years by colonialism and government interference to serve as a quaint museum piece of how our ancestors lived, but the challenges the people face are more survival-based than how to get your child into an elite preschool program. The Pimbwe live in small villages, have few possessions and eke out a subsistence living farming, fishing, hunting and gathering. Virtually all Pimbwe get married at least once, Dr. Borgerhoff Mulder said, and they do it without the blessing of judge, priest or Las Vegas. ''Marriage is not formalized with any specific set of rituals,'' she said, ''and marriages break up by one or another partner leaving.'' 
 Nor is there much formal sexual division of labor. ''In terms of farming, men and women do pretty much the same tasks,'' Dr. Borgerhoff Mulder said. ''The men will cook, do a lot with the kids.'' 
 Unlike in the West, where men control a far greater share of resources than women do, or in traditional pastoral societies like those found in the Middle East and Africa, where a woman is entirely dependent on the wealth of her husband and in divorce is not entitled to so much as a gimpy goat, Pimbwe women are independent operators and resourceful co-equals with men.
 This does not mean that mothers can go it alone, however. Again in contrast to the contemporary West, childhood mortality remains a serious threat, and it takes the efforts of more than one adult to keep a baby alive. A good, hardworking husband can be a great asset -- and so, too, may his relations. The evolutionary theorist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy proposes that one reason the offspring of much-marrying Pimbwe women do comparatively well is that the children end up with a widened circle of caretakers. ''The women are lining up more protection, more investment, more social relationships for their children to exploit,'' she said. ''A lot of what some people would call promiscuous I would call being assiduously maternal.''
 The goose, like the gander, may find it tempting to wander if it means that her goslings will fly.

HEADLINE: Europe Begins Phasing Out Its Incandescent Bulbs

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; Judy Dempsey contributed reporting from Berlin and Lisa Pham and Alice Pfeiffer from Paris.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
Restrictions on the sale of incandescent bulbs started taking effect across most of Europe on Tuesday in the Continent's latest effort to get people to save energy and combat global warming. But even advocates concede the change is proving problematic.
 Under the rules, stores will no longer be allowed to buy or import most incandescent frosted glass bulbs starting on Tuesday. Retailers can continue to sell the bulbs until their existing stock runs out. 
 While some Europeans are jumping on the bandwagon, others are panicking and have been stockpiling the old-style bulbs for aesthetic or practical reasons. Still others are resigned to the switch, if grudgingly.
 ''Why are we switching? Because we have to,'' said Ralph Wennig, a 40-year-old photographer shopping on Monday at BHV, a Paris department store. 
 The new compact fluorescent lamps are billed as more economical because they use up to 80 percent less energy and do not burn out as quickly.
 ''But the downside is that the light isn't as nice,'' Mr. Wennig said, ''and they are more expensive individually.''
 One bulb can cost 10 euros, or $14 -- or a lot more, depending on type -- whereas traditional incandescent bulbs cost about 70 cents each. But European Union officials argued that the energy savings would cut average household electricity bills by up to 50 euros a year, saving about 5 billion euros a year across Europe. That would help buoy the economy if consumers spent their savings, they said. 
 At a briefing on Monday in Brussels, however, the officials also were parrying charges that they were depriving children of traditional fairground lights, as well as also dealing with more serious questions about health hazards from the mercury in the new lamps. 
 Such arguments have already started to reverberate in the United States, where incandescent bulbs are scheduled to be phased out starting in 2012.
 Until then, the European Union is providing the biggest staging ground for the conversion and a debate over trade-offs created by environmental legislation. The issues include the loss of long-standing manufacturing industries, consumer choice and possible exacerbation of other environmental hazards. 
 Products as diverse as televisions, washing machines and tiny motors are being made more energy-efficient. The incandescent bulb ban is one of a series of measures to support Europe's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020.
 But the light bulb ban has proved singular in the way it has stirred fierce debate. The ubiquity of lighting and the way it can alter the aesthetics of an interior, even the experience of reading a book, makes it somehow more personal. 
 European countries are not the first to ban incandescent light bulbs. Australia has already introduced a ban and Cuba has entirely shifted to compact fluorescent bulbs, said Andras Toth, an expert with the European Commission, the group's executive agency. 
 Consumer advocates in Europe have cautiously welcomed the measures, but have also pointed to drawbacks for consumers -- especially those who have a special sensitivity to certain kinds of light or need old-style bulbs for health reasons.
 ''The blanket ban could spell misery for thousands of epilepsy and anxiety sufferers who are adversely affected by energy-saving bulbs,'' said Martin Callanan, a European Parliament member.
 He also said that the new bulbs would not work in all types of fixtures nor with dimmer switches, and that they would give off a harsh light. 
 European officials sought to reassure consumers that they still would have plenty of choice, and that the changes would be gradual. The clear 60-watt bulb, one of the most commonly used, will remain available until at least September 2011, and clear 40-watt bulbs until 2012. 
 National governments will be responsible for enforcing the rules. 
 The European Commission acknowledged, however, that compact fluorescent lamps had to be handled with extra caution. If one breaks, people are advised to air out rooms and avoid using vacuum cleaners when cleaning up the mess to prevent exposure to mercury and other electronic parts in the bulbs, officials said. Instead, householders should remove the debris with a wet cloth while avoiding contact with skin. Used bulbs should be put in special collection receptacles.
 Stephen Russell, the secretary general of ANEC, a group representing consumer interests in the development of product standards, said the commission had set the limit for mercury too high. 
 European officials said that they would find ways to push the industry to reduce the amount of mercury to levels around 2 milligrams for each bulb from the current level of 5 milligrams per bulb.
 The effects of the ban are likely to be felt first at the checkout counter, where supplies of old-style frosted bulbs soon could dry up entirely. 
 As for fairgrounds, European officials insisted that replacements were available that would retain their soft-white traditional ambiance.

PERSON: Richard Egan 

HEADLINE: Richard Egan, 73, a Founder of EMC Storage

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
Richard J. Egan, an entrepreneur who built EMC into one of the world's top technology companies, died Friday at his home in Boston. A former ambassador to Ireland, he was 73. 
 His family said in a statement that Mr. Egan had been suffering from lung cancer and many other illnesses. The Boston police said Monday that they had received a call from his apartment reporting that someone had been shot in the head but would not confirm that the deceased was Mr. Egan. The Boston Globe, citing a police source, reported Sunday that the gunshot wound had been self-inflicted.
 Mr. Egan and his former college roommate, Roger Marino, founded EMC in 1979 to sell data storage systems. After a couple of false starts, the men hit on a fresh concept, changing storage from a mere component of large computers into specialized hardware. 
 EMC was able to charge less for the storage than its competitors while adding other functions -- a recipe that proved attractive. EMC became the world's largest data storage company, reporting revenue of $14.88 billion in 2008 and employing about 40,000 people. 
 ''There aren't a lot of companies that reach the level of EMC or redefine an industry,'' said Steve Duplessie, a storage industry analyst at the Enterprise Strategy Group and an early EMC employee. ''And there aren't many self-made billionaires like Dick, either.''
 After Mr. Egan retired as chairman of EMC in 2001, President George W. Bush appointed him ambassador to Ireland, a post he held until 2003. 
 Mr. Egan had been a major fund-raiser for the Republican Party and had donated parts of his fortune to the Boy Scouts of America as well as health and education organizations. His wealth was estimated at well over $1 billion. 
 But his roots, in Dorchester, Mass., were humble, and he used them as a motivating force, friends and acquaintances said. 
 ''He had nothing,'' Mr. Duplessie said. ''He was a Dorchester punk growing up in a poor, immigrant family. He was maniacally driven for whatever it was he saw, and carried a lot of people with him. He's that self-made, violent, ruthless, tenacious, brilliant type.''
 Mr. Egan joined the Marine Corps after high school and served during the Korean War. He received a degree in electrical engineering from Northeastern University in Boston. Afterward he worked with a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in developing a spacecraft guidance system for the Apollo project and took jobs at NASA, Lockheed Aircraft and Intel, where he became proficient in computer memory. 
 He later joined Mr. Marino to tackle the data storage business in an unconventional manner, first starting an office furniture store in Massachusetts and then using the proceeds and the connections gained from that venture to nurture the fledgling EMC. 
 ''Many of their first customers were universities,'' said Peter Bell, a general partner at the investment company Highland Capital Partners, who started his career at EMC. ''In those days, the guy who bought office equipment often bought the computer systems too.''
 EMC started by undercutting companies like I.B.M. and Digital Equipment on price, but it eventually made separate data storage systems so important and sophisticated that it could charge a premium for the products. 
 ''Dick accomplished an amazing feat,'' Mr. Duplessie said. ''He turned data storage from an afterthought into a crucial product. And EMC still charges twice as much as I.B.M. if you want the best.''
 As a manager he was known for hiring highly motivated employees fresh out of college at a time when the industry leaned toward veterans in the field. Mr. Egan frequently acknowledged his Irish heritage and demonstrated a special bond with Ireland. In Cork, for example, he established a factory that benefited the local economy. He also started an engineering center in Israel to help develop the company's products and was credited with greatly improving Israel's technology infrastructure. 
 Mr. Egan stepped aside as chief executive to become chairman in 1992. Michael C. Ruettgers ran the company for the next nine years as it became one of Wall Street's best performers. Mr. Egan is survived by his wife of 52 years, Maureen; his children, John, Michael, Maureen, Christopher and Catherine; and a sister, Beverly; and 15 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Japan's Victors Set to Abandon Market Reform

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's opposition party won an overwhelming victory at the polls on Sunday pledging to increase social welfare, better protect workers and do away with American-style, pro-market reforms to lead the country out of its long slump.
 But while the presumptive prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, rallied campaign crowds with his pledge to shift away from the ''excessive'' market reforms of recent years, many economists here say Japan may need more American-style deregulation and market-led growth, not less, to invigorate its stagnant economy.
 ''Reform has become a bad word'' in Japanese politics, said Richard Jerram, chief economist for Japan at Macquarie Securities.
 ''Japan is now more reluctant than ever to use market forces to raise productivity,'' he said. ''But these changes are crucial.'' 
 In a manuscript widely circulated in business and diplomatic circles, Mr. Hatoyama, the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan who stands to become prime minister when the party assumes power this month, railed against American-style capitalism as ''void of morals or moderation'' -- a blight Japan must cast aside at all costs.
 ''The recent economic crisis resulted from a way of thinking based on the idea that American-style free-market economics represents a universal and ideal economic order,'' Mr. Hatoyama wrote in a recent syndicated opinion article. The article was first published in a Japanese monthly magazine and later carried by the online edition of The New York Times.
 Mr. Hatoyama, however, seemed to back away from his tough language a day after his victory at the polls. 
 The Op-Ed article ''did not present an anti-American way of thinking over all,'' he told The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily newspaper. 
 The young party's defeat of the long-ruling Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan for nearly its entire post-World War II history, comes amid a wider backlash against what many voters see here as damaging reforms championed by the long-serving former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The reforms, which coincided with a swing toward pro-market policies in the United States, included liberalizing Japan's rigid labor market and forcing banks to cut off support to heavily indebted ''zombie'' companies.
 The Democrats argued that such measures, intended to snap the country out of a long period of slow or negative growth, may have weakened the economy further. They also argue that overdependence on exports, as well as other close economic ties with the United States, has exposed Japan to the devastating effects of the global financial crisis.
 ''We're in the midst of an economic crisis, and there's a feeling that the crisis originated in the United States, and it was the fault of American policy makers and that the countries are paying the price of policy errors,'' said Steven Vogel, political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''There you have the makings of a very appealing political platform.''
 The Democrats are expected to form a coalition with the Socialists and the conservative People's New Party -- smaller parties that are decidedly against market reform -- which could reinforce this tendency toward government-led solutions to the economic crisis.
 The Democrats' platform centers on initiatives like cash allowances for child-rearing families and lower gasoline taxes. Such policies could bring about the start of recovery by lifting Japan's flagging consumer spending. 
 The Democratic Party has also promised to wrest away power from ministerial bureaucrats to ensure that spending more closely reflects public needs. But the party's leaders have not had much to say about how to address productivity, or Japan's continuing battle with deflation, or the overhang of a huge public debt. 
 Japan may be famous for its ruthlessly efficient, competitive manufacturing industries -- like Toyota's just-in-time production, in which parts are delivered just before assembly to keep inventory low. But its domestic service sector, which makes up 70 percent of the economy, is an overregulated, inefficient mess, businessmen and economists say.
 The backlash against reform worries entrepreneurs like Hideo Sawada, who forced open Japan's cloistered domestic airline sector in 1998 with Skymark Airlines, its first new carrier in 43 years.
 After years of delay by the Japanese government, Skymark received permission to fly just half a day before its first flight was due to depart. Eleven years later, the carrier has still not been granted a license for international flights.
 ''To do anything new in Japan means dealing with a nightmare of licenses, rules and vested interests,'' Mr. Sawada said. ''For Japan to grow, and for it to stay competitive, it needs to get serious about opening up what are frankly backward sectors. I don't get the sense the Democrats see that as a priority.''
 Many outdated rules protect inefficient companies, while entrepreneurship is kept in check by cumbersome barriers. Economists say excessive government assistance to small and medium-size companies works to dampen competitive pressure.
 The state of affairs is a legacy of an industrial policy, formed under the rule of the departing Liberal Democrats, that has long focused on honing the competitiveness of Japan's export-oriented manufacturing sector. The policies helped bring about Japan's rapid postwar economic growth and fed its bubble economy until its collapse in 1990. The rest of the economy, in contrast, has been relatively sheltered from both international and domestic competition.
 Now, with a rapidly aging population and almost no immigration, Japan must increase its productivity, economists say.
 ''If the population isn't growing, then there's no other way forward than for each worker to be more productive,'' said Hideo Kumano, economist at the Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. ''But that's not happening, at least in most areas of the economy.''
 The fragility of Japan's export-oriented economy has been underlined in the global financial crisis: a collapse in Japan's overseas shipments amid falling demand for cars and electronics caused an annualized 11.7 percent fall in the country's gross domestic product in the first three months of the year.
 The economy rebounded 3.7 percent in the latest quarter, as overseas shipments picked up; but economists doubt whether that recovery, set off by stimulus spending worldwide, is sustainable.
 Evidence of low productivity is everywhere in Japan: multiple workers crowd around cars at gas stations to clean windows and collect trash; the shift to information technology at Japanese offices is surprisingly slow, with workers still laboring over paper files and records. 
 Japan's jobless rate is at a record high of 5.7 percent, and it could be as high as 12 percent if not for a government subsidy program that encourages companies to keep surplus workers, according to a recent report by Nomura Securities.
 ''The Democrats are veering off the reform path, but I don't see what will come in its place,'' Toshio Nagahisa, executive director of PHP Research Institute, a Tokyo-based research group, told a recent forum.
 ''Right now, I find it hard to envision Japan's future.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Face Sanctions Over Cotton Subsidies

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: GENEVA 

 BODY:
American goods will face about $295 million in annual sanctions as a result of the United States' failure to eliminate illegal subsidies to domestic cotton growers, the World Trade Organizationruled on Monday. 
 The size of the penalty was disappointing for Brazil, which had sought $2.5 billion worth of economic retaliation against American goods and drug patents.
 The W.T.O. ruled that the sanctions should vary depending on American payments each year. Arbitrators used 2006 as a base year for the ruling, and said United States payments would have to increase significantly for Brazil to be allowed to punish American drug patents.
 ''The cumulated amount of countermeasures to which Brazil is entitled to is $294.7 million,'' the W.T.O. said in a two-part, 269-page ruling.
 Washington had argued that the award should not exceed $30 million.
 It is the fifth major decision since the Brazilian government brought the case in 2002, claiming that the United States was able to retain its place as the world's second-largest cotton producer by paying out some $3 billion to American farmers each year. China is the largest exporter of cotton, while Brazil is fifth.
 The trade group's condemnation of the United States in September 2004 was seen as a victory for Brazil and for West African countries that claimed to have been harmed by the subsidies. Three decisions since have confirmed that American support programs unfairly help producers undersell foreign competitors and depress world market prices, dealing a double blow to cotton growers in Brazil and elsewhere.
 In response to the legal defeats, Congress has scrapped some export credits and in 2006 repealed the ''Step 2'' cotton-marketing program that made payments to exporters and domestic mill users as compensation for buying higher-priced American cotton.
 But last year it approved a farm bill worth nearly $300 billion that left a number of other contentious cotton programs intact.

 From Andrew C. Revkin's blog, nytimes.com/dotearth.
 The economist and sustainability expert Herman E. Daly has responded to my query about whether there is an upside to the recent slowdown in consumption, and to the broader question of whether humans can or should shift to a new definition of progress. Does he see a viable real-world path to his ''steady state'' vision of the economy?
 ''Yes, Andy, I do. And it is clear that the growth-driven path is not viable, and in all likelihood no longer even economic. The Classical Economists already laid it out long ago, especially John Stuart Mill. ... 
 ''Will mainstream growth economists ever wake up? Maybe, maybe not. Keynes said, 'We are capable of turning off the sun and the stars because they do not pay a dividend.' '' 
 Some economists see an endless series of innovations always redefining the basket of things we call resources. After all, coal was just a black rock for most of human history; silicon was beach sand, and now it's the heart of semiconductors and solar panels.

 From John Tierney's blog, nytimes.com/tierneylab.
 After a long-term study of childrenshowed benefits of feeling guilty, Lab readers bared their consciences: 
 Kate: The original article quotes an expert as saying that guilt begins to form in the second year. If only. ... I feel I was born guilty! 
 cs: Then there are those who experience guilt, but have no capacity for atonement, only self-justification: ''That object needed to be broken. Aren't you glad that it's broken?'' 
 Fanficfemme: Don't whine, complain, scold or blame.... Get right to work teaching (and learning) the next and most important step: fixing the problem.
 Ashley: As a mother and an inner-city middle school teacher, I find that guilt plays a strong role, even with the toughest of students. Whether addressing disrespect, lack of work or pushing around another student, [discuss] the issue with a student in a way that frames the issues as a choice in values. ... How would you feel if you heard someone speak to YOUR mother that way?
 Well
 From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, nytimes.com/well.
 Armed with a Metrocard, a camera and $10, our Roving Runner, Brian Fidelman, heads out each week to explore New York City on foot. This week's destination was Flushing Meadows:
 Every year I go to the United States Open, and every year I vow to go beyond the tennis center and examine the rest of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Next time, for sure, I tell myself every year.
 But now that I know how simple it is to take the subway somewhere, anywhere, and just go for a run, I decided to take a pre-Open spin through the city's third-largest park. I ended my run nearby in Forest Hills, home to the U.S. Open before 1978. ...
 Today the park is sprawling -- half again the size of Central Park -- and heavily used, with countless playing fields, a botanical garden, a zoo, a science museum and, of course, the tennis center and the Mets' new baseball stadium. And while it lacks the lush, tree-covered paths of the city's more celebrated parks, it is a gem.

HEADLINE: Canada's Economy Improved in Second Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
The Canadian economy contracted at a 3.4 percent annual pace in the second quarter, an improvement from the first three months of the year, the government said Monday.
 Statistics Canada said in a statement that the economy actually grew in June, the first monthly increase in almost a year. Canada's central bank and many analysts think the economy is starting to grow again in the current quarter. 
The 3.4 percent drop in gross domestic product for the April-to-June period follows a the biggest drop on record in the first three months of this year. The economy plunged at a revised annual rate of 6.1 percent in the first quarter. The drop was previously reported as 5.4 percent. Statistics Canada data dates back to 1961.
 The United States has had fourth straight quarters of decline while Canada has had three. Economists have said Canada entered the downturn later than other countries and that Canada's performance typically lags the United States by six months. Canada and the United States share the largest trading relationship in the world. More than 70 percent of Canada's exports go to the United States.
 The chief economist at Royal Bank, Craig Wright, said June's positive number was in consensus with the view that the worst is behind Canada.
 ''The scariest point of the global economic picture was some time between September and October of last year. At that point it was more or less just hope that kept you from forecasting a depression or something quite scary,'' Mr. Wright said. ''What we're seeing now is that the extraordinary events were met quite aggressively with extraordinary initiatives around the globe and that's shoring up confidence.''
 Wright said Canada is well positioned to accelerate out of the recession.
 John Baird, Canada's transport minister, said the growth in June shows Canada's stimulus package is working and warned that now is not the time for an election. Canada's opposition parties are threatening to topple the minority Conservative government in a no confidence vote.
 ''It would be irresponsible to interrupt our important work on the economy with an unnecessary election,'' Baird said.

HEADLINE: Beach Clubs Recall the Past, But Their Future Looks Uncertain

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In the shade outside his cabana on the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, with the pool temperature set at a pleasant 76 degrees and the ocean a bit cooler, a man on a chaise longue did what people do in such situations: He took a nap. 
 Children giggled as they slid down two water-slide chutes. An older woman sat outside the cafeteria, deep into a paperback mystery, as young men and women carried people's beach chairs to the sand for them. The only interruption came from an announcement over the megaphone-style loudspeakers: the Jazzercise class was to start at 1:30 p.m.
 A long summer day at most New York City beaches can be priceless. At the Silver Gull Club, the total for one couple comes to more than $150. 
 But that is just for the day. For the entire summer, the cost for one family can run more than $5,000. 
 The Silver Gull is one of the few private beach clubs left in New York, a 46-year-old throwback in the Breezy Point section of Queens that, despite the state of the economy and the plethora of free beaches in the region, continues to serve as a summer getaway for a few thousand New Yorkers. Its membership is made up largely of middle-class families and retired couples from Brooklyn and Queens, all of whom pay from $715 to $4,260 to rent a bath cabin, cabanette or cabana for the summer season, along with a membership fee of $390 to $465 per child, senior citizen or adult. 
 And there is one unusual perk that goes unmentioned in the membership application: the use of a private club on public, federal parkland. The Silver Gull and another nearby club, the Breezy Point Surf Club, sit on the National Park Service's Gateway National Recreation Area. In 2007, the inspector general for the federal Department of the Interior criticized the park service for allowing clubs like the Silver Gull ''to monopolize desirable locations'' and for renewing the clubs' permits without proper environmental-impact reviews.
 Now, the long-term future of the Silver Gull is uncertain. 
 In April, the park service and the principal operator of the two clubs, Tom August, reached an agreement that allows the Silver Gull and the Breezy Point Surf Club to remain open three more summer seasons, a deal brokered with the help of Representative Anthony D. Weiner and Senator Charles E. Schumer. Parks officials are creating a new management plan for the Gateway that will decide the fate of the two clubs beyond the 2011 summer season.
 Some Silver Gull members are not optimistic, and they fear that their club will go the way of the long-gone Palm Shore Club or Brighton Beach Bath and Racquet Club.
 ''It's a relic,'' said Joan Mettler, 65, a real estate broker and retired public schoolteacher who lives in Rockaway Park, Queens, and has been a member about 17 years. ''It's got so many pluses that it would be a tragedy to close something like this down.''
 Federal officials have sought to shutter the two clubs in the past. The park service's 1979 management plan for Gateway called for the removal of the clubs' cabana structures, and a 1984 memo from an agency regional director insisted that the clubs be opened to the public and memberships be abolished. 
 Mr. August said the two clubs were ''working with the government to go forward in the future.'' He said that the Silver Gull -- with a membership of roughly 1,000 families, a number that has decreased in recent years because of the economy -- is not so much a private club as it is an association. 
 ''We're the most nondiscriminatory entity that can possibly be,'' Mr. August said. ''The only criteria for membership is you pay your bill. That's it.''
 The Silver Gull has long been known as a kind of poor man's Hamptons, but perhaps a rich man's Coney Island is a better description: When your next-door cabana neighbors are a friendly, bare-chested retired bus operator and his family from Dyker Heights, when your fellow swimmers in the pool are teachers on summer break, when your lunch options at the cafeteria include chicken nuggets and cheese fries, calling it exclusive or elite is a stretch. Not even the beach in front of the club is technically for members only; it is open to the public, said a park service spokesman, Brian Feeney.
 And there is one other little-known way the club has opened up to the masses: Cabana rentals for the day for nonmembers. The rental fee is $60 to $75 for a bath cabin, cabanette or cabana, along with a $50-per-adult and $30-per-child daily-use admission charge. The club started offering the daily-use option last year at the park service's request, though the response has been minimal, with roughly one or two day visitors a week. 
 Mr. Feeney said that all prices are submitted by the club and approved by the agency based on market research. The two clubs, which are registered with the state as nonprofits, have paid the government an average of about $700,000 in fees in each of the last three years, Mr. Feeney said.
 Geoffrey Croft, president of New York City Park Advocates, a parks watchdog group, said the day-use and annual membership fees function as a public-access restriction. ''It's completely out of the range of average New Yorkers and it's almost a poster child for what a public park isn't,'' Mr. Croft said. 
 Mr. August said the day-use prices were fair. ''It's like anything else,'' he said. ''People have different choices about what they want to do with their money.'' 
 Ever since the Silver Gull opened in 1963 and later became the stand-in for the fictional El Flamingo Beach Club in ''The Flamingo Kid,'' the 1984 movie starring Matt Dillon, New Yorkers of more modest means have speculated about what life was like beyond the security kiosk at Beach 193rd Street. A day-fee visit one recent afternoon revealed the club's hidden world at last: bikini-clad grandmothers relaxing by the pool, $3 for miniature golf, a children's day camp, cabanas a mere 8 feet wide and 14 feet deep. 
 The soup was vegetable beef. 
 The bar was closed. 
 ''I'm so bored,'' one young worker said, sighing.
 In the movie ''The Flamingo Kid,'' a Fourth of July fireworks show is preceded by this announcement on the loudspeakers: ''The fireworks are for El Flamingo members only. Nonmembers, please don't look up.''
 While such restrictions are pure Hollywood, the club's staff members, though courteous and welcoming, took a nonchalant approach to the recent day-fee visit. No tour of the club's grounds was offered. No towels or beach chairs were provided. The cabana's two wooden chaise longues were missing their mats, an oversight that the cabana girl corrected after two helpful members urged her to go find some.
 But members -- a majority of them Italian, Irish and Jewish -- have a fierce, nostalgic pride about the club, which can say it once had a future Supreme Court justice (Sonia Sotomayor was a member from 1988 to 1995) and a senator's mother (Selma Schumer) among their ranks. 
 The members say they are drawn to the club by the socializing, by the athletics programs, by the privacy. Many leave their cabana doors open when they hit the beach or the pool.
 ''A lot of people who have the cabanas, for them it is a summer home,'' said Judd Fischler, 78, a retiree from Brighton Beach who has been a member for more than a decade. ''It's away from everything. When you sit out on the deck, you can see the water coming in and you can watch the ocean liners coming out. It's very relaxing to be out there.''
 Mr. Fischler was interviewed by phone one recent afternoon, but only briefly. He and his wife were heading to the club.

HEADLINE: Like Other Markets, U.S. Follows Shanghai Lower

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and MARK McDONALD; Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
Losses in China's main stock market index ignited a sell-off in markets from Asia to Europe to Wall Street on Monday, as traders worried that a worldwide rally in stocks this summer had flown too high, too fast.
 Financial, energy and industrial companies were among those leading the markets lower. Shares of the government-supported insurance giant American International Group fell nearly 10 percent as investors worried that its stock was overvalued. 
 And oil prices fell $2.78, to $69.96 a barrel, in New York. It was the first time in more than a week that oil closed below $70. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 47.92 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 9,496.28. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 0.8 percent, or 8.31 points, at 1,020.62. The Nasdaq was off 0.97 percent, or 19.71 points, to 2,009.06. 
 The day's losses capped an otherwise stellar month for the major stock indexes. The Dow gained 3.5 percent in August, and the S.& P. 500 rose 3.3 percent, extending the legs of a rally that has breathed new life into the beleaguered stock markets.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 13/32, to 101 29/32. The yield fell to 3.40 percent, from 3.45 percent late Friday.
 Announcements of two corporate mergers on Monday, meanwhile, showed that deal-making was slowly coming back. 
 The Walt Disney Company said that it would pay $4 billion to buy Marvel Entertainment and its stable of superheroes, including Spider-Man, the Hulk and Iron Man. Shares of Disney slipped 3 percent, to $26.04, while Marvel surged 25.2 percent, to $48.37.
 Separately, the oil field services provider Baker Hughes said it was acquiring BJ Services, another oil services company, for $5.5 billion in cash and stock. 
 This week, investors in the United States will pay close attention to the government's monthly employment report to see whether the rate of job losses is tapering off. Another closely watched gauge will be whether businesses are asking employees to work longer weeks. Fewer job losses and longer work weeks would be strong signs the recession was ending. 
 Automakers will also report their August sales figures on Tuesday, offering a window into the impact of the government's cash-for-clunkers automobile rebate program.
 In Asia, the hard-charging Shanghai composite index has outpaced many of the world's other exchanges, gaining 90 percent earlier this year. But it plunged 6.74 percent on Monday to close out August with a drop of 21.8 percent, the worst performance for the month among major markets.
 Monday's fall, coupled with a drop of nearly 3 percent on Friday, made for ''a huge, huge decline,'' said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist at SJS Markets in Hong Kong.
 ''It has brought the index into bear market territory,'' he said. ''There's mounting concern over liquidity in the market. This is a big development.''
 Although China's markets are largely closed to foreign investors, movements in Chinese shares have increasingly been rippling into other markets. 
 In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 1.9 percent and closed below the 20,000-point mark on Monday. The Hang Seng's loss of 4.1 percent in August was its first monthly loss since March.
 In Europe, the DAX in Frankfurt fell 0.96 percent, while the CAC-40 in Paris was down 1 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50, a benchmark for the euro region, fell 1 percent. The London Stock Exchange was closed for a public holiday. 
 The volatile market swings in China have given some global analysts pause, and some see indications of trouble stemming from the vulnerable American commercial real estate sector or simply the length of time the rally in stocks has lasted.
 Chinese banks, acting at the government's behest, unleashed a flood of lending this spring and early summer as part of its efforts to stimulate the economy. Some of the funds were channeled into stocks, at least temporarily, leading some analysts to warn of an asset bubble.
 Lending dropped sharply in August, to about 200 billion renminbi, or $29.3 billion, about half the total for July, Mr. Kowalczyk said, citing a news report in Caijing, the authoritative financial magazine. 
 ''The Chinese government cannot be happy with such a drop,'' he said, referring to the steep and rapid decline of the Shanghai index. ''I expect them to soothe the market's nerves about the availability of funds -- some guidance, some moderation. The market is quite panicky.''
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

Will Heroes Work 
 Magic at Disney? 
 Walt Disney is paying a superhero price to swoop in on Marvel Entertainment, the parent of Spider-Man and Iron Man. Disney's desire to liven up its pirates-and-princesses slate is understandable. But there are a few wishes embedded in the deal that must come true to ensure a happy ending for Disney shareholders. 
 As strategically alluring as owning Marvel's stable of characters -- from Captain America to the X-Men -- may be, Disney's shareholders aren't getting caught up in the fantasy. They sliced $1.5 billion off its market value Monday. That's nearly twice the premium Disney agreed to pay Marvel's shareholders. 
 It's easy to understand investors' concerns. Marvel recently said it expected $100 million of net income this year, which suggests Disney is valuing Marvel at 40 times earnings. Moreover, it's paying a chunk of the consideration by issuing its own stock, which trades at just 15 times earnings. 
 So caution is deserved. But to suggest -- as the market apparently does -- that the deal will destroy value beyond the premium Disney is paying looks extreme. Recall that the house of Mickey Mouse paid 45 times Pixar's earnings. Though Disney's stock now trades around where it did when that deal was developed in January 2006, the purchase revived the group's core animation franchise. 
 Marvel's earnings suffer from the absence of a major film release this year. Last year it made $200 million thanks to the success of Iron Man, whose sequel starring Robert Downey Jr. opens next May. And it is reasonable to expect Disney can better exploit licensing opportunities, from theme park rides to branded Captain America towels, from its characters in a way that Marvel could not, given its smaller resources. 
 But none of this can be accomplished with a simple wave of a magic wand. Marvel already has licensing arrangements of its own -- including film distribution partnerships with Disney rivals. The Magic Kingdom also doesn't have all the capabilities it needs to fully mine Marvel's superheroes, particularly in the area of video games. But perhaps that's best left as the sequel to its acquisition series. 
 Bubble Trouble
 A Chinese bubble has been deflated. Too bad it's the wrong one. The main Shanghai stock market index has fallen 23 percent from its peak in early August, reversing half of the run-up that started early in 2009. That's a welcome correction, but it does not mean a return to normality, nor does it address the bigger bubble around the corner. 
 Shares were driven up by a belief in China's recovery -- and by a rush of liquidity. The fall occurred because both were gently damped. Politicians have warned that economic recovery isn't a done deal. Monetary authorities drained some liquidity from the market, curbed lending and asked banks to show restraint. 
 Chinese equities now trade at about 29 times trailing earnings. That's higher than Asia overall, but roughly in line with China's five-year average and below the last peak in 2007, when Chinese-listed shares traded at 50 times earnings. 
 But runaway stock prices were never the biggest worry. China's market cap is less than half its nominal gross domestic product for 2008, according to official data for July, compared with over 175 percent in the United Kingdom. Even after a recent surge, the number of brokerage accounts in China equals just 1 percent of the population. China's masses don't buy shares, and its companies don't depend on equity markets for capital. 
 Real estate is a different story. Housing makes up roughly a quarter of investment spending, which is in turn 40 percent of G.D.P. The differences between China's big cities make a bubble harder to spot. But record bids for land are cause for concern, as is falling affordability in big cities. Meanwhile, stagnant residential rents suggest speculation, not demand for shelter, is pushing up house prices. 
 A burst real estate bubble could be fiendishly tricky to clear up. While stock markets clear in a day, property gluts take many months, if they clear at all. Liquidity already pumped into the system has only made things worse: cash-rich developers have less pressure to sell houses, so they can keep ginning up prices further even as demand softens. Whatever the equity markets say, Beijing still has bubble trouble.

HEADLINE: A Chicago Production Lures the Wary With a Money-Back Guarantee

BYLINE: By ERIK PIEPENBURG

DATELINE: Are customers always right 

 BODY:
even if they want their money back after seeing a play? That's the question that's stirring chatter in Chicago, where a production recently offered to refund the full cost of a ticket to any unsatisfied patron. 
 Refunds were offered during the run of Migdalia Cruz's grim play ''El Grito del Bronx,'' a co-production of the small Chicago theater companies Collaboraction and Teatro Vista. The play (which was commissioned in 1996 by the Public Theater in New York but not produced there) is a dark drama about the relationship between a woman and her brother, a serial killer who is dying of AIDS in jail. The play has strong language and scenes of violence. 
 The Richard H. Driehaus Foundation, a family foundation in Chicago, wanted to support companies producing shows that foundation officials said might be ''particularly risky.'' So it offered Collaboraction up to $10,000 in refund money for the 20 performances of the play, which was performed at a 200-seat space in the Goodman Theater made available without charge. The play ran from July 15 through Aug. 9, including a week's extension, and the theater kept $300 on hand at each performance. (Ticket prices ranged from $15 to $30). 
 To get the refund, audience members were asked, but not required, to stay until the end of the show and to provide e-mail addresses and the reasons they were dissatisfied. 
 Jeffrey Gardner, Collaboraction's marketing coordinator, said that of the approximately 3,000 people who saw the production, only 14 asked for and received refunds, mostly at intermission, at a cost of $240. (The company will return the unused cash to the foundation.) 
 Anthony Moseley, the director of the show and the executive artistic director of Collaboraction, said that except for a woman who threw down her ticket stubs in disgust and some complaints about profanity, the reasons given were never explicit. 
 ''I don't think anybody got more specific than they didn't like it, or they weren't satisfied,'' he said. 
 The program, devised as a way to attract new audiences and to create buzz for the production, caused debate in Chicago, especially in the blogosphere. Chris Jones, the theater critic for The Chicago Tribune, wrote in his blog (on Chicagotribune.com) that this idea should die ''a quick death'' because ''art is not a light fixture.'' 
 Still, Mr. Moseley said that the play was better attended than many of the company's past productions, and many audience members he spoke to said the refund offer influenced their decision to attend. 
 Richard Cahan, a program officer at the Driehaus foundation, said several people he'd heard from were ''aghast'' at the idea of a money-back guarantee or what he called ''the commodification of the theatergoing experience.''
 ''There are people who believe that theater is about supporting art,'' he said. ''It's not like a tomato that's spoiled, and you have to take it back to the store. On the other hand, it's not given away for free, so in that sense it is a commodity.'' But he added: ''The recession has made it more difficult for theater organizations to take chances. One bad play can sink a theater.''
 The idea behind this experiment, he said, was to encourage theaters and theatergoers to take some of those chances. 
 Mr. Moseley, the director, said, ''We have to look at ways to change the model because philanthropic giving is just not there, especially for small companies trying to make the work of tomorrow.'' 
 According to the Broadway League, the national trade association, there is no industry standard for exchanges or refunds for tickets on Broadway; decisions are made at the discretion of the management. Off Broadway theater companies in New York, including the Public, may offer refunds if an above-the-title star is out, or if a patron has to leave during a show because of illness -- but ''I didn't like it'' is not going to get audience members their money back.
 The producer Jeffrey Richards, who is bringing Tracy Letts's play ''Superior Donuts'' from the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago to Broadway this fall, called the policy ''interesting'' but ''not viable.'' 
 ''I think a person takes risks when they go and see entertainment, whether it's a play or ballet or a movie or opera,'' he said. ''You can send back something if it isn't cooked properly at a restaurant, but if you don't like something, and you've already digested it, you can't get your money back.''
 George Forbes, the president of the League of Off-Broadway Theaters and Producers, agreed, saying that theaters were ''not in the business of providing free trials.'' He suggested that a more sustainable model for foundations and theater companies could be found at the Signature Theater Company in New York, where, through an initiative from Time Warner, all tickets to the regular run of a show are just $20. 
 ''There's no guarantee that you'll like the show, but there is a guarantee that the price is incredibly low,'' Mr. Forbes said.
 A more sympathetic ear was lent by the producer Ken Davenport, who said he had given a ''handful'' of refunds in response to an e-mail promotion that offered money back on select tickets to ''Altar Boyz'' Off Broadway.
 ''We're one of the most competitive and cluttered markets for theater,'' he said. ''You have to find a way to stand out. The consumer is weary of taking a risk, so anything I can do to reduce that risk is a benefit. I'm confident in my production in the first place.''
 Mr. Moseley, who has a background in finance, said he considered the refund policy a success, and one that his company would consider doing again in the future, with a few tweaks. 
 The refund idea isn't new. In 1993 the producers of the Broadway flop ''Ain't Broadway Grand'' took out a newspaper ad offering refunds at intermission to any patrons who didn't like the show enough to stay for the second act. 
 Suggesting that nothing in life is truly free, seven people were turned down, it was reported at the time, because they had bought discount tickets.

HEADLINE: A Look at the Underinsured

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
The national debate on health care tends to focus on providing coverage to people who do not have insurance. But a study released Monday by the Center for Health Policy Research at the University of California, Los Angeles, underscores the limits of the current system in protecting even insured people from the financial risk of being sick. 
 The report, ''The State of Health Insurance in California,'' found that more than 2.2 million of the state's adults -- almost one in seven working-age Californians -- said they had medical debt. And two-thirds of those said they incurred the debt despite having health insurance. 
 ''There's so much talk about the uninsured,'' said Shana Alex Lavarreda, the director of health insurance studies for the center and one of the report's authors. ''There does need to be a focus on the underinsured.'' 
 Many consumers have policies that do not adequately protect them from high medical bills, Ms. Lavarreda said, and people with medical debt are twice as likely as those without debt to forgo or delay necessary medical care. 
 The report is based on state health survey information gathered in 2007, when California and the country were still enjoying prosperity. Since then, unemployment has more than doubled in California. ''We definitely expect the picture is much worse,'' Ms. Lavarreda said. REED ABELSON

 BODY:
In the debate about health care overhaul, there are countless stories of families saddled with hospital bills and unemployed workers who have lost their insurance.
 But the story of Eric De La Cruz, of Las Vegas, stands out as a striking example of both the best and the worst that the American health care system has to offer -- extraordinary medical prowess that is too often out of reach for all but the luckiest and best insured. 
 In his early 20s, Mr. De La Cruz was told he had a disorder called severe dilated cardiomyopathy, in which the heart muscle becomes enlarged and weak. The symptoms include breathlessness, exhaustion and fluid buildup in the arms, legs and abdomen. 
 He was a student who had worked part time as a graphic designer and a disc jockey, but none of his employers offered health insurance. Once his condition was diagnosed, his family says, he was unable to buy private insurance because he had a pre-existing condition. 
 He twice applied for Social Security disability benefits, which would have entitled him to health coverage under Medicare. The applications were denied. He did eventually qualify for Nevada's Medicaid program, which bases eligibility on financial need rather than age or disability. 
 As his condition worsened, it became clear he would need a heart transplant. In some states and the District of Columbia, the transplant would have been covered by Medicaid -- but not in Nevada, where the program covers heart transplants only up to age 20. 
 Ben Kieckhefer, a spokesman for the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, defended that policy. ''All insurance plans decide what things they are going to cover and what things they are not going to cover,'' he said. ''Everyone in the state Medicaid program recognized the difficult situation the family was in, but we can't just start covering something for one individual case.''
 This spring, Mr. De La Cruz's sister, Veronica De La Cruz, a former anchor for CNN, began a two-pronged effort to save her brother. Her first hope was to win disability benefits so he could qualify for Medicare, which would cover a heart transplant. A hearing had been scheduled for spring 2010, far too late to save him. She appealed to state legislators to pressure a federal panel to expedite the disability hearing.
 ''How can a sick person navigate the system?'' she said in an interview. ''I am healthy and can barely do it on my own. The system is designed for people to get frustrated and give up.''
 Ms. De La Cruz also began contacting heart transplant centers to determine whether she could pay for the operation with donated money. Because Nevada has no heart transplant center, she contacted several medical centers in California and was told that without insurance, her brother would need to post a deposit of at least $150,000 to be evaluated and placed on a waiting list. The total cost for the transplant and subsequent hospital care, as well as antirejection drugs, would be nearly $1 million, payable in advance. 
 To exert public pressure and raise money, Ms. De La Cruz began sending out messages on Twitter, with daily tweets about her brother's health, his dog, Chance, and the red tape she was trying to cut. She gained a following of more than 6,300 people, whom she began calling Eric's Twitter Army. 
 The troops included Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails, which said it would award donors backstage passes and time with the band; the famed Tony Hawk auctioned autographed skateboards. Supporters bombarded Nevada legislators with calls, faxes and e-mail. The Medicare hearing was rescheduled, and by June, Mr. De La Cruz had won his long-awaited coverage, opening the door to a heart transplant center. 
 Elated, Ms. De La Cruz contacted U.C.L.A. Medical Center's heart transplant program, but now the hospital insisted that her brother get a secondary insurance policy -- even though Mr. Reznor told me the band raised nearly $1 million in less than two weeks. A hospital spokeswoman declined to comment on the case, citing patient privacy, but said the hospital ''had been working with'' the family.
 Eventually, Ms. De La Cruz arranged for her brother to be seen by doctors at the University of Southern California Medical Center. There, he spent a week on the ''high-priority transplant'' list. 
 But his condition had deteriorated so much that he soon became too sick for the procedure. On July 4, Eric De La Cruz died, at age 31. 
 Ms. De La Cruz says a surgeon told her he could have helped her brother, but he arrived ''two years too late.'' If not for all the delays and denials, she says, her brother would be alive today. 
 She is still crusading, sharing the story with lawmakers in Washington and at rallies, including one in Times Square this past weekend. At the very least, she says, insurance companies should not be allowed to turn down patients with pre-existing conditions.
 ''If my brother had been able to buy health insurance, he would never have been in this situation,'' she said. ''No one should ever have to go through what we've been through. Eric should still be alive.''

HEADLINE: Armenians And Turks Agree on Ties

BYLINE: By SEBNEM ARSU

DATELINE: ISTANBUL 

 BODY:
Turkey and Armenia, whose century of hostilities constitutes one of the world's most enduring and acrimonious international rivalries, have agreed to establish diplomatic relations, the two countries announced Monday. 
 In a breakthrough that came after a year of tiny steps across a still-sealed border and furtive bilateral talks in Switzerland, the foreign ministries of the two countries said that they would begin talks aimed at producing a formal agreement.
 The joint statement said they had agreed ''to start political negotiations'' but did not touch on when or how some of their more intractable disputes would be addressed, starting with the killing of more than a million Armenians by the Ottoman Turk government from 1915 to 1918, which the Turkish government has denied was genocide.
 The two countries have never had diplomatic relations, and their border has been closed since 1993, when Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, went to war over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. At the border, soldiers of Turkey, a NATO country, face Russian ones, called in by Armenia, across a mini-Iron Curtain. 
 Turkey supported Azerbaijan in the dispute, but Russia's military action in Georgia last year shifted the security calculus in the region. After the war in Georgia, Turkey sought to improve ties with its neighbors in the Caucasus, and Armenia elected a new government interested in reciprocating.
 Both countries hope an eventual opening of the border will benefit their struggling economies. Currently, there are limited charter flights between the countries but no real trade.
 For Turkey, better relations with Armenia could improve its chances for admission to the European Union, where the genocide issue remains one of the main obstacles, and remove a bone of contention over the same issue with the United States, which has a large Armenian community.
 The Swiss-mediated talks began last year, keeping a low profile to avoid exciting nationalist antagonism in both countries. Armenia's insistence that border and trade relations be normalized before any discussion of genocide began helped push the most contentious issue to the back burner. 
 Last September, President Abdullah Gul of Turkey attended a Turkey-Armenia soccer match in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, the first visit by a Turkish leader in the two nations' history.
 The symbolic gesture, dubbed soccer diplomacy, was widely opposed in both countries, where bitter ethnic enmity commands large majorities. 
 The central dispute is the genocide, about which there is little dispute among historians. Turkey has resisted the label, arguing that the Armenians were killed in warfare. 
 The next round of talks is scheduled to last six weeks, ending about the time of a World Cup match between Turkey and Armenia in Istanbul. President Serge Sargsyan of Armenia is invited to attend.

HEADLINE: Despite the Downturn, a Polish City Thrives

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: LODZ, Poland 

 BODY:
In the 19th century, the Polish novelist Wladyslaw Reymont titled his masterpiece about Lodz ''The Promised Land'' because the city attracted people from throughout Central Europe to work in its booming textile mills.
 These days, the industries have changed, but something similar is happening again, helping Poland to escape the searing global recession.
 With multinationals like Procter & Gamble, Dell and ABB leading a wave of foreign investment, cities like Lodz, in central Poland, are experiencing relative booms. Poles who left the country in search of work years ago are trickling back.
 As its peers in Central and Eastern Europe face a very rough year, Poland is emerging as the one economy in the region that has the heft to withstand a vicious downturn. And it just may end up being the one economy in Europe that avoids an outright contraction in 2009. 
 One of the most flourishing corners of Lodz is a vast former textile factory that is now a complex of stores, restaurants and even a beach volleyball court. The brisk business at the site, known as Manufaktura, illustrates how far Poland is removed from the searing experiences of Latvia or Hungary, not to mention London or New York.
 ''Maybe without the crisis, business would be better,'' said Slawomir Murawski, the director of Manufaktura. ''But who knows?''
 Poland has the advantage of being preoccupied with itself these days. Because it sells far less to the rest of the world than its neighbors, Poland is shielded from the vicissitudes of the global economy, while reaping its benefits, reflecting a wave of foreign investment. That, in turn, has helped keep its labor market strong at a time when many Europeans fear for their jobs.
 The government reported Friday that Poland's economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the second quarter, bolstered by exports, construction and services.
 Growth in gross domestic product was well above the 0.5 percent expected by analysts, as well as the first quarter's 0.8 percent annual rate of growth. 
 ''We're the only country in the whole European Union that has such good growth, and we've come here to brag,'' Prime Minister Donald Tusk said at a news conference in Warsaw, Bloomberg News reported. ''Poland is the E.U.'s undisputed growth leader.''
 At the beginning of the year, Poland suffered along with other emerging markets as investors pulled their money out en masse.
 To the immense frustration of Polish business, however, the picture of the region for outsiders has been dominated by countries like Hungary, Latvia, Serbia and Ukraine, whose crushing debt loads drove them into the arms of the International Monetary Fund.
 For Poland, a relatively light borrower, the crisis created a riptide in the form of a fast-depreciating currency, the zloty. That hurt some companies, namely those that had carefully hedged themselves against a rising currency, which was the previous year's problem. But Polish banks, keen to avoid driving their clients into bankruptcy, refinanced the hedges to reflect the new reality.
 ''In retrospect, the crisis proved manageable in Poland,'' said Ryszard Petru, chief economist at BRE Bank in Warsaw. ''But it was hard to know at the time.''
 The zloty plunged 27 percent against the euro in the six months ended last March. It has since risen over 13 percent.
 Poland has landed more softly than its neighbors because its economy is far less dependent on exports than other Central European countries, where exports can approach 90 percent of the gross domestic product.
 Poland, a much larger nation of 38 million people, lives far more from domestic demand, and that depends on a stable labor market.
 Mr. Petru predicts that unemployment will rise to 9.9 percent by the end of 2009, from 7.1 percent, but that is about even with the European Union average. And it masks some pockets of strong growth; the jobless rate is 2 percent in Warsaw, and about 8 percent in Lodz, or less than half what it was five years ago.
 One reason for the surprise in Lodz is clearly the influx of foreign investment.
 Procter & Gamble has one factory in Lodz and is opening another this fall. Fujitsu, the Japanese computer company, opened a service center in the city this year. Others include Infosys Technologies, the Indian information technology firm; ABB, the Swiss manufacturer of infrastructure equipment; and TNT, a Dutch logistics firm.
 Even after the shock of last September, when the bankruptcy of the investment house Lehman Brothers sent global business into free fall, ''companies in Lodz kept searching for labor,'' said Piotr Broncher, the Lodz regional director for Manpower, a provider of temporary employees. ''I was surprised. Everybody was surprised.''
 Manpower will probably find jobs for 1,200 people in the Lodz area this year, down slightly from 1,500 in 2008.
 Dell, the computer maker, made the investment that truly electrified Lodz.
 In January, Michael S. Dell, the company's founder and chief executive, officially opened a 400,000-square-foot plant that will handle logistics and assemble computers, particularly for customers from Central and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. Over the next three years, it will employ up to 3,000 people.
 In a symbolic shift, Dell moved operations to Lodz from Limerick in Ireland. Ireland has protested the 52.7 million euros in subsidies that Dell got from the Polish government, but Dell cited the skilled work force in Lodz and proximity to growing markets as the reasons for its move.
 The Irish boom, now possibly the worst bust in Europe, attracted many Poles, who worked with Dell there and are now finding their way home.
 ''We even have some workers in Lodz who have come from our Limerick, Ireland, factory and who are very happy to have come back to help set up this one,'' Mr. Dell said at the opening in January.
 Tomasz Rybinski, 30, was among those Poles who left the country after it joined the European Union in 2004. He found work in then-booming Britain, where he spent three years mixing salads, moving boxes in a warehouse and then, finally, working in a factory that made industrial refrigerators.
 Rumors this year that layoffs were in the works were enough to convince Mr. Rybinski that the new possibilities in his native Lodz trumped what had by then become a shattered British economy.
 After taking some time off, he found a job quickly. He recently started work in a factory that produces monitor and computer parts as an operator of a machine that molds plastic into specific shapes.
 ''It's better to live in your home town,'' Mr. Rybinski said. ''You get to see your family and friends more than just three times a year.''
 Financially, Mr. Rybinski said he would earn about the same monthly pay, the equivalent of about $500, that he earned in Britain.
 The turnaround in Lodz has been startling for a municipality whose population was still declining as recently as three years ago.
 Mr. Murawski, the director of Manufaktura, benefits from that growth. But one multinational on the horizon might be less welcome for his operation, which combines shopping, eating and entertainment for children.
 This autumn, the Swedish retailer Ikea will open its own complex in Lodz, employing much the same strategy: bring them in to shop, but amuse them as well.
 ''That is likely to affect us much more than the crisis,'' Mr. Murawski said. ''It is something concrete.''

HEADLINE: In Hawaii, High School Sports Are Far From Paradise

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Shane Victorino, the Phillies' All-Star center fielder, is a long way from Maui, where he grew up, but he still tries his best to keep up with what is going on at home. 
 About a month ago, he said, he read a newspaper article online that hit him hard. The Hawaii High School Athletic Association, walloped by recent state budget cuts, had pleaded for financial help from private citizens and corporations. The fledgling fund-raising drive was called Save Our Sports, or S.O.S., and two banks, two foundations and the head of the association had pledged a total of $430,000. 
 Victorino, 28, called his father, Mike, a city councilman living in Wailuku, a town near the sugarcane fields that cover Maui's arid central plain, and asked him more about the situation. Then Victorino, an Eagle Scout who was once a multisport star at St. Anthony High School on Maui, told the association's chairman, Keith Amemiya, that he would send a check for $10,000. 
 At last count, officials had collected more than $700,000 of their $1.2 million goal, helping the association keep sports seasons going and avoid the prospect of forcing students to pay to play. 
 ''It was almost like an obligation to do that,'' Victorino said before a recent Phillies game at Citizens Bank Park. ''It tells me something. In Hawaiian culture, everybody's got each other's back. I'm not saying that doesn't happen anywhere else, but it is true in Hawaii. Family is No. 1.''
 A year after the association narrowly avoided a cut in state financing, it watched the state government slash $2.4 million this summer of the $6.7 million it had budgeted for athletic programs covering about 25,000 students statewide.
 Hawaii has no top-level professional sports teams and limited college offerings beyond the University of Hawaii, so high school sports carry greater significance for many. Residents identify themselves by high school alma mater. Everyone knows President Obamaattended Punahou School in Honolulu.
 But water, and the travel required to cross it, complicate matters for an organization overseeing statewide competition for 95 schools.
 ''On Lanai and Molokai, every game is really an away game,'' Amemiya said in a telephone interview from his office in Honolulu. With a slight chuckle, he added, ''You can't drive there, or your bus will sink.''
 Victorino said St. Anthony, a private school, could fly to most away games, but he knew he was lucky. The Maui Interscholastic League includes two high schools on Lanai and Molokai, and getting from those islands to Maui is expensive, complicated and time consuming.
 Camie Kimball, the athletic director at Molokai High School, a public school with about 330 students in grades 9 through 12, said sports teams usually must ride a ferry to Maui. The ride takes about 1 hour 45 minutes each way, and Kimball said the round-trip fare ran from $80 to $105 per student.
 When a team arrives in Lahaina, Maui, players wait until a coach catches a cab ride to fetch a bus kept nearby at Lahainaluna High School. 
 For a tournament in August on Oahu, the Molokai girls' volleyball team slept at a nearby high school and cooked meals in the cafeteria. 
 ''There's not a whole lot to do on this island,'' Kimball said in a telephone interview from her office on Molokai. ''We don't even have a movie theater anymore. We don't have a whole lot of industry.''
 Molokai's unemployment rate topped 16 percent in July, and Kimball said several athletes at the high school would probably have had to drop out had they been required to pay fees. Amemiya and his wife, Bonny, donated $30,000 to the S.O.S. fund in July, including $15,000 for Molokai High School to cover interisland travel costs.
 ''When times are tough here, people pitch in, especially for sports -- and this is gender-neutral,'' said Jack Tsui, a former president at First Hawaiian Bank who is now with the Clarence T. C. Ching Foundation, which pledged $200,000 to the drive. ''I'm really not overly surprised. I thought people in the state would help out.''
 They have, Amemiya said, often with $20 checks. But Amemiya said tourists had contributed to the S.O.S. fund after learning about it. The drive ends in October, and Amemiya said he thought the goal would be met.
 ''This is a need-to-have,'' Mufi Hannemann, the mayor of Honolulu, said in a telephone interview. ''Sports is not a nice-to-have, it's a need-to-have. The importance of the issue is sky-high. People here get it about the value of sports.''
 For his part, Victorino said he could not imagine instituting a fee for sports. ''You shouldn't have to pay to play as a kid,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Newark Begins Cutting Water Service Over Late Bills

BYLINE: By DERRICK HENRY and COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
Newark began shutting off water service on Monday to dozens of customers who were overdue on their bills, sending hapless property owners, bills in hand, to City Hall in hopes of paying at least enough to keep their taps flowing.
 All afternoon, they climbed to the building's mezzanine level and filed through a round room with a stained-glass cupola and marble benches. The line led to Room 117, the offices of the Department of Water and Sewer Utilities, where that genteel ambience gave way to fluorescent lights and a gray linoleum floor, then to the equally dreary Room 104, home to the Department of Finance, to complete their transactions. 
 Some people walked back and forth between the rooms with paperwork or to double-check details. Occasionally, city workers emerged to shout, ''Is anybody paying in full?''
 Few were. Most were like Sam Gonzalez, 55, of Bloomfield, N.J., who owns a building in Newark with a bodega on the ground floor and apartments above. He is behind $5,112 on the water bill.
 ''I only have half,'' said Mr. Gonzalez, who added that he hoped it would be enough to keep water service in his building. He had brought $2,500 in cash and a cashier's check. ''I don't have any more than that.'' 
 On Friday, the city announced that it was cracking down on delinquent accounts, beginning with 1,600 of the worst offenders in a first wave on Monday. They are among about 5,000 property owners who, the city says, owe more than $1,000 each. All have been sent warning letters, city officials said. 
 The mayor's office would not identify any people or businesses who owed money, and would not provide any details about accounts that were in arrears. The city wanted to be ''sensitive to their privacy,'' said Esmeralda Diaz Cameron, a spokeswoman for Mayor Cory A. Booker. 
 Desiree Peterkin Bell, the mayor's director of communications, said about 125 property owners had their service cut off by day's end. But she said service would be restored by Monday night for those who had paid their bills.
 Mr. Gonzalez blamed the recession and the effects it has had on his tenants for his failure to pay the bill. 
 ''Times are bad, nobody's working, business is slow,'' he said. ''Some of my tenants are not working. They've been laid off. They're paying when they can.''
 He acknowledged that he had put off paying the bill. ''They've been lenient,'' he said of the city. 
 April Virhuez-Collins, 54, who said she owed $1,200, said city workers told her to come up with $250.99 by Tuesday to prevent an interruption of her water service. 
 ''If not, they cut it off,'' she said. Ms. Virhuez-Collins said she fell behind because she had not earned any income since May, when she left a job with New Jersey Transit after 13 years to take an early-retirement plan. 
 ''I worked all my life for 40 years,'' she said. ''I never thought I'd have to go through this.''
 Fatima Cabrera, 40, was among the final people to make arrangements on their delinquent accounts at the end of the day, paying her bill in full. She said a city worker had driven up to her home earlier and told her, ''We're here to take care of the water.''
 Ms. Cabrera, who lives with a son, 16, and daughter, 10, said she pleaded with the worker to give her a break. The worker said he would return Tuesday and expect to see her receipt for the paid water bill, she said. 
 She added that she planned to stay home from work on Tuesday to show the worker the receipt. She said she fell behind because she had been out of work for a year and had recently started working as a property manager at a building in Newark. 
 Not everyone was able to keep the water running. 
 Roshe Dousuah, 27, a fashion designer who moved to Newark from Philadelphia two months ago, stood in front of her building on Governor Street, just a few blocks from City Hall. 
 ''I went to turn the water on and there was no water,'' said Ms. Dousuah, who recalled seeing a warning about a week ago on the door. It was addressed to the landlord, who does not live there. 
 Ms. Dousuah said she hoped that her roommate would know how to locate the landlord. Meanwhile, she planned to look for a place to shower. ''I'm really upset. He might not get his rent this month.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Team Seals a Deal With Procter & Gamble

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Procter & Gamble has signed on as a sponsor of the United States Olympic team for the Vancouver and London Games, a move that will place the Olympic rings on more than a dozen household products, from Bounty and Tide to Pepto-Bismol and Pringles. 
 The sponsorship, expected to be announced Tuesday, comes at a key time for the United States Olympic Committee, which has struggled to attract and retain corporate partners in the recession. Company executives said the deal would involve 17 brands. Procter & Gamble will capitalize on the Olympics' appeal to women by running television advertisements for its beauty brands -- including Olay, Pantene and Secret -- during the Games. Olympic logos will appear on packaging and in-store displays to promote other products, like Charmin, Febreze and Scope. 
 Consumer research has shown that the Olympics appeal particularly to women, teenagers and adults ages 18 to 34, said Kirk Perry, vice president for North America at Procter & Gamble. ''That encompasses our consumer base,'' he said Monday in a telephone interview. ''It connects at every income level. It is such an iconic and important event.''
 Officials at Procter & Gamble and the U.S.O.C. declined to specify how much the agreement was worth, but Lisa Baird, the chief marketing officer at the U.S.O.C., said, ''It's a very significant sponsorship for us.''
 Baird said Procter & Gamble had signed on as a partner, the highest level of engagement on the U.S.O.C.'s roster of sponsors. Partners typically pay $15 million to $25 million for the right to use the Team USA and Olympic logos within the United States for four years, said Jim Andrews, a senior vice president at IEG, a sponsorship consulting company in Chicago. 
 ''It's certainly a huge win for the U.S.O.C. in a year that they needed one,'' Andrews said. 
 The U.S.O.C. is one of the few national Olympic committees that do not receive direct government money. Corporate sponsors accounted for 46 percent of the committee's revenue between 2005 and 2008, according to Lindsay DeWall Hogan, a U.S.O.C. spokeswoman. Since the close of the Beijing Olympics last summer, at least six companies -- including longtime supporters like Bank of America and Kodak -- have declined to renew their sponsorships, and Baird said the U.S.O.C. was still in negotiations with AT&T over whether it would renew its contract.
 Baird said her office was talking to a handful of other potential sponsors. A consumer survey in February, she said, showed that Americans saw ''supporting Olympic athletes as an uplifting and uniting cause for our country, even in this climate.''
 But the Olympic brand has struggled recently as companies have moved away from campaigns that build generic brand awareness and toward promotions leading directly to sales. Some sponsors have questioned the value of investing in the Olympics, which occur once every two years. 
 To address those concerns, the U.S.O.C. announced plans this summer to start a television network that would showcase Olympic sports year-round. The network has since been postponed after the International Olympic Committee and NBC, the Olympic broadcaster, raised questions about the deal.
 Several sports marketing experts said the Olympics continued to be a worthwhile investment. ''Sports is a catharsis for people, even during very difficult economic times,'' said Peter Graham, an Olympics expert and a professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina. ''I think some companies are seeing this as an opportunity to buy in now, when their costs are a little bit lower.''

HEADLINE: Pop! An Empty Shop Fills With Art

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Three months ago Simon Tarrant, a 44-year-old painter here who has never had gallery representation and has had only two solo shows in his 15-year career, decided to try something different. He approached the owners of a vacant building on a busy street in one of London's most affluent neighborhoods, and by June he had turned it into an exhibition space, where two of his semi-abstract landscapes now hang prominently. 
 With its four floors of high ceilings and big windows, the building -- formerly a fashion boutique on Fulham Road in Chelsea -- makes an ideal gallery for Mr. Tarrant's art, along with that of 14 of his friends and acquaintances. 
 Best of all, from Mr. Tarrant's point of view, he -- or rather Queen's Elm Artists, a collective he recently helped found -- can use the space for the rest of the year, rent free.
 In Britain as in America, the recession has forced many retail businesses to close or move to cheaper premises, leaving behind vast spaces that have generally remained empty. According to the Local Data Company, a retail industry research concern, the average store vacancy rate here was almost 12 percent at the end of June, up from 4 percent the previous year. 
 Before Mr. Tarrant opened the first Queen's Elm Artists exhibition, which runs through this week, the building stood vacant for more than a year, as its landlord, Sloane Stanley Estate, tried to find a tenant willing to pay $:150,000, or $243,300, in rent, taxes and other costs annually. 
 Now independent curators and entrepreneurial artists like Mr. Tarrant are stepping into the breach, persuading landlords and municipal councils to turn vacant spaces over to them temporarily. Galleries have sprung up throughout the country, and particularly in London, in spots as varied as shopping mall outlets, a scooter showroom and a video store. Last month the British government, worried about the economic, psychological and criminal hazards of retail vacancies, announced a $5 million ''revival fund'' for local governments in hard-hit areas to transform empty shops into something useful, like showrooms for local artists, and another $800,000 to help artists and arts organizations turn vacant high street shops into artistic spaces. 
 Having a place like the Fulham Road building ''is a dream come true'' for artists without galleries, Mr. Tarrant said, but the arrangement also offers obvious benefits to a landlord concerned about high upkeep costs or their alternative, dereliction. In an agreement typical of many being struck, Mr. Tarrant said he would pay for all utilities and return the property in the same or better condition than when the collective moved in. 
 In addition, he has agreed to hand over 15 percent of the proceeds from any artwork sold, and, although he is not required to, has plastered and painted the walls. And in its new role as a gallery, the building has been attracting a constant flow of visitors, two of whom, Mr. Tarrant said, had already expressed interest in renting the space.
 Most of the arrangements are for shorter periods than the six months in Mr. Tarrant's lease, and as a result the exhibition spaces have come to be widely known as pop-up galleries. Three miles northeast of the Queen's Elm Artists building, in the bustle of Covent Garden, two young freelance curators, Lee Johnson and Bakul Patki, are running an exhibition called ''DIY London Seen.'' It is up for just three weeks in a disused shop interior that still smells strongly of the bath soap sold by Lush, a beauty products retailer that moved to another space nearby. 
 An oversize bear covered in small mirrors (by Arran Gregory, a recent art school graduate) stands guard at the entrance to the show, which was inspired by the New York do-it-yourself art scene documented in the film ''Beautiful Losers,'' and put together through the curators' looking at MySpace pages and art school shows. (The landlord, Covent Garden Estates, said it saw the current economic climate as a good opportunity to support the arts.)
 Not that all pop-up galleries involve early-career or struggling artists. This year Charlie Phillips, the owner of the contemporary gallery Eleven, in the fashionable neighborhood of Belgravia, happily entered into partnership with the Grosvenor property group to take advantage of vacancies in two former clothing shops in Belgravia and neighboring Mayfair. 
 The resulting spaces, each open for two months, showed work by well-known artists like Natasha Law and Olly & Suzi. Each, Mr. Phillips said, represented a chance, if temporary, to expand to ''a great location that under normal circumstances we could not afford.''
 But most of these galleries do show less established artists, many in considerably less glamorous locales. In June, for example, a few artists turned the abandoned Apollo Video Store in the borough of Lambeth in South London into the Apollo Project, an art gallery and performance center, while art students in Leytonstone, in East London, used a 20,000-square-foot space formerly occupied by a branch of the now-defunct Woolworths chain to exhibit their works.
 Even in more affluent precincts, though, exposure does not necessarily translate into sales, at least in these recessionary times. As pleased as Mr. Tarrant is with the Queen's Elm Artists space, he has been a little disappointed that only 10 of the 70 or so works in the group's first show have sold. 
 Still, in spite of his agreement with the landlord to leave by the end of the year, he has already decided he would prefer to stay. ''We started off as a temporary thing, but it's now turning into something more permanent,'' he said. ''We're drawing up a business plan and really want to make it financially viable.''

HEADLINE: Checking In Cheaply

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
As the recession unfolds, a growing number of budget-minded business travelers are shifting to lower-price hotels, whether by choice or because their bosses are telling them to. 
 The biggest beneficiaries of the shift, travel experts say, are the hotels that keep prices down by not offering amenities like restaurants or meeting rooms.
 ''Travel managers have told us within their companies they're moving travelers to lower-tier hotels, '' said Caleb Tiller, spokesman for the National Business Travel Association. ''It's definitely a trend we've seen.'' 
 He said companies were taking a varied approach to the switch. Some are requiring it, others strongly encouraging it and others trying to set an example by having even top executives book more modest accommodations. 
 For those now staying at more bare-bones properties, the downgrading has some discomforts. Alan Hawrylyshen, a technology applications director for a manufacturer of mobile and voice-over-Internet networks, said he had encountered a host of minor inconveniences.
 At full-service hotels where he once was a regular, Mr. Hawrylyshen said checking in was welcoming and efficient. ''There was never a line. They'd be expecting you, greet you by name.'' Hopscotching to different hotels in search of low rates now means staying at places where his information is not already in the computer system. 
 ''Suddenly, checking in takes longer because they have to process your credit card and you have to fill out forms,'' said Mr. Hawrylyshen, who travels one to four times a month. ''It adds 10 minutes or more, sometimes up to half an hour'' to his already hectic schedule.
 Unfortunately for travelers like Mr. Hawrylyshen, this trend show no signs of abating. According to Peter C. Yesawich, chairman and chief executive at Ypartnership, a travel marketing and research company, a quarter of the nearly 800 business travelers surveyed this year indicated that they were booking less expensive hotels. 
 The trading down has been occurring on all levels: top executives who may have previously stayed at luxury hotels are staying at full-service hotels, while middle managers who used to stay at those properties are now switching to limited-service hotels. 
 ''If you used to stay in a full-service Sheraton, Marriott or Hilton, you may trade down to a Four Points, Courtyard by Marriott or Hilton Garden Inn,'' said Al Calhoun, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels, a real estate management and investment firm. 
 Industry analysts say the one sector that has fared better than others is what is known in the business as ''upscale'' or ''select-service'' hotels. While the terminology may not be familiar to travelers, the brand names are likely to be; Courtyard by Marriott, Hilton Garden Inn and Four Points by Sheraton, among them. 
 These hotels are distinguished from their full-service sister brands by a lack of restaurants, lounge areas or meeting rooms. While some hotels may have one or more of these amenities, they vary by property. By contrast, their presence is a given at full-service hotels. 
 According to Mr. Calhoun, revenue per available room, a crucial measure of a hotel's fiscal health, has not dropped as sharply for select-service properties as it has for other types of hotels. While room rates have softened in recent months, prices have been hit hardest at luxury and full-service chains. 
 Data from Smith Travel Research shows that hotel room rates dropped by an average of 8.1 percent in the first four months of the year, compared with the same period in 2008, with rates at luxury hotels falling by 13.9 percent and rates at select-service hotels declining 8.3 percent. 
 Select-service hotels are also holding their own in occupancy. Occupancy rates are expected to fall across all hotel levels in 2009 because of the recession's impact on business and leisure travel. However, Robert Mandelbaum, director of research information services at the consulting firm PKF Hospitality Research, said select-service hotels would end the year with less of a drop than most other brands. 
 While overall occupancy is expected to drop by 5.6 percent and luxury hotel occupancy by 8.3 percent, select-service occupancy is projected to end the year with a much smaller 3.7 percent decline. 
 This relative robustness could prove to be a double-edged sword in the coming months, though. Hotel investors and developers are increasingly flocking to these types of properties because the select-service hotels are viewed as a relatively safe haven during a time of overall distress for the industry. 
 ''They're cheaper to build, they're cheaper to maintain and they're cheaper to operate,'' said David Loeb, a real estate analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company. He said new hotels were opening at a rapid rate and would most likely add to the problem of too many rooms and not enough travelers to fill them. 
 ''The impact of all of this new supply is a really bloody market-share war,'' he said. ''The operators of these hotels are trying really hard to achieve or keep market share, and they're doing that by lowering prices.'' 
 While this is bad news for hotel operators, it is a silver lining for road warriors and corporate travel managers trying to hold the line on lodging expenses in a tough economy.

HEADLINE: Business Activity Increases More Than Expected

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Business activity in the United States rose more than forecast in August, adding to signs the economy is improving.
 The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said Monday that its business barometer increased to 50, the highest level since September 2008, from 43.4 in July. Fifty is the dividing line between contraction and expansion. 
 Automakers are likely to be at the epicenter of a rebound in manufacturing in coming months as assembly lines speed up after the government's cash-for-clunkers plan left showrooms bare. Increasing demand from overseas and a record reduction in inventories mean that an increase in factory orders and production may last for much of the rest of the year.
 It's ''a manufacturing-led recovery,'' said Robert Stein, a senior economist at First Trust Advisors of Wheaton, Ill. ''Much of this is probably related to the revival in auto production over the past month or so.''
 Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast the index would rise to 48, according to the median of 53 projections. Estimates ranged from 46 to 52.5.
 Economists watch the Chicago index for an early reading on the outlook for overall manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the economy. The Institute for Supply Management is scheduled to release its August factory report on Tuesday. According to a Bloomberg survey, that measure will show expansion for the first time since January 2008.
 The Chicago report's orders gauge climbed to 52.5, the highest level in a year, from 48 in July, and the production index rose to 52.9, from 43.3.
 The employment index increased to 38.7, from 35.3. A measure of prices paid for raw materials jumped to 50, from 35, while a gauge of delivery times increased to 54.6, from 49.6.

HEADLINE: The Obama Slide

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Two tides swept over American politics last winter. The first was the Obama tide. Barack Obama came into office with an impressive 70 percent approval rating. The second was the independent tide. Over the first months of this year, the number of people who called themselves either Democrats or Republicans declined, while the number who called themselves independents surged ahead. 
 Obama's challenge was to push his agenda through a Democratic-controlled government while retaining the affection of the 39 percent of Americans in the middle. 
 The administration hasn't been able to pull it off. From the stimulus to health care, it has joined itself at the hip to the liberal leadership in Congress. The White House has failed to veto measures, like the pork-laden omnibus spending bill, that would have demonstrated independence and fiscal restraint. By force of circumstances and by design, the president has promoted one policy after another that increases spending and centralizes power in Washington.
 The result is the Obama slide, the most important feature of the current moment. The number of Americans who trust President Obama to make the right decisions has fallen by roughly 17 percentage points. Obama's job approval is down to about 50 percent. All presidents fall from their honeymoon highs, but in the history of polling, no newly elected American president has fallen this far this fast.
 Anxiety is now pervasive. Trust in government rose when Obama took office. It has fallen back to historic lows. Fifty-nine percent of Americans now think the country is headed in the wrong direction.
 The public's view of Congress, which ticked upward for a time, has plummeted. Charlie Cook, who knows as much about Congressional elections as anyone in the country, wrote recently that Democratic fortunes have ''slipped completely out of control.'' He and the experts he surveyed believe there is just as much chance that the Democrats could lose more than 20 House seats in the next elections as less than 20.
 There are also warning signs in the Senate. A recent poll shows Harry Reid, the majority leader, trailing the Republican Danny Tarkanian, a possible 2010 opponent, by 49 percent to 38 percent. When your majority leader is down to a 38 percent base in his home state, that's not good.
 The public has soured on Obama's policy proposals. Voters often have only a fuzzy sense of what each individual proposal actually does, but more and more have a growing conviction that if the president is proposing it, it must involve big spending, big government and a fundamental departure from the traditional American approach.
 Driven by this general anxiety, and by specific concerns, public opposition to health care reform is now steady and stable. Independents once solidly supported reform. Now they have swung against it. As the veteran pollster Bill McInturff has pointed out, public attitudes toward Obamacare exactly match public attitudes toward Clintoncare when that reform effort collapsed in 1994.
 Amazingly, some liberals are now lashing out at Obama because the entire country doesn't agree with The Huffington Post. Some now argue that the administration should just ignore the ignorant masses and ram health care through using reconciliation, the legislative maneuver that would reduce the need for moderate votes.
 This would be suicidal. You can't pass the most important domestic reform in a generation when the majority of voters think you are on the wrong path. To do so would be a sign of unmitigated arrogance. If Obama agrees to use reconciliation, he will permanently affix himself to the liberal wing of his party and permanently alienate independents. He will be president of 35 percent of the country -- and good luck getting anything done after that.
 The second liberal response has been to attack the budget director, Peter Orszag. It was a mistake to put cost control at the center of the health reform sales job, many now argue. The president shouldn't worry about the deficit. Just pass the spending parts.
 But fiscal restraint is now the animating issue for moderate Americans. To take the looming $9 trillion in debt and balloon it further would be to enrage a giant part of the electorate.
 This is a country that has always been suspicious of centralized government. This is a country that has just lived through an economic trauma caused by excessive spending and debt. Most Americans still admire Obama and want him to succeed. But if he doesn't proceed in a manner consistent with the spirit of the nation and the times, voters will find a way to stop him.
 The president's challenge now is to halt the slide. That doesn't mean giving up his goals. It means he has to align his proposals to the values of the political center: fiscal responsibility, individual choice and decentralized authority.
 Events have pushed Barack Obama off to the left. Time to rebalance.

HEADLINE: Democrats Focus on Health Care in California Election

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
While it may it may be too soon to tell whether the current passion surrounding health care will carry over into next year's midterm elections, voters in California's 10th Congressional District will go to the polls on Tuesday in a race in which the issue has been front and center.
 The reason, most of the leading contenders say, comes from both the makeup of the district, which touches on four largely suburban counties east of San Francisco and is solidly Democratic, and the high profile the issue has been given by President Obama's proposed overhaul. 
''We knew in our polling that it was big,'' said State Senator Mark DeSaulnier, a Democrat. ''And we knew the numbers were going to go up from what we were hearing from D.C.''
 The special election was triggered when Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, a Democrat, took a top post in the State Department. 
 If no candidate receives a majority on Tuesday -- a strong possibility in a race with 14 candidates -- a general election with the top vote-getter from each party will be held Nov. 3. 
 The short campaign season has made tactical decisions about issues especially important, and health care has been the topic of choice for several Democrats. All the Democrats support health care overhaul, but some differ about the levels of oversight and government involvement.
 Mr. DeSaulnier, who was endorsed by Ms. Tauscher but trails Lt. Gov. John Garamendi in polls, used precious campaign money on a 12-page direct-mail pamphlet on the health care issue. A television advertisement, in late July, also focused on health care.
 Mr. Garamendi, the front-runner, said he had also focused on health care early on and recently issued a news release calling it his top priority. ''I looked at the campaign, I said, 'This is something I'm gong to push, period, regardless of the politics,' '' said Mr. Garamendi, who added that his interest in health care dated to his days as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s and included a stint as California's insurance commissioner.
 Assemblywoman Joan Buchanan said she had seen the rigors of the health care system up close as her 29-year-old son has dealt with a brain tumor. But Ms. Buchanan said she had emphasized the economy more. ''I'm not going to say it's not on people's minds,'' said Ms. Buchanan, who once worked as an executive of a dental company. ''But I'm hearing, 'Jobs, jobs, jobs.' '' 
 Anthony Woods, who has highlighted his background as a Harvard graduate and an openly gay veteran of two tours of duty in Iraq, said the issue was also personal, having grown up without health care and watching his mother's housekeeping business struggle with high premiums.
 The race's six Republican candidates have preferred to focus on wasteful spending, trade policy and family values. 
 A prominent Republican, David Harmer, a lawyer and son of a former California lieutenant governor, strikes a note of caution in his campaign literature. ''Any health care reform must first do no harm,'' reads an entry on his campaign Web site. 
 Tim Clark, a spokesman for Mr. Harmer, said the issue had lost momentum for local Democrats in the face of controversy over the Obama plan. ''There's been a wholesale retreat,'' Mr. Clark said, adding that he doubted it would be a factor in the November election. 
 Part of the attention paid to health care by Democrats may have to do with the dynamics of a special election, which is expected to have low turnout. Health care tends to be more important for older people who can be counted on to turn out to vote, several campaign consultants said. 
 The strong liberal bent of the 10th District, in which Ms. Tauscher won 65 percent of the vote last November, has also made uncommon the type of outrage seen at many town-hall-style meetings. 
 ''Most of what you get is very calm,'' said Mr. DeSaulnier, who has held four such meetings devoted to health care.

HEADLINE: Overseer of Dreamliner Will Retire From Boeing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said Monday that the executive overseeing its commercial-plane programs, including the delayed 787 Dreamliner, would retire.
 The executive, Scott E. Carson, 63, has led the commercial division since 2006, a period in which the new plane was delayed repeatedly by a variety of problems. 
 He will be succeeded on Tuesday by James F. Albaugh, the company's top executive for military programs, though Mr. Carson will not formally retire until the end of the year, Boeing said in a statement. 
 Dennis Muilenburg, 45, will succeed Mr. Albaugh, 59, at Boeing's military systems division. 
 Four days earlier, Boeing, based in Chicago, set a new schedule for the Dreamliner. The company said that it expected the plane's first test flight to happen by the end of the year and that deliveries to airlines would start in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 Boeing's chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., told reporters and stock analysts that Mr. Carson, who had a background in finance and marketing, had made the decision to retire on his own. 
 ''The decision to retire was Scott's,'' Mr. McNerney said, adding that Mr. Carson felt that, with the new schedule, he would be ''giving his successor a clear path forward on the program.''
 Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm, said he believed that Mr. Carson had been planning to step down for some time. Mr. Hamilton said Mr. Carson told him at the Paris air show in June that he intended to retire once both the 787 and 747-8, an updated version of the jumbo jet that is also expected to fly later this year, completed their first flights.
 Mr. McNerney praised Mr. Albaugh as one of the company's most experienced executives. He also said that Mr. Albaugh, an engineer who has headed Boeing's military, space and related businesses since 2002, ''is a technical guy himself.''
 Mr. Albaugh holds bachelor's degrees in mathematics and physics from Willamette University, and a master's degree in civil engineering from Columbia. He will soon relocate to the Seattle area.
 Mr. Albaugh ''has a deep appreciation for the kind of oversight we need to blend into our development efforts here,'' Mr. McNerney said.
 Mr. Carson had been credited with reviving sales of commercial aircraft before the recession hit. But the 787 Dreamliner, lighter and more fuel-efficient than other airplanes, has been plagued by delays stemming from supply problems, a labor strike, parts shortages and structural flaws. It is Boeing's first major new airplane in a decade and the most popular program in the company's history, with more than 800 advance orders.
 But its first test flight is more than two years behind schedule. And the plane, which will make extensive use of lightweight plastic composite in place of aluminum, was originally planned for delivery in May 2008.
 Mr. Albaugh has been at Boeing for 34 years. While he led the company's military and space businesses, the unit's revenue grew to $34 billion, from $25 billion, the company said, though its revenue flattened out as Pentagon spending peaked.
 During the last two years, Boeing transferred other executives from its military business into top management roles on the Dreamliner project as it tried to get it back on track.

HEADLINE: The Case Against a Super-Regulator

BYLINE: By SHEILA C. BAIR. 
Sheila C. Bair is the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE Obama administration has proposed sweeping changes to our financial regulatory system. I am an active supporter of the key pillars of reform, including the creation of a consumer financial protection agency and the administration's plan to consolidate the supervision of federally chartered financial institutions in a new national bank supervisor. This consolidation would improve the efficiency of federally chartered institutions while not undercutting our dual system of state and federally chartered banks. 
 But some are advocating even more drastic changes, like the creation of a single regulator for all banks (and bank holding companies). We clearly need to streamline the system, but a single regulator is not the solution. Calls for consolidation beyond the administration's plan fail to identify the real roots of last year's financial meltdown. The truth is, no regulatory structure -- be it a single regulator as in Britain or the multiregulator system we have in the United States -- performed well in the crisis. 
 The principal enablers of our current difficulties were institutions that took on enormous risk by exploiting regulatory gaps between banks and the nonbank shadow financial system, and by using unregulated over-the-counter derivative contracts to develop volatile and potentially dangerous products. Consumers continue to face huge gaps in personal financial protections. We also lack a credible method for closing large financial institutions without inflicting severe collateral damage on the economy. 
 The creation of a single regulator for all federal- and state-chartered banks would not address these problems. Rather, it would endanger a thriving, 150-year-old banking system that has separate charters for federal and state banks. Within this system, state-chartered institutions tend to be community-oriented and very close to the small businesses and consumers they serve. They provide loans that support economic growth and job creation, especially in rural areas. Main Street banks also are sensitive to market discipline because they know that they're not too big to fail and that they'll be closed if they become insolvent. 
 Concentrating power in a single regulator would inevitably benefit the largest banks and punish community ones. A single regulator's resources and attention would be focused on the largest banks. This would generate more consolidation in the banking industry at a time when we need to reduce our reliance on large financial institutions and put an end to the idea that certain banks are too big to fail. We need to shift the balance back toward community banking, not toward a system that encourages even more consolidation.
 A single-regulator system could also hurt the deposit-insurance system. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation currently supervises state banks. The loss of a significant regulatory role would limit its ability to protect depositors by identifying and assessing risks in the financial system.
 We can't put all our eggs in one basket. The risk of weak or misdirected regulation would be increased if power was consolidated in a single federal regulator. We need new mechanisms to achieve consensus positions and rapid responses to financial crises as they develop. 
 I have advocated the creation of a strong council of federal financial regulators. This council would monitor the financial system to help prevent the accumulation of systemic risks and would also have the authority to close even the largest institutions. But we don't need -- and can't afford -- to depend on one supreme regulator to have sole decision-making authority in times when our entire financial system is in flux. 
 One advantage of our multiple-regulator system is that it permits diverse viewpoints. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation voiced strong concerns about the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's relatively relaxed rules for determining how much capital banks should have on hand. In a single-regulator system, it's very likely that these rules would have been put into effect much more quickly and with fewer safeguards, and our largest banks would have faced the current crisis with much smaller buffers of capital. This is not about protecting turf. This is about protecting consumers and the safety of our financial system.
 Working with Congress, we need to draw on the best ideas available to plug regulatory gaps as outlined in the administration's proposal. We may never have a better opportunity to address the root causes of this crisis -- and prevent it from ever happening again.

HEADLINE: Japan's New Leadership

 BODY:
It took Japan decades, but voters finally got fed up with the entrenched ruling clique and threw it out of office. The landslide election victory for the Democratic Party of Japan was the worst defeat for the rival Liberal Democratic Party in more than 50 years. We hope this stunning rout presages the end of economic decline and political stagnation, but that will take real leadership, not just trading one group of politicians for another. 
 The first challenge is getting the economy out of its worsening crisis. Japan, crippled by recession throughout the 1990s, is about to lose its standing as the world's second-largest economy, to China. The economy, projected to contract 6 percent this year, is among the world's worst performers.
 Although constrained by a public debt approaching 100 percent of its gross domestic product and a fiscal deficit hovering around 10 percent of G.D.P., Japan needs to do more to stimulate domestic demand -- to deal with the immediate emergency and diminish its historical dependence on exports as an economic engine. This requires maintaining fiscal stimulus. It also requires a longer-term strategy that encourages spending by Japanese households. The Democrats' plans do not yet amount to a strategy that could rebalance the economy and put it on a path of domestically focused growth.
 Yukio Hatoyama, who is expected to be the next prime minister, wants a more equal alliance with the United States. Some of his policy proposals are reasonable, but others are cause for concern. We are eager to hear more details. The United States needs a responsible strategic partner committed to a strengthened alliance.
 One concern: Mr. Hatoyama's suggestion that Japan not renew the mandate for its ships on a refueling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of United States military operations in Afghanistan. President Obama is implementing a new Afghan strategy. Japan should continue its risk-free mission, at least through next spring.
 One good sign: Mr. Hatoyama's pledge not to visit the Yasukuni Shrine, a symbol of Japan's wartime past. Visits by some of his predecessors stirred damaging tensions with China and South Korea. 
 Some wonder if the Liberal Democratic Party can survive this loss. We hope it -- or some successor -- does. Every democracy needs a vigorous and responsible opposition to give voters a choice -- just like the Democratic Party finally gave the voters in this election.

HEADLINE: Great Lakes Rescue

 BODY:
Barack Obama, of Illinois, is the first president since Michigan's Gerald Ford to come from a heartland state that depends heavily on the Great Lakes for its economic well-being. Hopes have thus been raised that the Great Lakes will at last get the help they need. 
 The Clean Water Act of 1972 did much to stop direct discharges from industries and municipal sewage systems. But the lakes still suffer -- from lingering industrial pollution, toxics like mercury, deteriorating wetlands and, more recently, invasive species that have devastated the fishing industry and fouled shorelines. 
 In response, the Environmental Protection Agency will soon roll out recovery programs known collectively as the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. In June, the House gave the program the entire $475 million the White House wanted. The Senate should do likewise.
 This is a small down payment on a project that could ultimately cost $20 billion. But it is an important start that will be administered by one agency, the E.P.A., in an effort to avoid the scattershot funding that undermined earlier restoration efforts.
 Many of the tasks that lie ahead are easily identified, and some are ''shovel-ready,'' awaiting only an infusion of federal energy and money. But nobody has found the answer to what has become the lakes' biggest and most complex enemy -- the invasive species.
 The worst is the quagga mussel, a fingernail-sized shellfish that made its way to the lakes on an ocean freighter. First documented in Lake Erie in 1989, these tiny creatures now carpet the lake floor and filter out the tiny organisms at the bottom of the food chain with such efficiency that there is little left for bigger fish. Species vital to local economies -- like salmon and whitefish -- are disappearing. Recreational fishing in Lake Huron has nearly collapsed. Lake Michigan could be next.
 The hope is that a truce of sorts can someday be reached between native species and the exotics. But that will not happen unless new invasions stop -- which will require sterilizing the ballast of overseas freighters or, possibly, closing the lakes to foreign shipping. 
 That would be a radical step, but not irrational. It seems increasingly clear that the economic damage from exotic species outweighs the benefits of allowing polluting ocean ships into the Great Lakes.

HEADLINE: OBAMA TO WEIGH BUILDUP OPTION IN AFGHAN WAR

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and DEXTER FILKINS; Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Dexter Filkins from Kabul, Afghanistan. Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A new report by the top commander in Afghanistan detailing the deteriorating situation there confronts President Obama with the politically perilous decision of whether to deepen American involvement in the eight-year-old war amid shrinking public support at home.
 The classified assessment submitted Monday by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who took over American and NATO forces in Afghanistan in June, did not request additional American troops, American officials said, but they added that it effectively laid the groundwork for such a request in coming weeks. 
 While details of the report remained secret, the revised strategy articulated by General McChrystal in recent public comments would invest the United States more extensively in Afghanistan than it has been since American forces helped topple the Taliban government following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Taking a page from the 2007 strategy shift in Iraq, he has emphasized protecting civilians over just engaging insurgents.
 For Mr. Obama, who already ordered an additional 21,000 troops to Afghanistan this year, the prospect of a still larger deployment would test his commitment to a war he did not launch even as it grows more violent by the month. 
 He already faces growing discontent among his liberal base, not only over the war but also over national security policy, health care, gay rights and other issues.
 An expanded American footprint would also increase Mr. Obama's entanglement with an Afghan government widely viewed as corrupt and illegitimate. Multiplying allegations of fraud in the Aug. 20 presidential election have left Washington with little hope for a credible partner in the war once the results are final.
 The latest tally, with nearly half of the polling stations counted, showed President Hamid Karzai leading with 45.9 percent against 33.3 percent for his main opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, Reuters reported. 
 But the White House left open the possibility that Mr. Obama would send more troops. ''There's broad agreement that for many years, our effort in Afghanistan has been under-resourced politically, militarily and economically,'' Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Monday. He went on to use the words ''under-resourced'' and ''under-resource'' six more times during his daily briefing.
 The report comes after a sharp escalation of violence in Afghanistan, where more American troops died in August than in any month since the beginning of the war. 
 The military announced Monday that two American soldiers died in separate attacks involving homemade bombs, bringing the total killed last month to 51, according to the Web site icasualties.org. The number of such attacks has nearly quadrupled since 2007, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 ''The situation in Afghanistan is serious, but success is achievable and demands a revised implementation strategy, commitment and resolve, and increased unity of effort,'' General McChrystal said in a statement after sending his report to Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of all Middle East forces. 
 A military official said General Petraeus immediately endorsed its findings and forwarded it on Monday to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who will review it before sending it to the White House.
 The report coincides with an effort by the Obama administration to develop a series of benchmarks, or metrics, to measure progress in Afghanistan, much as was done in Iraq. Congress has insisted on evidence of improvement to justify the additional troops, financial investment and civilian reconstruction teams already committed by Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Gates said Monday that despite the ''gloom and doom'' that has characterized recent discussion, Afghanistan today is a ''mixed picture.'' 
 He said he would consider any troop requests in the coming weeks, but told Bloomberg News that he was concerned about ''the implications of significant additional forces in terms of the foreign footprint in Afghanistan, whether the Afghans will see this as us becoming more of an occupier or their partner, and how do you differentiate those.'' 
 Shortly after taking office Mr. Obama ordered 17,000 more combat troops and 4,000 more trainers to Afghanistan, and once they all arrive the American force there will number 68,000. As the NATO commander, General McChrystal also has 40,000 additional foreign forces available to him, but some of their home governments have placed restrictions on how they can be used.
 General McChrystal wants a large expansion of Afghan security forces and an acceleration of their training, according to American commanders. The Afghan government currently has about 134,000 police officers and 82,000 soldiers, although many of them are poorly equipped and have little logistical support.
 Under the strategy described by General McChrystal and other commanders in recent weeks, the overriding goal of American and NATO forces would not be so much to kill Taliban insurgents as to make ordinary Afghans feel secure, and thus isolate the insurgents. That means using force less and focusing on economic development and good governance. 
 General McChrystal also intends to try to unify the effort of American allies like Britain, Canada, Germany and France, and possibly to ask them to contribute more troops, money and training.
 With polls showing falling support for the Afghan war, critics in Congress have grown increasingly vocal in calling for withdrawal. 
 Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, returned from Afghanistan last week and said that despite the capable Americans now there, he was pessimistic about the chances of success and did not even know how to define it.
 ''I have this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that we're getting sucked into an endless war here,'' he said in an interview.
 Some Afghanistan specialists said Mr. Obama might have to swallow his own doubts and defy his base. ''I think he's going to have to tough it out,'' said James Dobbins, a former American envoy to Afghanistan. ''The downside of a policy of disengagement and what would happen for now would be more severe both for the president and for the country.'' Mr. Obama has said that deciding to send the additional troops was the hardest decision he has made during his young presidency. On Sunday, just before ending his vacation in Martha's Vineyard, he visited briefly at the Cape Cod Air Station with the family of a 21-year-old Marine who was killed in Afghanistan in July.
 Mr. Obama had met the Marine, Cpl. Nicholas Xiarhos, who was born in Hyannis, Mass., in February when he visited Camp Lejeune, N.C., to announce his plan to withdraw combat forces from Iraq. He told a story then of two Marines who stood in the path of a suicide bomber's truck and stopped it from entering a Marine outpost in Ramadi, Iraq, losing their own lives but saving dozens of their colleagues. 
 One of those saved was Corporal Xiarhos. He later shipped out to Afghanistan, where he was killed in action in July.

Thin Rate Spread
 Par for the Course
 Commercial lenders long for the days of ''3-6-3''. That's when bankers could borrow at 3 percent, lend at 6 percent and tee off on the golf course by 3 p.m. Now banks are trying to return to this pleasingly simple business model. Their first-half results show how hard it is. 
 British lenders, for instance. All of their net interest margins -- the difference between what they pay for funds and what they earn on loans -- slumped in the first half of 2009. The country's biggest bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, reported its net interest margin dropped from 2.1 percentage points to 1.7. 
 But it's not just a British problem. While the net interest margins of several large United States lenders improved slightly in the second quarter, a number of smaller banks, like United Western Bancorp and Pacific State Bancorp, experienced sharp year-over-year declines. Even Asian lenders like the Industrial Commercial Bank of China reported falling net interest margins. 
 The problem lies with low official interest rates. This hits banks' liability spreads, the margin between base rates and the interest they pay on customer deposits. During the boom, liability spreads were where banks made their money. In Britain, base rates were about 4 percent and depositors received tiny returns, typically less than 0.5 percent. In the United States, the federal funds rate was 5.25 percent in 2006, while depositors earned about 2 percent.
 On the other side of the balance sheet, boom-time margins on lending were held back by competition. The so-called asset spread, the margin between base rate and the rate charged on customer borrowing, was thin. In other words, 3-6-3 looked more like 0-5-3. 
 Now the opposite is true. Banks cannot cut deposit interest rates below zero, so plunging base rates have savaged liability spreads. True, lenders are repricing loans upward to account for the real risks of lending. But demand for credit is subdued. 
 This won't stay the same forever. Rising base rates will restore spreads on customer deposits, and asset spreads should stay high. But pressure from regulators to replace hot wholesale financing with more stable deposits will mean banks have to offer higher interest rates. Competition could erode the benefit of wider liability spreads. A return to the world of ''3-6-3'' could be some way off.
 Fantastic Skeptics
 Walt Disney has long inspired impressionable youngsters. The entertainment company may now give some imaginative ideas to acquisitive chief executives. It didn't take any Spidey sense to think that the superhero creator Marvel would make a good fit with the Magic Kingdom. But the purchase's very logic just might spawn imitators.
 The credit crisis has left the mergers and acquisitions market a wasteland, inhabited almost entirely by defensive and desperate deals. Even leftovers from better times, like Volkswagen's long courtship of Porsche, have failed to prevent merger activity from declining to almost Lilliputian dimensions. 
 The $4 billion Marvel purchase, along with the $5.5 billion oil industry purchase of BJ Services by Baker Hughes announced on the same day, suggests some rain may be falling in the deal makers' desert as confidence in the equity and credit markets reaches boardrooms. True, three years ago, both transactions would have been dwarfed by bigger leveraged buyouts. But they rank in this year's top 10. 
 Stronger financial markets are apt to make other sellers feel more Hulkish and buyers less mousy. In a wobbly economy, companies may think about buying growth through acquisition. And with the Standard & Poor's 500 index trading at a healthy 19 times estimated earnings, takeover targets may find the premiums on offer quite palatable. 
 When deal-making picks up, the first transactions are usually bargains. But the market recovery was too sharp for that. So it looks like the ride has sped on to sensible, if expensive, purchases. The Marvel acquisition requires something close to heroic profits to pay off for Disney's owners. 
 Disney investors didn't get caught up in the action -- they sold. The share price decline may be healthy. When merger momentum really gets going, companies splash out for takeovers that make little sense to anyone except the investment bankers involved. If Disney's deal confidence spreads, so too should shareholder skepticism. Otherwise fantasy figures could wind up costing real money.

HEADLINE: Clunker Program Spurred August Sales

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Auto sales perked up in August because of cash for clunkers, but both General Motors and Chrysler struggled after emerging from bankruptcy protection.
 Total industry sales in the United States increased 1 percent during the month compared with August 2008, and rose 26 percent compared with July.
 Much of the improvement was attributed to the government's popular cash-for-clunkers program that gave consumers vouchers worth up to $4,500 if they traded in an older, gas-guzzling model. 
 But even as most automakers posted gains in August, sales at G.M. dropped 20 percent and Chrysler's sales fell 15 percent.
 Ford posted a 17 percent gain in sales in August, partly because its Focus compact car was one of the top-sellers in the clunker program.
 Both G.M. and Chrysler have found it difficult to keep pace with the market after their trips through bankruptcy this year.
 Analysts said their performance was not surprising, given that the companies were drastically reorganizing operations after receiving financial bailouts from the Obama administration.
 ''We're still going through a phase of restructuring for both automakers,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president of the auto-pricing Web site TrueCar.com. ''We really didn't anticipate anything to happen in terms of their product lineup or their marketing efforts in this short a period of time.''
 G.M. executives, however, stressed that it was beginning to rebuild sales and restock inventories after cutting back production this year.
 The company pointed to strong sales of some its newest products, like the Camaro muscle car and Equinox sport utility vehicle, as evidence that consumers are starting to return to G.M. showrooms.
 ''It's the first time we've seen gains like this across so much of our portfolio this year,'' said Michael C. DiGiovanni, G.M.'s chief sales analyst.
 G.M.'s market share in the United States remained just above 19 percent in August, about the level it has maintained all year. Chrysler, now partly owned and managed by the Italian carmaker Fiat, did not comment on its weak August numbers. The company's market share dipped to 7 percent during the month, compared with 9 percent for the first eight months of the year.
 One analyst said that Chrysler was less able to take advantage of the clunkers program because its product lineup consists mainly of trucks and S.U.V.'s.
 ''It just underscores their lack of a competitive small-car product, which is the opportunity for Fiat to add value,'' said Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital.
 The most popular vehicles bought in the program were small cars built by Asian companies and Ford Motor, the only American automaker to avoid bankruptcy.
 Other automakers did benefit from cash for clunkers, which accounted for sales of 690,000 vehicles in a one-month period that began the last week of July.
 Ford also said sales of its F-series pickup truck rose for the first time since October 2006, which Ford said was a positive sign for the broader economy.
 ''We believe the fourth quarter will be better than the second quarter and the first half of this year,'' said Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president for United States sales and marketing. ''It will start the recovery.''
 Asian auto companies had varied results in August, most of them positive.
 Hyundai, the South Korean automaker, said its sales climbed 47 percent to a record. Honda sales were up 10 percent and Toyota reported a 6 percent increase. Nissan's sales were down by 3 percent.
 Over all, the industry's annualized sales rate for the month hit 14 million units, the highest pace so far this year.
 Analysts said that showroom traffic was already starting to fall now that the clunkers program is over. But the stimulus provided by clunkers could have a lingering impact in the months ahead.
 ''We do see clunkers providing some momentum because it has gotten consumers interested in buying vehicles again,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with IHS Global Insight.
 The increase in demand from the program has prompted several automakers, including G.M. and Ford, to increase vehicle production to replenish inventories, adding to the momentum that appears to be building in the broader manufacturing sector.
 Hourly workers are being called back at a handful of plants, and some factories are running on overtime. G.M. said Tuesday that its fourth-quarter production volumes would be 20 percent higher than during the July to September period.
 It may be some time, however, before G.M. and Chrysler can get back in step with the industry. G.M., in particular, will be hard-pressed to maintain its 19 percent market share once it sells its Saturn, Hummer and Saab brands, and discontinues sales of Pontiac models.
 ''G.M. and Chrysler still have a long recovery ahead of them,'' Ms. Lindland said. ''The fact is, they have gone as low as a company can go and still survive.''

HEADLINE: As G-20 Convenes, Waning Enthusiasm for Regulating Bonuses

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Judy Dempsey contributed reporting from Berlin.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The financial crisis may be slowly ebbing and some banks returning to profit, but the issue of bankers' bonuses remains politically charged, especially in Europe.
 In April, with the crisis still raw, leaders from the Group of 20 agreed at a meeting in London to find ways to curb bonus checks, including deferring payments and rewarding employees based on the performance of a bank. They proposed penalties in cases where the hunt for bonuses encouraged excessive risk-taking.
 Yet action on those goals has been patchy. France and Germany have laid down relatively strict rules governing remuneration, while Britain and the United States have shown less vigor, experts say. 
 G-20 finance ministers will meet on Friday in London for preparatory talks, but analysts and officials expect less impetus for concerted action when global leaders reconvene in Pittsburgh on Sept. 24-25.
 ''No one will come up with a global pay policy,'' said Kenneth Clarke, the former British chancellor of the Exchequer and now the Conservative Party's business secretary. Instead, regulators in individual countries should ''make sure that bonus schemes don't encourage short-term and irresponsible behavior.''
 Most analysts agree that for codes on pay to be effective, similar rules need to be enacted by all major economies. Some governments see their own role as limited; others are wary of losing investment to neighbors.
 France, however, has taken some bold steps. Last week, President Nicolas Sarkozy called on the G-20 to consider caps on the total bonus pools of banks and individual bonuses, and to cease working with those institutions that did not agree. He had just persuaded French banks to stretch two-thirds of their bonuses over three years and give a third in shares.
 At a meeting in Berlin on Monday, Mr. Sarkozy won broad backing from Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is seeking re-election on Sept. 27.
 ''Bonus payments are the thing that quite rightly drives a lot of people up the wall,'' she said.
 BaFin, the German markets regulator, said last month that short-term profit should no longer determine bonuses, and that they would have to be repaid if deals proved too risky in retrospect. Those rules go into effect on Jan. 1. 
 Belgium and the Netherlands are also taking steps to limit executive remuneration.
 French officials sense that it will be hard to win full support from Washington, but they have pledged to retain their tough stance regardless.
 ''France and Germany have never been opposed to having a sideswipe at Anglo-Saxon capitalism,'' said Ruth Lea, an economic adviser to Arbuthnot Banking Group in London.
 In an interview published Monday in The Financial Times, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain said that bonuses should be based on long-term success, that banks should ''claw back'' rewards if performance suffered subsequently and that regulators should be able to impose higher capital requirements on firms.
 But Mr. Brown was unenthusiastic about a mandatory cap on bonuses, warning it would be difficult to enforce.
 Britain's market watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, last month backed G-20 guidance, saying bonuses should not be guaranteed for more than a year and payouts should be spread over three years. But it narrowed the number of companies to which the code would apply.
 Still, Mr. Brown's intervention shows how politically fraught the issue has become.
 In the United States, Congress has given the Obama administration limited legal authority to change a corporate culture that promoted outsize compensation. But American officials appear wary of doing anything that could cause an exodus of executives and further damage fragile companies, analysts say. 
 ''Over all, I have the feeling that it's a bit of a damp squib,'' Mrs. Lea said of the drive to cap bonuses.
 Stronger banks in the United States -- like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley -- have already repaid government bailout money and so are not subject to restrictions on pay that can be imposed by Kenneth R. Feinberg, President Obama's adviser for executive compensation.
 Goldman said in July that it was setting aside $11.4 billion for bonuses after it posted a strong second-quarter profit. Other American banks have offered bonus guarantees to poach talent, as have companies elsewhere like Nomura of Japan, Credit Suisse of Switzerland and Barclays Capital of Britain.
 The results of Mr. Feinberg's review of banker compensation are expected after the meetings in Pittsburgh.
 Nicolas Veron, a regulation expert at the Bruegel research institution in Brussels, said it would be hard for the G-20 to enforce pay limits.
 ''Can you regulate compensation in a way that cannot be maneuvered around by the financial industry?'' he said. ''In the past, market forces of supply and demand have had the upper hand.''

HEADLINE: Low-Wage Workers Are Often Cheated, Study Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Low-wage workers are routinely denied proper overtime pay and are often paid less than the minimum wage, according to a new study based on a survey of workers in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
 The study, the most comprehensive examination of wage-law violations in a decade, also found that 68 percent of the workers interviewed had experienced at least one pay-related violation in the previous work week. 
 ''We were all surprised by the high prevalence rate,'' said Ruth Milkman, one of the study's authors and a sociology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the City University of New York. The study, to be released on Wednesday, was financed by the Ford, Joyce, Haynes and Russell Sage Foundations. 
 In surveying 4,387 workers in various low-wage industries, including apparel manufacturing, child care and discount retailing, the researchers found that the typical worker had lost $51 the previous week through wage violations, out of average weekly earnings of $339. That translates into a 15 percent loss in pay.
 The researchers said one of the most surprising findings was how successful low-wage employers were in pressuring workers not to file for workers' compensation. Only 8 percent of those who suffered serious injuries on the job filed for compensation to pay for medical care and missed days at work stemming from those injuries.
 ''The conventional wisdom has been that to the extent there were violations, it was confined to a few rogue employers or to especially disadvantaged workers, like undocumented immigrants,'' said Nik Theodore, an author of the study and a professor of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois, Chicago. ''What our study shows is that this is a widespread phenomenon across the low-wage labor market in the United States.''
 According to the study, 39 percent of those surveyed were illegal immigrants, 31 percent legal immigrants and 30 percent native-born Americans. 
 The study found that 26 percent of the workers had been paid less than the minimum wage the week before being surveyed and that one in seven had worked off the clock the previous week. In addition, 76 percent of those who had worked overtime the week before were not paid their proper overtime, the researchers found.
 The new study, ''Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers,'' was conducted in the first half of 2008, before the brunt of the recession hit. The median wage of the workers surveyed was $8.02 an hour -- supervisors were not surveyed -- with more than three-quarters of those interviewed earning less than $10 an hour. When the survey was conducted, the minimum wage was $7.15 in New York State, $7.50 in Illinois and $8 in California.
 Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis responded to the report with an e-mail statement, saying, ''There is no excuse for the disregard of federal labor standards -- especially those designed to protect the neediest among us.'' Ms. Solis said she was in the process of hiring 250 more wage-and-hour investigators. ''Today's report clearly shows we still have a major task before us,'' she said.
 The study's authors noted that many low-wage employers comply with wage and labor laws. The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small-business owners, said it encouraged members ''to stay in compliance with state and federal labor laws.''
 But many small businesses say they are forced to violate wage laws to remain competitive.
 The study found that women were far more likely to suffer minimum wage violations than men, with the highest prevalence among women who were illegal immigrants. Among American-born workers, African-Americans had a violation rate nearly triple that for whites.
 ''These practices are not just morally reprehensible, but they're bad for the economy,'' said Annette Bernhardt, an author of the study and policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project. ''When unscrupulous employers break the law, they're robbing families of money to put food on the table, they're robbing communities of spending power and they're robbing governments of vital tax revenues.''
 When the Russell Sage Foundation announced a grant to help finance the survey, it said that low-wage workers were ''hard to find'' for interviews and that ''government compliance surveys shy away from the difficult task of measuring workplace practices beyond the standard wage, benefits and hours questions.''
 The report found that 57 percent of workers sampled had not received mandatory pay documents the previous week, which are intended to help make sure pay is legal and accurate. Of workers who receive tips, 12 percent said their employer had stolen some of the tips.
 One in five workers reported having lodged a complaint about wages to their employer or trying to form a union in the previous year, and 43 percent of them said they had experienced some form of illegal retaliation, like firing or suspension, the study said. 
 In instances when workers' compensation should have been used, the study found, one third of workers injured on the job paid the bills for treatment out of their own pocket and 22 percent used their health insurance. Workers' compensation insurance paid medical expenses for only 6 percent of the injured workers surveyed, the researchers found.

HEADLINE: Meltdown on Wall Street, and Homeowners Left in the Lurch on Main Street

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The dire financial statistics paraded in the documentary ''American Casino'' are infuriating: $12 trillion pledged by the United States government to bail out Wall Street, $18.4 billion handed out in Wall Street bonuses last year, a final reckoning of $42,000 per capita to finance the rescue. But the most shocking images in this finger-pointing investigation of the subprime mortgage crisis are the shots of polluted swimming pools on abandoned properties in Southern California.
 In Riverside County some homeowners forced into foreclosure have not only turned off their pool pumps, allowing mosquitoes to breed and multiply, but have also filled up the spaces with playground equipment and other random trash. Some have even driven vehicles into their pools. 
 Why? As Jared Dever, a soft-spoken regional official who sprays the stagnant water with chemicals that kill the mosquito larvae, speculates, ''It may be a selfish retaliation.''
 These festering, junk-filled dumps are also sun-drenched petri dishes for rodent-spread disease. Some abandoned houses become meth labs and indoor marijuana farms. Aerial shots of decaying properties suggest an unfolding real-life version of a horror film in which an upheaval of squirming maggots threatens to overrun a suburban paradise. 
 ''American Casino,'' directed by Leslie Cockburn, who wrote and produced the documentary with her husband, the liberal journalist Andrew Cockburn, begins on Wall Street, where various whistle-blower types describe the climate of greed and carelessness that produced the financial meltdown. The documentary dates the origins of the crisis to the insertion of a provision in the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act, introduced by Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican and former senator who was then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, exempting credit-default swaps from government regulation.
 Alan Greenspan, testifying before Congress last year, admits to discovering a ''flaw in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works.'' In other words, his naive belief that markets are self-regulating helped enable the crisis. 
 In the words of Michael Greenberger, a director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Clinton years, this laissez-faire philosophy allowed Wall Street to ''shoot itself in both feet.'' 
 We meet Frank L. Raiter, a senior executive in charge of rating mortgage bonds at Standard & Poor's who quit in disgust when ordered to guess the rating of billion-dollar subprime securities. Mr. Raiter recalls an internal e-mail message, in which a colleague crowed: ''We rate every deal. It could be structured by cows, and we would rate it.'' Another e-mail message voiced the hope that everyone is retired ''by the time this house of cards falters.'' 
 If the tone sounds familiar, you've heard versions of the same swaggering contempt and indifference to consequences expressed in internal e-mail messages in ''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.''
 A meticulously structured film, ''American Casino'' begins on Wall Street; moves to Main Street, focusing on a Baltimore neighborhood; then travels to Stockton, Calif.; and ends in Southern California. 
 The Baltimore section is the toughest and most detailed. Here, the film asserts, investment bankers and mortgage lenders deliberately sold risky subprime mortgages, which they knew could never be repaid, to residents in minority neighborhoods. Hard-working, civic-minded African-Americans who lost their homes -- including a high school teacher, a therapist and a preacher -- tell wrenching personal stories. 
 In some cases deceptive salesmanship contributed to the losses. Borrowers were misled by contracts whose fine print even professionals had difficulty deciphering. To make a sale, additional fees were never mentioned until closing. In one of the most troubling assertions, a former executive for a now bankrupt mortgage company insists that ''almost everyone in the industry'' falsified borrowers' incomes to meet the terms of loans. 
 ''Reverse redlining,'' the practice of singling out minority borrowers to seek loans on unfavorable terms is ''the civil rights issue of the 2000s,'' declares John Belman, a civil rights lawyer.
 ''American Casino'' does not leave you assured that the worst is over. The corrupted gambling den that Wall Street became in the last 15 years may be emptied of many of its players. But if financial stability is restored without strong regulation, operations are likely to resume as before. The lesson of this story: if enough money is involved, greed trumps morality.
 American Casino

CORRECTION-DATE: September 18, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A review on Sept. 2 of the documentary ''American Casino,'' about the country's financial meltdown, misstated the surname of a lawyer who was quoted in the film as saying that ''reverse redlining,'' the practice of singling out minority borrowers to seek loans on unfavorable terms, is ''the civil rights issue of the 2000s.'' He is John Relman, not Belman.

HEADLINE: The Race to Be an Early Adopter of Technologies Goes Mainstream, a Survey Finds

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
For decades, the adoption and use of the latest technologies was limited to a subculture: Whether called ''tech enthusiasts'' or ''gadget geeks,'' the implication was that most of the world got along fine with older, established products and services, while a smaller group pursued the most leading-edge technology.
 But according to a study released Wednesday by Forrester Research, a marketing firm based in Cambridge, Mass., a shift has taken place. What used to be the pursuit of a few has become decidedly mainstream. We're all gadget geeks now. 
 According to the study, which surveyed 53,668 households in the United States and Canada by mail, half of all American adults are gamers. Sixty-three percent of American households have a broadband Internet connection. Three-quarters of American households have cellphones and PCs. And nearly 10 million American households, out of nearly 118 million, added an HDTV in the last year, a jump of 27 percent over 2007.
 ''There's really no group out of the tech loop,'' said Jacqueline Anderson, an analyst with Forrester who was one of the study's authors. ''America is becoming a digital nation. Technology adoption continues to roll along, picking up more and more mainstream consumers every year.'' 
 High-definition television sets were one of the fastest-growing consumer technologies in 2008. Over the next five years, the company forecasts, nearly 39 million households in the United States will get their first high-definition set, bringing total market penetration for HDTV to nearly 70 percent.
 The study also found that despite the recession, online spending remained strong, with older consumers leading the charge. On average, those consumers spent $560 in the last three months, although ''20 percent of that group spent more than $1,000 online in the last three months,'' Ms. Anderson said. Given the tumultuous economic climate, ''that's a lot of money,'' she said.
 Ms. Anderson also pointed out that families were a big driver behind the widespread adoption of technologies. The popularity of video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii, which took a decidedly different approach from other game-console makers by appealing to nongamers and families, created an opening for more digital entertainment to enter the home. 
 Families are also more likely to have gadgetry like MP3 players, digital cameras and digital camcorders. ''They have little kids so they want to catalog those memories,'' Ms. Anderson said. In addition, 86 percent of families with children had mobile phones but were also more likely to use mobile phones with more features like music and video playback. 
 The study also suggests a growing reliance on the Internet for commerce, communication, entertainment and social lives, said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research, and a co-author on the study. 
 ''The digitization of our daily lives has been steadily ramping up over the past decade,'' Mr. Golvin said. 
 One area that appears to be slower to catch on is home networks. The survey found that 33 percent of households in the United States with an Internet connection reported having a home network, up from 28 percent a year ago. Although Ms. Anderson says that figure is relatively high, the adoption is still lower compared with the adoption of other home technologies. 
 ''The barrier to entry for a home network is a lot higher than for an HDTV, where all you have to do is buy one,'' she said. ''There are more components and you have to understand how to connect them. Many people had the components for a home network before but didn't necessarily understand what it meant to put them together or why they'd want to,'' she said. In the next five years, the company forecasts, more than 30 million households will install a home network, bringing market penetration to just over 50 percent. 
 Already, Mr. Golvin says, more people are migrating away from the home and office to use the Web and turning toward their smartphones. About 15 percent of cellphone owners were using the Internet on their phones in 2008, the study found, showing that, for a growing number of Americans, there is an increasing ''expectation that all the same services and resources are available to us no matter where we are,'' he said.

HEADLINE: More Blackouts Possible

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Reduced season-ticket sales for some N.F.L. teams could result in a greater than usual number of local television blackouts.
 ''It's all part of the challenges that we're seeing in the economy and what our clubs are going through,'' Roger Goodell told reporters Tuesday at the Washington Redskins' training camp in Ashburn, Va. ''Our clubs have been working hard in the off-season to create other ways to try to get people in the stadiums and to have policies that are a little more flexible, and hopefully, they're going to pay dividends for us.'' 
 He said that the Jacksonville Jaguars, whose season tickets have fallen to 25,000 this season from 42,000 last season, were one of the teams whose games could be blacked out if their home games are not sold out.
 San Diego had one of its preseason games blacked out locally for the first time since 2006.
 And the Cleveland Browns nearly had a preseason game blacked out last month.
 N.F.L. rules require that games be blacked out in local markets if they are not sold out 72 hours before kickoff.
 A USA Today survey found that the fans of a dozen teams might face some blackouts this season.
 Goodell said that ticket sales in August might have been hurt by the level of preseason play. 
 CBS and Fox said they did not expect the blackouts to significantly affect ratings or cause them to provide givebacks to advertisers.
 ''Very simply, it's about the overall ratings,'' Ed Goren, the president of Fox Sports, wrote in an e-mail message. ''A few blackouts may not have any real effect on our full-season ratings.''
 LeslieAnne Wade, a spokeswoman for CBS Sports, said, ''It won't be in every market, so we don't expect blackouts to affect the rating we're selling for national advertising.'' RICHARD SANDOMIR

HEADLINE: From Online Romance to a New Life in Sydney

BYLINE: By LEAH GREENGARTEN

 BODY:
SYDNEY, Australia
 Alexander Falber and Romy Samuel are enthusiastic about their three-bedroom apartment in Bellevue Hill, one of Sydney's most prestigious suburbs. 
 ''Where else in the world can you be equidistant to the beach and the city?'' Mr. Falber said. ''It's the best location for making the most of the city.'' 
 The couple came to Sydney in 2006. They met a couple of years before through Jdate.com, a Jewish online dating site. It was a romance that could only have been had through the Internet, because Mr. Falber was in Manhattan, studying for his doctorate in chemistry, while Ms. Samuel was in Melbourne, Australia. But, ''His profile said, 'Willing to relocate,' '' she noted with a cheeky grin. 
 After a quick courtship they married, spent a couple of years working in New York and then decided to move to Sydney, where Mr. Falber, 32, a native of Monroe, Conn., is using his chemistry degree and entrepreneurial spirit on solar energy projects. Ms. Samuel, also 32, imports luxury goods. 
 The couple used realestate.com.au to find their apartment, which is in a 1940s-era brick structure of Art Deco design, a favorite style in Australia during that period. The 12-unit building stands at the end of a long driveway, insulating it from the noise of nearby traffic, and on a hillside, so the couple's apartment has a broad view of Sydney Harbor even though it is on the first floor. 
 ''We bought the apartment without even seeing it,'' the couple said in unison. They were still in New York when they found the listing, so Ms. Samuel's cousin, a managing partner at a Sydney law firm, went to the auction on their behalf. (Most properties in Australia are sold at auction.) 
 ''I was on the phone listening to the auction while Paul was bidding -- it was very exciting,'' Ms. Samuel recalled. ''The next thing I knew, I heard a hammer go down, clapping and Paul shouted, 'Mazel-tov, you're now residents of Sydney!' '' 
 They paid 850,000 Australian dollars (about $666,670 at the time) for the 160-square-meter (1,722-square-foot) apartment. A real estate agent told Ms. Samuel recently that it was worth 1.2 million Australian dollars ($941,200); a similar apartment in the building recently sold for 1.15 million Australian dollars. 
 ''The property market in Sydney remains quite steady, with a lack of supply holding up prices,'' said Elliot Placks, a real estate agent at the Ray White Double Bay Group. ''Also, the Australian government's initiative with the first-home buyer's grant, which is between 14,000 dollars and 21,000 dollars, is fueling demand.'' (That works out to around $12,000 to $17,400.) 
 He also noted that interest rates in Australia are at 20-year lows. 
 But the global economic downturn has affected the top end of the market, Mr. Placks said, resulting in price declines of 20 to 30 percent. 
 The apartment's living room has a gas fireplace, framed in cherry wood, but the couple turns it on only about one month a year. The parquet floor has a herringbone pattern, while the walls, which are double brick and painted white, are decorated with a lot of memorabilia from their days in New York, including photographs of their first apartment's front door, Ms. Samuel looking through binoculars at the Top of the Rock Observation Deck at Rockefeller Center and the Brooklyn Bridge. 
 Just off the living room is the dining area, where there is a table that seats eight because Ms. Samuel likes preparing traditional Jewish meals.
 They plan to renovate the kitchen in the future, but for now, its fittings date from the original construction. But it does lead to the balcony and a barbeque for outdoor grilling. Also, the couple's year-old cat, named Lionel Richie, likes to use the outdoor space to stalk the geckos that bask there in the sun. 
 One of the apartment's three bedrooms has been converted into a study, with two glass desks facing each other for their laptops and some shelving for their books lining the walls. 
 The apartment has two bathrooms, a garage for their car and scooter and a separate storage area. 
 Mr. Falber and Ms. Samuel recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary. Both said they couldn't be happier living in Sydney. They have been bowled over by the clean ocean air, the clear skies and beautiful beaches, they said. 
 Ms. Samuel, who was raised in Melbourne, said, ''It feels like home, sounds like home, but has the challenge of living in an unfamiliar city.''

HEADLINE: U.N.'s Cost Estimate Jumps For Poor Nation Power Needs

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
It will cost between $500 billion and $600 billion every year for the next 10 years to allow developing nations to grow using renewable energy resources, instead of relying on dirty fuels that worsen global warming, according to a United Nations report released Tuesday. 
 That astronomical estimate, far higher than any previously suggested by the United Nations, comes at a time when developed and developing nations are still deeply divided over who bears the responsibility for shouldering the expense of deploying cleaner energy resources, much less what the actual amount might be. 
 The issue of who will foot the bill remains one of the significant hurdles to reaching a global agreement on combating climate change by December in Copenhagen. Much of the focus in the talks has also been on significant emissions cuts. 
 ''We need a public investment program to drive this shift into cleaner energy resources,'' said Rob Vos, the director of development policy in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which produced the report, comparing it to the Marshall Plan, through which the United States rebuilt European economies after World War II. ''The major obstacle is to convince political leaders and their constituencies to go in that direction.''
 Developing nations want a commitment from the developed world of financial support for reducing current and future emissions, but no concrete commitments have been forthcoming. At the summit meeting of African Union leaders this week in Tripoli, Libya, members agreed to ask the industrialized world for $67 billion annually, including compensation for the consequences of global warming it created, according to news reports. 
 The developed world, by contrast, wants a commitment to reduce emissions up front, suggesting that financial support will follow. The United States Senate is supposed to address the issue by the end of September, while the European Union expects to come up with a proposed financial package in October.
 Senior United Nations officials say they hope that a special summit meeting on climate change, with about 100 world leaders expected to attend on Sept. 22, the day before the United Nations General Assembly begins, will help break the impasse.
 Numbers bandied about previously were in the $100 billion range, with leaders like Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain suggesting a combination of government and private money. ''The initial cost and the initial investment to put emissions on a sustainable path are large; no one knows exactly what the cost is,'' said Mark Kenber, policy director at The Climate Group, a nonprofit organization focused on combating climate change. 
 But the new United Nations report suggests that adapting to the effects of global warming, lowering future emissions and growing economically all need to be addressed through a global fund covering at least some of the cost from 2010 to 2020. The figure starting at $500 billion is the cost of building the infrastructure needed in the developing world, including in giants like India and China, to meet their energy needs using renewable resources like wind and solar. 
 That sum represents roughly 1 percent of the annual global economic output, and it is smaller than the total amount committed under the various national economic stimulus packages, Mr. Vos noted. Only about $21 billion has been committed to combating climate change, he said. One way to generate the money might be through a ''global tax'' on carbon emissions of about $50 per ton, the report said, which would raise about $500 billion. 
 Experts said that a global tax might seem like an ideal solution on an academic level, but that it would be a nearly impossible sell in the real world. Still, the main strength of trying to get the world on the same page in terms of how to fight climate change is that it would reduce costs for everybody, Mr. Kenber said.

HEADLINE: Call to Jury Duty Is Striking A New Fear: Financial Ruin

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 

 BODY:
One by one, jurors answered Judge Robert A. Rosenberg when he asked whether serving a trial of four to five weeks would be a hardship. Chemelle Charles, a nurse, said it definitely would: ''I'm the only one working in my house right now.''
 Ms. Charles's husband, a lumberyard employee, was laid off in July, she said. On that recent morning, Judge Rosenberg dismissed Ms. Charles, along with more than half of the 80 potential jurors he interviewed, many of them for similar reasons. 
 Few people like jury duty. But for many people squeezed by the recession, a jury summons holds a new fear: financial ruin. 
 Judges and court officials around the country say they are seeing the impact of the recession in their courtrooms. While no one keeps overall statistics on juror excuses, those closest to the process say that in many parts of the country an increasing number of jurors are trying to get out of service, forcing courts to call an ever larger pool of jurors to meet their needs. 
 Ranae Johnson, the jury commissioner for Bonneville County, Idaho, said that she typically summoned 400 people for each two-week term of service, but that lately she ''had to pop it up to 500'' because of rising numbers of economic hardship claims. ''We're hearing it more than we used to,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''A lot more.''
 She read from her notes of recent calls. ''I was laid off, have no car, no job and no friends that can even bring me there,'' one caller had argued. Another said, ''I cannot even afford the gas to have to come down there.''
 Jane Hybarger, the jury administrator for the United States District Court in Las Vegas, said the pleas she was hearing were more urgent, even desperate. 
 ''Now I'm hearing people who are living day to day, who are months behind in their mortgage,'' Ms. Hybarger said. ''There's tears in their voice -- they don't know how they're going to put food on the table.''
 Judge Rosenberg, in Florida, said in an interview that when the ''pervasive cloud of financial insecurity'' reaches the jury room, ''a judge has to be sensitive to the economic times.'' He had also dismissed Michael Lazar, a self-employed ''steel detailer,'' or designer of steel structures. Mr. Lazar said ''it would kill me'' to miss opportunities to work; he might lose his home.
 Alan Abeles, who owns a company that makes promotional items like T-shirts, also told Judge Rosenberg he could not serve -- ''no, sir, not in this economy.'' The judge pressed Mr. Abeles about whether any of his employees could fill in. ''I fired everybody,'' he replied; just three employees remained, and none were capable of taking on his duties. He, too, was released.
 Other judges say they sense a shift as well. Judge Barbara M. G. Lynn of the Federal District Court in Dallas said that as she geared up recently for a trial that was to last several months, the pleas from jurors differed from those in a case of similar length she impaneled a few years ago. 
 ''I did have more people who had lost their jobs,'' Judge Lynn said, ''or were looking for a new job, or were relocating for a job.'' Many potential jurors told her that their employers would not pay for their jury time -- employers that she knew, from the previous long trial, had paid in the past.
 Unemployment -- or the fear of it -- is hardly a barrier to jury service, of course, and being without a job could even make it easier for some people to do their civic duty. Jury experts say that many people have an exaggerated sense of the hardship that service requires.
 ''Most people, when they're called for jury duty, assume if they are going to be on a trial, it's going to be a long trial,'' said Shari Seidman Diamond, a law professor at Northwestern University. In fact, Professor Diamond said, the typical trial takes just two or three days, and in many jurisdictions jurors are dismissed after one day if they are not placed on a jury.
 Longer cases prompt greater efforts to head for the exits, said Douglas L. Keene, a trial consultant in Austin, Tex. Those who are unemployed ''can't afford to not be out there looking for a job,'' Mr. Keene said. And despite laws that protect jurors from being fired for their service, he said, people whose companies have gone through rounds of layoffs worry about the impact on them of several days away from the office.
 Fretful or angry jurors are a concern for plaintiffs' lawyers in civil suits, Mr. Keene said, because the plaintiffs brought the suit and ''are more likely to be blamed by the jurors for any inconvenience that jury duty caused them.''
 Judge Rosenberg agreed. He could force more jurors into the box than he does, he said, but a miserable juror who is straining to get back to work might be too eager to reach a quick verdict instead of engaging in a full and careful deliberation. ''That's not the juror you want,'' he said. ''That's not justice.''
 There are actions that states could take to make jury service less painful financially, said Patricia Lee Refo, a lawyer in Phoenix, principally paying jurors more. Jury service, Ms. Refo said, is ''a critically important civic service,'' and ''we should pay them in accordance with the importance of their work.'' 
 That is not a likely path for financially squeezed states to take, and some areas are openly hoping that people without incomes will find jury pay attractive. Matt Benefiel, a court official in Orange County, Fla., which includes Orlando, said that while the area's unemployment rate was higher than the national average, the number of people claiming hardship to get out of service had not increased. 
 ''We might actually have jurors who are looking to get the money,'' Mr. Benefiel said, which amounts to $15 a day for the first three days and $30 thereafter. 
 Norman Goodman, the county clerk for Manhattan, agreed.
 ''If somebody's out of work, I guess jury service is a paying job,'' Mr. Goodman said, even if the daily check from the court is just $40. ''It's not going to get you into Tiffany's,'' he said, ''but it's something.''

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Grows After 18 Weak Months

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
After 18 months of layoffs, plant shutdowns and other declines, the country's manufacturing sector grew in August, offering another piece of evidence that the economy was pulling out of recession.
 The Institute for Supply Management's survey of factories and industry had been edging higher this spring, as the blistering pace of economic declines began to level off. But last month, the group's manufacturing index turned positive, rising to 52.9, from 48.9 in July.
 A reading above 50 indicates expansion and growth; a number below 50 means economic contraction. 
 President Obama called the numbers ''a sign that we're on the path to economic recovery.'' 
 Companies that make textiles, paper products, computers and electronics, appliances and chemicals were among 11 industry groups that said their business had grown in August. They said new orders were flowing in, production was ticking up and their prices were rising. ''It is a big deal,'' said John E. Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. ''It does suggest that manufacturing is recovering.''
 Bit by bit, the picture is improving for manufacturers like Allied PhotoChemical, a company in eastern Michigan that makes environmentally attuned ink, paint and coatings. Some 40 percent of its business disappeared last year as the economy swooned, but Allied's president, Mike Kelly, said the company had gone after new customers and resisted the reflex to slash its work force.
 Mr. Kelly said Allied was now running at about 65 percent capacity, compared with a low of 40 percent early this year.
 ''You could hear the crickets chirping,'' he said. ''Our suppliers were calling us, giving us automatic price reductions. They were panicking. Now they're happy. They're even beginning to have some product shortages.''
 Many factories slashed their output and idled assembly lines over the last year as demand for their products dried up and the turmoil of the housing market spilled into the broader economy. But now, after cutting their inventories to the quick, some businesses are starting to rebuild their stocks.
 The Ford Motor Company has said that it would increase production by 10,000 vehicles to meet the higher demand generated by the government's cash-for-clunkers program. 
 ''We're at a very early stage of the upturn, and I think it's going to gradually build steam,'' said David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.
 Still, most industries were not hiring, an indication that the labor market remained weak. The manufacturing employment index contracted again in August, although at a slower pace than in past months. Four industry groups said their payrolls were growing while nine reported decreases.
 Manufacturing jobs have been devastated by the recession, with some two million positions lost since the downturn's official beginning in December 2007. 
 In all, economists believe the economy lost 225,000 jobs last month, and they are expecting the unemployment rate to rise to 9.5 percent when the government releases its monthly snapshot of the labor market on Friday.
 While many economists expect the economy to grow during the summer quarter as businesses stir back to life, they are worried that sluggish consumer spending will weigh down the economy in the year ahead. Consumer spending fell at a rate of 1 percent in the second quarter of the year, even as tax credits from the stimulus began filtering through the economy.
 ''What's the sustainability going forward?'' Mr. Silvia of Wells Fargo said. ''So much of that depends on the consumer.''
 Also on Tuesday, a report on home sales that are under contract showed that buyers were flocking back to the housing market. 
 The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales surged on a seasonally adjusted basis to its highest levels since 2001, when the group began tracking the numbers. It was the sixth consecutive month of increases.
 ''The recovery is broad-based across many parts of the country. Housing affordability has been at record highs this year with the added stimulus of a first-time buyer tax credit,'' Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist, said in a statement.
 The government's tax credit of up to $8,000 has been helping to entice first-time homebuyers into the market, and mortgage rates are about 5.25 percent nationwide, compared with more than 6 percent last year.
 Still, even if buyers are buying again, few builders are building.
 In another report, the Commerce Department said that construction spending fell 0.2 percent in July from a month earlier, and was 10.5 percent lower than it had been in July 2008. Although residential construction spending edged up for the month of July, it was down nearly 27 percent from a year earlier, a sign of the problems still facing builders as they compete with floods of foreclosed homes. 
 Spending on office buildings, commercial projects and hotels all fell from June.

HEADLINE: Ambitions and Prices to Suit the Moment

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
EDGING warily toward the anniversary of the great economic implosion, New York is still hungry and still dining out. 
 The slump was not the end of days. Restaurateurs and customers alike are navigating a post-traumatic landscape that -- though littered with broken dreams and empty rooms -- is abundant with unexpected opportunities, entrepreneurial surprises and not a few thriving kitchens.
Across the boroughs, eager yet economically humbled diners are meeting equally chastened restaurant operators -- and everyone is ordering from the city's rebalanced carte du jour. 
 The new rule is simple: ''Customers want excellence and indulgence at a really low price,'' said Ed Brown, a 46-year-old chef, who instead of sulking in the $2 million dining room of his high-end restaurant Eighty One, on West 81st Street, aggressively reinvented everything from its menus to its cost structure. Average check costs are now $29 lower there. He recently unveiled a grill room offering salads, chicken wings and a $9 chuck-and-brisket hamburger. And moving it forward, he and Jeffrey Chodorow will open Ed's Chowder House this month, evoking the Jersey Shore in what had been Mr. Chodorow's more expensive steakhouse, Center Cut. 
 Yet the storm has not passed, as was clear with the recent closings of Cafe des Artistes, the John Dory and Elettaria. Yet there will still be an impressive number of premieres, even if fall-opening ambitions are undeniably lower than they were last year, judging by a surfeit of spinoffs, re-dos and in-the-pipeline rev-ups. 
 Some openings -- like that of the $7 million SD26, the lower-key successor to the restaurateur Tony May's austere San Domenico -- are downright buzzy. Can a season really be such a drag if Danny Meyer (Maialino in the Gramercy Park Hotel) and Jean-Georges Vongerichten (in the Mark Hotel) are branching out again? 
 And while the chic Town shut down, the blazing chef David Chang will be planting his Momofuku flag in its Chambers Hotel space, with a Southeast Asian newbie.
 Lively neighborhoods get livelier: Williamsburg will see Saltie's sandwich shop, from Caroline Fidanza of Diner and Marlow & Sons, St. Anselm from the folks who own the bar Spuyten Duyvil, and the long-awaited Fatty 'Cue from Zakary Pelaccio of Fatty Crab. 
 And recession successes doggedly extend their brands: the multiple-Baoguette mini-empire of the chef Michael Huynh will expand to Obao Noodles and Grill on East 53rd Street and B Clinton on Clinton Street. Keith McNally, the 58-year-old proprietor of Balthazar, Pastis and Minetta Tavern, is focusing on Pulino's Bar and Pizzeria, which he expects to open at the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery in December. But he said he'd been planning for the restaurant for four or five years and casual, cheaper dining trends had nothing to do with his choice of style.
 ''The fact that it's the hot thing right now,'' he said of the pizzas he'd be serving, ''would really put me right off it.''
 Beyond the cut-and-thrust of the restaurant fray, there is evidence to suggest a triumph of survival in New York. The city's leisure and hospitality workers have fared much better in the city's economic mix than financial and professional-service workers, said Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York. Although the city's food and drinking places shed more than 10,000 out of some 200,000 workers after the jolt to the economy last fall, employment was back to 200,000 by May -- and up 4,000 more by July. ''If higher-end restaurants may be suffering, the lower-end restaurants may be seeing an increase in demand -- and employment,'' Dr. Dolfman said.
 Visitors from abroad, who have done their bit in the past for the city's restaurants, are still coming, according to one of the best barometers of foreign tourism, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which this year has welcomed 10 percent more visitors from abroad than in the comparable months of 2008, according to Harold Holzer, a senior vice president. 
 And recession or not, entrepreneurs just can't stop themselves. 
 ''This is a great time to look for growth,'' said Burak Karacam, the owner of Pera Mediterranean Brasserie, a 150-seat Turkish restaurant at 303 Madison Avenue in Manhattan, ''because landlords are offering more creative deal structures.'' Mr. Karacam, a former Harvard-trained investment banker, is negotiating for two new locations to establish more casual Pera extensions.
 Although rent increases have driven some restaurants out of business, some lease-hunters are stunned to find affordable spaces. 
 ''Landlords are a little chastened,'' said Stuart Morden, a senior managing director at the brokerage Newmark Retail LLC. They realize, he said, that ''to wait for the economy to turn around is folly.'' Mr. Morden said that many landlords are now offering rent abatements. The landlord of Eighty One, the Excelsior Hotel, is one of them, Mr. Brown said. 
 And restaurateurs are showing that they are willing to move on to find deals, or customers. ''Rents can be affordable citywide,'' Mr. Morden said, ''so no neighborhood can be ruled out, as far as good restaurants are concerned.''
 Ergo: the Bowery footprint is extended as Travertine locates at Kenmare Street and the Bowery. Or consider the odyssey of the neo-Philippine restaurant Cendrillon.
 After its 10-year-lease in SoHo ran out, the landlord wanted to triple the rent, said Amy Besa, 59, an owner. ''But a lot of our Manhattan customers had moved to Brooklyn,'' she said. 
 And so she and her husband, the chef Romy Dorotan, will open the new Purple Yam in a few weeks at 1314 Cortelyou Road in vibrant Ditmas Park, near their home. They are busily testing pan-Asian extensions to their menu. Their new lease -- $5,000 including rent, real estate taxes, and water and sewer fees -- is about a third of what they were paying in SoHo. 
 ''On nights and weekends, SoHo could be a ghost town,'' Ms. Besa said, ''but now we're in a real neighborhood again.'' 
 In the new crisis-versus-opportunity showdown, one operator's nightmare can be another restaurateur's future. When Al Bustan Restaurant, a 20-year-old Lebanese stalwart on Third Avenue in Manhattan, faced a $10,000 rent increase, its owner quickly found a space three blocks away at 319 East 53rd Street. 
 ''It was going to be a steakhouse, and they spent a lot of money on it,'' said Elias Ghafary, the owner of Al Bustan. ''It was ready to open. But a steakhouse wasn't suitable for us, so we're renovating and will open after Labor Day.'' 
 Often, in this wickedly fickle downturn, even high-end reservations have been no problem. Although there are always exceptions. (Lots of luck landing a great slot at Corton.) 
 And while Ken Friedman and his partner, the chef April Bloomfield, just shut the John Dory, their well-regarded seafood restaurant near the meatpacking district, they are now hoisting their standard at the Breslin Bar and Dining Room in the Ace Hotel on West 29th Street. 
 But the agita of the finance-challenged remains.
 ''The banks have pulled in their lines of credit and are giving zero money to restaurants,'' said Faye Fisher, a vice president at Advance Restaurant Finance, one of the few companies in New York making restaurant loans. ''Even when this recession is all over, banks won't turn around and give money -- for years.''
 So now, ''the money is out there, but it is all based on relationships -- people you've known for years,'' said Tracy Nieporent, director of marketing and a partner in the Myriad Restaurant Group, which runs Nobu and Corton. 
 Yet even if future New York restaurants have more plebeian build-outs, restaurateurs, like theater folk, are likely to keep angling for the next runaway hit. 
 ''This,'' Mr. Nieporent said, ''is the business we've chosen, as they say in 'The Godfather.' ''

HEADLINE: Comptroller Assails Officials on Cost of Bronx Water Plant

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
William C. Thompson Jr., the New York City comptroller and mayoral candidate, said on Tuesday that officials in the city's Department of Environmental Protection ''misled the public'' about a Bronx water filtration plant that is expected to cost more than double the initial estimate. 
 At a news conference, Mr. Thompson released two audits by his office that he said revealed flaws in the agency's estimates for the project, from calculation errors to figures based on incomplete designs. He stopped short of accusing the agency of deliberately distorting the costs but said that officials had done ''an incredibly poor job'' with their calculations.
 In 2003, the Department of Environmental Protection, which is overseeing the project, the Croton Water Filtration Plant, estimated its cost at $992 million. Construction began the following year. By 2007, city budget officials had determined the plant would cost $2.8 billion. 
 Mr. Thompson said the city also faced nearly $15 million in penalties for missing construction deadlines set in a 1998 consent decree with the state and federal governments in which the city, after receiving a previous extension, agreed to complete the plant by October 2011. It is now expected to be finished in spring 2012.
 ''What we discovered is an embarrassment,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''All this involves your money, taxpayers' money.''
 The plant, being built below ground in Van Cortlandt Park, will filter water from the Croton watershed in Westchester County, which serves parts of the Bronx and Manhattan. In 1997, the federal Environmental Protection Agency said the watershed did not meet its standards for purity; it initiated legal action to force the city to build the plant.
 Steven W. Lawitts, the acting commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said that the initial estimates had been based on ''a conceptual design'' and that the cost escalated mostly because of high inflation during the boom years in the construction business. 
 ''The comptroller is fixating on something that was used for planning purposes and to compare alternative sites,'' he said.
 Mr. Lawitts said the delays and overruns would have only a ''marginal'' impact on water rates. He attributed the delays to ''issues'' with the low bidder of the main construction contract, who eventually withdrew.
 But Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz of the Bronx, who long opposed building the plant underground in the Bronx and favored a site aboveground on land the city owns in Westchester, said inflation could not account for the gap between the estimates and the actual cost. He called it a result of ''incompetence plus lies.''
 ''This project is the biggest boondoggle in the history of New York City, and we have plenty of boondoggles in New York City,'' he said. ''They just aren't up to the job of running a project like this, and the comptroller's audits demonstrate that.''

HEADLINE: In Asia, Financial Sector Jobs Lead Rebound in Employment

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Marco Wong lost his job with Citigroup in Singapore in mid-January. During all the turmoil that engulfed the financial world last year, the cutbacks at the banking giant were neither unique nor surprising.
 Still, Mr. Wong says, Citigroup's decision not to renew his contract shortly before it was due to end ''came as quite a shock.''
 But 20 job applications, four interviews and three-and-a-half months later, Mr. Wong was gainfully employed again, this time as a financial consultant at IPP Financial Advisers in Hong Kong. 
 Asia has already emerged more forcefully from the recession than the United States and Europe, economic reports in the last month have shown. 
 Broad unemployment is still rising, a normal pattern even after economies begin to emerge from recessions. But economists say that any early signs of job growth are a prerequisite for a more solid recovery -- one in which more confident consumers, and not just huge government stimulus packages, can play a role in lifting the economy.
 Perhaps the most striking element in the new hiring is that almost a year after Lehman Brothers collapsed, it is the financial sector that is leading the way.
 ''The death of the industry has been greatly exaggerated,'' said Matthew Hoyle, founder of Matthew Hoyle Financial Markets, a specialist recruiter for the banking and hedge fund industries, based in Hong Kong. ''I am actually quite excited about the prospects for the rest of the year.''
 Jerry Gunnell, a corporate cash management specialist in Singapore, fell victim to Bank of America's headcount reductions in February. He is now back in the saddle at Standard Chartered, a British bank that does much of its business in Asia, in a somewhat different but equally senior position he took in mid-June, also in Singapore.
 In the last month, several banks have announced plans for hiring in Asia.
 Standard Chartered intends to hire about 850 relationship managers for its consumer banking business in the next 18 months, to gain a larger market share of affluent customers in Asia.
 HSBC, also active in Asia, is recruiting more than 100 staff members in Hong Kong. In mainland China, it plans to add 1,000 employees this year, and a similar number next year.
 Bank of New York Mellon recently announced it would increase its 150-person Hong Kong staff by an additional 50 as part of its expansion in Asia.
 And ANZ of Australia, which recently bought some Asian operations from Royal Bank of Scotland, the battered British lender, is hiring 100 senior private bankers in the region in the next 18 months.
 Several others, including Citigroup, Nomura, Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas, have announced new hires and appointments in recent weeks.
 Tales like these highlight the newfound dynamism that is starting to creep back into the Asian job market. While unemployment continues to rise in much of Europe and is expected to top 10 percent in the United States before any improvement materializes, rates in Asia have remained relatively low: 5.4 percent in Hong Kong and 3.3 percent in Singapore.
 One relatively weak spot is Japan. The jobless rate hit a seasonally adjusted 5.7 percent in July, the highest level since the end of World War II and up from 5.4 percent in June.
 But elsewhere, recruitment firms are busy again.
 Andrea Williams, managing director of Ambition, a recruiter in Hong Kong, said that things started to turn noticeably since April.
 ''During the second quarter of this year, we got in 20 percent more jobs than during the first three months of the year,'' Ms. Williams said. ''Yes, we're still below where we were a year earlier, but it's definitely encouraging.''
 Of course, for the legions of those who lost their jobs and still remain unemployed, or who are still being laid off as some companies continue to struggle, it is too early to celebrate.
 ''It's not an across-the-board improvement -- it's pretty patchy in terms of sectors and in terms of geographies -- but things are at least holding steady or even getting better in some parts,'' said Darryl Green, who heads Asia Pacific and Middle East operations for Manpower, a temporary employment and recruiting company.
 ''On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say we were negative during the first half of the year,'' he said. ''Now, we're at 0.5 or 1 -- not huge, but better, and definitely stronger than in the Americas and Europe.''
 Nearly all of the jobs that are coming back are ''replacements'' of previously cut positions, not new jobs, market experts here say. And employers are still being cautious and choosy when it comes to hiring.
 Outside the financial sector, there is anecdotal evidence of hiring in other areas, though it is patchy.
 Demand for sales jobs, for example, has picked up across all sectors as companies focus their still scarce resources on jobs they hope will help generate immediate revenue.
 ''Asia is seen as a growth market,'' said Mark Ellwood of the Robert Walters recruitment agency, in Singapore. ''Companies are not going out all guns blazing again, but there is once again an appetite to hire in certain areas.''
 In Hong Kong, Eike Croucher, a communications manager, was laid off from Swiss Re after the reinsurance company announced in April that it would shed 10 percent of its global work force of 11,500 people. Mrs. Croucher had a job offer from the German chemicals giant BASF on the evening of her last day at Swiss Re, because of some fast networking.
 ''I was very, very lucky, of course, that things happened so quickly,'' she said.
 It is still very much an employers' market. Generous ''expat packages'' -- in which overseas employees have much of their housing and their children's schooling paid for -- are for many a thing of the past.
 The most successful candidates have experience in Asia, a network of contacts and language skills.
 ''Employers are still being extra, extra selective in their talent search,'' said Mark Carriban, the Asia managing director based in Hong Kong for Hudson, a recruiting agency. ''And what is very prized out here is local market knowledge.''
 In fact, many recruiters are already starting to warn that a ''talent crunch'' could be only months away.
 One piece of advice for job seekers, though easier said than done: ''Learn Mandarin,'' Mr. Carriban said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Agency Finds Evidence of Drug Cartels Forming in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Though the Afghan opium harvest has declined for the second consecutive year, a new United Nations report says, there is growing evidence that some Afghan insurgent forces are becoming ''narco-cartels'' -- similar to anti-government guerrilla groups in Colombia -- that view drug profits as more important than ideology.
 Afghanistan's multibillion-dollar illicit narcotics industry finances much of the country's insurgency, and the influence of drug money is a major reason the Afghan government is considered among the most corrupt in the world. 
 Afghanistan's production of opium, the raw material for heroin, declined by 10 percent this year, and the amount of land used to cultivate opium fell by 22 percent, according to a report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime that is to be formally released Wednesday.
 The smaller harvest, largely attributed to market forces and heightened interdiction efforts, is a rare bit of good news for the United States and the coalition of Western governments whose troops and taxpayers are supporting what even American commanders describe as a deteriorating situation as the war approaches its ninth year.
 But while United Nations officials suggested that some opium-trafficking guerrillas were now less focused on Taliban ideology, they also reported that perhaps more than 10,000 tons of illegal opium -- worth billions of dollars and enough to satisfy at least two years of world demand -- is now secretly stockpiled. They said they were concerned that part of this stockpile could be a ''ticking bomb'' in the hands of people who could use it to pay for ''sinister scenarios.''
 Opium is easily smuggled and stored and ''is an ideal form of terrorist financing,'' Antonio Maria Costa, the executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said in an interview. ''It's a huge amount of money to have in the wrong hands.'' He called on intelligence agencies to investigate the stockpiles.
 American officials are also concerned that large stockpiles could bolster guerrilla war chests, despite recent military operations to curb the flow of drug money to the Taliban and other insurgent groups, a senior United States official said. The official, who did not wish to speak on the record, said that the stockpiles were believed to be in Afghanistan and that they were probably under the control of gangs that were principally involved in narcotics trafficking rather than directly controlled by ''terror groups.''
 But assuming the opium can be smuggled out of the country, the official added, ''the real issue is that regardless of what impact we have in the near term on production, distribution and other aspects of the narco network, this level of stockpiles means that funding resources will remain fairly even.''
 American troops and Afghan officials in some southern regions where opium proliferates say that the insurgency there appears to be increasingly influenced by financial loyalties rather than ideological or jihadist allegiances, as guerrillas move from taxing and extracting protection money from traffickers to smuggling and refining opium themselves. Estimates of the insurgency's annual revenue from drugs across Afghanistan vary widely, from $70 million to $500 million, according to a recent Congressional report.
 ''A marriage of convenience between insurgents and criminal groups is spawning narco-cartels in Afghanistan linked to the Taliban,'' Mr. Costa said. 
 As in some nations, including Colombia and Myanmar, the agency said in a statement, ''the drug trade in Afghanistan has gone from being a funding source for insurgency to becoming an end in itself.'' 
 Afghanistan in recent years has produced 90 percent of the world's opium.
 United Nations officials said this year's decline stemmed largely from a steep drop in the value of opium amid a huge supply glut; high prices last year for some other crops that caused farmers to switch; and more aggressive counternarcotics actions by Western and Afghan forces.
 They said it was not clear whether the decline would continue, especially if the difference between prices for opium and other crops were to widen to previous levels. Just two years ago, for example, an acre of opium fetched 10 times as much as an acre of wheat, but that ratio has diminished to three to one. 
 ''A market correction is going on while law enforcement has increased the pressure,'' Mr. Costa said. ''Now, military and economic forces are playing in the same direction.''
 Actual production of opium declined to 6,900 metric tons this year from 7,700 metric tons last year.
 The most striking decline was in Helmand Province, the dominant producer, where cultivation fell by one-third. In addition to market forces and more robust counternarcotics efforts, the United Nations cited efforts by Helmand's governor, Gulab Mangal, and an American- and British-backed anti-poppy program in the province.
 Mr. Costa said efforts by the United States and other NATO forces to take a more direct role were becoming a powerful deterrent. But he also appeared to be critical of the recently disclosed decision by the Pentagon to place 50 Afghan traffickers on a target list to be captured or killed. American officials have said the 50 are also tied to the Taliban.
 ''Drug lords should be brought to justice,'' he said in a statement. ''Not executed in violation of international law or pardoned for political expediency.''

HEADLINE: In Commercial Sector, Hard Times Have Just Begun

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
As the commercial real estate market heated up earlier in the decade and lenders competed feverishly to issue ever-riskier mortgages, hundreds of bankers, investors, lawyers, brokers, appraisers, accountants and analysts flocked to an investors' conference in Florida each January to celebrate their good fortune with lavish beach parties featuring bikini-clad models and popular entertainers.
 But in what a Prudential Real Estate Investors report described as ''a move of near-perfect symbolism,'' the conference sponsor, the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association, recently announced that next year's event would be relocated from South Beach to Washington, where the industry has been lobbying strenuously for federal assistance. 
 These days, the people who buy and sell office buildings, shopping centers, warehouses, apartment buildings and hotels are hardly in a festive mood, despite some recent encouraging signs relating to the job and housing markets and a recent increase in sales of small office buildings. 
 Even though industry lobbyists were able to persuade Congress to extend a loan program aimed at prodding the stalled securitization market back to life, several analysts said it was unlikely to head off a spate of defaults, foreclosures and bankruptcies that could surpass the devastating real estate crash of the early 1990s. ''It will prop up a few deals, but you can't stop the wave that's coming,'' said Peter Hauspurg, the chief executive of Eastern Consolidated, a New York brokerage firm. 
 The distress is still in its early stages, analysts said. ''We are between the first and second inning,'' said Richard Parkus, who directs research on commercial mortgage-backed securities for Deutsche Bank. ''We're going to have to get through a very difficult period.''
 Mr. Parkus said that vacancy declines and rent increases already mirrored what happened in the 1990s, and until new jobs were created, generating an increase in demand for commercial space and more retail spending, this was not likely to be reversed.
 Building values have declined by as much as 50 percent around the country, and even more in Manhattan, where prices soared the highest. As many as 65 percent of commercial mortgages maturing over the next few years are unlikely to qualify for refinancing because of the drop in values and new stricter underwriting standards, he said. 
 Fitch Ratings recently reported that $36.1 billion in securitized loans -- mortgages pooled, sliced into different categories of risk and sold to investors -- have been transferred so far this year to a ''special servicer,'' an agency that handles troubled loans. Such a transfer is prompted by a bankruptcy, a 60-day delinquency or the prospect of an imminent default. In all, some 3,100 loans representing $49.1 billion, or 6.1 percent of the total, are currently in special servicing, an amount that could grow to nearly $100 billion by the end of the year, Fitch said.
 But the damage is expected to be even greater for banks, which are holding $1.3 trillion in commercial mortgages (including apartment buildings) and $535.8 billion in construction and development loans, said Sam Chandan, the president of Real Estate Economics, a New York research company. About $393 million worth of mortgages are scheduled to mature by the end of next year alone, and an estimated $39 million more were due to expire this year but have been extended, he said.
 By midyear, Real Capital Analytics, a New York research company, had identified $124 billion worth of distressed property. Less than 10 percent of the distress had been resolved through loan modifications or sales.
 The downturn in commercial real estate is already having repercussions for local governments. New York City's general fund, to cite an example, collected $2.1 billion from transfer and mortgage recording taxes at the peak of the market in the 2007 fiscal year, according to Frank Braconi, chief economist for the comptroller's office. This fiscal year, it is expected to receive only $767 million, he said. 
 In New York, with its concentration of tall office towers, commercial mortgage-backed securities play a bigger role than they do elsewhere. The brokerage firm CB Richard Ellis estimates that about half the transactions in recent years involved securitized financing.
 The mechanism set up to manage problems with the underlying mortgages is being put to the test for the first time. Some longtime real estate investors who profited from the ready access to mortgages made possible by securitization now complain that the system is impersonal and rigid. Instead of negotiating directly with a lender sitting across a table, Norman Sturner, a partner at Murray Hill Properties, a New York real estate company, said he had been forced to deal by telephone with ''a third party sitting out in the Midwest'' who seemed indifferent to his problems.
 Since the master servicer, which handles the routine servicing of the loan, has no authority to restructure it, the landlord has no way to tackle anticipated problems before it comes into the hands of a special servicer and is already in trouble. ''What's going to happen when billions of dollars can't be repaid?'' said Mr. Sturner, who owns and operates five million square feet of office and apartment buildings.
 Mr. Sturner, a 39-year industry veteran who bought aggressively during the real estate boom, would not comment on any specific loans. But a Manhattan real estate executive, who declined to be identified commenting on another's business dealings, said that Mr. Sturner recently stopped paying his mortgage on One Park Avenue, a 20-story Art Deco building between 32nd and 33rd Streets, which he bought for $550 million in 2007, so that he could have the loan transferred to a special servicer. 
 Last year, one tenant, the Segal Company, a company specializing in employee benefits, said it would move at the end of this year to West 34th Street, leaving three floors at One Park Avenue vacant when new tenants are hard to come by and rents have fallen significantly. Fitch downgraded the securities backed by this loan in August.
 The rising incidence of delinquencies and defaults has cast a spotlight on the special servicers, who are chosen by the investors who hold the riskiest bonds, and, in most cases, are part of the same firm. Six companies control 85 percent of the business, according to Fitch. 
 One source of conflict is that pension funds, endowments and other institutional investors with the most protected securities are often eager to liquidate their positions as quickly as possible, and those with the riskier portions resist taking an immediate loss.
 Patrick C. Sargent, the president of the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association, said that despite an apparent conflict of interest, the servicers are accountable to all classes of bondholders and are required to maximize the proceeds for the investment as a whole. Falling short can lead to a lawsuit or a ratings downgrade. ''They are in a fishbowl,'' he said. ''They are going to be watched.''
 Critics say the special servicers are overwhelmed by the current workload. ''The people we are dealing with are swamped beyond any measure,'' said Paul M. Fried, a managing director of Traxi, a New York consulting company, who is advising borrowers with securitized loans.
 But one executive at a special servicer whose employer would not allow his or his company's name to be used said that his firm had tripled its staff in the last two years, and that other companies were also hiring asset managers. 
 Despite the criticism, Stephanie Petosa, a managing director at Fitch, which rates special servicers, said they were equipped to handle the workload. ''I think they are moving at a reasonable pace, given the current environment,'' she said.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 3, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about distress in the commercial real estate sector incorrectly paraphrased a comment by Richard Parkus, a research analyst for Deutsche Bank, about recent market trends. He said that office vacancies are increasing and rents are decreasing, not the other way around. The article also misstated the dollar total of commercial mortgages that are due to expire by the end of next year and the total that had been due to expire this year but were extended. The amounts are $393 billion (not million) and $39 billion (not million), respectively. And the article referred incorrectly to Murray Hill Properties' mortgage payments on the building it owns at One Park Avenue. The mortgage is current; the company has not missed a payment.

HEADLINE: Looking to Save Health Care Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Majority Rule on Health Care Reform'' (editorial, Aug. 30):
 You are certainly correct that ''it has become inescapably clear that Republicans are unlikely to vote for substantial reform this year,'' and you are also correct to warn against further delays and compromises with a party determined to use the health care debate as a partisan tool to destroy the Obama presidency, as Senator Jim DeMint was foolish enough to admit publicly.
 But the reconciliation process may not be the best solution because of the procedural hurdles that the opponents of reform can be counted on to raise. A better solution would be for President Obama to try to get the necessary votes for cloture. 
 The president must exert strong leadership and make it clear to the Democratic caucus in general and the Blue Dog Democrats in particular that for the sake of their party, the country and the future of the Obama administration, they must vote for cloture so that a bill that will accomplish substantive reform can have an up-or-down vote on the floor. 
 If the Blue Dog Democrats then feel that they must vote against the final bill so that their campaign contributors in the health care industry will not be angry at them, then that is their choice. This plan would enable President Obama to present the country with a real and coherent reform that could be enacted with 51 votes and to avoid a reconciliation process fraught with difficulties and imponderables.
 But it depends on the Democrats' realizing what a catastrophe it would be for the country and for their party if there were no reform or a reform in name only that did not accomplish its purpose.
 Michael Ossar Portland, Ore., Aug. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial favors using reconciliation bills to pass comprehensive health care reform through the Senate, arguing that ''the ideological split between parties is too wide'' to achieve a compromise. But in your December 2005 editorial ''Protecting Public Lands,'' budget reconciliation bills are called ''a handy hiding place for ideas that could never stand up to public scrutiny on their own.''
 If it is wrong to legislate through this backdoor channel on a relatively minor issue like whether the holders of mining claims should be allowed to buy public land rather than leasing it, isn't it even worse to enact legislation affecting the health of millions of people through this same method?
 Furthermore, how can one square this view with your March 2005 editorial ''Walking in the Opposition's Shoes,'' which calls the filibuster a ''peculiar but effective form of government''?
 Galen Simmons New York, Aug. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 In your clarion call for imposition of the reconciliation process when the Senate considers a Democratic bill for transformative health care reform, a process that would supersede the usual voting procedure, you do not mention polls indicating great concern within the body politic with the legislation you so heartily advocate.
 There is no small quotient of hubris attached to altering Senate procedure to force transformative change on 16 percent of the gross domestic product, all in the face of substantial opposition. Unseemly tactics will hardly persuade the doubtful majority of Americans that they have been well served.
 Paul Bloustein Cincinnati, Aug. 30, 2009
 The writer is a physician.
 To the Editor:
 America should hope that all Democratic senators read and heed your editorial suggesting how their party can enact President Obama's signature health care reform. Clearly, most aspects of it fit within the rubric of ''budget reconciliation.''
 Nearly every domestic issue facing the nation is affected by health care costs -- whether it is the fiscal well-being of struggling icons like General Motors; the competitive position of producers of goods and services that have to vie for orders with producers in countries whose governments relieve them of employee health care costs; the individual health insurance costs that are sucked from other consumer spending; or the uncontrollable cost of health care driven by transfer of unpaid medical care of the uninsured to the bills of the insured.
 The editorial sagaciously warns that this is the moment. America must hope -- yes, demand -- that pursuit of campaign contributions does not steal this historic opportunity.
 Sharon Morrison Whitefish, Mont., Aug. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Until Medical Bills Do Us Part,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Aug. 30):
 Thirty years ago, as my father wasted away from the ravages of Parkinson's disease, my mother faced the same dilemma -- divorce or bankruptcy.
 The fact that nothing has changed in three decades does not augur well for health care reform and speaks volumes about our nation's misguided values and priorities.
 Carole S. Tunick Scarsdale, N.Y., Aug. 30, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The column cites a very real problem, but unwittingly makes the case for less government intrusion, not more. 
 It is government-run Medicaid that forces people to deplete their savings in order to qualify for aid. Why would we want government in control of health care when bureaucrats routinely establish and carry out arbitrary rules that deny help to anyone who has accumulated any assets during a lifetime?
 Joseph Melody Los Angeles, Sept. 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof's column on the use of divorce by the elderly to avoid financial impoverishment because of long-term custodial illness unfortunately perpetuates a harmful myth.
 In New York State, the healthy spouse may retain $109,560 in savings while the ill spouse qualifies for Medicaid. Under ''spousal refusal,'' assets of an even greater amount can be legally protected.
 The best advice is for the couple to seek the services of a lawyer who devotes his or her career to these issues: an elder law attorney.
 Daniel G. Fish New York, Aug. 31, 2009
 The writer is a past president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.

HEADLINE: Changing Health Care By Steps

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 After Harry Truman repeatedly failed to persuade Congress to pass universal health insurance, some Truman administration officials came up with a less ambitious idea. They suggested covering only 8 percent of the population, and an especially sympathetic 8 percent at that: everybody 65 and older. 
 Truman never really pushed the plan, however. John F. Kennedy later did, yet was stymied by Congress and the American Medical Association, which equated it with Soviet-like socialism. So it fell to Lyndon Johnson. Even after he won a 23-point landslide in 1964, he had to agree to some unseemly deal-making, as Jonathan Cohn of The New Republic has noted, that handed a big payday to hospitals and doctors. 
 Only then, in the summer of 1965, was Medicare born.
 Next week, Congress will return to session, and health care, of course, will be at the top of its agenda. Passing a bill, it's clear, will be no easier than in previous decades. President Obama's poll numbers have fallen, while untruths about death panels have made the rounds and members of Congress have been subjected to town hall harangues. 
 But the job facing Mr. Obama hasn't really changed: he will have to figure out how to end up more like Johnson than like Truman or, more recently, Bill Clinton. He and Congress will have to figure out how to make some progress toward fixing the country's troubled health care system. 
 Any bill they pass will inevitably be flawed. It will not do enough to reduce wasteful spending. It probably will not result in universal coverage. Special interests -- like drug companies and, once again, hospitals -- will get off too lightly. 
 But such is politics. Starting from scratch with a more purely liberal bill or a more conservative one, as some have urged, won't change the messy reality of democracy. ''You're not going to fix health care on one bill,'' Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said. ''Even if my most liberal colleagues had their perfect bill, it's not going to fix health care. A bill is going to have to be altered and amended later.''
 Indeed, from an economic standpoint, the biggest risk seems to be that health care will be left unchanged and that we'll simply pretend we are as healthy, wealthy and wise as can be.
 We're not. The United States is the only rich country in the world without something resembling universal health insurance. Medical costs already take a big whack out of workers' paychecks, and Medicare's budget is growing at an unsustainable rate. Despite all this spending, we too often receive inadequate care.
 Emergency room care and certain cancer treatments are among the best in the world. But management of chronic diseases isn't nearly as good. Senior citizens and children are less likely to receive vaccinations here than in some other wealthy countries, a recent analysis found. Americans face higher risks of being killed by a medical error or harmed by a medication error.
 Health reform won't solve all these problems. But there is still reason to think that it can improve things. A limited, imperfect, warts-and-all bill would, as in 1965, be a lot better than no bill at all.
 The main political problem with health reform is still the immediate cost of it. Covering the uninsured will require $1.2 trillion or so over 10 years, and Congress hasn't been able to agree on $1.2 trillion of spending cuts and tax increases to keep the deficit from growing.
 This standard -- deficit neutrality -- may not be fair. George W. Bush, after all, spent trillions of dollars cutting taxes and adding a Medicare prescription drug benefit without offsetting the costs. Yet given the current size of the deficit, Mr. Obama and Congress have to do better.
 So a scaled-down version of health reform will probably mean spending less money to subsidize health insurance, thus leaving some of the uninsured without coverage. Such a compromise would not be the end of the world. (Medicare, remember, initially applied to a measly 8 percent of the population.) But it would create one tricky technical problem.
 Any plan to expand insurance depends on creating a broad group of people known as a risk pool. A company's work force is such a pool: it allows an insurer to balance the high cost of covering the sick with the low cost of covering the healthy. 
 If Congress passed a universal health insurance plan, the 45 million or so newly insured would make up their own risk pool, one that included both today's young, healthy uninsured as well as older, sicker uninsured. But if Congress stops short of universal coverage, it then has a problem. 
 It can't allow just people to sign up for subsidies voluntarily. That would create an incentive for the sick to buy insurance and the healthy to go without it. Average insurance costs would then soar -- and the subsidies would have to soar too, undercutting the plan.
 There are ways out of this problem. Congress could mandate that the young and, say, the near poor buy insurance. Together, they would create a decent risk pool.
 A second big question is whether health reform will include any serious attempt to reduce medical costs and improve quality. Economically, this issue may matter more than any other. Politically, it would make the White House seem serious about reducing the budget deficit. 
 ''Whatever new bill is going to come about has to have a far greater emphasis on cutting costs and making the delivery system far more efficient,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''That's true substantively and politically.'' 
 Right now, we pay hospitals, doctors and drug companies to give us more care rather than better care, and we get what we pay for. I recently described how this system undermines the treatment of prostate cancer, but there are dozens of examples.
 Unfortunately, none of the major proposals in the House of Representatives address the problem. The House's liberal leaders have been mostly uninterested in changing the incentives in health care. So have conservative Blue Dog Democrats, despite their fiscal discipline rhetoric. 
 Republicans, for their part, have signaled that their top priority is defeating a bill; they even rejected Mr. Obama's offer to include tort reform, a pet Republican issue. It looks as if any attack on fee-for-service medicine will fall to Senate Democrats.
 And then there is the president.
 Persuading Americans that health care needs reforming was always going to be hard. It depends on making people see the logic in a series of hypotheticals. If we don't reduce the growth in costs, we will leave our children with a crushing tax burden. If we do reduce costs, our paychecks will be fatter. If we reward quality of care instead of quantity of care, fewer people will die an early death. This isn't easy stuff.
 But Mr. Obama didn't get elected because he promised to do the easy jobs better than Hillary Clinton or John McCain. He won the election by vowing to be a Reagan-like communicator who could rally Americans to deal with daunting, intractable problems -- the kind of problem that bedeviled Bill Clinton, John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman.
 Mr. Obama and his advisers have spent much of this week trying to come up with a post-Labor Day strategy for selling health reform. They understand very well that incremental success is a lot better than nothing, and the Democratic-controlled Congress means that their odds are better than even. But they're not there yet.

HEADLINE: Liberals Try to Topple Canadian Government

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
Canada moved closer to its second federal election in less than a year on Tuesday, after the opposition leader Michael Ignatieff announced that his Liberal Party would no longer support Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his Conservative government. 
 ''Mr. Harper, your time is up,'' Mr. Ignatieff told a cheering crowd of Liberal politicians at a party retreat in Sudbury, Ontario. ''We will hold Stephen Harper to account and we will oppose his government in Parliament.''
 The Conservatives do not control a majority of the votes in the House of Commons and rely on the support of the Liberals and two smaller opposition parties to maintain power. Some combination of members from the two smaller parties, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois, would have to join the Liberals in order to bring down the government.
 Bob Rae, a prominent Liberal member of Parliament, said his party would introduce a motion of no confidence in the government at the first opportunity in the Parliamentary calendar, probably in early October.
 Exactly how either of the smaller parties, which are to the left of both the Conservatives and the Liberals, will respond when that happens is unclear. Last week, however, Jack Layton, the leader of the New Democrats, said that his party ''would be the least likely of the political parties to support the Conservatives.''
 Since 2006, Mr. Harper has maintained two governments without a majority of Parliamentary votes partly because the opposition parties were concerned that Canadians were weary of federal elections. There have been three since June 2004.
 Mr. Harper and other Conservatives were quick to say Tuesday that Canadians were not longing for another vote this fall. The prime minister also suggested that the end of his government would harm the economy.
 ''Political uncertainty does not serve the country right now,'' Mr. Harper said in Calgary, Alberta, the city which includes his Parliamentary district.
 In his speech, Mr. Ignatieff, a former journalist who also headed a human rights institute at Harvard University, criticized Mr. Harper for eroding public health care ''at a time when Americans want a public health care system,'' for lowering the country's international profile and for replacing a large federal budget surplus with a deficit.
 This is the second time since the October 2008 election that Mr. Harper's government has been in peril.
 In December, Mr. Harper asked Governor General Michaelle Jean, who represents Queen Elizabeth II as the nation's head of state, to shut down Parliament so that his government could avoid a no confidence vote. Stephane Dion, the Liberal leader at the time, had formed a coalition with the other two opposition parties to replace the Conservatives in power.
 While the episode eroded Mr. Harper's reputation as a shrewd political strategist, it ultimately proved worse for Mr. Dion who had already announced his resignation as Liberal leader. The party's executive accelerated the replacement process with the unusual step of naming Mr. Ignatieff as leader in December without holding a party convention.

HEADLINE: Conservative Democrats Expect to Make a Deal

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Reporting was contributed by Bernie Becker, Andrea Fuller, Janie Lorber and Ashley Southall.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Like her colleagues, Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, a South Dakota Democrat and leader of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, has been weathering the summer of health care discontent.
 There have been the angry constituents, the worried business leaders and even productive talks on what an acceptable health care overhaul should look like. Despite the clamor, Ms. Herseth Sandlin said she still believed that she -- and perhaps a majority of the more than 50 Blue Dogs -- could ultimately get behind a health care package if it was reasonable and represented a consensus Democratic view.
 ''I want to support necessary change,'' she said. ''But I don't want to support radical change.'' 
 Even after the tough town-hall-style meetings, unrelenting Republican assaults and a steady stream of questions from anxious voters, interviews with more than a dozen Blue Dogs and their top aides indicate that many of the lawmakers still believe approval of some form of health care plan is achievable and far preferable to not acting at all. 
 ''I can't tell you how comprehensive it will be, but I do believe something will get passed,'' said Representative Michael Arcuri, a second-term Blue Dog Democrat from New York.
 The political temperature of the Blue Dogs -- and their ideological counterparts in the Senate -- after the five-week recess is crucial. As representatives of some of the nation's most conservative territory represented by Democrats, they potentially have the most to lose if a Democratic bill spurs a backlash. Even with healthy majorities in Congress, every Democratic vote is critical given the reluctance by some Democrats to consider a major overhaul and near blanket Republican opposition.
 One lawmaker in the group, Representative David Scott of Georgia, said his determination to enact a health care overhaul had been increased over the recess because of what he called the spread of misinformation and other unfair tactics engaged in by the opposition.
 ''I think now more than ever we must get strong in our resolve to pass health care insurance reform legislation,'' Mr. Scott said. 
 Another coalition member, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said that despite the intensity of the health care fight over the last month, he was not sure the Democratic landscape had changed all that much from when House members left Washington in early August.
 ''The members that were skeptical of the public option going into the recess are still skeptical,'' Mr. Schiff said. ''Those who were supportive are still supportive.'' He suggested the major transformation was among Republicans, who seem far less open to any health care proposals given the heated sentiments aired by conservative voters.
 Administration officials, who have been talking regularly with lawmakers, said they found that most Democrats remained engaged and eager to explore ways to reach agreement.
 ''For the lion's share of Democratic members of Congress, this isn't about looking for a way to make this disappear,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, about the health care issue. ''This is about trying to find common ground for a yes vote.''
 Senate Democrats have similar internal tensions. Several more conservative Democratic senators have expressed reluctance about elements of proposals favored by liberals, especially the public insurance option, and concern about the overall price tag. 
 With the recess in its final week and the health care debate nearing a potentially critical moment, Congressional Democrats are also pressing the administration to move more aggressively to unite Democrats. On Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who oversaw the drafting of the Senate health committee's bill, said President Obama must ''step up and really frame this again for us.''
 But even as some moderate and conservative Blue Dogs signaled they were still ready to move forward, it was clear that others could support only a substantially scaled-back approach. That could mean a bill that would fall short of the Democratic goal of extending coverage to the almost 50 million people without health insurance.
 ''Without wholesale changing the bills, I just don't see how it's going to work,'' said Representative Jim Marshall of Georgia.
 ''I didn't intend to vote on it before I left D.C., and I certainly haven't changed my mind about it,'' said Representative Walt Minnick, a Blue Dog from Idaho.
 The sensitivity of the issue was demonstrated by how cautious lawmakers were in even discussing it. Several Blue Dogs declined to talk publicly about their views, while others said health care had become a proxy for general voter distrust of the federal government and fear about the Obama administration's perceived intrusion into private markets.
 But the sense from those who did consent to interviews was that once Congress resumes, Democrats need to figure out what they could agree on and how far they should go in remaking the health care system, given the political and fiscal restraints.
 With Republicans essentially out of the health care picture for now, Blue Dog members from suburban and rural America said they could provide the ideological balance to the more urban members of the Democratic caucus, who are pushing for a sweeping plan of universal coverage that has drawn public criticism.
 Still, the Blue Dogs are split on whether any new health insurance options should be packaged more like a cooperative familiar to voters in the less populated states represented by Blue Dogs or the public insurance idea being pushed by other Democrats.
 ''I've heard too many stories of Iowans who can't afford health insurance, or can't get coverage for the care they need,'' said Representative Leonard L. Boswell, a Blue Dog member from that state. ''I support a public option so that we can bring down the costs of premiums and curb the inflation of health care costs.''
 But Ms. Herseth Sandlin, while not ruling out the idea of a public plan, said Democrats needed to think strategically, decide on the limits of a plan that can attract majority support and revisit the issue in the future if they cannot achieve all they want now. 
 ''We have to be pragmatic and forge some deal that moves us in a positive direction,'' she said. ''We have expended unnecessary energy on elements of the plan that I don't think are essential. I remain optimistic that when we come back in September, we will recognize how important it is to get half a loaf.''

HEADLINE: Buying American in Tehran

BYLINE: By JERRY GUO. 
Jerry Guo was an analyst for a hedge fund in Tehran this summer.

DATELINE: Tehran 

 BODY:
 MY daily commute involves a walk down this city's most expensive shopping avenue, Fayyazi -- past tony boutiques that sell Calvin Klein jeans, Gucci handbags, Dior perfume and Victoria's Secret lingerie. Over lunch, my Iranian co-workers debate the merits of BlackBerrys versus iPhones, both found in the backrooms of electronics stores here.
 As an American living in Iran's turbulent capital through this historic summer, I was initially struck by how easy it is to find practically anything from back home, despite supposedly stringent Western trade sanctions. (Since President Ronald Reagan imposed export restrictions in 1987, technically only agricultural and medical products and ''informational materials'' like movies and magazines can be exported to Iran from the United States.) But as an analyst for a local hedge fund, I've also observed how easy it is to conduct substantial business with European investors and how firms like the one where I worked have adjusted to being considered corporate untouchables by the West. 
 American sanctions against this country are not only obviously ineffective, as my walk along Fayyazi demonstrated, they often have unintended consequences that hurt American interests. 
 President George W. Bush's 2005 sanctions on financial assets, meant to crack down on rogue banks facilitating Iran's nuclear program, had two unforeseen side effects. Freezing the financial assets of these banks increased the price of credit, making it more costly for honest financial firms like ours to operate. It also increased the value of Western goods like TV satellite dishes, cigarettes and alcohol, which the Revolutionary Guards sell on the black market, netting an estimated $12 billion a year. 
 Today, five members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany are to meet to consider cutting off Iran's supply of imported gasoline and diesel -- which accounts for 40 percent of the country's total consumption -- if the regime does not agree to restart negotiations over its nuclear weapons program by the end of this month. Sadly, though, the only people such sanctions would hurt would be the poor, who would face higher prices for food and bus fare. 
 Sanctions against foreign investment firms hurt ordinary Iranians, too, because those businesses pour money into companies that make medicine and build roads and housing, providing jobs for the millions of young Iranians who graduate each year with limited job prospects. 
 Further isolating Iran economically may in fact play right into the hands of Revolutionary Guard hard-liners. Tougher sanctions would rally this fratricidal conservative bloc against an old common enemy and help the Guards' many businesses, which include smuggling goods through secret landing spots on the coast.
 The ''targeted'' financial sanctions that the United States instituted in 2005 have been ineffective because Iran, despite its reputation as an international pariah, conducts substantial financial transactions with countries as varied as Brazil, France, Italy, South Korea and, of course, China and Russia. In March, when the Treasury Department froze the assets of our company's main competitor, First Persia Equity Fund, that firm's reputation took a huge hit. Yet its day-to-day business was not affected, for it has always dealt mainly with European banks and investors that see Iran not as a national security threat but as a money-making opportunity. 
 Despite this, American officials believe sanctions can be effective, and often cite as evidence the case of Banco Delta Asia, a bank based in Macao that handled much of the North Korean regime's external transactions. The United States blacklisted the bank, resulting in a freeze on $25 million in accounts linked to North Korea. In 2007, American negotiators used those accounts as a bargaining chip in an effort to persuade Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. 
 But the comparison doesn't hold up because Iran's foreign financial networks are far more complex and pervasive than North Korea's. By my count, at least six state banks that the United States considers to be financiers of Iran's nuclear or arms programs have operational branches throughout Europe. Bank Sepah -- a bank that the Iranian military uses for funneling money to the country's ballistic missile program -- even has an office on Fifth Avenue in New York City.
 Iranians by now have grown used to the constant saber-rattling. In December 2006, when the United Nations Security Council froze assets of weapons proliferators in Iran, according to calculations made by the fund where I worked, the Tehran Stock Exchange fell 7 percent. After the next round in March 2007, the index fell about 3 percent. By the third round last year, markets didn't budge. Local shops have adapted by routing their transactions with international merchants through second-tier banks in third-world countries like Pakistan. 
 Companies that import equipment like electronics have likewise hired middlemen in Dubai. Hewlett-Packard, for example, has officially sold zero computers here. But according to research by the firm I worked for, Iran is the company's largest market in the Middle East. 
 By driving large chunks of business outside the regulated economy, sanctions have benefited not only the Revolutionary Guards but also shadowy money lenders called hawalas. The hawalas swap debts without any cash exchanging hands -- a particularly good way to minimize the risk of detection when transferring more than $10,000. (Most European banks will happily handle any transaction under this amount.)
 Financial sanctions can never really work until Europeans sever their banking ties to Iran. But Iran is one of the Middle East's largest economies, and the European Union is Iran's largest trading partner. Some $20 billion worth of goods, exported each year from Europe to Iran, is at stake. Even when European countries have imposed sanctions, they are often not enforced. Last year, Italy simply lifted its sanctions against Bank Sepah.
 In any case, at this point sanctions may not be needed. The Iranian government's brutal crackdown in the wake of the disputed presidential election is becoming its own greatest undoing. YouTube videos of protesters dying in the streets and news reports of prison abuse and show trials do more to isolate the government here than a gas embargo ever could.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 14, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article on Sept. 2, about sanctions against Iran, misstated the status of sanctions against an Iranian bank with operations in Italy. Sanctions against the institution, Bank Sepah, remain in place; Italy has not lifted them.

HEADLINE: One Restaurant's Closing Is Another's Fresh Start

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
RECYCLING may be the hottest trend in New York City dining this season. Not turning used cooking oil into fuel or making tables out of barnboards, but recycling restaurants themselves. What else can you do when diners want a more relaxed, affordable setting? 
 Lever House couldn't survive the recession, but the owners of Sant Ambroeus are turning it into Casa Lever, with an all-day cafe up front. After the precious Wakiya didn't pan out, Danny Meyer was invited in and the Chinese restaurant will become the trattoria-style Maialino. Geoffrey Zakarian's Town in Midtown closed, so David Chang and his chef, Tien Ho, will come from the East Village to take his place. Jeffrey Chodorow's steakhouse Center Cut will become Ed's Chowder House.
Seafood shacks may be the new burger joints. There will be six of them in Greenwich Village alone. 
 More women, from Missy Robbins at A Voce Columbus to Danae Cappelletto at Travertine, are showing up at the stoves and as partners in new places. Far-flung neighborhoods continue to attract restaurateurs, from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, to the far West 50's in Manhattan, to Long Island City, Queens. 
 Unlike past years, there are few interlopers from other cities and countries: Nate Appleman of San Francisco at Keith McNally's new Italian venture, and Le Caprice New York, transplanted from London, are notable exceptions. 
 Nobody's going for glitter and gilt. Well, almost nobody. Tony and Marisa May's lavish new SD26 has both: a Swarovski crystal curtain and a gold-leaf ceiling.

HEADLINE: City Seeks to Turn Stalled Projects Into Moderate-Income Housing

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
As a rising number of half-finished and half-empty condo projects clutter the skyline, state and city officials have begun developing programs to turn hundreds of these apartments into moderate-income housing.
 But those efforts have proved far from easy. With budgets tighter than ever, there are few financial incentives to entice developers and lenders. And there are the practical challenges of selling apartments to buyers for far less than what their neighbors paid, not least among them possible complications for market-rent buyers, whose mortgages often depend on the building's financial status. 
 As housing officials work through the early stages of devising the programs, questions abound in the industry. 
 Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said that while empty buildings were not ideal, efforts to use them for moderate-income housing also presented problems. ''In the long run,'' he said, ''it would be reasonable to assume that there would be a negative impact on property values, separate and apart from change in market conditions.''
 Priscilla Almodovar, chief executive of the New York State Housing Finance Agency, said that a plan now in its early stages would most likely include offering homebuyers state-financed mortgages for units in buildings where some have already been sold to market-rate buyers. In that case, developers would also cut the price of the apartments.
 Another program would set aside $5 million for $40,000 grants to 125 homebuyers. For example, a single person or couple making $92,160 or less would qualify to buy a $380,000 apartment, using a $40,000 grant that the state provides the developer. A family of three or more making $107,520 would qualify to buy a $411,000 apartment. With these types of programs, the state typically requires buyers to hold on to the units for 10 years.
 Ms. Almodovar stressed that the program would take some time to develop, because the state had no experience with turning half-finished buildings into moderately priced housing. 
 ''There's no playbook here,'' she said. ''We're trying to figure out how hard this is.'' So far, officials are seriously talking with one developer on a condo project in Fort Greene, she said.
 In a separate move, Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries introduced legislation on Tuesday to help developers refinance troubled loans worth up to $150 million and make it easier to turn troubled condo and rental projects at all stages of construction into moderate-income rental units. 
 To qualify for the program, the loans would have had to be secured during the building boom from 2004 to 2008. The refinanced loans, held by the state, would require developers to add moderately priced housing, which Mr. Jeffries said he hoped would make up 50 percent of these buildings' units.
 In Mr. Jeffries's Brooklyn district -- which includes parts of Clinton Hill, Fort Greene, Prospect Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights -- there are 66 condo projects in some stage of development, including a handful in foreclosure.
 Among those in foreclosure that Mr. Jeffries has identified are 118-120 Lexington Avenue and 525 Clinton Avenue. Calls to representatives of those buildings were not returned.
 He said there were also buildings that are probably in trouble that he did not know about yet. For example, Goldman Sachs and the developer the Clarett Group recently handed back the Forte, at 230 Ashland Place, to the lender, Eurohypo Bank, before he even knew about the deal. 
 Mr. Jeffries said he had also been working with Representative Edolphus Towns, chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to help pressure banks that received federal money to work with the state to release developers from troubled mortgages.
 ''Many of these institutions continue to receive TARP money,'' Mr. Jeffries said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program. ''It is the right thing for these banks to recirculate these tax dollars into the economy.''
 In July, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn introduced a separate $20 million program aimed at luxury rental and condo buildings that are empty, half-finished or have sold only a few units. That initiative will give preference to developers asking for subsidies of less than $50,000 per condo unit and less than $75,000 per unit for those they turn into rentals. 
 But mortgage brokers have already raised some practical questions about how these programs would work: What restrictions would the buyers face when they later try to sell? How will the programs affect local real estate values? 
 Melissa Cohn, president of Manhattan Mortgage, which has arranged thousands of local mortgages, questions how market-rate buyers will be able to get mortgages in buildings where the makeup of the units have changed and may no longer meet lenders' requirements. Then there is paying for the management of the building.
 ''It's very hard, in a building that is 30 percent sold and closed, to designate the balance of the building affordable housing,'' Ms. Cohn said. ''The costs of carrying a building doesn't change. Do you get rid of the doorman? Eliminate the gym? Close down the party room?''
 With one group of buyers paying lower prices, Keith Kantrowitz, the president of Power Express Mortgage Bankers in Lake Success, N.Y., questioned how these buildings would divide the costs of the amenities that condo developers adopted in the boom years.
 ''Are they going to have a badge saying that they can't use the pool?'' he said. ''No one has done this yet.''
 Still, government officials say their modest efforts are far better than the alternative: letting buildings sit empty.
 ''If we just did nothing, everyone would lose. The neighborhoods lose,'' said Ms. Almodovar of the State Housing Finance Agency. ''Everyone benefits if we help bring in new buyers, stabilize the market, taking ownership of the community.''

HEADLINE: Beryl Sprinkel, Reagan Economic Adviser, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Beryl W. Sprinkel, a high-ranking economic adviser to the Reagan administration who helped formulate its policies and guide its response to the October 1987 stock market crash, died on Aug. 22 near Chicago Heights, Ill. He was 85.
 The death was confirmed by Candy Bartok of Tews Funeral Home in Homewood, Ill. She would not release the cause, which was reported elsewhere as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, a rare neuromuscular disease. Judy Jenson of Flossmoor Community Church in Flossmoor, Ill., where a memorial service was held, said Mr. Sprinkel had died in an ambulance taking him to a hospital in Chicago Heights from a nursing home in Beecher, Ill. 
Mr. Sprinkel's biggest impact came after he submitted his resignation as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to deal with a family illness in the fall of 1987. The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen by 508 points on Monday, Oct. 19, and President Ronald Reagan was meeting with his principal economic advisers the next day.
 Mr. Sprinkel, in what he thought were his last days as chairman of the council, persuaded the president to permit negotiations on tax increases with Congress, The New York Times reported 11 days later. Mr. Sprinkel assured Mr. Reagan that negotiations would not necessarily mean acquiescence to increases.
 This step was perceived by market participants and others as evidence that the administration wanted to get its fiscal house in order, and was one of the moves that began to calm traumatized markets. Mr. Sprinkel quietly withdrew his resignation, and his position was elevated to cabinet rank.
 He had been warning for months of a crisis. He thought the administration's agreement with other countries to support the dollar was pushing interest rates dangerously high.
 But Mr. Sprinkel could not rally the president and his top economic advisers to his side in two earlier meetings, the second held on the Friday before the crash, a day the Dow dropped 108 points. As usual, he made his argument in economic terms, eschewing the political perspectives other aides put forward.
 He did prevail when some suggested closing the financial markets the day of the crash. Leo Melamed, then chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said in his book ''Leo Melamed: Escape to the Futures'' (1996), written with Bob Tamarkin, that Mr. Sprinkel exploded:
 ''Mr. President, that's crazy. If you close the markets down, you will lose the ability to interpret what they are telling us. The markets must be left open.''
 They were.
 Beryl Wayne Sprinkel was born into a farm family in Richmond, Mo., on Nov. 20, 1923. He served in the Army as a tank gunner in World War II, then earned a degree in economics from the University of Missouri. He studied at the University of Chicago, where he earned an M.B.A. and a Ph.D., and immersed himself in the monetarist ideas of Milton Friedman, who later won a Nobel Prize in economics.
 Pure monetarists believe that money supply -- and only the money supply -- determines the rate of economic growth and inflation. In books like ''Money and Stock Prices,'' Mr. Sprinkel strove to explain the implications of this economic philosophy.
 Mr. Sprinkel worked at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago from 1952 to 1981, rising to executive vice president. Then Donald T. Regan, Mr. Reagan's choice to be secretary of the Treasury, chose Mr. Sprinkel to be his undersecretary for monetary affairs. Mr. Regan said he wanted ''the best monetarist I can get.''
 Mr. Sprinkel gained a reputation for outspokenness, criticizing the Federal Reserve and foreign economic officials, as well as apostles of supply-side economics who thought tax cuts were the answer to every economic question. He took a tough line on loans to debtor nations, even ones in crisis.
 In February 1985, Mr. Sprinkel was nominated as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, a job that Reagan had considered abolishing. Mr. Sprinkel played down his new role, saying Mr. Reagan had an ''amazing'' knowledge of economics and was ''his own chief economic adviser.''
 Mr. Sprinkel's first and second wives, the former Esther Pollard and Barbara Angus Pipher, and his sons Dennis and Gary died before him. He is survived by his third wife, the former Lory Kiefer Reed; his son Kevin; his stepchildren, Janet and David Reed; and 10 grandchildren. 
 A remark by Mr. Sprinkel is often quoted by monetarist economists for its elegant succinctness: ''Control the money supply and everything else falls into place. Thank you, and good night.''

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Group Weighs In

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Promote personal health by taxing sugary soft drinks. 
 Make it easier for individuals to buy coverage by creating health insurance exchanges. 
 Encourage more efficient use of insurance by reducing the tax breaks employers get for providing health benefits. 
 Those are among the dozens of diverse recommendations in a report released Tuesday by a bipartisan group of economists and health policy experts convened by Dr. Mark B. McClellan, a former Medicare administrator under President George W. Bush. 
 The group ranged from free-market thinkers like Joseph R. Antos of the American Enterprise Institute, to the Democratic policy adviser David M. Cutler from Harvard.
 Dr. McClellan said the group tried to reach a bipartisan consensus about the many gradual steps that could be taken to help the country control medical costs while improving the quality of care. They say that any legislation should support long-term changes, rather than short-term fixes like slashing Medicare payments. 
 ''These steps are about accountability and support for what we really want -- better care at a lower cost,'' Dr. McClellan said.

HEADLINE: With Shift in Japan, U.S. Sees a Stranger as a Partner

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and MARTIN FACKLER; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Martin Fackler from Tokyo.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Japan's landmark election presents the Obama administration with an untested government, creating a new set of imponderables for a White House already burdened by foreign policy headaches in Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.
 Inside the administration, the historic change in Tokyo is raising concerns that Japan may back away from supporting key American priorities like the war in Afghanistan or the redeployment of American troops in Asia, according to senior officials.
 Specifically, the newly elected Democratic Party says it may recall the Japanese naval forces from a mission to refuel American warships near Afghanistan. And it wants to reopen an agreement to relocate a Marine airfield on Okinawa, which requires Japan to pick up much of the cost for moving thousands of Marines to Guam. 
 The victory of the Democrats on Sunday means the White House must deal, for the first time in decades, with a Japanese government that is a complete stranger, and one that has expressed blunt criticism of the United States. The party's leader and presumptive prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, recently spoke out against American-led globalization and called for a greater Japanese focus on Asia.
 Despite the party's campaign rhetoric, its leaders insist they will not threaten the alliance with the United States, particularly when Japan faces a fast-rising China and a nuclear-armed North Korea. Senior American officials said they expected Japan to remain a bulwark in Asia, even noting that the new government, unburdened by history, could play a more central role in negotiating with North Korea.
 But for the most part, the United States is perplexed by what one official described as a ''seismic event,'' with unknown consequences for one of its most important relationships.
 ''The election of a new party could produce new ways of doing things, which we will have to adjust to,'' said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. ''You'll have this period of unpredictability.''
 The big question many in Washington are asking is whether the vote was a harbinger of a deeper change in Japan, away from its historic dependence on the United States.
 ''There is a fear of dramatic change in the U.S.-Japan alliance,'' said Michael Auslin, an expert on Japanese foreign policy at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ''No one knows what will happen next, or even who to talk to for answers.''
 The Democratic Party struck a chord with its talk of improving ties with China and other neighbors, reflecting the fact that Japan's $5 trillion economy has grown more dependent on commerce with its neighbors.
 Fears of Japanese drift seemed to be confirmed last week when an article by Mr. Hatoyama, excerpted and translated from a Japanese journal, appeared on the Web site of The New York Times. It stirred a hornet's nest in Washington by casting Japan's embattled economy as the victim of American-inspired free-market fundamentalism. Yet it also stressed the importance of the American alliance.
 Mr. Hatoyama's views sent many in Washington's diplomatic establishment scurrying to learn more about him and the Democrats. That highlighted a problem: While American officials and academics have spent decades cultivating close ties with the Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan for most of the last half century, they have built few links to the opposition.
 Some Japan experts said it would be a mistake to read too much into Mr. Hatoyama's remarks, and Japanese officials privately conveyed that same caution to the Obama administration. 
 ''It was an indication they still haven't figured out what they're going to do in power,'' said Michael J. Green, a professor of international relations at Georgetown University who served on the National Security Council during the last Bush administration. ''This could get confused and dysfunctional for a while.''
 Stung by the reaction, Mr. Hatoyama appears to be back-pedaling and engaging in damage control. On Monday night, he said he had not intended for the article to appear abroad, and said it was being misinterpreted. ''If you read the entire essay, you will understand that it is definitely not expressing anti-American ideas,'' he said.
 Professor Green noted that in many ways, relations between the United States and Japan were smoother now than in years past because the trade disputes of the 1980s and 1990s were largely settled.
 He said the new government would find that some of its proposals, like reopening talks on the relocation of the Futenma Marine airfield on Okinawa, were unrealistic, given the years it took to negotiate that deal. For the Obama administration, he said, the challenge will be to give Japan's new leaders a face-saving way to back down. 
 Japan, experts said, could play a more muscular role in talks with North Korea if, as expected, the Democrats turn down the heat on the issue of Japanese abducted by North Korea decades ago, a perennial sticking point for the Liberal Democrats.
 And Obama administration officials said they were eager to dispel perceptions in Japan that a better relationship with China would somehow undermine its alliance with the United States.
 ''We have no desire to see our defense commitment tested by battle,'' a senior official said. ''We see no contradiction between Japan reducing frictions with China and a strong Japan-U.S. alliance.''
 In recent years, many Japanese have thought the United States took the relationship for granted, paying more attention to China. 
 Traditionally, the United States has sent high-powered diplomats or political figures to Tokyo. But the Obama administration chose to send a big campaign donor, John Roos, as ambassador, passing over a longtime Asia hand, Joseph S. Nye Jr., who had been championed by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 Administration officials counter that Mr. Roos, a Silicon Valley lawyer, will be influential because he has the ear of President Obama.
 Political analysts and former diplomats say the Democrats are so sharply divided ideologically -- between pacifist former Socialists and flag-flying former Liberal Democrats -- that they will avoid treading too heavily on divisive foreign policy issues for fear of splitting the party.
 Policy analysts also say the Japanese public would turn against the Democrats if they undermined the Washington alliance, pointing out that the opposition won because of anger with the incumbents' failed economic policies, not because of a desire to change the nation's reliance on the United States, which remains widely accepted here. 
 ''They do not have a mandate for changing the alliance with the U.S.,'' said Yukio Okamoto, a former adviser to several prime ministers on foreign affairs.

HEADLINE: Oil Allies Protesting U.S. Money For Rivals

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration has granted as much as $1.6 million in aid to help trade groups promote ethanol, natural gas, propane and biodiesel products, whose clean-energy selling points happen to fit with the administration's push to cap carbon emissions.
 Oil industry allies said the administration was engaging in favoritism and financing propaganda. ''These are for-profit companies, and basically the Department of Energy is underwriting their public-relations campaign,'' said Daniel Kish, a spokesman for the Institute for Energy Research, a conservative group fighting the proposed emissions caps. 
 ''When is the last time the government gave a grant to the American Petroleum Institute to go out and tout the virtues of fossil fuel?'' Mr. Kish asked. ''Last time I checked, the National Mining Association hasn't gotten anything to educate people about the wonders of coal.''
 Stephanie Mueller, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said in an e-mail message that ''this grant was competitively awarded to promote the expansion of biofuels and other clean-energy technologies.'' 
 The grants were announced by the Department of Energy last week along with $300 million in economic stimulus money awarded to 25 projects to encourage the use of cleaner and energy-efficient alternatives to petroleum. Most of the money will help pay for vehicles that run on alternative fuels or build infrastructure to distribute the fuels. 
 In connection with those efforts, however, the department also awarded about $3.25 million aimed at ''educational projects'' to increase ''awareness of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles.'' One grant was made to North Carolina State University. One was made to the West Virginia University Research Corporation. And the third, for $1.6 million, went to a coalition of industry groups, the Alternative Fuel Trade Alliance.
 One of its members, the Renewable Fuels Association, is a trade group that lobbies for ethanol subsidies, although the group said the grants would go only to marketing, not lobbying. Other organizations in the alliance are nonprofits closely allied with lobbying trade groups: the National Biodiesel Foundation, whose executive director is an official of a biodiesel lobbying group; and the Clean Vehicle Education Foundation, a sister organization of the natural gas trade group.
 Another group is the Propane Education and Research Council, an industry group that was created by Congressional legislation and is forbidden to lobby. (Propane is a byproduct of fossil fuel production, and its makers say it gives off less pollution.) The other member of the alliance is ASG Renaissance, a Michigan-based marketing firm that specializes in clean energy. 
 Robert White, an official of the ethanol trade group, said the grants would pay for some joint promotional workshops aimed at ''anyone from 'Joe Six-Pack' to the media to fueling station owners to local elected officials.'' Mr. White said each industry group would also plan promotions for its own product as well.
 He pointed out that the groups were required report their marketing to the Energy Department ''to make sure it is accurate and not just biased information coming from these trade groups.''
 Brian Feehan, an official at the propane group, said its efforts were more narrowly focused, specifically on managers of local fleets of vehicles. Douglas B. Horne, president of the Clean Vehicle Education Foundation, said his organization had been holding workshops to inform local officials about natural gas use for years and now planned to expand them to promote other fuels.
 In a statement announcing the $300 million in grants, the Energy Department estimated that the alternative-energy projects it is financing ''will help displace about approximately 38 million gallons of petroleum per year.''

TAKING
 QUESTIONS
 This week on the blog, Maria Balinska, the author of ''The Bagel: The Surprising History of a Modest Bread,'' is answering readers' questions about one of New York's staple foods. An excerpt: 
 Q. I thought authentic bagels had to be boiled, not baked; could baking bagels be what is making them so doughy and bready? Erick Bond
 A. Yes, and some bakeries steam instead of boiling, which gives a different consistency.
 Q. Is there a specific city or area that is associated with the early history of the bagel, as Bialystok is to the bialy? 
 Zora
 A. No city gave its name to the bagel as Bialystok did to the bialy, but if I had to pick one place it would be another Polish city, Krakow. This is where the bagel is first mentioned, in a 1610 list of sumptuary laws (laws designed to limit expenditure) drawn up by the city's Jewish elders. 
 This is also the city most closely associated with the bagel's closest cousin, the obwarzanek, which is now a registered regional product with the European Union. Before 1939, most of the city's obwarzanek and bagels were baked by Jewish bakers; most of the people I spoke with who remember life there then say that the two products were practically interchangeable.
 Q. Regarding why bagels are round: Perhaps they were indeed hawked on poles by bakers at the market; I've heard that the word ''bagel'' is Yiddish for ''bangle.'' HB
 A. They were indeed hawked on poles and on ropes, at the market and on street corners. Lots of pictures and words confirm this. The word ''bagel'' comes from the Yiddish ''beigen,'' which means ''to bend.''
 Q. What is an objective set of standards for judging bagels (i.e., not the circular logic of ''The best bagels come from New York because New York makes the best bagels'')? Where would those objective standards come from? FC
 A. Everyone has their own particular standards, but for me the crust has to be shiny and crunchy; the inside consistency chewy and slightly damp; the taste should be yeasty with a tangy bite; and the overall effect of eating a bagel should be that you feel like a stone has landed in your stomach -- in the best possible way, of course.
 Q. Do you have a favorite bagel joke? David
 A. Here's one from ''Milton Berle's Private Joke File'':
 We used to buy day-old bagels. They were so hard we had to hammer the butter on. Then my uncle came up with a brilliant idea. He went to Israel and made a fortune selling Cheerios as bagel seeds. 
 If you believe either one, there's some border property along the Golan Heights I'd like to sell you.

 A Fire, a Bell, a Find: A catastrophic fire in Coney Island nearly a century ago leveled broad stretches of the amusement area, sending two gargantuan ferry piers into the sea and leaving thousands of people unemployed.
 But a 500-pound bell that fell into the ocean with the piers will soon be on display again, thanks to a diver on a search inspired by photos.

HEADLINE: Leader Does Not Emerge In Report on 2016 Bids

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Olympics received mostly praise, tempered by concerns over finances and transportation, in a report released Wednesday by the International Olympic Committee on the plans of the four cities vying to host the Games. 
 The report did not single out a winner or loser among the finalists, underscoring the closeness of the race a month before I.O.C. members are due to vote on the host city in Copenhagen. Chicago is competing with Tokyo, Madrid and Rio de Janeiro. 
 ''Usually they mention a bid that is not yet ready, and none of that was talked about,'' said Robert Livingstone, the producer of GamesBids.com, an independent Web site in Canada that focuses on the Olympic bid process. ''This time there is no clear leader.''
 The report called Chicago's $3.8 billion budget ''ambitious but achievable'' and said the bid had the support of national government officials as well as 67 percent of city residents, according to an I.O.C. poll. By comparison, 56 percent of Toyko residents supported that city's bid. In Rio and Madrid, 85 percent of residents supported the bids in each city. 
 The report noted, however, that the Chicago bid organizers had not provided a full financial guarantee in the event of an economic shortfall, which is ''contrary to I.O.C. requirements.'' 
 The City of Chicago has promised up to $500 million to back the effort, and Illinois has pledged an additional $250 million. 
 After I.O.C. members toured Chicago in April, Mayor Richard M. Daley pledged to sign the host city contract, which would place financial responsibility for the Games in the hands of the city. Patrick G. Ryan, Chicago's bid leader, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that the City Council was close to authorizing the mayor's pledge and that the organizers had arranged for up to $2 billion in private insurance. 
 The report also questioned whether Chicago's Metra rail system could handle the surge in Olympic traffic. In a statement, Chicago organizers said that $12 billion had already been allotted to improve the city's infrastructure, regardless of whether the Olympics are held there. 
 Ryan said representatives of the Chicago bid are spending the final month lobbying I.O.C. members at sporting events worldwide and preparing for their presentation in Copenhagen. ''We're not predicting victory, but we've got a very competitive bid, we've got a great city, and our team has done well,'' he said.
 Livingstone cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from the report, noting that I.O.C. members often vote for a range of reasons. Past winners, including Beijing, have not come out ahead in the technical report. 
 The competition to host the 2016 Games is considered particularly close. Rio de Janeiro is popular among many I.O.C. members because the Olympics have never been held in South America, but concerns about security have been raised. The report took note of the city's ''safety challenges,'' but said organizers had shown that Rio hosts two million people every year during Carnival and New Year's Eve celebrations.
 Although the report offered praise for the organizational efforts of each city, Madrid and Tokyo received relatively harsh criticism. Madrid, which is bidding for the second time after losing to London for the 2012 Games, submitted a plan that ''lacked clarity and showed limited understanding of Olympic requirements'' in budgeting of areas like transportation, the report said. Still, it found the city's $2.67 billion budget to be achievable and said its overall concept was ''well constructed.''
 Tokyo's evaluation noted the low public support and found that some sites that the city had listed as existing would require extensive construction. In a statement released Wednesday, Tokyo's organizers said domestic support for the Games had been steadily increasing.

HEADLINE: Report Cites Culture of Ethnic Hatred in Suffolk County

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
An environment of racial intolerance and ethnic hatred, fostered by anti-immigrant groups and some public officials, has helped fuel dozens of attacks on Latinos in Suffolk County during the past decade, says a report issued Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that tracks hate groups around the country.
 ''Latino immigrants in Suffolk County live in fear,'' said the report, which the law center released at a news conference here. ''Political leaders in the county have done little to discourage the hatred, and some have actively fanned the flames.'' 
 The law center, based in Montgomery, Ala., came to prominence in the 1970s for anti-discrimination efforts and its legal battles against the Ku Klux Klan. It started looking at Suffolk County after Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant, was stabbed to death last November in Patchogue. Seven youths, who prosecutors say were driven by prejudice against Latinos, are awaiting trial in that case. 
 The center's report is the product of months of investigation on Long Island, including scores of interviews with Latino immigrants and local civic leaders. While it draws heavily on news accounts and public records, center officials said it was the most comprehensive compilation of statements and events showing a pattern of hate crimes in Suffolk that were at least tacitly condoned -- if not actively encouraged -- by some local leaders. 
 The center's investigators made ''frightening'' discoveries, the report said: ''Although Lucero's murder represented the apex of anti-immigration violence in Suffolk County to date, it was hardly an isolated incident.''
 Many Latino immigrants in Suffolk say they have been beaten with baseball bats and other objects, attacked with BB guns and pepper spray, and been the victims of arson, the report said. Latinos, it added, are frequently run off the road while riding bicycles or pelted with objects hurled from cars. 
 On Aug. 15, after the center's report had been printed, an Ecuadorean man in Patchogue was attacked by three men who used racial epithets as they kicked and punched him, the police said. The three were arrested, and two were charged with assault as a bias crime, Newsday reported. 
 On Aug. 20, a man in Smithtown told a mother and a daughter who wore traditional Islamic garb that he was going to ''chop you into little pieces and kill you,'' the police said. The man was charged with second-degree aggravated harassment, the Associated Press reported.
 And on Wednesday, the police said, hate-crimes detectives were investigating a burglary Tuesday night at a Latino evangelical church in Patchogue, in which notes with anti-Hispanic comments were found on the altar.
 The law center report, echoing often-repeated statements by advocates for immigrants, accused the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, of helping to create an atmosphere of anti-immigrant sentiment by taking a hard line against illegal immigration.
 In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Levy said, ''While we can continue to disagree about policies related to the economic and social impacts of illegal immigration, we can all agree that any violence against a fellow human being cannot and will not be tolerated.'' In the past, Mr. Levy has repeatedly denied accusations that he has fomented bias. 
 The report pointed to a statement by Michael M. D'Andre, a county legislator from Smithtown, at a 2001 hearing on a bill to penalize contractors who hire undocumented workers. Mr. D'Andre said that if his town were ''attacked'' by an influx of Hispanic day laborers, ''we'll be up in arms, we'll be out with baseball bats.'' He apologized the following week for his remark. 
 The report also highlighted a comment by Elie Mystal, a county legislator from Amityville, who said during a hearing in 2007 that if day laborers started gathering in his neighborhood, ''I would load my gun and start shooting, period.'' He later apologized and said he had been joking, according to news media reports. 
 Mr. D'Andre and Mr. Mystal are no longer legislators.
 The report said Latinos' fears were fed by nativist groups like Sachem Quality of Life, a local organization that has disbanded. 
 After Mr. Lucero's death, many immigrants in the county stepped forward to describe their attacks to the police and media. In some of the cases, the allegations were reported to the police at the time the assaults occurred, but no arrests were made, in part because language barriers made communication difficult, the authorities have said. 
 Law center officials said that according to immigrants they interviewed, there may have been another reason for the inaction: police indifference. 
 Many immigrants told center investigators that the ''police did not take their reports of attacks seriously, often blaming the victim,'' the report said. ''They said there's little point in going to the police, who are often not interested in their plight and instead demand to know their immigration status.'' 
 The Suffolk County police commissioner, Richard Dormer, said in a statement, ''Some of the report had concrete ideas, most of which we are already implementing, but other parts were rife with inaccuracies due to the law center's failure to interview the Police Department, the district attorney or elected officials.''
 The report urged officials to adopt measures including halting ''their angry demagoguery'' about immigration, promoting programs that encourage respect for diversity, and training police officers to take seriously all allegations of hate-motivated crime. 
 ''If these measures are taken to combat an increasingly volatile situation,'' the report said, ''it's likely that angry passions in Suffolk can be cooled and a rational debate on immigration and its consequences begun.''

HEADLINE: A Hybrid Degree

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Adding Layers of Skills to a Science Background'' (news article, Aug. 20): 
 Technology-industry employers have told me that they seek to hire professionals with both scientific and business skills, exactly as described in your article. 
 But students do not need to settle for individual hybrid courses or seek two separate degrees, as there is a new, innovative type of graduate degree that combines the two skill sets.
 The Professional Science Master's (P.S.M.) degree blends rigorous study of science or math with coursework in areas like communication, project management and business basics. A hallmark of P.S.M. programs is a required real-world internship or project.
 Nationwide, there are 146 P.S.M. programs. P.S.M. graduates are able to serve as liaisons among scientists, business and the general public. They play an important role in our nation's economic competitiveness.

HEADLINE: Trading Remains Subdued On Anxiety Over Jobs Data

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market extended its slide as investors worried that a weak job market would trip up an economic recovery.
 Stocks posted modest losses on Wednesday, a day after tumbling on fears about banks and concerns that a six-month rally of more than 50 percent has left the stock market overheated. The Dow Jones industrial average lost an additional 30 points after falling 186 points on Tuesday. 
 A private-sector report on unemployment gave investors new reason to fret about what is widely seen as the biggest problem facing the economy. The ADP National Employment Report found that employment fell by 298,000 in August after a revised loss of 360,000 jobs in July. The losses were the smallest since September 2008 but more than analysts had expected.
 The report shapes expectations for the Labor Department's monthly reading on jobs, which is due Friday. Unemployment has hurt consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the nation's economic activity. Without more help from consumers, the economy will have trouble pulling out of the longest recession since World War II.
 ''Until Friday's data comes, no one is really making any big bets,'' said Neil Massa, senior trader at MFC Global Investment Management. ''A little profit-taking looks healthy at this point.''
 Analysts said the market's ability to avoid another steep drop was a good sign but cautioned that trading volume remained light ahead of the Labor Day weekend. Light volume can skew the market's moves and make it difficult to draw conclusions about investor sentiment.
 ''We need these periods of backing off,'' said Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN in Omaha, Neb. ''When there is no news to really spark the interest that we need to take this thing higher, the inclination is to sell off.''
 Even with stocks down for three consecutive days, major market indicators have given up less than two weeks' worth of gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is still up 47.5 percent from a 12-year low on March 9.
 The Dow fell 29.93 points, or 0.3 percent, to 9,280.67. The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 3.29 points, or 0.3 percent, to 994.75, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,967.07.
 Bond prices rose, pushing down yields. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 16/32, to 102 22/32, and the yield fell to 3.30 percent from 3.36 percent late Tuesday.
 The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, and gold prices rose as investors turned to the safety of hard assets. Gold gained $22.15, to $978.50 an ounce on the spot market.
 Light sweet crude oil settled unchanged at $68.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Japan's Nikkei stock average tumbled 2.4 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped less than 0.1 percent, while Germany's DAX index fell 0.1 percent and France's CAC-40 lost 0.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Health Care That Works

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Here's a paradox.
 Health care reform may be defeated this year in part because so many Americans believe the government can't do anything right and fear that a doctor will come to resemble an I.R.S. agent with a scalpel. Yet the part of America's health care system that consumers like best is the government-run part.
 Fifty-six to 60 percent of people in government-run Medicare rate it a 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale. In contrast, only 40 percent of those enrolled in private insurance rank their plans that high. 
 Multiple surveys back that up. For example, 68 percent of those in Medicare feel that their own interests are the priority, compared with only 48 percent of those enrolled in private insurance. 
 In truth, despite the deeply ingrained American conviction that government is bumbling when it is not evil, government intervention has been a step up in some areas from the private sector.
 Until the mid-19th century, firefighting was left mostly to a mishmash of volunteer crews and private fire insurance companies. In New York City, according to accounts in The New York Times in the 1850s and 1860s, firefighting often descended into chaos, with drunkenness and looting.
 So almost every country moved to what today's health insurance lobbyists might label ''socialized firefighting.'' In effect, we have a single-payer system of public fire departments.
 We have the same for policing. If the security guard business were as powerful as the health insurance industry, then it would be denouncing ''government takeovers'' and ''socialized police work.'' 
 Throughout the industrialized world, there are a handful of these areas where governments fill needs better than free markets: fire protection, police work, education, postal service, libraries, health care. The United States goes along with this international trend in every area but one: health care. 
 The truth is that government, for all its flaws, manages to do some things right, so that today few people doubt the wisdom of public police or firefighters. And the government has a particularly good record in medical care.
 Take the hospital system run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated health system in the United States. It is fully government run, much more ''socialized medicine'' than is Canadian health care with its private doctors and hospitals. And the system for veterans is by all accounts one of the best-performing and most cost-effective elements in the American medical establishment.
 A study by the Rand Corporation concluded that compared with a national sample, Americans treated in veterans hospitals ''received consistently better care across the board, including screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.'' The difference was particularly large in preventive medicine: veterans were nearly 50 percent more likely to receive recommended care than Americans as a whole.
 ''If other health care providers followed the V.A.'s lead, it would be a major step toward improving the quality of care across the U.S. health care system,'' Rand reported.
 As for the other big government-run health care system in the United States, Medicare spends perhaps one-sixth as much on administration as private health insurers, although the comparison is imperfect and controversial.
 But the biggest weakness of private industry is not inefficiency but unfairness. The business model of private insurance has become, in part, to collect premiums from healthy people and reject those likely to get sick -- or, if they start out healthy and then get sick, to find a way to cancel their coverage.
 A reader wrote in this week to tell me about a colleague of hers who had health insurance through her company. The woman received a cancer diagnosis a few weeks ago, and she now faces chemotherapy co-payments that she cannot afford. Worse, because she is now unable to work and has to focus on treatment, she has been shifted to short-term disability for 90 days -- and after that, she will lose her employer health insurance. 
 She can keep her insurance if she makes Cobra payments on her own, but she can't afford this. In her case, her company will voluntarily help her -- but I just don't understand why we may be about to reject health reform and stick with a dysfunctional system that takes away the health coverage of hard-working Americans when they become too sick with cancer to work.
 On my blog, foreigners regularly express bewilderment that America may reject reform and stick with a system that drives families into bankruptcy when they get sick. That's what they expect from the Central African Republic, not the United States. 
 Let's hope we won't miss this chance. A public role in health care shouldn't be any scarier or more repugnant than a public fire department.

HEADLINE: Workers in America, Cheated

 BODY:
An important new study has cast an appalling light on a place where workplace laws fail to protect workers, where wages and tips are routinely stolen, where having to work sick, injured or off the clock is the price of having a job. 
 The place is the United States, all across the lower strata of the urban economy.
 The most comprehensive investigation of labor-law violations in years, released Wednesday by the Center for Urban Economic Development, the National Employment Law Project and the U.C.L.A. Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, surveyed 4,387 workers in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. Its researchers sought out people often missed by standard surveys and found abuses everywhere: in factories, grocery stores, retail shops, construction sites, offices, warehouses and private homes. The word sweatshop clearly is not big enough anymore to capture the extent and severity of the rot in the low-wage workplace.
 Workers told of employers who ignored the minimum wage, denied overtime, took illegal deductions to pay for tools or transportation, or forced them to work unpaid before or after their shifts. More than two-thirds of them had endured at least one wage violation in the previous workweek. More than a quarter had been paid less than the minimum wage, often by more than $1 an hour. Violations typically robbed workers of $51 a week, from an average paycheck of $339. 
 The report paints an acute picture of powerlessness. Of workers who had been seriously injured on the job, only 8 percent had filed for workers' compensation -- a symptom, researchers said, of the power of employer pressure. Although 86 percent of respondents had worked enough consecutive hours to be entitled to time off for meals, more than two-thirds had had their breaks denied, interrupted or shortened. Workers who complained to bosses or government agencies or tried to form unions suffered illegal retaliation: firing, suspension, pay cuts or threats to call immigration authorities.
 It is, of course, morally abhorrent that the American economy should be so riddled with exploitation. But it is also powerfully evident that there are practical consequences when the powerless are abused. Low-wage workers spend a high proportion of their income on necessities; when their paychecks are systematically bled by greedy employers, an entire community's economic vitality is sapped as well.
 The answers are basic, though too long ignored. Government needs to send more investigators to back rooms, offices and factory floors, and to enlist labor organizations and immigrant-rights groups as their investigative eyes and ears. Penalties for wage-law violations need toughening. Employees who have historically been denied basic labor rights -- domestic workers and home health aides -- need to finally be given the protection of wage-and-hour laws. Companies must not be allowed to skirt their legal obligations by outsourcing hiring to subcontractors, letting others break the law for them. 
 The report has particular significance for immigrant workers, who made up 70 percent of the survey (39 percent of them were undocumented). Workplace abuses are flourishing in the absence of a working immigration system, where illegal immigrants are vital to the economy but helpless to assert their rights. 
 The report upends the argument that the way to help American workers is to make illegal immigrants ever more frightened and exploitable. Only by protecting all workers will the country begin to rebuild a workplace matching its ideals of decency and fair play.

HEADLINE: A Reluctance to Retire Means Fewer Openings

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL and MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
To the long list of reasons American companies aren't hiring -- business losses, tight credit, consumer retrenchment -- add the fact that many of their older workers are unable, or afraid, to retire.
 In other parts of the developed world, people are retiring as planned, because of relatively flush state and corporate pensions that await them. But here in the United States, financial security in old age rests increasingly on private savings, which have taken a beating in the last year. Prospective retirees are clinging to their jobs despite some cherished life plans. 
 As a result, companies are not only reluctant to create new jobs, but have fewer job openings to fill from attrition. For the 14 million Americans looking for work -- a number expected to rise in Friday's jobs report for August -- this lack of turnover has made a tough job market even tougher.
 Consider Barbara Petrucci, a dialysis nurse who had expected to stop working soon, or at least scale back to part time. Now that her family savings have been depleted by market declines, she expects to stay on the job for a long, long time. 
 ''Retirement is kind of an elusive dream at this point,'' says Ms. Petrucci, 58, who works at an Atlanta hospital while her retired husband, Ned, 61, interviews for jobs (unsuccessfully, so far). ''We tease at work about someday having to go around at the hospital with our walkers.''
 The diverted life plans of families like the Petruccis are an unintended economic consequence of the nation's sprawling 401(k) plans. These private retirement savings vehicles, designed 30 years ago as a supplement to traditional corporate pensions, have somewhat haphazardly replaced the old system, like an innocuous weed that somehow overgrew the garden. 
 As is apparent in this downturn, the economic effects of such an ad hoc system can be perverse. In boom times, when companies need more workers, the most experienced employees may decide to retire, taking comfort in their bloated 401(k)s, whose values typically fluctuate with the financial markets. 
 Today, the reverse is happening in the first deep recession since the new accounts became so pervasive. A Pew Research survey scheduled for Thursday release found that nearly four in 10 workers over age 62 say they have delayed their retirement because of the recession. (Though the data omits some people who have retired and includes some who are still working, the Social Security Administration said that about 2.3 million people that age started collecting benefits last year.)
 ''One unappreciated side effect of the 401(k) system is that it's a sort of reverse automatic stabilizer,'' says Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at the New School. 
 The recent retirement losses have prompted policy makers to discuss whether Americans need a stronger social safety net, not just in health care and unemployment benefits, but in retirement as well.
 Economists say there are advantages to reducing the financial risk for individuals. Pooling investments, in some cases, allows workers to switch jobs more easily and helps lower fees associated with investment decisions, for example. 
 Alternatives include creating incentives for saving and for less risky investments through tax laws or other regulations. The Obama administration has proposed an opt-out retirement savings system, for example. And even before the crisis, some states developed plans for pooling private savings into voluntary, portable retirement accounts. 
 Though their pension systems may be strained, people in many countries with stronger safety nets are still exiting the labor force in lockstep despite the global recession. Last year in the United States, almost a third of people ages 65 to 69 were still in the labor force; in France, just 4 percent of people this age were still working or looking for work.
 After all, Europe isn't just the land of ''socialized'' medicine. It is also the land of ''socialized'' retirement plans, and like other automatic stabilizers, pensions help cushion the blow of an economic crisis.
 Retirement income typically comes from a combination of three buckets: state pensions, corporate pensions and individual arrangements. In many other industrialized countries, that first bucket -- state pensions -- supports a large amount of retirees' income.
 The typical American receives just 45 percent of his preretirement wage through Social Security, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. By contrast, a worker in Denmark, which has one of the most comprehensive and generous retirement arrangements in the world, can retire with a state pension that is 91 percent of his salary. 
 ''The financial crisis hasn't affected me,'' says Jens Erik Soerensen, a 63-year-old in Hellerup, Denmark, who works as a researcher at Chempilots, a Danish company that develops polymers for use in the medical device industry. 
 Mr. Soerensen has calculated that when he retires, the combined disposable income that he has with his wife (Lone, also 63, who retired this year from her job in TV production) will fall by about 20 percent. The couple will also continue to benefit from universal health coverage.
 ''I think we can survive without changing our lifestyle, at least until 75,'' he said. After that, he might have to dip into personal savings.
 Of course, such a system comes with tradeoffs. To help pay for generous state pensions, Danish workers have one of the highest tax burdens. The population is also aging, meaning that there will be fewer working people to pay for the pensions and care of a graying society. 
 In response, some nations have been trying to encourage people to stay at work longer. In France, suggestions to raise the retirement age above its current level of 60 have met fierce opposition from unions, although the government intends to push ahead. Britain has had a bit more success, announcing plans to raise the retirement age to 68, from 65 -- in 2044. 
 Along with raising the retirement age, some European countries have been shifting more financial risk to individuals. 
 In the United States, where the practice is decades old, the question is whether people can be freed from making their own financial decisions, an act they may not feel qualified to do and may not want to do.
 One study found that nearly a quarter of Americans ages 56 to 64 had more than 90 percent of their 401(k) balances invested in stocks instead of bonds, against financial advisers' standard advice for people nearing retirement age.
 ''Employees are just not capable of making these decisions,'' said Rick K. Shapiro, a member of the army of financial planning professionals that America's private retirement system (and private health care and college education financing systems) has spawned. ''Maybe they can learn, but they're distracted, and they're not incented to learn until the thing blows up.''
 Even conscientious investors -- like the Petruccis, who keep an updated spreadsheet of their investments -- lose money. 
 ''We thought we were conservative,'' said Mr. Petrucci, noting that he and his wife lost about 35 percent of their life savings in the crisis and have made only a little of it back. 
 Still, the American preference for self-reliance, instead of more socialized financial protections, remains strong, even among those who lost big. 
 ''I don't want to depend on anybody else in my retirement,'' Mr. Petrucci said. ''Not family members, not our children, and certainly not the government, for that matter.''

HEADLINE: Other Countries Looking for Signs From India and U.S. as Trade Talks Resume

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and VIKAS BAJAJ. 
Stephen Castle reported from Brussels and Vikas Bajaj from New Delhi.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
As stalled global trade talks resume Thursday, the world will look to the two countries most responsible for their acrimonious collapse last year -- the United States and India -- to lead negotiators in striking a deal that is palatable to both developed and developing countries. 
 While there are signs that the host of this week's session, India, has become more willing to bargain, negotiators are still trying to determine whether the administration of President Obama is even paying attention yet. 
 Two days of talks are not expected to produce a breakthrough. Even the optimistic forecast for the long-running negotiations, known as the Doha Development Round, does not foresee any agreement until the end of next year.
 But negotiators say they hope discussions on Thursday and Friday will send a signal to this month's Group of 20 industrial and emerging nations meeting in Pittsburgh and provide some idea of what concessions the United States needs to sell a trade agreement back home.
 That the talks are taking place in New Delhi -- with a new Indian trade minister, Anand Sharma, as host -- is significant in itself.
 The Indians are ''sending a very strong signal internally and externally'' of their commitment, said Catherine Ashton, the European trade commissioner, who negotiates for the 27 countries in the European Union. 
 During an interview Tuesday night, before leaving for India, she said that Mr. Sharma ''would not be doing it lightly.'' 
 For India, this meeting provides an opportunity to recast itself as a proponent for the Doha talks after earning a reputation last year as an obstructionist.
 Trade ministers from the rest of the world often complained, in private, that India's former trade minister, Kamal Nath, was brusque, impatient and unwilling to engage in detailed negotiations to find compromises. Mr. Nath, who represents a largely rural constituency in Parliament, is now in charge of the ministry for roads and surface transport.
 Analysts in New Delhi say Mr. Sharma, who has previously served as a spokesman for the Congress Party and in the Foreign Ministry, has both domestic political influence and an appreciation for the art of diplomacy.
 ''Personalities clearly matter in driving this debate,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, who has advised the Indian government on economic issues. ''Having a different person than Kamal Nath might change the contours of the debate.''
 Still, Mr. Prasad and other analysts say the personnel change will most likely not be enough to substantially alter India's position on many issues like agriculture.
 While acknowledging that India still had its problems, Ms. Ashton highlighted the difficulties facing Ron Kirk, the new United States trade representative.
 ''We all know Ron has very little domestic lobby support for the Doha round,'' she said. ''There is a sense in which this belonged to the previous administration, and there is not a strong lobby in favor.'' 
 What was needed, she said, was an ''Obamaization'' of Doha -- ''making it feel that this is a deal that this administration and this president feels comfortable with.'' 
 In Europe, policy makers fret that trade is low on the agenda of an administration that is expending political capital on other fronts.
 ''The big issues are health care and climate change,'' Ms. Ashton said. ''It is hard when you have big issues domestically to add in more issues.'' 
 Diplomats also point to the failure of the White House to fill all the positions in Mr. Kirk's team, including that of ambassador to the World Trade Organization in Geneva.
 ''I don't see that the Obama administration has the energy at this time or the political interest at this time in pushing a trade agenda, when they need it on health care,'' said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
 The Doha Development Round began in November 2001. A deal would involve rich countries' opening their markets for farm produce and cutting subsidies for agriculture. In return, the wealthier developing countries, like India and Brazil, would cut industrial tariffs. Advocates say that would help lift poorer countries out of poverty by increasing global trade.
 But last year, talks foundered on the right of India and other developing countries to protect vulnerable agricultural products from competition in the event of a surge of imports. The United States argued that this would mean moving backward on current commitments.
 Since the collapse of those talks, the landscape has been transformed by the global financial and economic crisis.
 Joseph Francois, a fellow at the Center for Economic Policy Research and professor of Economics at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, argued that the ''depth of the recession and the collapse of trade has focused people's minds, and there is perhaps more enthusiasm for sending a positive message'' on the Doha round. 
 But he also said the recession might strengthen the hand of labor unions in the West, which usually are critical of free-trade deals. ''Domestic politics matter, and it's going to be hard,'' he said. ''It has to look like Obama comes away with something.'' 
 Speaking during a conference call with journalists on Tuesday, Mr. Kirk did not avoid the difficulty of selling Doha in the United States.
 ''Those who believe in trade,'' he said, ''have to articulate our policy in a way the American public understands and feels comfortable with.'' 
 Peter F. Allgeier, a former United States ambassador to the W.T.O., said American negotiators were pushing for more detailed concessions because they had to get a better deal for exporters to persuade lawmakers in Washington to reduce farm subsidies.

Ominous Signals
 From Bonds Data 
 The worst is over. At least until about a week ago, that was what most investors seemed to be thinking. Prices and hopes were rising with almost every statistical release and earnings report. But one important market has been stuck in a gloomier mood. 
 Government bond yields have fallen significantly in the last month or so: to 3.4 percent, from 3.9 percent, on 10-year notes in the United States; to 3.2 percent, from 3.7 percent, in the euro zone; and to 3.6 percent, from 4 percent, in Britain. That sort of decline sits uneasily with rising economic optimism. 
 Why? There are several theories. 
 One is the expectation of deflation or something like it. Japanese consumer prices are the same now as they were in 1993, when its financial bubble had fully burst. Even if future Western gross domestic product growth proves stronger than it has been in Japan -- an annual rate of 0.6 percent from 1993 to before the latest recession -- financial pressure could keep retail prices from rising. In that environment, a risk-free interest rate of 3 to 4 percent doesn't sound too bad. 
 Another explanation is more mechanical. Thanks to the ''nearly free money'' programs of central banks around the world, including some purchases of government-backed securities, there may be more buying power in the markets than can be absorbed by a record supply of new government debt, forcing prices up and yields down.
 Finally, there is the dark future theory. Bond buyers may think investors in other markets, principally the stock exchanges, have misread the economic data. What looks like a recovery could actually be an inventory correction that will be followed by another recession. Therefore, government bonds would represent a safe haven. 
 Whatever is actually moving bond investors to push down yields, one thing is clear. If they are right, the world's financial woes are unlikely to be over. Either flat consumer prices or a new recession would make more loans go bad, straining bank and government balance sheets. Conversely, if excess money is piling up, the funds could easily push up other prices, creating another asset price bubble or a bout of uncomfortable inflation. 
 The bond market may be hard to read, but none of its signals look to be telling a happy story.
 The Register Shrugged
 Is libertarianism's flag-bearer about to become a welfare queen? The collapse of the media chain Freedom Communications, named in honor of the philosophy that its founder championed, makes it appear so. The sanctity of private contracts was an important tenet of its late founder, R. C. Hoiles. Filing for protection from creditors appears to fly in the face of all he stood for. 
 The owner of The Orange County Register of California and more than 100 other publications and television stations filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after agreeing with lenders on a plan to restructure its $771 million in debt after its cash flow fell about 75 percent over the last five years. 
 Up until now, the company was run by Mr. Hoiles's heirs, who sought to uphold his fiery advocacy of libertarianism. But control will now pass to its lenders. Mr. Hoiles, who died in 1970, was an ardent fan of Ayn Rand and inspired free-marketeers like Alan Greenspan and Barry Goldwater. His successors even held seminars in the philosophy for Freedom's employees. 
 Mr. Hoiles's belief in limited government and individual responsibility informed his paper's editorial policies through the New Deal and Great Society programs he opposed. But Freedom was caught out more recently by the precipitous industrywide decline in advertising revenue. 
 Squaring libertarians' belief in individual responsibility and the sanctity of private contracts with a bankruptcy filing isn't easy. But lenders willingly, if implicitly, assume some credit risk by charging more for debt that falls further back in the payoff queue should a default occur. If the bankruptcy court divides the spoils accordingly, the sanctity of the contracts could be viewed as intact. 
 The intellectually unforgiving Mr. Hoiles would probably have little patience for such hairsplitting. But it might give his offspring some comfort.

HEADLINE: For the Stressed Business Owner, a Range of Pursuits to Revive the Spirit

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

 BODY:
For Diane Slovak, a builder in Connecticut, trapshooting is a way to relieve the relentless stress of running her 21-year-old business in a tough economy. For Bruce Woolf, owner of Quaker Road Associates, a home construction and renovation company in Chappaqua, N.Y., it is a monthly poker game. Doug Holzworth, a self-employed technical writer in Raleigh, N.C., fences on his driveway. 
 For many small business owners and employees, certainly builders and others in the construction trades, these are difficult times. With restricted access to credit, consumers and businesses are canceling or postponing major projects and purchases. That means the owners have to work extra hard to keep their businesses going. And the longer the downturn lasts, the bigger the toll it takes on their well-being. 
 That is why Ms. Slovak says she needs to sneak away from one of her construction sites occasionally to a nearby shooting range. 
 ''Getting out to the trap field and focusing on a little clay pigeon that is six inches in diameter going 40 miles per hour is the best therapy,'' said Ms. Slovak of Georgetown, Conn. 
 ''You're not thinking about anything else, and when I come out of there I feel refreshed,'' she said. ''I shoot 50 to 100 rounds just to clear my head and put a smile on my face. Then I can go back ready to deal with any situation.''
 Mr. Woolf, who has had to dismiss 5 of his 10 full-time employees and has lost 40 percent of his workload, looks forward to his monthly poker game. The games, his custom for 25 years, are with eight close friends ages 40 to 60, several of whom also run small businesses, including a bicycle shop and an advertising agency.
 ''It's just so much fun,'' he said. ''For five or six hours on a Friday evening, we more or less totally forget about the world. It's really helpful.'' 
 So, too, he concedes somewhat sheepishly, is faithfully watching ''American Idol'' with his two daughters, ages 8 and 10. ''It's really relaxing and fun family time.''
 Given the many challenges of running a business in a recession, ''it's a life-and-death issue'' to monitor and mitigate the effects of work-related anxiety, said Dr. Carol Scott, an emergency room physician who also helps business owners and their employees manage stress.
 Small-business owners, many of them motivated high achievers, tend to neglect their own health in the scramble to find and retain clients, she said. ''You'll cancel that doctor's appointment and stop going to the gym,'' she said. ''Suddenly you'll just collapse and wonder why.'' 
 Her suggestion for dealing with stress is to walk briskly for 30 minutes every day, even in three 10-minute segments.
 Lee Sellenraad, director of project development at Barton Malow, a commercial construction company in Ann Arbor, Mich., said his sense of history calms him. His company, with 1,700 employees, works nationwide only on commercial projects worth more than $10 million. While some sectors -- like power plant construction -- are booming, others are not. Mr. Sellenraad said he had survived tougher times when, in 2004, he went an entire year without an income. 
 ''My father grew up in the Netherlands in World War II, and my mother was Dutch,'' he said. ''They were used to a life of hiding, escaping the Germans, living on tulip bulbs. Their experience gives me some perspective.''
 To relax, Mr. Sellenraad said, he watches his 18-year-old son play varsity baseball, walks his neighborhood with his wife and works out at the gym as a body builder. 
 Mr. Holzworth, 51, the technical writer, said fencing is his balm, and his driveway is his fencing strip. ''We've had crowds,'' he said. ''Police cars have driven past the house slowly.'' Being thought the neighborhood eccentric for his public swordplay does not diminish his enjoyment.
 ''Fencing is incredibly physically demanding,'' he said. ''Any anxiety, stress or nervous tension that's built up during the week just burns away with the first clash of blades. When I'm done, I'm exhausted but grounded.''
 Mr. Holzworth said he also plays chess one evening a week. ''I find it very calming to be able to focus on a specific, well-structured challenge,'' he said. ''That, plus a glass of wine, makes a perfect evening.''
 Working at The Greenbrier resort, in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., for 11 years meant many months of bad news, said Lynn Swann, its director of public relations. From 2003 to 2009, the luxury resort, which dates from 1778, lost $90 million. It is the largest employer, with 1,300 jobs, in a town of 2,000 and a county of 35,000 with few other opportunities. 
 The resort filed for bankruptcy protection in March but was sold in May to Jim Justice, a prominent West Virginia businessman. Under Mr. Justice, the resort has begun construction of an underground gambling complex and is opening an additional restaurant on Oct. 1.
 The mood is more optimistic now, Ms. Swann said. But in the darkest days, ''I just wanted to crawl into a hole,'' she said. To manage her stress, Ms. Swann has tried everything: the soothing music of the Swiss harpist Andreas Vollenweider, reading thrillers, aromatherapy in her office, weekly papaya facial masks and plastering her office walls with inspirational quotations. Her 8-year-old daughter, she added, gives great hand massages.
 The emotional support of family members and friends -- kind, calm, familiar and solid -- is crucial, small-business owners agreed.
 Michael Cohen, founder and chief executive of the Santa Barbara Adventure Company, an 11-year-old business that offers kayaking, bicycling and other activities, has had a 10 to 15 percent decline in revenue and a huge jump recently in the number of competitors undercutting his prices. The school and corporate groups he relies on for business are cutting back, while six full-time and seven part-time employees rely on him.
 To relieve stress, his staff takes 10-mile hikes and long bike trips, he said. Mr. Cohen goes surfing, or straps on his 9-month-old son to take his 3-year-old for a hike to a local creek. ''I've always relied on nature as a stress reliever,'' he said. 
 For Stacey Lund, already stuck behind the wheel of her sport utility vehicle for a two-hour daily commute to work from upstate New York, doughnuts and coffee do the trick. Ms. Lund relies on Tim Hortons, a Canadian chain with 536 stores in 11 states in the United States, for the comfort of something easy, familiar and affordable. 
 She said she realized that if the doughnuts offered her comfort, they might do the same for others. So as she drives across northern New York selling advertising for Entercom Communications to seven local radio stations, she makes sure to bring a box.
 ''Our business is very relationship-based,'' she said. ''Clients are pulling back their spending, and they have tons of other media reps calling on them. But as soon as they see I have a bag or box of goodies, their eyes light up.''

HEADLINE: BP Reports Finding Giant Oil Field Miles Below Floor of Gulf of Mexico

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
BP announced on Wednesday the discovery of what it characterized as a giant oil field several miles under the Gulf of Mexico, but it may take years to assess how much crude can actually be recovered.
 The discovery should have no immediate effect on world oil or gasoline prices because it could take three years or more to begin extracting oil. Because the oil is so deep underwater and difficult to extract, the price of oil will need to be above $70 a barrel to make drilling profitable, energy analysts said. 
 Nevertheless, the discovery was another indication that the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico are probably the most promising area in United States-controlled territory to bolster domestic oil production. The rise in gulf production in recent years, in large part because of BP's deep-water giant Thunder Horse field, has stabilized domestic production after almost two decades of yearly declines. 
 ''This is big,'' said Chris Ruppel, a senior energy analyst at Execution L.L.C., a London investment bank. ''It says we're seeing that improved technology is unlocking resources that were before either undiscovered or too costly to exploit because of economics.''
 The discovery, called the Tiber well, is about 250 miles southeast of Houston at a depth of more than 35,000 feet -- greater than the height of Mount Everest -- and well below the gulf floor. 
 It is part of a new frontier of exploration where oil companies are spending billions of dollars to find oil on the bottom of seas off the shores of Brazil and West Africa and boring through miles of rock, salt and packed sands.
 The discoveries have been made possible by leaps in development of offshore drilling technology, computers and three-dimensional imaging that can pinpoint where the best reserves lie, and advanced mooring equipment to stabilize platforms in deep waters. BP officials say the oil and gas in the field is extremely hot and under intense pressure, requiring advanced well heads with thick steel and heavy insulation.
 BP declined to estimate the size of the new reserve, but a company executive said that it could be bigger than the three billion barrels of oil equivalent, combining oil and gas stocks, thought to be in the recently discovered Kaskida field nearby. As the largest oil and gas producer in the gulf, BP produces 400,000 barrels a day. It has reserves of 18 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves globally. 
 Energy analysts say recovery rates can range widely, but that at least one billion barrels could be recoverable. 
 Fadel Gheit, a senior oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, said the new find means BP is ''gaining momentum over the rest of the guys'' in the gulf, and would reduce production costs in the adjacent Kaskida field since equipment could be shared in the two fields. He added, ''The gulf is where the action is and will remain the oil future for the United States.'' 
 BP said the well would be one of the deepest ever drilled by an oil company. The company will operate the well with a 62 percent interest. Petrobras and ConocoPhillips have also invested in the project. 
 ''The information we have gathered thus far is encouraging,'' a BP spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said, adding that one well has already been drilled in the area. ''But appraisal work will be required before we know the field's size and determine how it should be developed. It's the next wave of development of the ultra-deep-water Gulf of Mexico.''
 The Tiber well, along with the Kaskida discovery in 2006, ''support the continuing growth of our deep-water Gulf of Mexico business into the second half of the next decade,'' Andy Inglis, BP's chief executive for exploration and production, said in a statement.
 The Gulf of Mexico accounts for about a quarter of the nation's oil production, and that percentage could rise even though many shallow-water wells are tapping out. 
 But the gulf is also a treacherous place to rely on oil because of hurricanes, which have been particularly fierce in recent years. Last year, the hurricanes Gustav and Ike shut down wells, damaged pipelines and forced companies to evacuate workers from production platforms for weeks, for an estimated loss of 63 million barrels of production.
 Deep-water drilling in the gulf has produced some major challenges and delays. BP's Thunder Horse platform, the biggest in the gulf, which produces 300,000 barrels a day, was first drilled in 1999 but did not begin to produce for a decade because of a series of engineering problems.

HEADLINE: Despite Global Recession, A Polish City Is Thriving

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: LODZ, Poland 

 BODY:
In the 19th century, the Polish novelist Wladyslaw Reymont titled his masterpiece about Lodz ''The Promised Land'' because the city attracted people from throughout Central Europe to work in its booming textile mills.
 These days, the industries have changed, but something similar is happening again, helping Poland to escape the searing global recession.
 With multinationals like Procter & Gamble, Dell and ABB leading a wave of foreign investment, cities like Lodz, in central Poland, are experiencing relative booms. Poles who left the country in search of work years ago are trickling back.
 As its peers in Central and Eastern Europe face a very rough year, Poland is emerging as the one economy in the region that has the heft to withstand a vicious downturn. And it just may end up being the one economy in Europe that avoids an outright contraction in 2009. 
 One of the most flourishing corners of Lodz is a vast former textile factory that is now a complex of stores, restaurants and even a beach volleyball court. The brisk business at the site, known as Manufaktura, illustrates how far Poland is removed from the searing experiences of Latvia or Hungary, not to mention London or New York.
 ''Maybe without the crisis, business would be better,'' said Slawomir Murawski, the director of Manufaktura. ''But who knows?''
 Poland has the advantage of being preoccupied with itself these days. Because it sells far less to the rest of the world than its neighbors, Poland is shielded from the vicissitudes of the global economy, while reaping its benefits, reflecting a wave of foreign investment. That, in turn, has helped keep its labor market strong at a time when many Europeans fear for their jobs.
 The government reported Friday that Poland's economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the second quarter, bolstered by exports, construction and services.
 Growth in gross domestic product was well above the 0.5 percent expected by analysts, as well as the first quarter's 0.8 percent annual rate of growth. 
 ''We're the only country in the whole European Union that has such good growth, and we've come here to brag,'' Prime Minister Donald Tusk said at a news conference in Warsaw, Bloomberg News reported. ''Poland is the E.U.'s undisputed growth leader.''
 At the beginning of the year, Poland suffered along with other emerging markets as investors pulled their money out en masse.
 To the immense frustration of Polish business, however, the picture of the region for outsiders has been dominated by countries like Hungary, Latvia, Serbia and Ukraine, whose crushing debt loads drove them into the arms of the International Monetary Fund.
 For Poland, a relatively light borrower, the crisis created a riptide in the form of a fast-depreciating currency, the zloty. That hurt some companies, namely those that had carefully hedged themselves against a rising currency, which was the previous year's problem. But Polish banks, keen to avoid driving their clients into bankruptcy, refinanced the hedges to reflect the new reality.
 ''In retrospect, the crisis proved manageable in Poland,'' said Ryszard Petru, chief economist at BRE Bank in Warsaw. ''But it was hard to know at the time.''
 The zloty plunged 27 percent against the euro in the six months ended in March. It has since risen more than 13 percent.
 Poland has landed more softly than its neighbors because its economy is far less dependent on exports than other Central European countries, where exports can approach 90 percent of the gross domestic product.
 Poland, a nation of 38 million people, lives far more from domestic demand, and that depends on a stable labor market.
 Mr. Petru predicts that unemployment will rise to 9.9 percent by the end of 2009, from 7.1 percent, but that is about even with the European Union average. And it masks some pockets of strong growth; the jobless rate is 2 percent in Warsaw, and about 8 percent in Lodz, or less than half what it was five years ago.
 One reason for the surprise in Lodz is clearly the influx of foreign investment.
 Procter & Gamble has one factory in Lodz and is opening another this fall. Fujitsu, the Japanese computer company, opened a service center in the city this year. Others include Infosys Technologies, the Indian information technology firm; ABB, the Swiss manufacturer of infrastructure equipment; and TNT, a Dutch logistics firm.
 Even after the shock of last September, when the bankruptcy of the investment house Lehman Brothers sent global business into free fall, ''companies in Lodz kept searching for labor,'' said Piotr Broncher, the Lodz regional director for Manpower, a provider of temporary employees. ''I was surprised. Everybody was surprised.''
 Manpower will probably find jobs for 1,200 people in the Lodz area this year, down slightly from 1,500 in 2008.
 Dell, the computer maker, made the investment that truly electrified Lodz. In January, Michael S. Dell, the company's founder and chief executive, officially opened a 400,000-square-foot plant that will handle logistics and assemble computers, particularly for customers from Central and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. Over the next three years, it will employ up to 3,000 people.
 In a symbolic shift, Dell moved operations to Lodz from Limerick, Ireland. Ireland has protested the 52.7 million euros in subsidies that Dell got from the Polish government, but Dell cited the skilled work force in Lodz and proximity to growing markets as the reasons for its move.
 The Irish boom, now possibly the worst bust in Europe, attracted many Poles, who worked with Dell there and are now finding their way home.
 ''We even have some workers in Lodz who have come from our Limerick, Ireland, factory and who are very happy to have come back to help set up this one,'' Mr. Dell said at the opening in January.
 Tomasz Rybinski, 30, was among those Poles who left the country after it joined the European Union in 2004. He found work in Britain, which was booming and where he spent three years mixing salads, moving boxes in a warehouse and then, finally, working in a factory that made industrial refrigerators.
 Rumors this year that layoffs were in the works were enough to convince Mr. Rybinski that the possibilities in his native Lodz trumped what had by then become a shattered British economy. After taking some time off, he found a job quickly. He recently started work in a factory that produces monitor and computer parts as an operator of a machine that molds plastic into specific shapes.
 Financially, Mr. Rybinski said he would earn about the same monthly pay, the equivalent of about $500, that he earned in Britain.
 The turnaround in Lodz has been startling for a municipality whose population was still declining as recently as three years ago.
 Mr. Murawski, the director of Manufaktura, said his business benefited from that growth. But one multinational on the horizon might be less welcome for his operation, which combines shopping, eating and entertainment for children.
 This autumn, the Swedish retailer Ikea will open its own complex in Lodz, employing much the same strategy: bring them in to shop, but amuse them as well.
 ''That is likely to affect us much more than the crisis,'' Mr. Murawski said. ''It is something concrete.''

HEADLINE: In Rating Schools, New York Hands Out Mostly A's and B's

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA and ROBERT GEBELOFF

 BODY:
The news could have been cause for a huge celebration: a whopping 97 percent of New York's elementary and middle schools earning an A or B on the city's annual report card. Yet Chancellor Joel I. Klein was tempered in his praise, careful to say that the high marks did not necessarily mean that the city was filled with excellent schools. 
 ''We want to make clear that that means that they met their progress targets,'' Mr. Klein said, a tad defensively, at a news conference at Public School 189 in Washington Heights on Wednesday. ''Not by any stretch of the imagination that those schools don't have a lot of improvement ahead of them.'' 
 At the same time, when asked if there was something wrong with a grading system in which nearly every school earned top marks -- 889 of the 1,058 graded schools got A's, and just two received F's -- he clearly took pride in the results. ''If you're asking whether I would rather see less A's,'' he said, ''the answer is no.'' 
 Last year, 38 percent of elementary and middle schools got A's and 41 percent B's; in 2007, the first year that schools were graded, 23 percent earned an A and 38 percent a B. 
 Suddenly, New York City looks like Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average -- or like the Ivy League, noted for grade inflation that makes, say, a B-minus seem like the new F.
 More than half the schools that received grades on Wednesday -- 550 of them -- did better this year than last year. Another 438 received the same marks; the vast majority already had A's. Forty schools saw their grades fall. 
 The grades -- which are designed to give parents a clear idea of how well a school is teaching their children, and are also used to help determine bonuses for principals and teachers -- have become one of the most contentious policies of Mr. Klein's tenure. They are primarily based on how much student test scores at each school improve from one year to the next, and rely heavily on comparing schools that have similar demographics. 
 The system uses a blunt letter grade to call attention to which schools are doing well and which are not. But on Wednesday, Mr. Klein urged parents to dig deeper, to look at the factors and underlying numbers used in the complicated formula that determines the grades. And he emphasized that the results did not necessarily mean that 97 percent of the schools were doing well. 
 The Bloomberg administration has made accountability the touchstone of its efforts to overhaul city schools. When the mayor and chancellor first released the reports in 2007, they said the grades would be vital in determining if a low-performing school should be closed. In the last two years, Mr. Klein has announced that he would close 28 schools, and he has tried to remove principals from other low-performing schools. 
 All of the schools that received F's last year and remained open received A's or B's this year. Of the schools that received D's last year, none earned lower than a C this year. And of the 393 schools that received A's last year, only three dropped below a B. 
 The United Federation of Teachers and a group of parents sued the Department of Education last year to block the closing of two schools in Harlem, Public Schools 194 and 241, and one in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, P.S. 150. All three earned A's this year. 
 Asked if that meant there was something wrong with the closing process or with the grading system, Mr. Klein again grew defensive.
 ''I think there's nothing wrong with anything,'' he said. ''I know we need to find something wrong here, but there's nothing wrong with anything. That is to say those schools -- and this is not atypical -- made progress this year. That's what the progress report reflects.'' 
 He said that when moving to close failing schools, the city considered other factors, such as student enrollment and whether parents were applying in large numbers to the school. 
 Two charter schools run by Harlem Children's Zone that have been praised by Mr. Klein, as well as by President Obama, received B's this year. 
 Geoffrey Canada, the president of Harlem Children's Zone and a loyal ally of the Bloomberg administration, said the report cards helped show administrators and teachers where they needed to improve, but he questioned whether they made much sense to most parents. 
 ''I think they can be slightly misleading if they are taken at face value,'' Mr. Canada said. ''If you're at a school where things are improving, you should feel good about that, but there are a lot of schools where you could have done really, really good last year, and just really good this year and you're getting a lower grade. So it's tricky.'' 
 Dozens of school districts from cities all over the country and as far away as Australia have worked with Education Department officials to replicate the grading system. 
 Daniel Koretz, a professor who focuses on testing and accountability issues at the Harvard School of Education, said it was hard to come to any clear conclusions about schools or the system by looking at the grades. It is even harder, he added, because so many questions have been raised about whether the state's math and reading tests had become easier in recent years. 
 ''The agnostics are right: We just don't know what's going on right now,'' he said. ''The problem is we are stuck with this. We really have no second measure.''

HEADLINE: Fresh From Its Victory, Japanese Party Shows Its New Muscle

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Moving quickly to fulfill an election promise, Japan's newly victorious Democratic Party has begun its battle to rein in the nation's powerful bureaucracy by challenging a seemingly mundane appointment at the consumer affairs agency.
 The unusually heated fight began on Tuesday, when Japan's lame-duck prime minister, Taro Aso, whose long-governing Liberal Democratic Party was routed in Sunday's election, ignored Democratic objections to appoint a retired Land Ministry official.
 The Democrats immediately criticized Mr. Aso for rushing to fill the post with a former bureaucrat, a common practice here that has allowed Tokyo's central ministries to exert broad influence over government. On Wednesday, the national daily Asahi Shimbun quoted a top party official, Tetsuro Fukuyama, as saying that the Democrats may reverse the appointment when they formally take power later this month. 
 Controlling the bureaucracy was the signature campaign pledge of the Democrats, and one that found overwhelming support among voters fed up with the nation's insider-driven politics. But many former bureaucrats and political analysts are doubtful that the Democrats, as the inexperienced former opposition party, can make much headway against a force that has run this country for decades.
 ''I wish the Democratic Party the best of luck,'' said Hiro Kishi, a professor of public policy at Tokyo's Keio University, a former Trade Ministry bureaucrat who has himself battled bureaucrats. ''But I am afraid that they will fail.''
 If so, they will not be the first to battle in vain against the elite career officials at the nation's central ministries, who write the laws and divvy up government budgets in backroom negotiations.
 For most of their postwar rule of Japan, the Liberal Democrats were content to let the bureaucracy steer the nation, which they did spectacularly well during the economic miracle. But recent prime ministers have tried to curtail the bureaucracy's powers after corruption scandals and a failure to end the nation's long stagnation made it the target of growing populist ire. 
 This anger helped drive Sunday's landslide victory by the Democrats. But while the Democrats may win some high-profile battles like the one this week, political analysts and former bureaucrats warn that they may end up losing the war. 
 For one, they say, the bureaucrats have an overwhelming advantage in experience and know-how, from running the nation literally for generations. 
 Of the 308 Democrats elected on Sunday, 143 are first-time lawmakers; of the rest, only a handful have ever held a cabinet post. What is more, they have few outside sources of help. Japan does not have the United States' vast number of research groups with their legions of policy experts. And unlike on Capitol Hill, Japanese lawmakers also lack the large staff of aides knowledgeable on policy issues.
 This makes it hard for lawmakers to shake their dependence on bureaucrats, who are often the only people who know where in the stacks of paperwork to find important information, and how to navigate laws and regulations to get things done.
 This greater experience also extends to the techniques of political combat, say political experts and former bureaucrats. 
 Mr. Kishi, the professor, said that when he was as an adviser in the government of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, a reformist, bureaucrats in the Financial Services Agency did everything they could to block efforts to force banks to undertake an expensive bad-loan cleanup.
 He said officials hid information, went behind his back to lobby sympathetic lawmakers and even leaked damaging stories to the press.
 ''They tried their best to stop us,'' Mr. Kishi said. ''They'll fight much harder against the Democrats'' since their own interests are at stake. 
 The Democrats have vowed to shift key powers, including drawing up national budgets and filling top bureaucratic posts, into a new National Strategy Agency, which will answer to the prime minister. The party also promised to shrink the number of career bureaucrats and to bar retired ministry officials from taking comfortable jobs in government or the private sector, a practice known as ''amakudari,'' or ''descent from heaven.''
 In the weeks before Sunday's election, ministries rushed to fill amakudari spots ahead of the widely forecast Democratic victory. The Land Ministry, which manages public works, put a retiring official in charge of Japan's housing finance agency, while a retiring Education Ministry bureaucrat became an executive director at the Tokyo National Museum.
 This angered Democrats, setting the stage for this week's fight. On Monday, the Democratic leader and presumptive next prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, signaled his displeasure at Mr. Aso's plans to name a former bureaucrat to fill the top job at the newly created consumer agency.
 ''Given that the Democratic Party is going to take over government, why rush to establish the agency and make personnel appointments?'' Mr. Hatoyama asked reporters.
 Mr. Aso went ahead anyway the following day with appointing Shunichi Uchida, who also served as a vice minister in the Cabinet Office. When Mr. Fukuyama responded by threatening to remove Mr. Uchida, major Japanese newspapers pronounced the dispute the first battle between politicians and bureaucrats.
 The fight seems to have fed a growing mood of bureaucrat-bashing. Besides Mr. Uchida, several ministry officials who long worked behind the scenes have suddenly come under unheard of public scrutiny. Newspapers have begun criticizing top bureaucrats by name, while television news programs show footage of them humbly ascending Nagatacho, Japan's Capitol Hill, to answer the summons of Democratic lawmakers.
 Still, in the end, political analysts and former bureaucrats say, the Democrats may be forced to quietly make peace with the bureaucracy, to get its help in achieving other parts of their agenda -- like strengthening Japan's social safety net and cutting wasteful spending -- to show voters before upper house elections next July. 
 The Democrats already seem to be toning down their rhetoric. Mr. Hatoyama no longer says he will fire every bureaucrat above the level of agency chief, as he first vowed in February. On Monday, he even backed away from his party's campaign slogan, which called for a ''post bureaucrat'' Japan, saying that what he meant was getting beyond an over-reliance on bureaucrats.
 ''The Liberal Democrats needed the bureaucracy to run the country,'' said Masayasu Murakami, a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat who is now executive director of the Japan Forum on International Relations, a Japanese research group. ''The Democrats will realize they need the bureaucracy, too.''

HEADLINE: Dubai Superheroes: Little Old Grannies Who Wear Veils

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
Ramadan is a holy month of praying and fasting, and for television executives it is also the Middle Eastern equivalent of sweeps month. 
 With ample time for family television viewing, pan-Arab channels save their best shows for Ramadan and schedule new episodes each evening. In recent years none of the offerings have captured the collective imagination in quite the same way as ''Freej,'' the region's first 3-D animated series.
 The show finds humor along the dominant fault line of this city: the tension between old and new. Set in Dubai, where camel races are conducted mere miles from the base of the world's tallest building, the series focuses on four secluded and sometimes stubborn grandmothers.
 Its creator, the 31-year-old Mohammed Saeed Harib, is now following a path well worn by the creators of ''The Simpsons,'' ''South Park'' and other influential cartoons. He is trying to expand ''Freej'' into a worldwide brand while maintaining its popularity here in Dubai, where viewers adore the four grandmothers who star in the 15-minute episodes. But the recession is not making it easy. 
 ''Freej,'' which swiftly became one of the most popular shows in the United Arab Emirates when it had its premiere here three years ago, is on a hiatus this Ramadan season, a result of the declining economy and, Mr. Harib says, his exhaustion after three grueling production cycles. In its place a new series of three-minute episodes starring the characters is being shown on local television. 
 Mr. Harib's animated aspirations took shape a decade ago when he studied at Northeastern University in Boston, where his peers downloaded ''South Park'' episodes in their dormitories. He recognized that his native emirate lacked homegrown characters and superheroes.
 ''We don't come from a land that has a lot of role models, except for C.E.O.'s and sheiks,'' he said in an interview at his loft studio near the man-made island called Palm Jumeirah.
 At Northeastern Mr. Harib started to sketch his first character, later named Um Saeed, a wise, stubby lady in red who often leads the grandmas' conversations. The cartoon he envisioned would extol grandmas as role models. Mr. Harib said that he imagined that the veil that partly covered a woman's face would be the ''costume of the superhero.''
 A government fund for young businessmen helped finance the first season. Mr. Harib signed up Du, one of the region's cellular carriers, as a sponsor. Viewers in the region, who were largely unaccustomed to seeing animation in prime time, took to ''Freej'' as soon as it made its debut. Mr. Habib became a ''national icon,'' SAID Satish Mayya, the chief operating officer of the advertising planning agency BPG Media.
 Before long Mr. Harib was being praised as the Matt Groening and the Seth MacFarlane of the Middle East. These references to the creators of ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy'' are not lost on Mr. Harib, who noted that he was named to a local business publication's list of the world's 100 most influential Arabs.
 But the show never attempts the risque humor of American cartoon sitcoms. Instead it tackles hot topics like wedding traditions and bribery in a distinctly Arab way, sometimes merely hinting at issues. 
 Motioning straight ahead, Mr. Harib said, ''You can't go like this.'' He made a curve with his hand and said, ''You have to go like this.'' He joked that he could compare sexual behavior to the eating of an apple, but said that he hadn't written an episode about that yet.
 ''Freej'' stoked controversy in its first season with an episode that alluded to Islamic extremism. The episode was pulled from repeat broadcasts but still appeared on the DVD of that season.
 Sarah Al Jarman, the programming and acquisition manager for the English-language channel Dubai One, introduced a subtitled edition of ''Freej'' to give non-Arab viewers a glimpse at a locally created animated series.
 She said the episodes ''actually reflect many local old ladies'' in the Emirates, featuring their traditional dress, language and habits.
 Soon a second season, and then a third, was in production. By some estimates, half of the 1.4 million residents of Dubai tuned in for the second season. The show's popularity ''actually grew with time,'' Mr. Mayya said.
 Unlike series in the United States, where episodes are typically shown once a week, episodes of shows during Ramadan are shown five or seven days a week. Mr. Harib said the pace of production was exhausting. 
 Shortly after taking a sip from a ''Freej'' water bottle, Mr. Harib said he now had 400 lines of merchandise for ''Freej.'' ''I will not die a hungry man,'' he remarked. Plans for a board game were displayed in the office, near sets of ''Freej'' pens, tissue boxes, duffel bags and toys. And the third season will be released on DVD this month. But perhaps the most ambitious project, a theme park, appears to be postponed, given the recession.
 The next season of ''Freej'' also appears to be delayed. It is evident that Mr. Harib's beloved brand is at a crossroads, as the economic downturn has compounded the difficulties of producing a fourth season. The Gulf region lacks the Hollywood studio structure that can finance and support projects over time, but Mr. Harib said he hoped that he would secure new sponsors.
 Kicking off one of his sandals, he said his staff of 17, which includes a team of mostly female writers, will produce another season ''when we're ready for it now.''
 This month the three-minute spinoff episodes, titled ''Freej: Book of Riddles,'' have the grandmas under a curse after buying a dusty book at a souk. Each chapter of the book includes a puzzle, which viewers can try to solve by text-messaging answers to the television network.
 During Eid, the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the network will broadcast a new one-hour episode of ''Freej'' inspired by the crown prince of Dubai.
 ''He called up with an idea for an episode,'' said Mr. Harib, who expressed enthusiasm about this one-hour episode because it is the closest that his production company has come to his eventual goal of a ''Freej'' movie.
 To get there, he said his characters need to be dubbed into English. Already he has had one episode dubbed into Italian to woo a possible buyer in Italy. As for exposure in the United States, Mr. Harib said he had met with executives from Cartoon Network and Universal this summer. 
 If ''animation exports the cultural values of the nation,'' as Mr. Harib put it, then he said he wanted ''Freej'' to continue to represent his native Gulf state, even abroad.
 ''We are a minority in this country,'' Mr. Harib said, referring to the fact that expatriates make up most of Dubai's population. ''We really need to sustain who we are.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. May Be Vital to Obama In Afghan War

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Obama prepares to decide whether to send additional troops to Afghanistan, the political climate appears increasingly challenging for him, leaving him in the awkward position of relying on the Republican Party, and not his own, for support.
 The simple political narrative of the Afghanistan war -- that this was the good war, in which the United States would hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks -- has faded over time, with popular support ebbing, American casualties rising and confidence in the Afghan government declining. In addition, Afghanistan's disputed election, and the attendant fraud charges that have been lodged against President Hamid Karzai, are contributing further to the erosion of public support.
 A CBS News poll released on Tuesday reports that 41 percent of those polled wanted troop levels in Afghanistan decreased, compared with 33 percent in April. Far fewer people -- 25 percent -- wanted troop levels increased, compared with 39 percent in April. And Mr. Obama's approval rating for his handling of Afghanistan has dropped eight points since April, to 48 percent. 
 Congressional Democrats, particularly those on the left, report increasing disenchantment among constituents with the idea of a long and possibly escalating conflict in Afghanistan, especially as the American strategy comes to resemble a long-term nation-building approach rather than a counterterrorism operation.
 ''I and the American people cannot tolerate more troops without some commitment about when this perceived occupation will end,'' Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said Wednesday in an interview. He said he had been to 60 town hall meetings in his state so far this year. During the first half of the year, he said, there were no comments about Afghanistan or Iraq. But in the past two months, that has changed, with more people focused on troop losses in Afghanistan.
 Andrew J. Bacevich, a professor of international relations and history at Boston University, said, ''There was a time, back in 2003 and 2004, when it was possible to drum up popular support for the war by attaching to the argument claims that the United States of America was eliminating evil and advancing democracy and women's rights.
 ''But this is many years later, with the economy in shambles, 5,000 American soldiers dead in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those notions are no longer as compelling as they might have been. War exhaustion sets in,'' said Professor Bacevich, author of ''The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism.''
 Even one strain of conservative thinking has turned negative on the war. The syndicated columnist George F. Will wrote in a column published Tuesday that the United States should substantially reduce its presence in Afghanistan. 
 But despite Mr. Will's argument, national security hawks in the Republican Party -- not Mr. Obama's most natural support base -- still back the president on Afghanistan.
 ''So far, to their credit, they've either remained silent or they've been supportive, guys like McCain and Graham,'' said Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, a moderately left-wing think tank, referring to Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans. 
 At the moment, Mr. Obama appears to still have the support of Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House, including Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California. Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, indicated on Wednesday that he was not ready to jump ship. But he was not sounding a ringing endorsement, either. 
 ''I was O.K. with the president's efforts and goals in Afghanistan,'' he said in a phone interview. ''At the same time, I'm open to hearing whether those are achievable, and as we debate that, we also need to think about what are the costs of reversing course.'' 
 But it was the Republican National Committee, and not the Democrats, that was sounding more solidly behind the president on Afghanistan. After Mr. Will's abdication on Tuesday, the Republican National Committee quickly sent out an e-mail message and posted a statement, ''Stand Strong, Mr. President,'' on its Web site to take issue with the conservative columnist. 
 ''We agree with President Obama that 'we have to win' in Afghanistan and make sure that our commanders on the ground have the troops and resources they need,'' the committee chairman, Michael Steele, said in the statement. He urged Mr. Obama to ''stand strong and speak out for why we are fighting there,'' adding that Mr. Obama has said too little so far ''about why the voices of defeat are wrong.''
 Similarly, Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, said he would continue to back Mr. Obama ''as long as we're making progress.'' 
 Senator Graham, for his part, was in Afghanistan last week, putting in a stint as Colonel Graham as he served out his Air Force Reserves duty rotation. He met with military officials and soldiers, and talked to Obama administration officials in Kabul, the capital, as well, and is supporting Mr. Obama's Afghanistan strategy.
 Afghanistan, Mr. Graham said Tuesday in an interview, ''is where 9/11 was planned and executed. 
 ''This is not Vietnam.'' 
 He said he would support a push for more troops in Afghanistan, but added that Mr. Obama would have to make a public case for it to convince wavering people on both the right and the left. 
 ''The president needs to be more aggressive about taking ownership of this strategy, and reinforcing to this country the consequences of Afghanistan being lost and becoming a safe haven for Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Graham said. 
 The debate over Afghanistan will play out in the coming weeks, as the military decides whether to ask for more troops; commanders in Afghanistan have already said their forces are insufficient to get the job done. Mr. Obama himself must decide whether to make a more public push for a deeper United States commitment. Administration officials say privately that they believe that they have 12 months to show significant progress in Afghanistan before they totally lose public support.
 One danger for Mr. Obama is that he may be forced to abandon his own party on Afghanistan for the right, which could put him in a perilous position if Republicans at any point decide they do not want to support a Democratic president on the issue. 
 ''Some people on the right think Afghanistan is hopeless, some people think this is Obama's war and want to do to Obama the same thing the left did to Bush with Iraq,'' Mr. Graham said.

HEADLINE: Ousted Honduran Leader Seeks Tougher U.S. Stance Against Coup

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Manuel Zelaya, the deposed president of Honduras, called on the United States to match its strong words of condemnation for the coup that ousted him with actions -- asking the Obama administration to cut off tens of millions of dollars in assistance to the de facto government and freeze the visas and assets of those involved in plotting his overthrow.
 Mr. Zelaya said he appreciated the numerous statements President Obama had made in his defense since June 28 when Honduran soldiers rousted him from bed and loaded him, dressed in his pajamas, onto a plane leaving the country. 
 Yet without tougher actions, he said, Mr. Obama's statements had begun to ring hollow, hardening the intransigence of those who deposed him, and signaling to Latin America that the United States put politics above democratic principles.
 ''He's risking his prestige in Latin America,'' Mr. Zelaya said. ''We are not asking him to intervene. We are asking him to be consistent with democratic principles. And if he does that, Latin America will applaud.''
 His remarks came moments after a speech at George Washington University and a day before he was scheduled to meet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 A senior State Department official rejected Mr. Zelaya's criticism, saying that the United States had exerted more pressure than any other country to restore Honduran democracy.
 The administration has cut some $22 million in government assistance, including $16 million in military aid, the official said. It has also revoked a handful of diplomatic visas from members of the de facto government, and it recently stopped issuing all nonimmigrant visas at the American Embassy in Honduras.
 ''I would contest that this situation can be resolved with easy formulas,'' the official said. ''This situation is complex. If it weren't it would have already been resolved.'' 
 So far, the reviews of Mr. Obama's handling of the Honduras crisis have been mixed. Initially, the administration won praise throughout the hemisphere for condemning the coup in no uncertain terms and collaborating with other countries in the region to resolve the crisis rather than taking unilateral action.
 But with talks on restoring Mr. Zelaya at an impasse, there have been charges that the United States was sending mixed messages, publicly saying that it supports Mr. Zelaya's return but refusing to use all its economic influence in Honduras to force the de facto government to resign.
 ''If they can't get the cast of characters in Honduras to behave the way they want them to,'' said Julia E. Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations, ''how are they going to deal with Afghanistan or Iran?''
 The longer the political crisis in Honduras continues, the more of a conundrum it threatens to create for Mr. Obama. A handful of Congressional Republicans, backed by a well-connected group of lawyers and lobbyists, have mobilized in support of the de facto government, accusing Mr. Zelaya of illegally trying to change the Constitution so that he could run for another term. 
 They have held up crucial State Department appointments to pressure the administration not to impose sanctions against Honduran leaders.
 A clash also appears to be brewing between the administration and some Latin American countries over whether to recognize the Honduran election scheduled to take place this autumn. Several countries, including Brazil, Mexico and Chile, have said they would not recognize an election overseen by the de facto government.
 The United States, Canada and Caribbean countries have so far not taken a formal position, saying that an election may be the only peaceful way to end the conflict that has polarized Honduras.
 Presidential campaigning began on Tuesday there, and in a televised address the head of the de facto government, Roberto Micheletti, said the contest would show the world that democracy was alive and well in Honduras.
 ''This process will serve to categorically show that we appreciate democracy, that we are a people who want to live in harmony,'' Mr. Micheletti said, according to The Associated Press. 
 Mr. Micheletti, who is not a candidate, added that an election was the ''only and definitive solution to the political crisis.''
 But Mr. Zelaya said the coup undermined Hondurans' faith in democracy and in the rule of law.
 ''Any elections without my presence would not end the crisis in my country,'' he said. ''They would only deepen the crisis.''
 Mr. Zelaya said that in his State Department meetings on Thursday he would ask Mrs. Clinton to clarify several issues. He said he would ask why, two months after he was forced from power, the State Department had not formally determined that his ouster fit the legal definition of a military coup, which would require the United States to definitively cut aid currently considered ''on pause.''
 He also said he would ask the United States to formally condemn the human rights abuses, including attacks against union leaders, journalists and others who support him, that have been reported by groups like Amnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
 The State Department official, who was granted anonymity because he was not allowed to speak publicly, acknowledged that tens of millions of dollars, including development and humanitarian aid, had not been interrupted because of concerns about the impact on a country where more than half of all people live in extreme poverty. 
 Officials close to both Mr. Zelaya and Mr. Micheletti said that although formal negotiations seemed to be going nowhere, informal talks between Mr. Zelaya and his opponents had begun, raising hopes that a settlement could be reached.
 The State Department official said, however, that the de facto government had used talks to stall for time, and he warned that the United States was prepared to take tougher measures if it still refused to relent.
 Next week, the board of directors of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which is headed by Mrs. Clinton and financed by the United States, will meet to decide whether to cut off its aid to Honduras, which includes $215 million over four years.

HEADLINE: California: Urging Water Rules Change

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sent a letter to Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke asking them to reverse the federal government's restrictions on water use intended to protect fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. ''Three years of drought continue at serious cost to our farms, our people and our economy,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger wrote. ''As reservoirs remain low and water deliveries unreliable, those costs increase daily.'' Across the state, 64 water agencies have mandatory rationing policies and there have been large numbers of job losses across the state because a protracted drought has interrupted farming in some areas.

HEADLINE: Conservatives See Need for Serious Health Debate

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The roiling debate over health care this summer has included a host of accusations from opponents of the plan that have been so specious that many in the mainstream news media have flatly labeled them false. 
 Far from embracing the attacks, many leading conservative health care policy experts said in recent interviews that the dynamic was precluding a more robust real-world debate while making it nearly impossible for them to inject their studied, free-market solutions into the discussions.
 And they said the focus on what they consider misleading or secondary issues was getting in the way of real questions about the plan they believed worthy of consideration. 
 ''There are serious questions that are associated with policy aspects of the health care reform bills that we're seeing,'' said Gail Wilensky, a veteran health care expert who oversaw the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs for the first President George Bush and advised Senator John McCain in his presidential campaign last year. 
 ''And there's frustration because so much of the discussion is around issues like the death panels and Zeke Emanuel that I think are red herrings at best,'' she said, referring to a health care adviser to President Obama whose views on some issues have been misrepresented by opponents. 
 Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, is among those making policy-laden arguments against Mr. Obama's plan that do not lend themselves to easily digestible catch phrases like ''death panels'' or false but sensational assertions that the elderly will be told to choose euthanasia as a cost-saving measure. But his critique is based on related fears that the plans being discussed would inevitably lead to increased government involvement in personal medical decisions and eventually affect vital services.
 Like many of his conservative peers, Dr. Gottlieb said he was concerned that the administration's plan would fail to control costs adequately while increasing demands for services. The result, he said, is that Medicare, Medicaid and any new government insurance program would be forced to deny payment for procedures deemed unnecessary.
 Administration officials contend that the plan would not cause a draconian increase in rationing by finding savings in Medicare and Medicaid -- plenty of which takes place already, people on both sides of the debate agree -- because it would be largely financed by cutting waste in Medicare, more than $500 billion over 10 years. 
 Their argument holds that they can find that money with real efforts to decrease redundant procedures due to poor record keeping -- causing a doctor, for instance, to prescribe an expensive test a patient has already had -- and the correction of similarly exorbitant inefficiencies throughout the system.
 ''To put this in perspective, the Medicare savings proposals that the House is considering as part of health insurance reform would constitute perhaps a 6-to-7 percent reduction in spending over 10 years,'' said Daniel H. Pfeiffer, a White House spokesman, who also noted that the AARP had agreed with the administration's assessment that the cuts would not force reductions in beneficial services. ''A wide array of experts agree that we could reduce spending by 30 percent without reducing services,'' he added.
 But, starting out with a general distrust of government solutions, even conservatives who agree that tens of billions of dollars are wasted annually are dubious about the government's ability to find significant savings without eventually affecting care negatively. They argue that the government is incapable of making such cuts fairly or competently. 
 Some conservatives insist that more of Medicare's administrative functions should be contracted out to private insurers. Others suggest tax breaks or subsidies for people to buy their own coverage. 
 A similar idea was once proposed by Dr. Emanuel, whose plan for a voucher system is not being considered by the White House. But it is in keeping with conservative approaches holding that government should try to change the health care system through tax policy rather than direct intervention.
 ''We profoundly disagree with this notion of a large, centralized restructuring of the health system,'' said Stuart M. Butler, a vice president of domestic and economic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. ''You've got to devise a system that starts to change underlying incentives -- the policy incentives -- and allow a gradual change in the system over time.''
 That is not to say that there is much of a consensus among conservative health care policy analysts, who face an intellectual conflict on health care: many proven ways of saving money have tended to result from the sort of centralized decision-making that they have traditionally abhorred.
 So while some conservative policy analysts are finding savings in Medicare, many say they fear that government will misuse the information it gleans from studying the utility of various treatments by eventually using the results to dictate care. (Mr. Pfeiffer said, ''There is nothing in any of the versions of the legislation that suggests that is remotely possible.'')
 Ms. Wilensky, on the other hand, applauded the administration for financing just such studies to reduce ineffective but expensive treatments. 
 ''We have to find ways to spend smarter and treat smarter so we slow the spending growth rate,'' she said. Ms. Wilensky said the entire health care system should stop paying doctors an individual fee for each service they provide patients -- something experts say encourages over-treatment and waste -- and alternatively, for instance, persuade them to join together with different specialists to offer an array of services for one lump sum. 
 This idea is widely supported by conservatives and liberals alike, but no proposal to set up this new payment system has gained attention. 
 ''Part of the problem on the Republican side is an unwillingness to say, Let's find a right way to do this, and let's go ahead even if all the special interests don't like what we're doing,'' said John Goodman, president of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group. 
 In the meantime, Mr. Goodman said he hoped his side could do a better job at making clear it had genuine misgivings about Mr. Obama's proposals.
 ''I think the critics have approached this in the wrong way; saying there's going to be a death panel is not the right way,'' he said. ''The right way to approach it is to put the burden of proof on the administration -- tell us how you're going to do that without denying care to people who are really in need.''

HEADLINE: The Revenge Of Levi

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
For the first time in my life, I feel sympathy for Sarah Palin.
 Levi Johnston -- you will remember him from his featured role as the father of Bristol's baby at the Republican convention -- has written an article for the new issue of Vanity Fair. It's his take on the Palin home life, which Johnston says was ''much different from what many people expect of a normal family.''
 Given the fact that Johnston is a 19-year-old high school dropout whose mother was arrested last year on six felony drug counts, it is conceivable that he is not the perfect arbiter of normal families. But even if he were an Eagle Scout with a scholarship to Harvard, can you imagine anything worse than discovering your daughter's teenage ex-boyfriend has been given a national platform to discuss his impressions of her mom's parenting skills? 
 It's hard to totally resist an article that has sentences that start with: ''In early August, before I went hunting and Sarah was picked, Bristol and I were at a tattoo parlor in Wasilla. ...'' Or information like the fact that baby Tripp's middle name is Easton in honor of ''my favorite hockey-equipment company.''
 But somehow I have a feeling that even the most ardent Palin-haters are not going to be able to work up much sympathy for Levi's complaint that Sarah made him cut off his mullet before his appearance at the Republican convention. Or that when she moved to Juneau after being elected governor, she tried to take Bristol with her in order to break them up.
 In fact, trying to separate her daughter from Johnston could be filed away in the rather slim folder titled ''Sarah Palin's Good Ideas.''
 Levi's reports on Palin's failings as wife and mother sound exactly like what any self-absorbed teenager might say about his girlfriend's working mom. She doesn't cook! He and Bristol had to do everything! They had to take care of the kids and go to Taco Bell to get Sarah a Crunchwrap Supreme! 
 Plus, Sarah fought a lot with Bristol's dad, Todd, and they certainly didn't look like a happy couple to Levi. She claimed to be a hockey mom but he didn't notice her at the rink all that often. (Why do I have the feeling that the amount of time Johnston spent keeping tabs on his teammates' parents was not extensive?) 
 It's too bad Johnston is untrustworthy about every subject not covered by Field & Stream. Otherwise, this article might be fair payback for the Levi-Bristol convention appearance. In an effort to cement her family-values cred, Palin gave every teenage girl in the country a deeply unrealistic and dangerous vision of the wonderful way a boyfriend would transform once he discovered there was a baby on the way. (In the staged world, the handsome, expectant, unmarried couple held hands while the whole auditorium applauded. In the real world, after whacking off Levi's mullet, Sarah had to veto his plans to go partying and force him to hang around the hotel with her pregnant daughter. ''It was boring,'' he concluded.)
 Besides selling a fantasy about how easily a semi-delinquent, unemployed father-to-be could be turned into Prince Charming, Palin also spent her campaign trying to give the impression that running for vice president and taking care of five children, the youngest a baby with special needs, was as easy as falling off a snowbank. Politicians who don't want the federal government to address child care issues like to imagine that's true. It absolves them from dealing with the question of who takes care of the kids when women make up almost half the work force. 
 So it would be helpful to know if Palin was ''always in a bad mood and she was stressed out a lot,'' as Johnston claims. But really, we're going to have to wait for a more reliable witness. Maybe Piper or Willow are preparing their memoirs.
 Levi and Bristol split up last spring, a few months after the birth of their baby. (''It was the happiest day of my life, but it was also terrible because my family couldn't be there,'' he writes. ''I didn't think Sarah wanted my mom around all the cameras because she had been arrested for selling prescription medication a week and a half earlier.'') The Palins have accused him of trying to cash in on his relationship to the former vice presidential candidate, and we can add this to a very brief list titled ''Sarah's Accurate Depictions of the World Around Her.''
 However, I was fascinated by his claim that she doesn't know how to shoot a gun. Hunting is one of the very few matters in which Levi Johnston seems like a trustworthy source, and if he says she showed no familiarity with weapons, I want to know more. In fact, I think Palin should never be allowed to bring that moose stuff up again until she appears at a rifle range and gives us a demonstration.

HEADLINE: White House To Propose Big Reserves At Banks

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Many banks are finally back on their feet. The question now is how to keep them there for good. 
 So after propping up lenders with billions of taxpayer dollars, the Obama administration is contemplating long-term measures aimed at preventing, or at least minimizing, any future financial crisis. 
 The thrust of the plan is to have banks, particularly those deemed too big to fail, maintain larger capital cushions -- a move bankers have traditionally opposed because it eats into their profits. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, is expected to outline the administration's proposals Thursday in a letter to the finance ministers of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging nations, who are scheduled to meet in London this week. 
 The measures are still under discussion and, if adopted, probably would not take effect for years. But capital levels, once the domain of academics and policy specialists, have quickly become Topic A in banking circles and underpin the administration's proposals for overhauling financial regulation. Compelling banks to hold more capital could radically reshape the industry. 
 Administration officials hope to reach a broad, international consensus on the issue and lay the groundwork for the rapid introduction of new capital guidelines after the Group of 20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh late this month. 
 But agreeing on an outline is one thing. Getting down to the details is quite another. The last international capital standards were years in the making. Those guidelines rely on banks' ability to assess risks, something most failed to do adequately in recent years, with disastrous results for the global economy. 
 Yet few policy makers see an easy fix. While requirements for more capital generally make banks safer, albeit less profitable, they also impede banks' ability to make the loans that fuel the economy and create jobs. The challenge is to strike a balance. 
 At the center of the Obama administration effort are two of the biggest issues in banking. The first is how to deal with institutions that are so large and interconnected that their failure might threaten the entire financial industry and the broader economy. The second involves institutions that take outsize trading risks, potentially exposing them to devastating losses. Some banks, like Goldman Sachs, fall into both categories. 
 Mr. Geithner is expected to propose that all banks maintain higher capital levels, with a big part in common stock. But so-called systemically important institutions -- perhaps two dozen, mostly big banks, plus a handful of other financial institutions -- would be held to even tougher standards. He is also expected to propose that institutions that engage in risky activities, like derivatives and proprietary trading, hold a larger buffer to guard against an industrywide shock. 
 ''This is a critical part of making the financial system safer in the future,'' Mr. Geithner said in Washington on Wednesday. ''This is not something we can take a long time to do.'' 
 Administration officials hope to reach a global consensus and are wary about putting American banks at a competitive disadvantage by imposing tighter restrictions unilaterally. Mr. Geithner said his goal was to come out early with a proposal to shape the debate. 
 It is unclear how regulators overseas will respond. European and Asian banks, which have typically held less capital than their American counterparts, might have to raise billions of dollars to comply with tough new global standards. 
 The Obama administration will meet plenty of opposition at home. Businesses like trading, derivatives and private equity would become far less lucrative if capital levels were sharply raised. The industry is unlikely to accept new rules without a fight. 
 Still, the failure of existing international standards, known as the Basel II accord, may prompt quick action. The health of banks has become a political issue as well as an economic one. 
 Under the current international rules set by the Basel accord, a bank is ''well capitalized'' if it meets a so-called Tier 1 capital level of 4 percent and a total capital level of 10 percent of its risk weighted assets. Under American rules, banks must hold even larger cushions. 
 Although no specific amounts have been settled on, it appears regulators now want more. In an interview on Tuesday, Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said there was already a consensus for a tougher international leverage ratio that would set consistent minimum capital levels around the world. ''It needs to be a hard and fast simple measure to ensure adequate capital in good times and bad,'' Ms. Bair said. 
 Mr. Geithner is also expected to propose further measures intended to make banks less reliant on raising additional capital when the markets are under stress. One idea is to require banks to cut their dividends and stop buying back their own stock if their share price declines precipitously. Another is to encourage banks to issue preferred stock that automatically converts into equity in a severe downturn. 
 Putting new measures into effect could take years. American and overseas regulators are reluctant to raise capital standards, curbing lending, during a global recession.

HEADLINE: Roosevelt: The Great Divider

BYLINE: By JEAN EDWARD SMITH. 
Jean Edward Smith, a professor at Marshall University, is the author of ''F.D.R.''

DATELINE: Huntington, W.Va 

 BODY:
 PRESIDENT OBAMA'S apparent readiness to backtrack on the public insurance option in his health care package is not just a concession to his political opponents -- this fixation on securing bipartisan support for health care reform suggests that the Democratic Party has forgotten how to govern and the White House has forgotten how to lead.
 This was not true of Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Congresses that enacted the New Deal. With the exception of the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 (which gave the president authority to close the nation's banks and which passed the House of Representatives unanimously), the principal legislative innovations of the 1930s were enacted over the vigorous opposition of a deeply entrenched minority. Majority rule, as Roosevelt saw it, did not require his opponents' permission. 
 When Roosevelt asked Congress to establish the Tennessee Valley Authority to provide cheap electric power for the impoverished South, he did not consult with utility giants like Commonwealth and Southern. When he asked for the creation of a Securities and Exchange Commission to curb the excesses of Wall Street, he did not request the cooperation of those about to be regulated. When Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act divesting investment houses of their commercial banking functions, the Democrats did not need the approval of J. P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs or Lehman Brothers.
 Roosevelt took the country off the gold standard and Congress enacted legislation nullifying clauses in private contracts stipulating payment in gold over the heated opposition of many of the nation's wealthy. The Agricultural Adjustment Act setting production quotas and establishing price supports was adopted over the fierce opposition of the nation's food processors. Establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps was fought tooth and nail by organized labor because of the corps' modest wages. Social Security became law over the ideological objections of those who believed that government was best which governed least and that individuals should fend for themselves or rely on charity. And the authority of the government to set maximum hours and minimum wages, as well as the right of labor to bargain collectively, was established despite the vociferous opposition of American business. 
 Roosevelt relished the opposition of vested interests. He fashioned his governing majority by deliberately attacking those who favored the status quo. His opponents hated him -- and he profited from their hatred. ''Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today,'' he told a national radio audience on the eve of the 1936 election. ''They are unanimous in their hatred for me -- and I welcome their hatred.''
 Roosevelt sought consensus among his fellow Democrats, which is why he sometimes kowtowed to the Southern oligarchs who were the chairmen of Congressional committees. But his Republican opponents were relegated to the political equivalent of Siberia. Roosevelt rode up Pennsylvania Avenue with President Herbert Hoover to the inauguration in March 1933, but he never saw or spoke to him again -- not even in World War II.
 For Roosevelt was a divider, not a uniter, and he unabashedly waged class war. At the Democratic Convention in 1936, again speaking to a national radio audience, Roosevelt lambasted the ''economic royalists'' who had gained control of the nation's wealth. To Congress he boasted of having ''earned the hatred of entrenched greed.'' In another speech he mocked ''the gentlemen in well-warmed and well-stocked clubs'' who criticized the government's relief efforts.
 Roosevelt hived off the nation's economic elite to win the support of the rest of the country. The vast majority of voters rallied to the president, but for a small minority he was the Devil incarnate. Few today remember the extent to which Roosevelt divided the nation. The sense of unity wrought by World War II blurred the divisiveness of the 1930s. Also, Roosevelt endeavored to ensure that more than half of the country was always on his side. Finally, and most important perhaps, the measures he championed have stood the test of time. It is difficult for Americans today to comprehend how anyone could have opposed Social Security, rural electrification, the regulation of Wall Street or the federal government's guarantee of individual bank deposits. 
 Roosevelt understood that governing involved choice and that choice engendered dissent. He accepted opposition as part of the process. It is time for the Obama administration to step up to the plate and make some hard choices. 
 Health care reform enacted by a Democratic majority is still meaningful reform. Even if it is passed without Republican support, it would still be the law of the land.

HEADLINE: Myth-Busting: The Value of College

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Does the economy suffer from an oversupply of college graduates?

 BODY:
Over at The Choice blog, Rebecca R. Ruiz describes a recent National Public radio segment called "Is a College Education Worth the Debt?" In the segment, Richard Vedder, a professor of economics at Ohio University, argued that the country suffers from an oversupply of college graduates. "We are starting to graduate, I don't want to say too many students, but it's becoming more and more difficult for new college graduates to get jobs, independent of the recession," Mr. Vedder said.
You hear this line of argument fairly often. But it flies in the face of an overwhelming amount of evidence.
In fact, the gap between the pay of college graduates and everyone else has reached an all-time high, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. That's evidence of an of college graduates. If more people were graduating from college, then college graduates would not command a wage premium relative to everyone else. If more people were graduating from college, as the economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz explained in an important recent book, income inequality would not be nearly as high as it is.
In a magazine article this year, I summarized the research on the value of a college education:Goldin and Katz are careful to say that economic growth is not simply a matter of investing in education. And we can all name exceptions to the general rule. Bill Gates dropped out of college (though, as Malcolm Gladwell explains in his recent book, "Outliers," Gates received a fabulously intense computer-programming education while in high school). Some college graduates struggle to make a good living, and many will lose their jobs in this recession. But these are exceptions. Goldin's and Katz's thesis is that the 20th century was the American century in large part because this country led the world in education. The last 30 years, when educational gains slowed markedly, have been years of slower growth and rising inequality.
Their argument happens to be supported by a rich body of economic literature that didn't even make it into the book. More-educated people are healthier, live longer and, of course, make more money. Countries that educate more of their citizens tend to grow faster than similar countries that do not. The same is true of states and regions within this country. Crucially, the income gains tend to come after the education gains. What distinguishes thriving Boston from the other struggling cities of New England? Part of the answer is the relative share of children who graduate from college. The two most affluent immigrant groups in modern America - Asian-Americans and Jews - are also the most educated. In recent decades, as the educational attainment of men has stagnated, so have their wages. The median male worker is roughly as educated as he was 30 years ago and makes roughly the same in hourly pay. The median female worker is far more educated than she was 30 years ago and makes 30 percent more than she did then.

HEADLINE: President Shakes Up South Korean Cabinet

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL 

 BODY:
President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea replaced his prime minister on Thursday in a cabinet reshuffle that also removed the country's defense minister, who had clashed with Mr. Lee over military spending. 
 Mr. Lee appointed Chung Un-chan, 61, an American-educated economist and a former president of Seoul National University, to replace Prime Minister Han Seung-soo. Mr. Chung, who earned his doctorate from Princeton University, is frequently described in the South Korean news media as a possible presidential candidate. 
 Mr. Lee has been under pressure from his ruling Grand National Party to revamp his cabinet since the party suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary by-elections in April. 
 Gen. Kim Tae-young, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was named defense minister. The man he replaced, Lee Sang-hee, made headlines last month when he sent a letter to the presidential office and some cabinet ministers complaining bitterly about the government's spending plans for the country's 650,000-member military. 
 The Defense Ministry asked for a 7.9 percent increase, to $24.7 billion, for next year. But the government reportedly suggested a 3.8 percent increase. 
 General Kim earned a reputation as a hard-liner on North Korea when he told Parliament last year that if the North deployed nuclear weapons, South Korea would consider pre-emptive strikes. 
 Choi Kyoung-hwan and Yim Tae-hee, both legislators affiliated with the ruling party, were named as knowledge and economy minister and labor minister, respectively. Joo Ho-young, another ruling party legislator and close political ally of the president, was picked as minister without portfolio. He will carry out assignments from the president and the cabinet. 
 Lee Kwi-nam, former vice justice minister, was promoted to justice minister. Paik Hee-young, a professor at Seoul National University, will become minister of gender equality.

HEADLINE: The Corruptibles

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Shortly after Huang Guangyu was named the second richest man in China by Forbes last October, the 39-year-old entrepreneur disappeared. 
 Nearly a week later, Beijing's Public Security Bureau issued a brief notice saying he had been detained on corruption charges, the first indication of his whereabouts.
 Soon, other prominent individuals were arrested or charged with corruption or bribery: Rixin Kang, the former head of China's nuclear power agency; Chen Tonghai, the former chairman of Sinopec, the state-owned oil company; the head of Beijing's Capital Airport (who was executed last month); and the former mayor of Shenzhen, one of the country's biggest manufacturing centers.
 Chinese authorities say the arrests are part of the Communist Party's latest anticorruption campaign -- and they include the arrest last month of four employees of the British-Australian mining giant, Rio Tinto, on bribery charges. 
 But analysts say that prominent corruption cases in China are often the outgrowth of power struggles within the Communist Party, with competing factions using the ''war on corruption'' as a tool to eliminate or weaken rivals and their corporate supporters. 
 In the case of Mr. Huang, the electronics billionaire, for example, state-run media say a number of other high-ranking officials with longstanding ties to him have also been dismissed and arrested in what looks to be a Communist Party power shuffle.
 China does not have an independent police or judicial system; party leaders order investigations. ''It's a very politicized process,'' says Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California and author of numerous studies on corruption in China. ''If your patrons do not protect you, you're toast.'' This may help explain one of the enduring contradictions of China's political and economic system: the government regularly publicizes an astounding number of corruption cases, yet little progress seems to be made in uprooting corruption.
 But as China prepares to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Communist victory here, Beijing is growing increasingly worried that rampant corruption is eroding public trust in the party, hurting the economy and threatening social stability.
 In a recent government poll, 75 percent of those surveyed listed corruption as their No. 1 concern. And this year, public outrage over corruption has caused mass demonstrations -- like one in June, when thousands of people in the eastern city of Shishou rioted after a cook died mysteriously in a hotel believed to be controlled by corrupt officials.
 ''The public is fed up with corruption,'' says Gao Quanxin, a senior fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.
 China's top leaders, including President Hu Jintao, have called on the Communist Party to strengthen its fight against graft. 
 Experts say one of Beijing's objectives in the current crackdown is to send a message to officials who overstep some unknown acceptable level of graft or who too ostentatiously flaunt its rewards and, second, to reassure an increasingly angry public.
 The problem is apparently so large that even selective enforcement results in about 150,000 officials being punished every year for bribery, corruption and other offenses.
 China is paying a hefty price for corruption, analysts say, through the misallocation of resources, and the health and safety threats that can arise when regulators, for instance, are paid to look the other way.
 A 2007 study by the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace estimated that in 2003, corruption cost China about $86 billion, or about 3 percent of gross domestic product at the time.
 ''Corruption has not derailed China's economic rise,'' says Professor Gao at the Chinese Academy. ''But it's rotting the establishment of a rule of law. The Chinese government has more than 1,200 laws, rules and directives against corruption, but implementation is ineffective.''
 Experts say corruption is thriving here because relatively low-paid government officials wield enormous power over business and resources. ''The key variable is the extent to which the government gets involved in business in China,'' says Professor Pei at Claremont McKenna.
 Many officials come up with ever more imaginative ways to gain wealth, like setting up private foundations to accept bribes or encouraging entrepreneurs and companies to bankroll the education overseas of family members.
 ''It's no longer bags of cash,'' says Violet Ho, an investigator working for Kroll, the risk consulting firm. ''There are sophisticated games going on.''
 Chinese lawmakers are considering a law that would give investigators larger powers, including criminal penalties on the ''bribe-taking relatives and spouses'' of corrupt officials.
 No one knows how many Western companies participate in corruption here or how often, but many multinational corporations are worried, particularly American companies that must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids bribing foreign officials.
 This year, Morgan Stanley dismissed a real estate executive in Shanghai after discovering he might have violated the bribery law. And in 2007, Lucent Technologies agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine after the United States government accused the company of violating the act.
 In a filing, the Justice Department said Lucent spent more than $10 million from 2000 to 2003 to bring 1,000 officials to the United States. The officials were supposed to visit Lucent operations, but instead Lucent often paid for them to travel to Las Vegas, Disneyland and the Grand Canyon.
 Still, when major corruption cases occur, the origins and nature of the cases are often shrouded in mystery. 
 In 2006, when Chen Liangyu, Shanghai's party secretary and a Politburo member, was ousted, many experts said there was evidence that he -- a major regional figure -- had lost a power struggle with leaders in Beijing.
 Many China experts believe the Rio Tinto case was politically motivated because Rio Tinto battled with the government steel industry over iron ore prices. 
 Those caught in the party's campaigns are usually humiliated and denounced for taking bribes, leading ''decadent lifestyles'' and, sometimes, for taking multiple mistresses.
 But so many officials are engaging in the same practices that in Hong Kong there is a cottage industry in books that detail the private lives of corrupt officials, with titles like, ''The Sexy Record of High-Ranking Communist Party Officials,'' ''Power and Money: How They Steal,'' and ''Shared Mistresses: Lust and Caution Among Chinese Officials.''
 Whatever the public outrage, many experts say they doubt corruption will go away anytime soon, largely because China does not have an independent police force or judicial system. 
 There are limits to where the party is willing to go. When President Hu's son became embroiled in a corruption investigation in the southern African nation Namibia involving a Chinese company he once controlled, Beijing asked Chinese Internet portals and state-run outlets not to make any mention of the case.
 Analysts say there is another reason change will come slowly: because officials seek power precisely so that they can form alliances and make the decisions that will eventually make them rich.
 ''It's now a recruiting tool,'' Professor Pei says of the promise of future graft. ''Corruption is the glue that keeps the party stuck together. Getting rid of it is not possible as long as they keep this system.''

HEADLINE: The Mood of the Market, as Measured in the Galleries

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
''No one is doing well,'' snapped the New York dealer Michele Maccarone over the phone. ''And anyone who says they are is lying.'' Ms. Maccarone, who has had a gallery for eight years, first on the Lower East Side and now on Greenwich Street in the West Village, is known for showing challenging new art as well as for dramatic overstatements. But she had just been asked the question art dealers probably dislike most these days: ''How are things going?'' Which is code for ''Are you selling art? Are you staying open?''
 ''I didn't take a day off all summer,'' Ms. Maccarone continued. ''I'm even doing resale. Me, Michele Maccarone.'' 
 Despite reports from the auction world that a recovery is under way, Manhattan's gallery scene feels all pins and needles as it heads into fall. Things aren't as bad as many expected them to be, but they could get worse. 
 Fragile is the word Knight Landesman, publisher of Artforum magazine, used to describe the current gallery mood: ''Fragile and hoping for business.'' Ad pages in Artforum's September issue are down to 206 from 363 a year ago, a decline of more than 40 percent.
 An art gallery is like a single-cell organism: it is the crudest but also the most essential life form in the art-world food chain. It is among the easiest of public forums to start up, and therefore the most efficient means of introducing new blood into the system. All it takes is one person with the single-minded determination to get the work of an artist or two seen and a reasonably clean, well-lighted space of almost any size -- something that is becoming a more affordable option as rents soften and storefronts, even in some of Chelsea's chic new condos, sit vacant. 
 At the same time keeping a gallery going is usually fairly hard, and can seem impossibly daunting when sales slump. As small operations, galleries are highly vulnerable to changes in the economic climate -- canaries in the coal mine, as they have often been called. So it made sense, as the bottom fell out of the art market last winter, that many people predicted galleries would start closing fast and furiously.
 As it turned out, it is hard to know if this summer has brought much more than the usual in the way of closings, along with relocations, expansions, contractions, splits and alliances. So far the list of galleries that have closed is barely two dozen long, and only if you include galleries that closed several months before the crash; galleries that, to be blunt, will not be missed; neophyte galleries that had yet to establish either a financial or critical foothold; and galleries that closed for reasons only partly related to the market, or not at all. 
 The much lamented Guild & Greyshkul in SoHo, for example, was run by three artists who say they had always intended to return full time to their own work. Rivington Arms, in the East Village, closed because the interests of its two partners diverged. And several galleries have closed in order to regroup and reopen, at least according to their owners, including Cristinerose, Smith-Stewart, the Proposition and Feature. Bose Pacia, the South Asian art gallery lately of Chelsea but now of Dumbo, relocated to regroup and has plans to reopen in a larger space in Manhattan in a year or two, said Rebecca Davis, its director. 
 Meanwhile there have been expansions, big and small, and a few newcomers, the most significant of which is probably Hauser & Wirth, a deep-pocket gallery with high-profile spaces in Zurich and London. Although Iwan Wirth, a Swiss dealer, was until this June half of Zwirner & Wirth with the American David Zwirner in a town house on East 69th Street, his heftier European brand is arriving in New York -- and in the same town house -- with a bang. Its first show will be a restaging of Allan Kaprow's famous 1961 happening-installation ''Yard,'' with the transgressive performance artist William Pope.L offering an interpretation that may or may not take too many liberties with the original. (The piece, which consisted of over 1,000 discarded car tires, was first exhibited at the Martha Jackson Gallery -- located in the same town house.) 
 The tea leaves on this move, as on much of the current situation, are ambiguous. Is it an omen of the rebounding health of the New York gallery scene, or merely evidence that Hauser & Wirth saw an opportunity to swoop in while the competition was feeling less invincible than usual? Mr. Wirth said the gallery had ''been thinking about coming to New York for a decade,'' and made clear that the softened real estate market had made the move easier. 
 He sounded enthusiastic, in any case. ''It is a completely different thing to be at the center of the universe than on the periphery,'' he said. (Asked what he thought about going up against other ultra-high-end galleries, he said only, ''Ask me again a year from now.'')
 Down in Chelsea, the David Zwirner Gallery will add a fourth gallery space to the three Mr. Zwirner already has on West 19th Street. This one is on the ground floor of the building called the Metal Shutter Houses, designed by Shigeru Ban, which is going up across the street. It will be used primarily for older and secondary-market material. 
 On a smaller scale, the outsider-art dealer Andrew Edlin, located in the gallery multiplex of 529 West 20th Street, will get much more visibility for his mix of outsider and insider art when he takes over the street-level space on 10th Avenue near 19th Street that was occupied until last July by Bellwether. And Sean Horton, who opened a tiny storefront gallery called Sunday L.E.S. on the Lower East Side three years ago, has extended his initial short-term rental of the parlor floor of the federal-style house on West 22nd Street. (He has also taken on a partner, Frank Liu, identified in a news release as a practicing artist with a very successful career in advertising, and changed the name from Horton & Company to Horton & Liu.)
 Mr. Horton, whose taste runs to unknown artists who make quirky paintings, said he had ''the best summer ever'' in terms of sales. He explained that Sunday would now function as a project space for showing artists the gallery does not represent, while the Chelsea space would concentrate on the 11 it does -- a number he and his new partner hope to almost double. Mr. Horton said Chelsea ''has a need for young art dealers and young artists,'' adding that lower rents in the area were a big help: ''This wouldn't have been possible at all a year ago.'' 
 Even for those who can't hope to afford any Chelsea rent, the less stratified, increasingly porous quality of the postboom art world seems to have made setting up shop in some form easier. Last spring the young artist Margaret Lee began staging exhibitions in her Chinatown loft, and she will continue to do so for at least one more year.
 Fabienne Stephan, who works as the director of Salon 94 Freemans on the Lower East Side, has opened a minuscule space around the corner on Chrystie Street with her husband, Paul-Aymar Mourgue d'Algue, and a friend, Hanne Mugaas. Measuring 6 by 16 feet, the gallery, called Art Since the Summer of '69, is described by Ms. Stephan as having ''the same square footage of a large painting that could be hanging in a big Chelsea gallery.'' The next exhibition, opening Sept. 21, will be ''The Bichon Frise in Art,'' an archive of reproductions of paintings with small white dogs and some contemporary works made in response to them. 
 ''It's too easy to go around and see exhibitions you don't like and criticize things,'' Ms. Stephan said. ''We decided do something that we like.'' 
 Becky Smith, who closed Bellwether, her Chelsea gallery, in July, is considering organizing a series of nomadic shows in vacant spaces around town (although she is also thinking about returning to her own painting). Amy Smith-Stewart, who closed her gallery on the Lower East Side in May, already has some projects in the works. Ms. Smith-Stewart, too, invoked the softened real estate market. ''I want to take advantage of the fact that there is so much commercial space,'' she said, ''and do something less static and more elastic and artist-driven.''
 On the other hand, what might be called the graying, or perhaps the squaring, of Chelsea is still happening, too, with the relocation there of two more 57th Street galleries. Ameringer McEnery Yohe, which represents some living artists like Judy Pfaff but is especially active in the resale market for Color Field and Abstract Expressionist painting, will open in late October in the West 22nd Street space vacated by 303 Gallery (which moved to larger, spiffier quarters on West 21st Street). 
 Lori Bookstein Fine Art, the other 57th Street refugee, is more idiosyncratic, concentrating on underknown older artists, including Garth Evans, Irving Kriesberg and Louise Kruger, and the estates of Louis Finkelstein and Aristodimos Kaldis. After 12 years in business and five on 57th Street, Ms. Bookstein is taking over the former Cohan & Leslie space (next to the former Bellwether) on 10th Avenue. The move was prompted, Ms. Bookstein said, by a raise in her rent uptown. She found she could get 1,000 more feet and a ground-floor space in Chelsea for a bit more than what she used to pay. 
 Ultimately, of course, how things are going depends on whom you talk to. Ms. Maccarone, at her most optimistic, foresees ''an O.K. September until the auctions,'' which she predicts will once more confirm a downward trend. To be followed, she says, ''by a dry winter and a lousy spring,'' with things approaching normal by fall 2010. 
 ''I'm doing everything I can think of'' to get by, she said. She cut staff and eliminated art fairs even before the market crashes of 2008. She is going to younger artists whose work can be priced less expensively (maybe not the first reason an artist wants to be given a show, but never mind). And three benefits will be held in her gallery this season. Will she be paid for the use of her space? No, she said, ''but they might bring people into the gallery who have not been exposed to contemporary art before.''
 Several blocks north in Chelsea, meanwhile, the characteristic ebullience of Friedrich Petzel, a German-born dealer with an eponymous gallery on West 22nd Street, seemed barely dimmed. ''We've had an actually O.K. six months,'' Mr. Petzel said, noting nonetheless that he had cut back certain expenses, stretching exhibition runs and ceasing to cover artists' fabrication costs. Yet ''things felt a lot grimmer in the early '90s,'' he said, referring to the last art-market slump. 
 ''Sure, it's gotten harder'' to sell, he added, ''but you have to do better, do more. I'm looking at this as an opportunity and also as temporary.'' 
 ''We will certainly succeed,'' he said expansively. ''I have no doubt.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the economic status of Manhattan art galleries, using information from a news release on the Web site of the Ameringer McEnery Yohe gallery, misstated the date the gallery will open on West 22nd Street after moving from West 57th Street. It is Sept. 17, not late October.

HEADLINE: Five-Year Dispute on Aircraft Claims Loses Its Urgency

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
After five years of bitter and costly litigation between the United States and Europe, the World Trade Organization is expected to deliver a report on Friday intended to set limits on government support for civil aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus. 
 But it is coming, economists and industry analysts say, too late to make much difference. 
 The preliminary report, analysts say, is expected to support at least part of the complaint filed in 2005 by the United States on behalf of Boeing, claiming that the European Union and its member governments had funneled tens of billions of euros in illegal subsidies to the European aircraft maker Airbus in the last 40 years. 
 The most serious charge in the American case, legal specialists say, involves ''launch aid,'' the low-cost loans extended by European governments to help finance the development of planes.
 In a counterclaim, the European Union contends that Boeing has received at least $24 billion since the 1980s in research and development support through generous contracts with the United States military and space programs, as well as significant tax breaks from Washington State, the site of Boeing's largest assembly lines. The W.T.O. is due to issue a separate report on the European counterclaim next year.
 While the findings may be a watershed in a case that, by many measures, is the largest and most expensive to be heard by the global trade body, analysts say the dispute's relevance has faded as new airplanes are increasingly being designed and built in several countries.
 And even if the W.T.O. forcefully declares Europe's support for Airbus illegal, the process of resolving both claims would take many more years before any actions could be taken.
 Some analysts also say it would be hypocritical to provoke a trade war over subsidies for airplanes after hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars and euros were given to failing banks and automakers on both sides of the Atlantic in the last year.
 With Airbus and Boeing globalizing production even more -- and other countries like China and Japan expanding their domestic industries -- several analysts say the Americans and Europeans would be better off seeking a negotiated settlement.
 ''Lots of governments are interested in having a piece of the civil aircraft construction business, so much of the aircraft produced today is not manufactured in the country with the nameplate,'' said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a trade specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''This introduces a whole new level of complexity.''
 The costs and risks associated with developing jet aircraft -- not to mention the employment effects -- are so large that governments have always played a role, economists say. Washington and Brussels acknowledged as much in 1992, when they agreed to permit launch aid covering as much as a third of development costs, and indirect aid through tax breaks and support for research and development, as long as the amount of aid did not exceed 3 percent of total aircraft sales. 
 The United States unilaterally withdrew from that agreement in 2004, arguing that Airbus, which had surpassed 50 percent of global market share, no longer needed government support.
 Increasing competition, however, has led Boeing and Airbus to outsource a larger share of their manufacturing to international partners and rely more on suppliers in lower-cost countries like China and India. The forthcoming Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for example, is being built with help from partners in a half-dozen countries, with 35 percent of the work being done in Japan.
 Production of Airbus's rival aircraft, the A350-XWB, is likely to involve partners in Europe, China, Russia and South Korea, the company has said. Each program has benefited from direct or indirect financial support from third-party countries. So to speak of an Airbus plane as ''European'' or a Boeing plane as ''American'' disguises reality.
 Legal specialists do not expect the W.T.O. to agree with all of the 43 American claims. But the United States hopes that the report will find that launch aid violated global trade rules enough times so that European governments will be dissuaded from continuing the practice for aircraft programs like the A350 and the next generation of single-aisle planes expected late in the next decade.
 ''Even if you accept the argument that, 40 years ago, Airbus as a nascent company needed government support in order to compete with established competitors in the marketplace, the idea that Airbus today, with more than 50 percent market share, still needs support from the taxpayer doesn't even pass the laugh test,'' said Robert Novick, Boeing's lead lawyer in the W.T.O. case.
 The Europeans concede that some early Airbus programs got significant public financing, not all of it on commercial terms.
 Analysts say governments are probably two decades away from recouping their investment in the $13 billion A380 program.
 Still, the European Union vowed last month that the dispute before the W.T.O. would have ''no relation'' to government plans to lend money to future Airbus planes. France, Germany and Britain have already pledged a combined 2.9 billion euros, or $4.1 billion, to finance the A350.
 ''Europe is determined to support Airbus, and after what the U.S. has spent bailing out autos and banks, I'm not sure that I blame them,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ''If, as a taxpayer, I was able to choose between an investment in the U.S. auto sector or in Airbus right now, I think I'd have to choose the latter.''
 Others expressed a concern that recent government measures to counteract the global financial crisis threatened to undermine the authority of the W.T.O. more generally.
 ''The whole system is like a broken dish on the floor,'' Mr. Hufbauer said. ''It will be extremely difficult to provide discipline.'' He co-wrote a recent policy note, partly financed by Airbus, that urged both sides to seek a negotiated settlement rather than continue their ''misguided'' litigation.
 ''Tit-for-tat trade cases in the W.T.O. will not change the basic facts of this industry,'' he wrote.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Wins 1,600 Financial Jobs

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The fierce tug of war between New York and New Jersey over 2,300 financial jobs in Lower Manhattan is just about over.
 New Jersey has come out ahead, winning most of the jobs, said government officials and real estate executives. But New York keeps the headquarters.
 The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a critical part of Wall Street's financial machinery, had threatened early this year to move its entire operation to New Jersey, enticed by lower costs and a subsidy package worth well over $70 million. 
 Then followed nine months of wooing and pleading by top officials on both sides of the Hudson River, including Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey.
 Now, Depository Trust appears to have reached a decision to keep its headquarters and roughly 700 employees at its current home at 55 Water Street, according to the officials and executives, who declined to be identified because the company has not formally announced its decision.
 Most of its work force, however, will move to the Newport office complex on the Jersey City waterfront.
 A spokesman for Depository Trust said a final decision had not been made. New York officials still hope they can steer the company to Pierrepont Plaza in Brooklyn Heights, instead of Jersey City.
 ''We don't think it's over yet.'' said Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, whose district includes Lower Manhattan, ''but I believe they're willing to keep at least 700 downtown. We're trying for more.''
 The bruising campaign to keep Depository Trust, which clears and trades securities for many brokerage firms and banks, was a test of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's policy of refusing to give in to demands from companies playing one state against another. But the outcome also raises questions about the future role of Lower Manhattan as an international financial center.
 For decades, financial firms have been migrating from the city's historic financial district to shiny skyscrapers in Midtown, or less expensive towers in Jersey City and Stamford, Conn. 
 But Depository Trust's decision to join them, at least in part, comes only weeks after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said it would leave Lower Manhattan for the Empire State Building. At the same time, downtown stalwarts like American International Group, the troubled insurance giant, and Merrill Lynch are shrinking their presence. And JPMorgan Chase has put its skyscraper, Chase Manhattan Plaza, up for sale.
 In December, New Jersey granted Tullett Prebon, a British financial firm, $16.5 million in incentives for agreeing to move 330 jobs to the west side of the Hudson from Lower Manhattan.
 ''For more than half a century, the Lower Manhattan economy has been undergoing change,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of policy and urban planning at New York University. ''The epicenter of finance has moved to new locations.''
 Indeed, downtown, which often looked deserted at the end of a work day, has become far more lively and diverse as thousands of residents moved into converted office buildings. Over the past five years, a vast majority of companies moving downtown have been law firms, nonprofits, technology and new media, not financial services, said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan research group in Manhattan.
 ''We need to be much more strategic about the kinds of companies that we're trying to attract to Lower Manhattan right now,'' Mr. Bowles said. ''I believe that Lower Manhattan is a much more attractive place today.''
 Mr. Silver, and some city officials, contend that Lower Manhattan is still feeling the effects of the recession. The financial industry will bounce back with the economy, they insist, and Midtown financial firms seeking cheaper space will move downtown, where rents traditionally are 30 percent lower.
 But New York is still vulnerable to New Jersey, which offers generous incentives and where real estate costs are already lower. In February, New Jersey's development authority offered Depository Trust a package worth $74.6 million over 10 years if it moved 1,600 employees to Jersey City when its Manhattan lease expires in 2012.
 City and state officials in New York later met with the company to fashion a counter-offer. But city officials drew the line at offering the company a set of customized subsidies. 
 Their policy is supported by many economists and civic groups who argue that it is more important to improve transit and the overall business climate than to get into a bidding war for jobs.
 ''We're glad the company is maintaining its headquarters here,'' said Deputy Mayor Robert C. Lieber. 
 ''But,'' he added, ''we're not about to use scarce taxpayer dollars to chase irresponsible enticements that other places may be willing to give away. We're better off investing that money.''

HEADLINE: Not Looking Good So Far For Back-to-School Sales

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
After posting yet another month of weak sales, the nation's stores are hoping a late September rush will save the back-to-school shopping season. 
 Back-to-school has historically been one of the most lucrative times of the year for retailers, but sales in July and August were markedly down as consumers pinched pennies. Spending is still slow despite signs the economy is stabilizing, which does not augur a strong holiday shopping season, a crucial time for stores.
 August sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales, were better than July's, partly because of tax-free shopping days. 
 But on Thursday most stores posted significant declines -- with the worst coming from chains that specialize in teenage clothing and gear. 
 ''We're seeing this really continued and resounding reluctance of consumers to pay full price,'' said Craig R. Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, adding that stores selling higher-end merchandise ''continue to bleed share to the discounters and other value players.''
 Indeed, low-price retailers like Aeropostale, Ross Stores, Kohl's and TJX (the parent company of the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls chains) were standouts, posting sales increases. 
 Bill Dreher, a senior retailing analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities, said higher customer traffic at places like Kohl's and Target, while not yet translating into robust sales, was a sign that consumers were considering making discretionary purchases again. Come the holidays, he predicted, Kohl's and Target ''should be destinations for affordable gift-giving.'' 
 Kohl's reported a 0.2 percent same-store sales increase on Thursday. Target posted a 2.9 percent decline, but exceeded expectations.
 ''Guest traffic in August was essentially flat to last year,'' Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, said, ''marking a meaningful improvement from second-quarter trends.''
 Still, economists and analysts say consumer spending will not return in any real way until the job market improves. 
 ''In a meadow blossoming with so-called green shoots,'' said John D. Morris, a retailing analyst with BMO Capital Markets, ''you just can't ignore the unemployed U.S. consumer dozing on a blanket.'' 
 Over all, the industry turned in a 2.9 percent sales decline compared with a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters, making August the 12th consecutive month of negative growth. The August decline comes after a 5 percent drop in July.
 Chains offering children's and teenage clothing had some of the biggest declines: Abercrombie & Fitch (down 29 percent), American Apparel (down 20 percent), Zumiez (down 12.1 percent), Wet Seal (down 11.2 percent), Hot Topic (down 8.1 percent), Children's Place (down 8 percent) and American Eagle Outfitters (down 7 percent). Limited Brands, which owns Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, was down 4 percent. 
 Sales at Gap, which has been undergoing a turnaround, were down 3 percent, far better than the company's 8 percent decline for the period a year ago. The company's Old Navy division, which sells low-price clothing for the entire family, posted a 4 percent increase, in contrast to a 9 percent decline last year. 
 Retailers said Thursday that their sales were hurt by a calendar shift that pushed Labor Day a week later this season. Analysts added that the weak summer job market had left teenagers with less money. 
 To make matters worse, stores have noted that back-to-school shopping has been taking place later and later, sometimes even after children are already back in the classroom. Many chains are hoping that cooler weather and pent-up demand will spur sales over the course of this month. 
 Department stores were mostly in line with July's declines: down 19.6 percent at both Saks and at the specialty retail segment of Neiman Marcus, which includes Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores; down 12 percent at Dillard's; 8.9 percent at Stein Mart; down 8.1 percent at Macy's; 7.9 percent at J. C. Penney; 7.6 percent at Nordstrom; and 5.1 percent at Bon-Ton Stores. 
 Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest chain, used to help lift the total industry number, but in April it stopped reporting monthly sales figures. Its competitors, like Target, posted declines in August. But because they sell necessities at low prices, they were still better off than most other stores. August same-store sales fell 6 percent at BJ's Wholesale Club and 2 percent at Costco.
 Despite continued declines, Ken Perkins, president of the research firm Retail Metrics, noted in a report Thursday that ''retail same store sales clearly bottomed in July.'' And the International Council of Shopping Centers, which is predicting a 2 percent same-store sales decline for September, said August ''very well may mark a turning point in the retail sales cycle.'' 
 That is likely to be the case next month as stores begin comparing their monthly sales figures with the bad numbers they began posting last September. At the very least, they can look forward to easier year-over-year comparisons.

They have memorably recorded at the Village Vanguard, and each of their returns feels like a generous occurrence.

 NICHOLAS PAYTON GROUP (Thursday) The prodigiously gifted trumpeter Nicholas Payton has a fine recent album, ''Into the Blue'' (Nonesuch), that neatly synthesizes his dual allegiance to hard bop and groove music.

 LOGAN RICHARDSON TRIO (Friday) Logan Richardson has a warm, full sound on alto saxophone and a taste for music that makes warmth and fullness feel inevitable.

 GONZALO RUBALCABA TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Gonzalo Rubalcaba is a technically astonishing pianist, and he plays with a dramatic flourish and rhythmic complexity evocative of his native Cuba. ''Avatar'' (Blue Note), the almost imperiously brilliant record he released last year, features music for a quintet; here he pares down to a trio. (Through Sept. 12.) At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton , (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30 general seating and $40 premium seating, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)20090903
 DR. LONNIE SMITH TRIO (Friday through Sunday) Under the command of Dr. Lonnie Smith, the Hammond B-3 organ can be subtly atmospheric or growlingly ecstatic.

This one, featured on his new album, ''Idiosyncrasies'' (Strick Muzic), includes Orlando Le Fleming on bass and E. J. Strickland, his twin brother, on drums. Its sound can be room-filling, and its drive can be thrillingly intense. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village , (212) 529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com; cover, $12 for the first set, $6 for the second set, with a one-drink minimum for each.

 JOHN SURMAN QUARTET (Friday and Saturday) The baritone and soprano saxophonist John Surman has long been a leading figure in British jazz and improvised-music circles, and he doesn't surface here nearly often enough.

At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton , (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30, general seating; $40, premium seating. (Chinen)20090903

HEADLINE: The M-Word Surfaces in Virginia

 BODY:
The rara avis search for Republican moderates has suffered an arresting moment in the Virginia governor's race. 
 Just when the Republican Party candidate, Robert McDonnell, was scoring in the polls with job creation and other economic issues among the state's northern moderate base, he suddenly had to confront his own impassioned conservative thesis from 20 years ago in Christian evangelical school. There, he demanded that government ''statutorily and procedurally'' favor married couples over ''cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators.'' 
Feminism, Mr. McDonnell wrote, was ''one of the real enemies of the traditional family,'' while federal child-care programs were a detriment to the family by encouraging women to work. 
 His thesis, composed as an action paper for the Republican Party before he successfully ran for the state legislature, upbraided the Supreme Court for upholding contraception for unmarried couples and urged an end to ''conventional folklore about the separation of church and state.''
 That was 20 years ago and no longer represents his views, Mr. McDonnell insisted this week after the thesis surfaced and stirred a furor that he was cynically trying to rebrand himself a moderate after a successful career as a conservative legislator and attorney general. 
 The candidate pulled out a familiar dodge used by politicians when asked to explain damaging positions they've taken in the past. He said he was ''simply doing an academic analysis'' back in his graduate student days. ''My views on many issues have changed as I have gotten older,'' said Mr. McDonnell, who was 34 when he composed the thesis. 
 In campaigning, Mr. McDonnell briefly cited a thesis on ''welfare policy'' to a Washington Post reporter, Amy Gardner, who diligently tracked it down. She compared his conservative action program to his actual statehouse deeds across 14 years and found considerable overlap, for example in repeatedly seeking abortion restrictions and opposing a resolution to end wage discrimination between men and women. 
 We'll let Virginia voters sort out whether Mr. McDonnell has moderated since his start-up days as a conservative firebrand. He's got trouble on both sides, since it's unclear whether the state's potent conservative base will warm to his claims of political growth.
 For now, it's fascinating to watch any flicker of Republican moderation -- pragmatic, realistic, contrived. The party and the nation could certainly use it.

 Museums
 ASIA SOCIETY: YANG FUDONG: 'SEVEN INTELLECTUALS IN A BAMBOO FOREST,' through Sept. 13. Presented in its five-hour entirety for the first time in a United States museum, Mr. Yang's hypnotic five-part black-and-white movie, ''Seven Intellectuals in a Bamboo Forest,'' tracks the dreamlike meanderings of a group of fashion-model-pretty young people, from a breathtaking mountain summit to a busy city where the disjunctive imagery becomes increasingly surrealistic and comical. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street , (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson)20090903 
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'LIVING AND DREAMING,' through Sept. 13. This annual exhibition presents works by young artists who have completed a preparatory program for careers as professionals. Most look as if they could use a few years more of seasoning, but a handful appear to be artists to keep an eye on. The highlights include Eva Davidova's surreal videos; Meredith Drum's enigmatic, low-budget sci-fi film; Nathan Bennett's walk-in room resembling a set for a Stanley Kubrick space odyssey; and Jeffrey Hargrave's mock-racist caricatures. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania , (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090903
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090903
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090903
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 20. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period, and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Roberta Smith)20090903
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirshenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090903
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090903
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Nov. 29. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending from one end of the open-air deck to the other. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090903
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PAGES OF GOLD: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through Sept. 13. This quietly compelling show assembles ''orphan'' leaves (illuminated pages separated from medieval manuscripts and sold, individually, to collectors). Organized geographically, the show allows a comparison of illumination styles in England, Italy, Spain and other countries and regions. It also highlights the figures who created and participated in the market for single leaves. They include an Italian abbot, an English art historian and a mysterious artist known as the Spanish Forger. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090903
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'SCRIPTURE FOR THE EYES: BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN NETHERLANDISH PRINTS OF THE 16TH CENTURY,' through Sept. 27. Abounding in sex, violence and supernatural happenings, the Bible has been a great source of inspiration for visual artists. This superb show features pieces by some of the biggest names in the history of Western printmaking. Woodcuts and engravings by Lucas van Leyden and Hendrick Goltzius alone would make a visit to the museum worthwhile, but among the 79 works on view there are lots more wildly imaginative and technically amazing feats of printmaking. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20090903
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090903
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090903
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FOCUS: OSKAR KOKOSCHKA, WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Oct. 5. More a taste whetter than a substantial introduction, this exhibition presents six of the Expressionist portraits that made Kokoschka's reputation in the pre-World War I era and about 40 works on paper. The early paintings of eminent Viennese citizens still pack a considerable psychological punch. The gaunt, hollow-eyed ''Martha Hirsch (Dreaming Woman)'' projects an eerie, erotic charm, while her male counterparts resemble zombies and mad professors. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)20090903
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'DOROTHY IANNONE: LIONESS,' through Oct. 18. High priestess, matriarch, sex goddess: the self-taught American artist Dorothy Iannone has been called all these things and more. Now, at 75, Ms. Iannone is having her first solo show at an American museum. It includes just a smattering of early work: four paintings, one sculpture, an artist's book and a series of wooden cutouts. It is complemented, however, by an exhibition at the Anton Kern Gallery in Chelsea that spans the 1960s to the present. Both shows deliver an invigorating shock to an art world lulled, as of late, by the tasteful, conservative and blue-chip. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090903
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'INTERSECTIONS INTERSECTED: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF DAVID GOLDBLATT,' through Oct. 11. Celebrated internationally for his socially engaged photography, Mr. Goldblatt has been producing deceptively understated photographs in South Africa since the early '60s. His landscapes, urban scenes and portraits do not show the kinds of horrific images you might expect of witness-bearing photography in the land of apartheid and its violent aftermath, but their reticence speaks volumes. The 114 subtly elegant pictures in this slow-burning show cast a spell of love and mourning. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090903
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090903
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'DAN GRAHAM: BEYOND,' through Oct. 11. This beautifully installed retrospective pays tribute to an influential artist who doesn't necessarily call himself that, and it tends to bear him out. Most impressive are a series of early Conceptual artworks involving surgically precise uses of language and magazines; a series of deadpan, Minimalist-inspired photographs of New Jersey architecture; and ''Rock My Religion,'' an imaginative video about the roots of rock 'n' roll. The video installations and walk-in glass-and-mirror pavilions -- admired because they are interactive -- quickly grow tedious or gimmicky. The many artists who claim Mr. Graham as precedent may surpass him, but there is more than one way to be important. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090903
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'PAUL JENKINS IN THE 1960S AND 1970S: SPACE, COLOR AND LIGHT,' through Sept. 25. While seriously overhung, this exhibition affords a rare, extensive look at the work of an artist who borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and then Color Field painting to devise flowing, billowing veils of color that dazzle with their formal acrobatics and luminous, jewel-toned hues. Working with his well-known ivory knives, Mr. Jenkins makes his colors leap, overlap and splinter, pitting them against whiplash lines and stark white backgrounds that increase their luminosity. His paintings have frequently been too gorgeous for their own good, which means that they can verge on slick. But the selection here shows him at the height of his powers. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue , (212) 581-1657, dwigmore.com. (Smith)20090903
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'THE FEMALE GAZE: WOMEN LOOK AT WOMEN,' through Sept. 19. With a photograph by the eminent Victorian photographer Julia-Margaret Cameron -- as well as paintings by Joan Mitchell and Marlene Dumas, a video by Lynda Benglis and recent sculptures by Louise Bourgeois and Vanessa Beecroft -- this exhibition not only counters the so-called male gaze traditional to Western art with instances of the female one, it also represents a complexity of viewpoints that throws the entire gender-based dichotomy into question. Lust, love, desire and the urge for power can all be found in the works here, some of which could easily have been made by men (not necessarily a bad thing). But there are also above-average levels of empathy, autonomy and dignity in play, and a fascinating process of recontextualization. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street , (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com. (Smith)20090903
 'GLITZ & GRIME: PHOTOGRAPHS OF TIMES SQUARE,' through Sept. 12. This group show's 24 photographs, dating from 1945 to 2009, chronicle the highs and lows of Times Square, a place that embodies the spirit of American commercial culture at its most seamy and manically exuberant. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street , (646) 230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com. (Johnson)20090903
 'NAKED!,' through Sept. 19. Although it includes some images of men, a more accurate title for this entertainingly lubricious show would be ''Naked Women of Childbearing Age.'' A big part of the show's appeal is its wacky eclecticism. The 44 works range from a 1626 painting of the river god Alpheus chasing the nymph Arethusa, by Moyses van Uyttenbroeck, to Mel Ramos's 2007 sculpture of a voluptuous woman emerging from an open banana peel. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street , (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Johnson)20090903
 'PHASE TWO'; through Oct. 25. For a glimpse of the future of contemporary art, or at least a slice of that future,spend some time with the second round of exhibitions at X Initiative. Each of the three largest provides immersion in the work of a young, promising European artist working in time-based mediums. Luke Fowler's films about artists and eccentrics push the documentary form into art. Keren Cytter's visceral videos wreak havoc with numerous cinematic genres and a few from television. Tris Vonna-Michell combines slide projections and recordings of his rapid-fire spoken-word performances to trace his experiences in ways both random and crazily obsessive. X-Initiative, 548 West 22nd Street , (917) 697-4886, x-initiative.org. (Smith)20090903
 'SUMMER PICTURES,' through Sept. 12. When it comes to painting, the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi knows what he likes and then some. His group show of works by friends and one relative transcends such connections and explores issues like landscape, still life, breakfast and color -- especially color. The artists include Jane Freilicher, Maureen Gallace, Wayne Thiebaud, Maira Kalman and Adrianne Lobel (a theatrical designer). Their work looks fresh and diverse, like a party of people who don't know one another, but end up getting along famously. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street , (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com. (Smith)20090903
 Public Art
 'PLOT/09: THIS WORLD & NEARER ONES,' through Sept. 20. The big draw in the city's first quadrennial of public art -- an exhibition of 19 site-specific works organized by Creative Time on Governors Island -- is the beautiful, haunted, car-free island itself. Standouts among the uneven melange of artworks include videos by Guido van der Werve, Adam Chodzko, Judi Werthein and the ingenious Bruce High Quality Foundation. Outdoors, beyond the dark rooms, Susan Philipsz, Teresa Margolles, Tue Greenfort, Mark Wallinger and especially Klaus Weber also add substance. But the degree of site-specificity fluctuates wildly, and the concept as a whole is inadvertently called into question. (212) 206-6674, creativetime.org. (Smith)20090903
 Out of Town
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'THE ART OF POWER: ROYAL ARMOR AND PORTRAITS FROM IMPERIAL SPAIN,' through Nov. 1. Drawn from the Royal Armory in Madrid, one of the oldest and greatest repositories of armor in the world, this exhibition presents full suits of armor, as well as individual helmets, shields, swords and armor for horses. There are portraits of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish kings in armor, too, and three spectacular tapestries. But it is the extraordinarily sumptuous metalwork, produced not for warfare but for ceremonial occasions, that is the main attraction. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington , (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)20090903
 Last Chance
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS'; closes on Sunday. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking, visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090903
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIGHT OF THE SUFIS: THE MYSTICAL ARTS OF ISLAM'; closes on Sunday. ''What's in your head -- throw it away! What's in your hand -- give it up! Whatever happens -- don't turn away from it.'' That's how a 10th-century Persian spiritual master defined the Islamic devotional practice known as Sufism. Countless other definitions have been proposed since, almost as many as for Islam itself. And variety -- paintings, ceramics, mosque lamps, books -- is what you find in this tiny, exquisite show in the Brooklyn Museum's newly reinstalled Islamic galleries. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090903
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHIONING FELT'; closes on Monday. Tribute is paid to the world's oldest textile (no loom required) in all its sturdy, cosseting, beautiful, shape-shifting, dye-friendly majesty. The show includes contemporary furnishings, garments, jewelry and room dividers, as well as two large installation works. The felt runs from raw to cooked -- that is, furry to gossamer -- and in some of the most intriguing instances it is mated with lacquer, plastic, LED lights and metal or coral beads, as well as silk, linen or cotton. There are episodes of frivolity. A few earlier works -- including a Mongolian runner and a saddle blanket -- reunite function and decoration and distort familiar motifs in wonderful ways. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Smith)20090903
 'DOVE/O'KEEFFE: CIRCLES OF INFLUENCE'; closes on Monday. Exhibitions with fresh takes on the early American Modernists don't happen every day. This one delves into the give-and-take between the shy, retiring Arthur Dove (1880-1946) and the iron-willed Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986): a bond of friendship and mutual respect that is little known today, despite the fact that the two were something like the Pollock and de Kooning or Johns and Rauschenberg of the between-the-wars period. His work was crucial to the formation of her style; her early (Dove-influenced) watercolors inspired him to take up the medium at the end of his career. Their similarities and differences make for a lively dialogue and shed new light on one source of the organic abstraction that has figured centrally in American art ever since. Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, 225 South Street, Williamstown, Mass. , (413) 458-2303, clarkart.edu. (Smith)20090903
 ZOE LEONARD; closes on Monday. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y. , (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090903
 'LIVE FROM NEW YORK ...'; closes on Saturday. Subjects in this exhibition of photographs by various artists of famous musicians performing or hanging out in New York include Billie Holiday; Frank Sinatra; Sonny and Cher in hippie-cowboy outfits; Marilyn Monroe singing ''Happy Birthday'' to the president; Bob Dylan and George Harrison in a duet onstage; the Ramones outside CBGB; and, most famously, John Lennon in a sleeveless New York T-shirt. Bonni Benrubi, 41 East 57th Street , (212) 888-6007, bonnibenrubi.com. (Johnson)20090903
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT'; closes on Monday. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090903
 ANNA MOLSKA: 'THE WEAVERS'; closes on Saturday. The New York gallery debut of this young Polish artist consists of a short film that transfers the setting of an 1892 German play, about an uprising by exploited weavers, to a Silesian coal mine. A rough-edged form of collage results, as the dialogue and voice-over don't match the images. The piece evokes 19th-century realist painting, but the point is made without becoming heavy-handed: in many parts of the world labor conditions have not advanced much since the Industrial Revolution. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 28th Street, Chelsea , (212) 481-0362, www.broadway1602.com. (Smith)20090903
 PEABODY ESSEX MUSEUM: 'THE GOLDEN AGE OF DUTCH SEASCAPES'; closes on Monday. What with all those cataclysmic storms, shipwrecks, sea battles and marauding pirates in 17th-century Dutch marine paintings, it's a wonder anyone dared venture off land at all. There are periods of calm in this show of 72 expertly rendered seascapes, but the overall impression is harrowing. Nautical history buffs will be in heaven. East India Square, 161 Essex Street, Salem, Mass. , (866) 745-1876, pem.org. (Johnson)20090903
 'SELF-PORTRAITS'; closes on Friday. Nine well-known artists coyly toy with self-portraiture. In a1984 photograph John Coplans has his aged, hairy back turned to the camera. In photographs from 1979, 1981 and 1985, Cindy Sherman appears to play characters in different cinematic melodramas. A lacy pattern of thick black paint almost completely hides Rudolf Stingel's face in a small 2007 painting, and Martin Kippenberger, wearing oversize Picasso-style briefs, has a blue balloon floating in front of his face in a painting from 1988. Skarstedt Gallery, 20 East 79th Street , (212) 737-2060, skarstedt.com. (Johnson)20090903
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CLAES OLDENBURG: EARLY SCULPTURE, DRAWINGS, AND HAPPENINGS FILMS' AND 'CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN: THE MUSIC ROOM' ; closes on Sunday. This pair of exhibitions lean heavily on the Whitney's sizable collection of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/Van Bruggen drawings, some of which were shown in 2002. But they also include newly restored, never exhibited films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings and a major kinetic sculpture, ''Ice Bag -- Scale C'' (1971), brought back to life by conservators. A centralized gallery of early drawings and soft sculptures defines Mr. Oldenburg's epicurean branch of Pop, with works like ''Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich)'' and ''French Fries and Ketchup'' (both 1963), served up on low, platterlike pedestals. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20090903

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: 'Avedon Fashion: 1944-2000' at the International Center of Photography: This exhibition, with nearly 180 works, focuses on Richard Avedon's fashion photography, which the critic Roberta Smith calls his ''greatest work.'' Above, a 1998 shot of Jade Parfitt, left, and Esther De Jong in ensembles by Galliano.(PHOTOGRAPH BY RICHARD AVEDON FOUNDATION)(pg. C16)

Like many others in this city, Carolina Shellman plans to head to the Hamptons on Friday, driving out really early, around 4 a.m. Barring unexpected traffic, she should make it to East Hampton as the sun comes up, about 6:30.
 Watching a sunrise on a Hamptons beach must be a pleasure. So Ms. Shellman has heard. Not that she would know. East Hampton to her is defined by the town's post office. That's where she works. 
 She used to be a clerk at a branch of the Postal Service on West 125th Street, a short subway ride from her apartment in Washington Heights. That was a few months and a lifetime ago.
 Since early July, Ms. Shellman, 33, has had to commute more than 100 miles each workday to the post office in East Hampton. It means getting up by 3 a.m. to be on time. In midafternoon, after working straight through without a lunch break, she makes the return trip, another hundred-plus miles. On a good day, that takes three hours. It is not always a good day.
 There are times when she does not get home till 7 p.m. One night, she said, she didn't walk through the door until 9. It is not a schedule that allows for much time with her 11-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter, who are watched during the day by Ms. Shellman's parents.
 And when she has to pick up her friend Michele Morgan in Harlem, the journey takes longer. Ms. Morgan, 53, was also a postal clerk in Manhattan until early July. Now she works in Montauk, a half-hour's drive from East Hampton. Only Ms. Morgan doesn't drive. So someone from Montauk picks her up in East Hampton and drives her the rest of the way.
 ''I'm feeling exhausted and wiped out all the time,'' Ms. Morgan said. Small wonder.
 These women are two of the many casualties in a seemingly endless financial crisis that has the Postal Service by the throat.
 Its annual losses run into the billions. Mail volume is way down, and there is talk of cutting delivery to five days a week. Hundreds of post offices are on the chopping block, including a dozen or so in New York City. For many people, this is an intensely emotional issue. It is why the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent agency that oversees the Postal Service, has scheduled a public hearing on this issue for Sept. 23 at Fordham University's Bronx campus.
 In the financial mess, 150,000 postal jobs have disappeared, largely through attrition. Then there are people like Ms. Shellman and Ms. Morgan, whose commuting ordeal was chronicled recently by The East Hampton Star.
 They still have jobs. But they have been ''excessed,'' in bureaucrat-speak. The Postal Service decided that there wasn't enough for them to do at their old workplace, and reassigned them. In all, 121 employees were shifted in New York, most to branches no more than 50 miles away, said Darleen Reid, a Postal Service spokeswoman.
 But not everyone was so fortunate. A few ended up on Shelter Island and the North Fork of Long Island, more than 100 miles from the city. When Ms. Shellman learned that she was going to East Hampton, she had no clue where it was. She had to check MapQuest.
 ''I'd never even been to Long Island,'' she said. ''I had an uncle who said, 'That's where the United States ends.' He was right.''
 She and Ms. Morgan feel shabbily treated. They were told of their new assignments on the night of July 2, just as the Fourth of July weekend was beginning. They had to report for duty right after the holiday. They had virtually no time, they said, to adjust their lives to their altered circumstances.
 And while the Postal Service says that it wanted only to make sure that they had full-time jobs, the women (and their union) suspect that the aim was to make life so uncomfortable for them that they would quit, perhaps taking a $15,000 early-out incentive being offered to some employees.
 Ms. Morgan said that she might have to go that route if she cannot find a reasonably priced room in Montauk during her workweek. ''I feel I don't have a choice,'' she said. ''I can't afford to live out here, and my body can't take the commute.''
 Ms. Shellman, however, says that she will tough it out, even if it means continuing her daily commute of six or seven hours. ''I'm not going to roll over and die,'' she said.
 Who knows? If she stays in East Hampton long enough, she might even get to the beach. She is mostly familiar with the post office parking lot. The beach? ''To me, it's a myth.''

HEADLINE: Financials Rise, Helping to End 4 Losing Days for S.&P. 500

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks rose, snapping a four-day losing streak for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, as some retail stores reported sales that topped projections and Chinese equities rallied the most in six months.
 Alcoa and Caterpillar led the Dow Jones industrial average higher after a 4.8 percent advance in the Shanghai Composite Index.
 The S.& P. 500 climbed 8.49 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 1,003.24 in New York after tumbling 3.3 percent this week. The Dow average added 63.94 points, or 0.7 percent, to 9,344.61. More than four stocks rose for each that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. The MSCI world index of stocks in 23 developed countries rose 0.5 percent. 
 ''Corporate profits are going to continue to surprise investors on the upside,'' said Hank Smith, who helps oversee $6 billion as chief investment officer of Haverford in Radnor, Pa. ''On a fundamental basis, we don't think the market has gotten ahead of itself.''
 The S.& P. 500 halted its longest daily losing streak since May, even as jobless claims exceeded forecasts and a report on service industries did not bolster speculation that the economic recovery would be strong enough to justify a six-month rally in equities. 
 The government is scheduled to release its monthly jobs report Friday and may say the unemployment rate climbed to 9.5 percent in August, which would be the highest level since 1983.
 Costco Wholesale rose 8.6 percent to $54.99. Its same-store sales declined 2 percent in August, less than the 5.6 percent analysts had estimated. Gap increased 7.6 percent to $21.18. The company, which also operates Old Navy and Banana Republic clothing stores, said sales at stores open at least a year fell 3 percent in August from a year ago, less than the 6.7 percent estimated.
 Ford Motor advanced 6.4 percent to $7.48. Its credit rating was raised by Moody's Investors Service because of cost reductions, available funds and a ''robust'' vehicle lineup.
 Alcoa rallied 3.6 percent after increasing its forecast for global aluminum demand because of stimulus spending in China. Caterpillar rose 3.5 percent to $45.04.
 The S.& P. 500 financial shares climbed 2.3 percent collectively for the best gain among 10 groups. The average mortgage rate for 30-year fixed home loans fell to 5.08 percent this week, from 5.14 percent, reducing borrowing costs for buyers amid signs the housing market was stabilizing, according to data from Freddie Mac.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 11/32, to 102 11/32. The yield rose to 3.34 percent, from 3.3 percent late Wednesday.
 A group of mining companies, seed producers and chemical makers increased 1.6 percent as prices for raw materials jumped. Gold advanced to a six-month high, reaching $999.50 an ounce. Copper rose for a second day.
 Amgen, the largest biotechnology company, and Merck slid more than 1 percent after President Obama said he would take a more direct role in the legislative fight over health care. Mr. Obama plans to make his case directly to lawmakers and the public next week by addressing a joint session of Congress.
 Chinese stocks jumped Thursday after Liu Xinhua, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said authorities would promote a ''stable and healthy'' market, tempering concern the government wants to curb equity speculation. Ministers from the Group of 20 nations are likely to suggest the global economy is healing as they meet in London this weekend. The European Central Bank kept interest rates at a record low.
 The Shanghai stock index has climbed for the last three days after slumping 22 percent last month as banks reined in lending to avert asset bubbles, and policy makers advised industries to curb overcapacity. The measure had rallied 103 percent from a November low on prospects a $586 billion stimulus package and record lending would revive growth in the world's third-largest economy.
 China's stock market has foreshadowed moves in global equities the last two years. It peaked on Oct. 16, 2007, two weeks before the MSCI All-Country World index. The Shanghai index fell 72 percent from its 2007 high and bottomed on Nov. 4, 2008, four months before the MSCI index.

HEADLINE: New Claims for Jobless Benefits Fall Slightly

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
New claims for jobless aid fell less than expected last week, and the number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits rose -- further signs that any economic recovery will be hindered by a weak job market and flat incomes. 
 Most economists say they think the recession is over, but they also say the jobless rate will keep rising until at least next summer as the economy struggles to mount a sustained recovery. That means household incomes will remain depressed and consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy, will continue to slump.
 ''Firms are still not hiring, and that reflects deep pessimism about the sustainability of the economic recovery once government stimulus programs wear off,'' said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ''The lack of job creation remains a big headwind for cash-starved and credit-constrained consumers.''
 The Labor Department said the number of laid-off workers applying for benefits dipped to 570,000, from an upwardly revised 574,000 the previous week. That was a smaller improvement than economists had expected.
 The number of Americans continuing to receive benefits jumped to 6.23 million, up 92,000 from the previous week and a troubling reminder of the difficulty of people in finding jobs. The continuing claims data lags behind new claims by one week.
 The recession, which began in December 2007, has eliminated a net total of 6.7 million jobs. That toll is expected to grow on Friday, when the government reports the unemployment rate for August. Economists predict the jobless rate, now at 9.4 percent, will rise to 9.5 percent, with 225,000 net job losses in August.
 Mr. Guatieri and other analysts said job losses for August might be even larger -- perhaps topping the 247,000 jobs lost in July.
 In another report Thursday, a key gauge of activity in service industries, which account for about 80 percent of economic activity in the United States, edged up to 48.4 in August, from 46.4 in July. It was the best reading by the Institute for Supply Management's service-sector survey in 11 months, and it pushed the index closer to topping 50, the dividing line between contraction and expansion.
 Economists closely watch initial jobless claims, which are considered a gauge of layoffs and a sign of the willingness of companies to hire new workers. Claims are well off the recession's high of 674,000, hit in the first week in April. But they are still running far above the 350,000 that many economists view as a sign of a healthy labor market.
 The Labor Department report showed that the four-week average of initial jobless claims edged up to 571,250 last week, compared with 567,250 the previous week.

HEADLINE: Judges' Frustration Grows With Mortgage Servicers

BYLINE: By JOHN COLLINS RUDOLF

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
Bobbi Giguere had no luck in securing a loan modification from her mortgage servicer, Wells Fargo. For months, she had sent the bank the financial documents it requested to process her modification. But each time she called to check on the request, she was told to send her paperwork again. 
 ''I submitted the paperwork three times, and nothing happened,'' said Mrs. Giguere, 41, who has a high school education and worked as restaurant manager before losing her job. 
 On Thursday, something happened. She questioned a Wells Fargo official about the bank's lack of response -- under oath. 
 The spectacle of a high-ranking banking executive being grilled by an ordinary homeowner was the result of an unusual decision by Judge Randolph J. Haines of the United States Bankruptcy Court to summon a senior executive from Wells Fargo to appear in Mrs. Giguere's bankruptcy case.
 At the hearing, Judge Haines made it clear that he was acting out of concerns about Wells Fargo's mortgage modification practices generally.
 ''This is certainly not an isolated case,'' he said. ''The kind of story I hear from this debtor is one that I and other bankruptcy judges around the country are hearing over and over and over again.''
 With consumers complaining about the difficulty of getting any response from their mortgage servicers, the effectiveness of the Obama administration's plan to provide homeowner relief is being threatened. As they wait for an answer on whether they might qualify, homeowners are succumbing to foreclosure and bankruptcy proceedings and winding up in courts -- at times in front of judges who are also frustrated. 
 Ms. Giguere filed for bankruptcy protection as she was trying to keep her three-bedroom house in a Phoenix suburb, where she lives with her 15-year-old son. Representing the bank at her hearing on Thursday was Joseph Ohayon, senior vice president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Servicing.
 Under preliminary questioning by one of the bank's lawyers, Mr. Ohayon stated that Mrs. Giguere had repeatedly failed to provide a financial worksheet, a critical document in processing a loan modification.
 Under cross-examination by Mrs. Giguere (who had a little assistance from Judge Haines), the bank's defense withered. From her files, Mrs. Giguere produced a letter from Wells Fargo describing the paperwork that she needed to file for a loan modification. In the witness chair, Mr. Ohayon read the letter. 
 ''Mrs. Giguere is right,'' Mr. Ohayon concluded. ''The letter did not ask for a financial worksheet.''
 Experts said the hearing in Phoenix reflected rising frustration by federal bankruptcy judges with mortgage servicers, which process payments for banks and the investors who own large pools of loans. In recent months, judges in Ohio and Pennsylvania have chastened mortgage servicers for failing to process payments properly and for errors in foreclosure filings, among other concerns. 
 ''The judges are seeing more and more of a pattern of indifference to record-keeping and good business practices,'' said Robert Lawless, a law professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in bankruptcy law.
 One of the biggest complaints by homeowners has been poor communication by mortgage servicers on the status of their applications for loan modifications. In the case of Mrs. Giguere, Wells Fargo decided back in March shortly after she faxed the bank her application that she did not qualify for the Home Affordable Modification Program. 
 She did not learn of the bank's decision until Thursday. 
 ''When did you tell the debtors that their loan was no longer being considered for modification?'' Judge Haines asked Mr. Ohayon. 
 ''We haven't. They've never been told,'' said Mr. Ohayon, adding: ''Customer communication is something we're taking a serious look at, your honor.'' 
 The hearing with Wells Fargo did not result in any sanctions against the bank for its failure to provide timely information to Mrs. Giguere about her mortgage modification application. But the bank did pledge to improve its communications with customers and to explore avenues for increasing the ease with which homeowners can seek loan modifications. 
 Wells Fargo has also scheduled a three-day seminar at the Phoenix Convention Center, beginning on Tuesday, in which customers who have submitted loan modification applications can meet with a bank representative in person and learn whether their application has been approved or denied.
 Wells Fargo has been criticized for its slow pace in modifying mortgages under the Treasury Department's foreclosure prevention initiative, which was begun in April. The bank has started trial modifications on about 20,000 home loans under the program, or 6 percent of those who meet the program's guidelines. JPMorgan Chase, by comparison, has begun modifications on nearly 20 percent of such loans. The banks' information was issued in a recent report from the Treasury on the progress of the program. 
 At the hearing, Wells Fargo blamed a series of revisions in the program by the government for the slow pace. 
 It has also pledged to renew negotiations with Mrs. Giguere over modifying her home mortgage. Yet difficult financial circumstances make it unclear whether she will ultimately be able to keep her home, mortgage modification or not. She has recently gone on food stamps and is receiving free state medical aid; her $240 weekly unemployment check is her main form of income. 
 When her home shot up in value, she refinanced it several times, pulling out equity to pay off credit card debt and other expenses. She and her husband are divorcing, and he is no longer willing to help pay the mortgage. With little in savings, she has not made a full mortgage payment since November.
 ''I'm not perfect, I'll be the first to admit that,'' Mrs. Giguere said. ''I've fallen behind.''

HEADLINE: Japan's New Leader Seeks To Reassure U.S. on Alliance

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Scrambling to mend fences with his country's biggest ally, Japan's next leader, Yukio Hatoyama, told President Obama and the United States ambassador on Thursday that the American alliance was the basis of Japanese foreign policy.
 In a phone call Thursday with the White House, he reassured Mr. Obama that he would not change the alliance with the United States, Mr. Hatoyama said. It was his first conversation with the president since his party defeated Japan's long-governing incumbent party in Sunday's landmark election.
 ''We reaffirmed that the Japan-U.S. alliance is the foundation'' of Japanese foreign policy, Mr. Hatoyama told reporters. 
 Mr. Hatoyama was seeking to quell worries that his slightly left-of-center government -- elected after an almost uninterrupted half-century of rule by the conservative, pro-American Liberal Democratic Party -- would pull Japan away from the United States.
 During the campaign, his party, the Democratic Party, promised to seek a more ''equal partnership'' with Washington and build closer ties with China and other Asian countries. But the biggest problems were caused by an essay by the Stanford-educated Mr. Hatoyama, published in The International Herald Tribune and on the Web site of The New York Times, that called Japan's ailing economy a victim of American-led globalization. 
 The resulting stir in Washington presented Mr. Hatoyama's inexperienced government-in-waiting with its first crisis. American criticism of the essay was front-page news in Japanese newspapers on Thursday, reflecting the still widely held sentiment here that Japan must stay close to the United States, especially with a fast-rising China and nuclear-armed North Korea nearby.
 Mr. Hatoyama has tried to control the damage in recent days, stressing that he has no intention of fundamentally altering the alliance, although his party wants some minor changes to agreements covering the 50,000-strong American military presence. He has also said the essay was misunderstood, and not intended to be anti-American.
 Still, Japanese political analysts have been sharply critical of Mr. Hatoyama for failing to manage his image, and for letting the essay be an early statement of his views to the world.
 ''The article itself is minor,'' said Koji Murata, a professor of international relations at Doshisha University in Kyoto. ''But the sense of timing of Mr. Hatoyama and those around him raises substantial doubts about his diplomatic sense.''
 According to Mr. Murata and others, the matter also reflected the lack of information about Mr. Hatoyama and his party in Washington, which had grown used to decades of dealing with the Liberal Democrats, while largely ignoring the opposition.
 Mr. Murata also faulted American officials for their immediate negative reactions to the Democrats' campaign pledges, like re-examining an agreement to relocate the Marine Corps airfield at Futenma to another site on the Japanese island of Okinawa. 
 ''If they say things like Futenma is not negotiable, this will just make the Democratic Party become more obstinate,'' Mr. Murata said. 
 Mr. Hatoyama met for 45 minutes on Thursday with the new United States ambassador, John Roos, a California lawyer who was a fund-raiser for Mr. Obama.
 ''We spent a lot of time talking about how to enhance and deepen the relationship across a broad range of issues, not only strategic issues, but scientific issues, cultural matters,'' Mr. Roos told reporters.
 Mr. Hatoyama said that he told Mr. Roos that the alliance ''should be further strengthened in a constructive, future-oriented manner.'' 
 Mr. Hatoyama described his 12-minute phone conversation with Mr. Obama as friendly and constructive.

HEADLINE: Bernanke: Greenback's New Father

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Six months after the financial world seemed to be coming to an end, the world's economies appear to be recovering. Banks that seemed to be on the brink of failure less than a year ago are now able to pay back investments made by the Treasury.
 It is too early to declare victory, but the world looks much safer than it did only a few months ago. Credit markets are recovering, to the point that the junk bond market will have its best year ever if it manages not to lose any money over the rest of 2009. The stock market has just finished its best six months since 1938. 
 If victory is to be had, it will owe a lot to the willingness of American policy makers to set aside cherished policies and simply create money. And that is one reason it is appropriate to pause and celebrate an unheralded bicentennial: The father of the greenback, Elbridge Gerry Spaulding, who was born 200 years ago, in 1809.
 Spaulding was that rarest of creatures, a man who succeeded in both business and politics; a congressman who saw a problem coming and had a solution ready. It was he who, at the end of 1861, figured out that the American government simply needed to print money to pay for the Civil War. It was economic heresy then, but without it this country might not have survived.
 Such an idea was then dismissed by some as ''fiat money,'' money that is money not because it is backed by gold or silver, but because some government says it is money.
 That such currencies can fail to work is obvious, as those who lived in Weimar Germany or present-day Zimbabwe have found out. But notwithstanding those examples, the last 20 years deserve to be remembered as the age of fiat money. For much of that time, central bankers were revered as heroes for engineering long booms and short, shallow recessions.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the current chairman of the Federal Reserve, sometimes does not seem to understand that this reputation has taken a hit. After he warned that ''a perceived loss of monetary-policy independence'' could lead to ''reduced economic and financial stability,'' he drew a taunting comment from Dean Baker, an economist with the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington.
 ''Maybe Mr. Bernanke missed it,'' wrote Mr. Baker, ''but his independent Fed gave us the largest financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression. Does anyone really think that things would have been worse if the Fed had been more accountable?''
 Mr. Bernanke did not miss it, of course. He may have been slow to realize how critical the situation was, but when he did, he acted decisively. Like Spaulding almost 150 years ago, he showed a willingness to abandon the wisdom of an earlier time. The government lent money it did not have to financial institutions, and bought stock in them.
 The Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet to an unprecedented extent, and seemed to be guaranteeing almost everything in sight. Given how closely the Fed worked with the Bush and Obama administrations, it may not have reinforced its reputation for independence, but it was certainly a pioneer in innovation.
 Today Spaulding is largely forgotten. Civil war generals are remembered with monuments and even colleges; Spaulding has a dormitory named for him at the University of Buffalo.
 But some deem him a hero. ''If Wall Street had saints, then the college of financial cardinals would surely canonize Elbridge G. Spaulding,'' wrote T. J. Stiles in his insightful new biography of Cornelius Vanderbilt, ''The First Tycoon.''
 Spaulding, wrote Mr. Stiles, ''performed a true miracle: he conjured money out of nothing, and so contributed more toward the Union victory (and the future of New York's financial sector) than any single battlefield victory.''
 How did he do that? A congressman from Buffalo, and a banker before and after he was a politician, he was chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee when the government was in danger of running out of money to pay for the Civil War. He wrote a law that allowed the government to print money and declare it had to be accepted as legal tender. 
 Until then, the only circulating paper money was notes issued by banks. Those notes were supposed to be convertible into gold, although the banks had been forced to suspend such conversions at the end of 1861. There was no central bank. 
 To opponents, Spaulding's plan was simply immoral. ''It will infinitely damage the national credit,'' warned Representative Justin S. Morrill of Vermont, adding that it was ''a breach of the public faith'' that would lead to rampant inflation. 
 ''This fair fabric of our untarnished faith and unbounded wealth and credit ought not to be destroyed,'' added Representative Valentine B. Horton of Ohio. ''It will,'' forecast Representative Roscoe Conkling of New York, ''proclaim throughout the country a saturnalia of fraud, a carnival for rogues.''
 The bill passed Congress not because anyone thought it was good policy absent a crisis, but because most thought it was necessary. Something very similar can be said about the government's multiple bailouts during this crisis.
 In the end, Spaulding was proved right. ''It was at once a loan to the government without interest and a national currency, which was so much needed for disbursement in small sums during the pressing exigencies of the war,'' he wrote years later in his book, ''History of the Legal Tender Paper Money.''
 He even created a floating currency. Gold dollars still existed, and were the only dollars that could be used for international trade. When the war appeared to be going badly for the North, the value of the greenback sank. Someone with first knowledge of a Union victory could gain a quick profit by selling gold for greenbacks.
 Contrary to the expectations of Representative Morrill, paper money did not set off sharp inflation over time, and when the paper money eventually was made convertible into gold, there were no lines of people wanting to trade in paper for bullion.
 Mr. Bernanke's eventual reputation is likely to be determined by how well he succeeds in his vow to right the economy without prompting a major devaluation of the dollar.
 Some doubt he can do it. ''The Fed, which saw none of this coming, now asks us to believe that it will see clearly enough into the future to remove this massive monetary stimulus before it becomes harmful,'' said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
 If Mr. Bernanke does manage to accomplish that, he, like Elbridge Spaulding, will have earned financial canonization.

HEADLINE: Call Grows In Europe To Limit Bonuses

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH and JULIA WERDIGIER; Julia Werdigier reported from London, and Matthew Saltmarsh from Paris.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Seven European finance leaders have called for far-reaching curbs on bonuses for bankers in a strongly worded draft paper to be presented at a meeting on Friday of G-20 ministers in London.
 Citing the ''insatiable greed'' of some financial players and their ''destructive irresponsibility,'' the draft calls for the G-20 to impose a policy that would prohibit guaranteeing bonuses for more than a year and would require that bonuses be spread over several years. ''Bonuses should reflect the individual's and bank's true performances over time,'' the draft said.
 Whether the efforts pay off with anything more than a political statement remains to be seen. Other countries, including the United States, have indicated they have different priorities. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has declined to comment on specific proposals by European governments and has played down expectations of any significant announcements. On Thursday, Mr. Geithner called the gathering on Friday a stock-taking meeting, not a new initiatives meeting. He is expected to discuss an administration proposal aimed at requiring banks to maintain larger capital cushions.
 Separately, on Thursday, the British leader joined his German and French counterparts in a statement calling for a universal deal to restrict bonuses when leaders of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging nations meet in Pittsburgh on Sept. 24-25.
 That statement was not as strident as the document signed by the finance leaders.
 Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, declined to sign the paper, which said that banks were ''taking advantage of good results for the first quarter to pretend that the crisis was only a minor setback,'' according to a draft copy obtained by The International Herald Tribune.
 Mr. Darling was reluctant to sign the document because he will be chairman of the G-20 meeting in London on Friday, according to the British Treasury.
 Other European officials said they suspected that Britain had not decided whether it wanted to go as far as Paris and Berlin in cracking down on bonuses.
 Either way, pressure is growing on London and Washington for concrete steps to ensure that traders' rewards do not encourage risky activity. The United States has moved to rein in compensation of companies that have received federal assistance, but it has shied away from regulating bonuses on a broader scale.
 The draft has the blessings of the finance ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Sweden, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, and Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, chairman of Eurogroup, which sets economic policy for the euro zone. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France also wants the G-20 to consider caps on the total bonus pools -- even linking such pools to the banks' investment revenue -- and on individual bonuses. 
 The position of Britain is less clear. Its watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, backed G-20 suggestions last month, saying bonuses should not be guaranteed for more than a year and should be spread over three years. But it narrowed the number of companies to which the guidance would apply.
 In the leaders' letter published Thursday, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Mr. Sarkozy laid out three broad principles on compensation that should be translated into binding rules for financial institutions at the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh.
 Bonuses should be ''kept at an appropriate level in relation to the fixed remuneration and must depend on the performance of the bank, the business unit and the individuals,'' the three leaders wrote. Businesses that do not comply with the rules should be sanctioned on a national level.
 Mr. Brown has agreed on the need to regulate bonuses, but he has appeared less enthusiastic about global caps and penalties.

HEADLINE: Let's Get Fundamental

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
If I were magically given an hour to help Barack Obama prepare for his health care speech next week, the first thing I'd do is ask him to read David Goldhill's essay, ''How American Health Care Killed My Father,'' in the current issue of The Atlantic. That essay would lift Obama out of the distracting sideshows about this public plan or that cooperative option. It would remind him why he got into this issue in the first place.
 Goldhill's main message is that the American health care system is dysfunctional at the core. He vividly describes how the system hides information, muddies choices, encourages more treatment instead of better care, neglects cheap innovation, inflates costs and unintentionally increases suffering. 
 The essay is about the real problem: the insane incentives. Goldhill is especially good on the way the voracious health care system soaks up money that could go to education, the environment, economic development and a thousand other priorities. Health care, he writes, ''simply keeps gobbling up national resources, seemingly without regard to other societal needs.'' 
 Then I'd ask Obama to go to the Brookings Institution Web site and read a report called ''Bending the Curve: Effective Steps to Address Long-Term Health Care Spending Growth.'' This report was written by a bipartisan group of battle-tested experts, including Mark McClellan, David Cutler, Elizabeth McGlynn, Joseph Antos and John Bertko.
 This report also focuses on the key issue: perverse incentives. It's got a series of proposals on how to restructure insurance markets, reorganize provider payments, change the way effectiveness-research findings are implemented and cap the employee tax deduction.
 These aren't pie-in-the-sky ideas. The authors have combed through the bills that are already out there. They've taken good ideas that are now in embryonic or neutered form. They show how the ideas would work if fully implemented. We're not going to revolutionize 18 percent of the American economy overnight, but these proposals would put us on the path toward real reform.
 We're not on that path right now. Several months ago, President Obama made a promise: People with health insurance would be able to keep exactly what they have.
 We all understand why he made that promise. He wanted to reassure people who are happy with what they've got. He wanted to mollify the industries that have a vested interest in the status quo.
 But Obama's promise sent the reform effort off the rails. It meant that efforts to expand coverage marched ahead, but efforts to fundamentally reform the system got watered down. 
 Instead of true reform we got a series of bills that essentially cement the present system in place. The proposals do not fundamentally challenge the fee-for-service system. They don't make Americans more accountable for their own health care spending. They don't reduce costs. They just add more people into the mess we've got. 
 The president made this promise to ease passage. But it ended up hollowing out the substance of the reform. And the political benefits didn't even materialize. Voters are still spooked by the costs, the centralization and the cuts they are sure will come.
 If I had a magic hour with the president, I'd tell him this is his ninth-inning chance. He can stay on the current path. He might be able to pass some incremental bill that extends coverage. But he won't have tackled the fundamental problems that first drove him to this issue. He won't have cut health care inflation. He won't have prevented a voracious system from bankrupting the nation, defunding the schools, pushing down wages and impoverishing the young.
 On the other hand, he can shift back to the core issue: the perverse incentives that make this system such a mess. He can embrace proposals--like the Brookings proposals or, more comprehensively, the Wyden-Bennett bill -- that address the structural problems instead of simply papering over them.
 This remains a politically risky strategy. There are many industries that have an interest in making sure health care spending rises to 20 percent of G.D.P., and then 22 and then 24. But the president's in political hot water already. He got there trying to dodge the hard issues. He might as well be there because he's fighting for something real.
 There are many people telling him to go incremental. They're telling him to just enlarge the current system a bit and pay for it by pounding down a few Medicare fees. But did Barack Obama really get elected so he could pass the Status Quo Sanctification and Extension Act? 
 This is not the time to get incremental. It's the time to get fundamental. Reform the incentives. Make consumers accountable for spending. Make price information transparent. Reward health care, not health services. Do what you set out to do. Bring change.

HEADLINE: Biden Defends Federal Stimulus Program

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The boss was away at Camp David. The battle over health care was set for next week. So it was left to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to protect the administration's other flank here Thursday with a strong defense of the federal stimulus program.
 Arguing that the stimulus helped avert what some had feared would be a second Depression, Mr. Biden took on critics who call the stimulus a ''grab bag'' of too many programs. ''It doesn't reflect a lack of design,'' Mr. Biden said in a speech at the Brookings Institution. ''That was the design.'' 
 Mr. Biden said that the stimulus law was not a ''single silver bullet'' but rather ''silver buckshot.'' He tried to dispel the notion that the $787 billion stimulus bill was essentially a giant public works program -- which may have taken root when the administration billed it as the biggest investment in infrastructure since the creation of the Interstate highway system -- by noting that the money was divided between tax cuts, aid to struggling states and to the unemployed, and only partly to infrastructure spending.
 He noted that one of the stimulus law's central goals was to bring relief to those who have been hardest hit in the recession. ''I know my Republican critics think that we shouldn't do that,'' he said. ''Maybe that's the difference between being a Democrat and a Republican. I'm not being facetious. It's a legitimate disagreement.''
 In his speech, which came 200 days after the stimulus bill was passed, Mr. Biden characterized its progress by saying, ''We're at the nine mile mark of this marathon.''
 The administration's website indicates that by its own accounting of the $787 billion program, roughly 19 percent of the money has begun coursing through the economy: $88.8 billion in spending that has actually been paid out through federal agencies, and another $62.5 billion in the form of tax cuts.
 The debate over the stimulus has taken on new importance as President Obama prepares to make his final push for a health care bill. With distrust of government fueling some of the public skepticism about an overhaul of the health care system, the administration is holding up the stimulus as an example of a government program that works. The argument was made tougher when the unemployment rate rose above what the administration originally predicted when it pushed for the stimulus bill's passage. 
 So Mr. Biden cited a range of economists who credit the stimulus with boosting economic activity, and who say that it has already helped create or save between half a million and a million jobs -- a notoriously difficult calculation to make. ''Without it we'd be in much deeper trouble,'' he said. 
 Still, with officials bracing for the unemployment rate to continue its rise, Mr. Biden cautioned that ''There's going to be positive economic news, and there's going to be negative economic news.'' 
 In discussing his efforts to ride herd on the nation's governors as they implement the bill, Mr. Biden revealed that he had spoken to all 50 governors except one -- and he made it clear he was referring to the one he debated last year in St. Louis, former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. 
 ''I have now spoken to every single governor expect one, who is now a former governor,'' he said, to laughter, before hastening to add that it was just scheduling difficulties that kept them from speaking. ''It wasn't by design.''
 At the end, he was asked about health care. He told the audience to tune in to president Obama's address to Congress next week. ''One thing I've learned,'' he said. ''Don't step on the boss's lines.''

HEADLINE: New Snag For Oracle In Sun Deal

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris, Steve Lohr from New York, and Miguel Helft from San Francisco.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
European regulators delayed the proposed takeover of Sun Microsystems by the software company Oracle on Thursday, indicating that the combination could squelch the growth of a popular, free corporate database program owned by Sun.
 The decision by the European Commission to extend its investigation into the deal, worth $7.4 billion, is especially sensitive because the Justice Department has already approved the merger. Regulators in the United States questioned Oracle's market power in some areas of its business but raised fewer concerns than the Europeans about open-source software.
 The European Commission's assertiveness has conflicted in the past with the Justice Department's judgment. It has objected to mergers of American companies on several occasions, but in 2003, it outright rejected the merger of General Electric and Honeywell after the American authorities approved it. Mario Monti, competition commissioner at the time, said that G.E. would become too dominant in markets for aircraft engines. 
 In recent years, Mr. Monti and Neelie Kroes, the current European Union competition commissioner, have found themselves at odds with some of their American counterparts over whether to force Microsoft to change its Windows operating system.
 American and European antitrust officials, legal experts say, agree far more often than they differ, other than in a handful of cases. ''But there are somewhat different sensitivities,'' noted Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. ''Even after the change in administrations in Washington, the American level of concern about postmerger price increases tends to be less than in Europe. And European antitrust officials are more protective of consumers and more confident of the beneficial consequences of intervention.''
 Samuel R. Miller, a partner at Sidley Austin in San Francisco who acted as special trial counsel for the Justice Department's first antitrust case against Microsoft, said, ''This action reflects a continued pattern of aggressive antitrust enforcement regardless of whether the companies are based in Europe, the U.S. or Asia.''
 Oracle has tussled with European Union regulators in the past over its ambitions but has overcome initial opposition. In 2004, the commission approved Oracle's acquisition of PeopleSoft without conditions after subjecting the deal to the kind of in-depth inquiry now under way over its purchase of Sun. The Justice Department had opposed that merger, but lost in a legal battle with Oracle. The following year the European commission also approved Oracle's acquisition of Siebel Systems, again without conditions.
 In announcing the decision Thursday, Ms. Kroes warned that the acquisition could hamper development of an important software product owned by Sun, which specializes in computer hardware. The product, MySQL, is the most widely used corporate database software in the world, and it competes with software produced by Oracle.
 Ms. Kroes said preserving access to open-source software was vital when much of the world, including Europe, might just be emerging from a deep slump.
 ''In the current economic context, all companies are looking for cost-effective IT solutions and systems based on open-source software are increasingly emerging as viable alternatives to proprietary solutions,'' Ms. Kroes said. She said a longer investigation was needed ''to ensure that such alternatives would continue to be available.''
 Oracle had no comment on the action. 
 The commission has at least three months, or until Jan. 19, to decide whether to clear the deal or issue an order blocking it.
 European and American antitrust authorities have sought to narrow their differences in recent years in an effort to avoid disputes that have marred trans-Atlantic relations this decade.
 Antitrust experts said the decision to investigate the effects on open-source software of Oracle's acquisition of Sun showed that differences persisted between American and European regulators.
 ''Europeans still have a lot more concerns than Americans about companies using strong or dominant positions to create bottlenecks for competitors in the information and technology sectors,'' said Peter Alexiadis, a partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who is based in Brussels.
 ''Any whiff of dominance over different platforms used to deliver information raises particular concerns,'' he said. ''This may in part explain why Europeans, who are used to multiple business traditions, might be less inclined to view Oracle's traditional strengths in databases as not posing competitive concerns.''
 Mr. Alexiadis also noted that a German company, SAP, was an example of a European software company that fiercely competes with Oracle on a number of relevant markets affected by the deal.
 In the beginning, writers of open-source software did not see it as a source of profit. More recently, companies with open-source operations have begun making large amounts of money on those products by providing support services to go along with them. That bundle of software and service is still often priced at a discount to software sold by companies like Oracle.
 A major concern cited by European investigators was what would happen to MySQL once Oracle took it over.
 They expressed concern that Oracle would have an incentive to stymie the development of MySQL as a way of improving the sales of its competing database products.
 Some experts said the concerns of Ms. Kroes were probably unfounded.
 Bo Lykkegaard, an analyst with IDC in Copenhagen, said Oracle had bought Sun for a variety of reasons and that MySQL was not among Oracle's priorities.
 Even so, Mr. Lykkegaard said that Oracle, by keeping MySQL's open-source status, would be able to develop parts of its business by reaching out to small companies or departments within large companies that were seeking value-priced software for running operations that were not necessarily ''mission critical.''
 Another issue that may have led the Europeans to take more time with the case is the way that Oracle has handled regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.
 Oracle notified European Union regulators of its deal in late July, more than two months after it informed American officials.
 European merger watchdogs can take a dim view if companies spread out their notifications between jurisdictions over long periods of time, and they have said in the past that such tactics might be aimed at pressuring the Europeans to give the green light to takeovers already approved in the United States.

HEADLINE: Frolicking in a City Ankle-Deep in Pools

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
When Matthew Keiser and his daughter, Mia, needed to cool off with a swim the other day, they climbed to the roof deck of their pre-Civil-War loft in TriBeCa and plunged into their own sleek custom steel infinity pool whose disappearing edge seems to merge with the looming downtown towers of the city's municipal acropolis. 
 Kelvyn Jackson in the Bronx took his daughter -- also named Mia -- for a dip in their family pool on the same sweltering August afternoon. Theirs sits on the ground visible from the clattering No. 1 elevated train and came in a box from Target. 
 Two Mias, two New York families, two gritty urban settings, two very different swimming pools. 
 Yes, Palm Springs disbelievers, New Yorkers also have their private pools, albeit mostly seasonal and now nearing their end-of-summer apotheosis. In-ground, above-ground or underground, inflatable or portable, behind fenced-in backyards, in alleyways, on high-rise terraces or tucked into billionaire penthouses, they are often invisible to the casual passerby, but not to air travelers who spot them winking in the cityscape below like shards of Navajo turquoise or Chinese jade.
 ''It's like sometimes I say, 'Is this real?' '' said Louis Hernandez, a retired police officer, who excavated his backyard in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, with pick and shovel to build his gleaming blue 25-by-12-foot pool, carrying out the soil through his brownstone in five-gallon buckets.
 New York City's pools number certainly in the thousands, with the census in space-precious Manhattan -- the unlikeliest of private swimming pool habitats -- at close to 100, according to pool suppliers and property brokers. 
 That includes aquatic spectacles like the Keisers's watery aerie, and the 48-foot-long top-floor indoor lap pool with workout gym of a TriBeCa neighbor, Steven Schnall, a venture capitalist and real estate developer, in another building, on North Moore Street.
 Long celebrated is the Roman-style pool in the double-wide former Guccione Mansion at 14-16 East 67th Street, sold last year to the hedge fund investor Philip Falcone for a near-record $49 million. And no, said his spokesman, Charles V. Zehren, Mr. Falcone would not allow even a tiny peek. 
 Seen by viewers of ''Sex and the City'' but also off-limits to the idly curious is the legendary 12th floor rooftop pool lined with hand-painted blue Spanish tiles atop the soaring 11,000-square-foot triplex at 704 Broadway that the Israeli entrepreneur and architect Jonathan Leitersdorf sold in 2007 to the supermarket mogul Ronald Burkle for $17.5 million. 
 Lesser known is an indoor private pool at 3 East 94th Street, according to a former owner, and an eight-room duplex condo with private outdoor pool at 51 Walker Street whose occupants also declined a look, said the property's agent, Edwin Cabrera.
 But in Princes Bay, Staten Island -- the most rural and pool-besotted of the boroughs -- Frank D'Amato was proud to show off his extravagant saltwater pool with fountains and water slide where his children Rosina, 12, and Frank, 9, and their Yorkie, Chloe, frolicked alongside a brickwork piazza with a koi pond, TV screens visible from any angle, bar, grill and pizza oven. 
 ''It started out as new kitchen cabinets and went a little out of hand,'' said Mr. D'Amato, 47, a commodities broker, who estimated the project ''sort of snowballed'' to around $250,000. But he said, ''I'm a pool fiend.''
 You could say that too of Mr. Keiser, 37, a diver, sailor and marketing entrepreneur whose Internet startup LiveIntent connects fans and followers with brands and personalities on Twitter and Facebook and whose new stimulant snack, Perky Jerky, caffeine-infused beef jerky, is just reaching store shelves.
 After buying half of the cast-iron 1857 Cary Building running along Church Street between 89 Reade Street and 105 Chambers Street, Mr. Keiser, inspired, he said, by his friend Mr. Leitersdorf, spent unspecified millions and three years in renovations, including about $500,000 on a 17-by-11-foot steel roof-deck pool with a current, designed by Diamond Spas in Frederick, Colo. To bear the weight, the roof was reinforced with 51-foot steel beams that had to be trucked in at night through a closed Lincoln Tunnel, at additional thousands billable to Mr. Keiser. ''People say to me, 'What, are you out of your mind?' '' he said, shrugging. ''Other people buy Ferraris.'' 
 He and his wife, Adriana, and Mia, now 3, moved in last September, keeping the pool open and heated to 94 degrees through the winter. (They have since been joined by a son, Pax, now 9 months.) In the pool, they are visible to gawkers in surrounding buildings but say they don't mind. ''There's no point in having all this if you can't show it, right?'' said Mrs. Keiser, a fashion executive. 
 The same afternoon, on Godwin Terrace in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, Mr. Jackson, 28, an unemployed father who lives with his mother, father and brother, hoisted his year-old Mia into a tube in their 12-foot round above-ground pool overlooking their backyard vegetable garden and a Rite Aid parking lot under the elevated train. ''We got it last year at Target, on sale for $300,'' Mr. Jackson said. Maintenance was reasonable, he figured -- about $60 in chlorine tablets for the season. And come fall, he said, ''there's a drain in the parking lot; we'll take it apart and put it back in the box.''
 In neighboring forested Fieldston, Lewis and Hindy Weinger and their children, Natan, 6, Azriel, 4, and Liya, 2, spend evenings after work and camp cooling off in the collapsible 15-foot round pool the family found on the Internet five years ago for $250. ''The reality is when you're lying on a lounge chair in the pool, you don't know how deep or big it is,'' said Mr. Weinger, 50, chief financial officer of a real estate company.
 Of course, no borough has land for pools like Staten Island, where Anthony and Donna Rugolo in Eltingville spent $50,000 on a pinch-waisted pool 32 feet long and up to 16 feet wide, created by Nick Tsoukas of Grecian Pools in Eltingville, who also built the D'Amatos's pool. Mr. Rugolo, 45, a contractor, grinned at the tireless cannonball leaps of their daughters Lauren, 13, and Brianna, 10, and friends and called it ''one of my best investments -- I always know where they are.'' 
 In the heights of Dongan Hills,, Paula Cecala also entertained a crew of splashing teenagers: her sons, Joseph, 18, and Anthony, 16, and their friends at her pool decorated with a mural of a Sicilian landscape. The week before, she and her husband, Glenn, an auto mechanic, had thrown Joseph a prom party for 100 classmates at the pool. 
 Elsewhere, the possibilities scale down. On 62nd Street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, James and Kim Basile, schoolteachers, find their 12-foot collapsible backyard pool a welcome antidote to classroom pressures, despite maintenance headaches like the algae bloom from recent rains that turned the water green. As Ms. Basile struggled with a pool vacuum the other day, her husband called out helpfully, ''Want me to get you the ladder, hon?'' 
 There may be no more modest and beloved pool in the city than the 10-foot-round, blue plastic 30-inch high Intex model from Target in an alleyway on 36th Street in Astoria, Queens, where Michelle and Joe Mifsud, immigrants from Malta, and their children, Joey 13, Jared, 10, and Mary 7, splash around on hot days. ''It's enough to keep you cool,'' said Mrs. Mifsud, a teacher. 
 Mr. Hernandez, 68, the retired police office in Brooklyn, said he had little idea what was in store when he decided 10 years ago to build hisin-ground pool in the backyard of his brownstone on 45th Street.
 Disdaining an excavator's estimate of $2,000 as exorbitant, he decided, he said, to do it himself, recruiting Mexican workers and friends. It ended up costing him $2,400 for the hole, plus $12,000 for the pool installation and $800 for the brickwork and coping.
 ''It was worth every bucket,'' said his wife, Carmen. Their grandson, Anthony, 10, had a particularly good time in the water this summer. ''You don't see too many pools like this,'' Mr. Hernandez allowed. But he said, ''if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't do it.''

HEADLINE: Unemployment Hits 9.7% Despite Slower Job Losses

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The unemployment rate surged to 9.7 percent in August, signaling that joblessness and financial anxiety were likely to endure in millions of American homes for many months.
 The Labor Department's latest employment report, released Friday, added weight to a growing belief that, at least technically, the economy had already escaped the grip of recession. Though 216,000 net jobs vanished in August, the losses continued to moderate from their worst numbers of the year.
Yet the report also lent credence to a deepening consensus that, even as the economy resumes expansion, the recovery was likely to be weak, prompting most companies to hold back from aggressive hiring. 
 ''In the context of a full-blooded recovery, this report is disappointing,'' said Alan Ruskin, an economist with the Royal Bank of Scotland in Stamford, Conn. ''We're still clawing our way back.''
 Many experts envision a jobless recovery, in which the economy grows but job losses persist. That would reprise the end of the last recession in 2001, when payrolls continued to decline for nearly two years afterward.
 Such an outcome would confront the Obama administration with a potentially nettlesome political problem heading into next year's midterm elections. After the government unleashed $787 billion to stimulate economic growth, and after it bailed out financial institutions and the auto industry, the unemployment rate exceeds worst-case projections envisioned by the administration early this year. 
 On Friday, Jared Bernstein, the top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the picture would look far worse were it not for the stimulus spending. He added that more help was on the way as the government distributed the remaining two-thirds of the package.
 ''Our interventions have contributed to significant cuts in the rate of job loss,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''We're headed in the right direction, but we're far from out of the woods. There are simply too many Americans seeking work.''
 If the jobless rate continues to climb, as is widely expected, that could generate pressure for another stimulus spending package. But given intensifying concern about the size of federal budget deficits -- now projected to exceed $9 trillion within a decade -- any new spending could be politically perilous. 
 The latest snapshot of the nation's labor situation testified to the drastic improvement since early this year, when nearly 700,000 jobs a month were disappearing. Yet it also underscored the continued bleakness of the economic landscape.
 ''It's a good picture compared to where we were, which was just a free fall,'' said Dean Baker, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''But compared to anything else, this is just a horrible report. The rate of decline is slowing, but it's not going to stop. We're likely on a path toward more than 10 percent unemployment.''
 Most economists see recent improvements as the result of pulling away from the disaster of last fall -- when the investment giant Lehman Brothers collapsed, spreading fear throughout the financial system -- and not a sign of vigorous growth ahead.
 After years of borrowing against soaring home values, tapping credit cards and harvesting stock market winnings to spend in excess of their incomes, millions of households are being forced to conserve. That limits consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of the nation's economy. And that makes businesses that might otherwise hire and expand more inclined to hunker down.
 ''Household balance sheets are shot,'' Mr. Ruskin said. From here, spending ''has to come from income, and income has to come from employment, and at this juncture it looks like employment will only improve very slowly.''
 The unemployment rate is up from 9.4 percent in July, when the economy lost 276,000 jobs.
 The jobs report underscored the broad reach of the labor crisis, which has imposed austerity even on those still employed. In the last year, average weekly earnings have increased by only 0.8 percent -- a decline, after factoring in the rising cost of goods. So many companies have trimmed working hours that paychecks have shrunk.
 The so-called underemployment rate -- which counts the jobless along with those working part time because their hours have been cut or they cannot find full-time jobs -- reached 16.8 percent in August.
 In recent months, the economy has benefited from a slowdown in the pace at which businesses have slashed inventories, prompting factories to expand production. Auto sales have been aided by the cash-for-clunkers program, which gave buyers incentives to trade in cars. Home sales have been stimulated by a tax credit for first-time homebuyers, an inducement that expires in November. 
 After those programs wear off, the nation may again confront a fundamentally weak economy. 
 ''Everybody is looking around saying, 'Where is a robust recovery going to come from?' and not finding it,'' said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ''We're going to have elevated unemployment for four years to come.''
 In Williamsburg, Va., Ginny Hoover, 49, has remained unemployed since she lost her job at a pharmaceutical company in November 2007. She has maxed out her credit cards and borrowed money from friends. She broke her apartment lease and moved in with her boyfriend. But other than an offer to sell insurance door-to-door for commissions only, she has found no work.
 ''I thought maybe a month or two and I'd have another job,'' Ms. Hoover said. ''I never would have guessed that it would be as brutal as it was out there.''
 Despite increased factory production, manufacturing shed 63,000 jobs in August. Construction lost 65,000 jobs. Health care remained a rare bright spot, adding nearly 28,000 jobs.
 ''I don't think businesses will hire back anytime soon,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics. ''Companies are rewarded by the stock markets for not hiring and keeping their costs down. We will see another jobless recovery.''
 In Delray Beach, Fla., Donna Angelillo lost her job as a property manager in May and quickly exhausted her savings. Her $1,000 monthly unemployment check does not cover her $1,030 monthly rent. 
 Jobs are scarce, she said. Past-due bills are abundant.
 ''I don't have September rent, but right now I'm more concerned about the electricity,'' she said. ''Either today or tomorrow, they're going to shut it off. I'm getting desperate.''

HEADLINE: The Cloud Hanging Over Skype

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Early this week, eBay announced that after four years of owning Skype, the popular, and free, online phone service, it had sold the company to an investor group for around $2 billion. The investors included the Silicon Valley private equity firm Silver Lake Partners; Marc Andreessen's new venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz; a London firm called Index Ventures; and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Under the terms of the deal, eBay will retain a 35 percent stake in Skype, giving it a valuation of $2.75 billion. 
 Many people on Wall Street -- and a number of telecommunications experts I spoke to this week -- were stunned by the price Skype sold for, and not just because we're in the middle of a recession. In 2005, when eBay bought Skype from its founders, Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstrom, it paid $3.1 billion. But the company had performed so poorly that by the fall of 2007, eBay had been forced to take a $1.1 billion write-down. 
 Around that same time, Mr. Zennstrom, whose relationship with eBay management had turned acrimonious, stepped down as Skype's chief executive. (Mr. Friis had already left the company.) Although Skype's performance has improved since the installation of a new chief executive last year, it was no secret that eBay was trying to unload it. Many potential buyers had walked away, believing that eBay simply wanted too much.
 There is another reason that the Skype deal has raised eyebrows, however. Not long after Mr. Friis and Mr. Zennstrom left the company, they became embroiled in a dispute with eBay that has turned into a very nasty lawsuit.
 It turns out that in selling Skype to eBay, Mr. Friis and Mr. Zennstrom retained control of a key part of the Skype technology, which they licensed to eBay. Although the details are under seal in a London court, the Skype founders' essential complaint is that eBay tampered with their software, and in doing so, violated the terms of the licensing agreement. They were demanding that Skype be forced to stop using the technology, which, for all intents and purposes, would mean shutting down Skype itself. The case is set for trial in 2010.
 Companies are sued all the time, of course. But this lawsuit feels different; to put it bluntly, it feels more dangerous than the typical lawsuit aimed at a corporation. In a court hearing in London last June, eBay's lawyer told the court that if Mr. Friis and Mr. Zennstrom won the case, the result would be ''devastating.''
 In its financial documents, eBay says that it is ''confident'' of its legal position. But it also acknowledges that an ''adverse result'' could mean that the ''continued operation of Skype's business as currently conducted would likely not be possible.'' That is hardly your typical corporate boilerplate. Indeed, after that court hearing in June, a telecom analyst named Jayanth Angl told Bloomberg that ''if eBay can't reach an agreement over that piece of technology, that could certainly turn the Skype acquisition into a debacle.''
 And so, the mystery of the Skype deal: why were the winning bidders willing to pay so a high price for a company whose very existence could be threatened by this lawsuit? One possibility is that they have nerves of steel. The other is that they know something nobody else does.
 Skype was not Mr. Friis's and Mr. Zennstrom's first company. No, that was the infamous Kazaa, a peer-to-peer company that the two men founded in 1999, not long after Napster showed the world exactly how easy it was to steal copyrighted music using peer-to-peer computing. By 2001, the recording industry, having routed Napster, turned its sights on Kazaa. 
 Going after Kazaa was tougher because it was located somewhere in Northern Europe, outside the purview of United States law enforcement. (No one knew exactly where.) The Kazaa founders moved periodically to keep the recording industry from being able to subpoena them, and for years, they stayed away from the United States for the same reason. But the recording industry kept up the pressure, and as their legal costs mounted, Mr. Friis and Mr. Zennstrom finally decided to get rid of the company and move on.
 Former Skype executives will tell you that the Kazaa experience did a lot to shape Mr. Friis's and Mr. Zennstrom's approach to business. It made them extremely secretive. They almost never talk to the press. (They didn't speak to me for this column.) And it also made them extremely protective of the technology they created. Which is why, long before they sold Kazaa, they moved their peer-to-peer software into a new company, called JoltID.
 In 2003, when they started Skype, that same technology that had powered Kazaa became an important part of the Skype code; it was the means by which computer users connected to each other and created a larger network. (VoIP -- voice over Internet protocol -- was the means by which they spoke to each other online.) But Skype never owned the technology; JoltID did.
 Why eBay was willing to go along with such an arrangement when it bought Skype two years later will forever be a puzzle. But so long as the two men remained part of the eBay ''family,'' it didn't matter much. Any changes to the peer-to-peer code were ones they approved. 
 When the deal went sour, however, and the founders left eBay, that all changed. And when eBay continued to tinker with the code -- something eBay contends it has a right to do under the license -- they entered into negotiations that went nowhere. Finally, by March of 2009, the two sides had sued each other.
 At the same time, the founders, together with some big private equity firms, including Elevation Partners in Silicon Valley (yes, the Bono firm), and General Atlantic in New York, were trying to buy back Skype. It was, after all, their one big success. (Their third start-up, Joost.com, has gone nowhere.)
 It is hard to know precisely what happened next. EBay claims that all the bidders were treated the same, and that the losers simply didn't put up as much money as the winner. But according to supporters of the Skype founders, their investing consortium made three serious efforts, over the course of a year, to bid for the company. Every time, they say, they were stiff-armed by eBay's investment bankers. About a month ago, they wrote a letter to eBay protesting their inability to get a hearing for their proposals. 
 And maybe the Skype founders did try to buy back the company on the cheap. The sense I got, however, is that the founders would have been willing to come up with a price that suited eBay -- if they had been able to enter into negotiations. What is clear is that the bad blood that had developed between eBay and the founders was infecting the potential negotiations over a buyback of the company. (EBay denies this.) 
 And then, a few months ago, out of the blue, came the $2 billion bid from the Silver Lake consortium. One way it has dealt with the litigation risk is by persuading eBay to assume 50 percent of any losses resulting from the lawsuit. But that still doesn't mitigate against the possibility that the founders could win the lawsuit -- and put their creation, Skype, out of business.
 So why were they willing to bid so high? One theory is that the Silver Lake people think they can win in court. Indeed, if by next summer the two sides are still arguing in court, we'll know that is the answer to the mystery. That is the ''nerves of steel'' theory.
 But how likely is that? In this environment, big-time private equity firms don't commit $2 billion if there is a serious possibility the company they've just bought might be put out of business. As it happens, not long before Index Ventures becameinterested in Skype, it brought on board a man named Michelangelo A. Volpi, a highly respected former Cisco executive who -- hmmm -- once sat on the Skype board. In fact, he was so well liked by the Skype founders that they hired him to run Joost. Wouldn't you know it? Joost uses the same peer-to-peer technology as Skype and Kazaa.
 Mr. Volpi told me that not long after he arrived at Index Ventures, he discussed the possibility of making a run at Skype -- and he and another Index Ventures partner, Danny Rimer, in turn rounded up Silver Lake and Mr. Andreessen, who -- hmmm -- sits on the eBay board. (As soon as he got involved with the bid, Mr. Andreessen recused himself from any board discussion about the Skype sale.) In the end, Mr. Andreessen committed $50 million to the deal -- a very large percentage of his $300 million venture fund. 
 So another theory: because of his friendship with the Skype founders, Mr. Volpi believes he'll be able to settle the lawsuit. Rich Tehrani, the president of TMC, a telecom publishing company, told me that he had just come from a conference where rumors were rife that the Silver Lake consortium had already cut a side deal with the Skype founders. (All the parties deny this.)
 The third possibility is that Mr. Andreessen and the others have figured out a technology ''workaround'' so they no longer have to rely on the JoltID technology, something eBay had already begun working on. But almost everyone I spoke to said such a workaround would be, at best, difficult and expensive -- and could cause such severe disruption to Skype's business that it might never recover.
 It is, alas, unsatisfying to delve into a mystery like this and not be able to solve it. But over time, it will become clear. Either the case will linger, and we'll know that Silver Lake, Andreessen et al. do indeed have nerves of steel. 
 Or it will quickly go away, which will provide an answer of a less seemly sort. The mission of Skype, after all, is to shrink the world and bring people together.

HEADLINE: Teenage Unemployment Rate Reaches Record High

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Pity the unemployed, but pity especially the young and unemployed.
 This August, the teenage unemployment rate -- that is, the percentage of teenagers who wanted a job who could not find one -- was 25.5 percent, its highest level since the government began keeping track of such statistics in 1948. Likewise, the percentage of teenagers over all who were working was at its lowest level in recorded history.
 ''There are an amazing number of kids out there looking for work,'' said Andrew M. Sum, an economics professor at Northeastern University. ''And given that unemployment is a lagging indicator, and young people's unemployment even lags behind the rest of unemployment, we're going to see a lot of kids of out work for a long, long, long, long time.'' 
 Recessions disproportionately hurt America's youngest and most inexperienced workers, who are often the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired. Jobs for youth also never recovered after the last recession, in 2001. 
 But this August found more than a quarter of the teenagers in the job market unable to find work, an unemployment rate nearly three times that of the nonteenage population (9 percent), and nearly four times that of workers over 55 (6.8 percent, also a record high for that age group). An estimated 1.64 million people ages 16-19 were unemployed.
 Many companies that rely on seasonal business, like leisure and hospitality, held the line and hired fewer workers this summer -- a particular problem for teenagers.
 In Miami, 18-year-old Rony Bonilla spent past summers busing tables at restaurants and working at the Miami Seaquarium. He said he set out to find another job this summer, but dozens of businesses, like Walgreens, Kmart and Chuck-E-Cheese, turned him down. Mr. Bonilla said he and many of his friends were unable to find any job offers beyond commission-only employment scams.
 ''I'm looking for anything to pay the bills,'' he said. ''You name it, I applied. And I never even heard from them.''
 Expecting record unemployment among youth, Congress set aside $1.2 billion in February's stimulus bill for youth jobs and training. As with everything stimulus-related, supporters, like Jonathan Larsen of the National Youth Employment Coalition, say the money has tempered a bad situation, although the overall numbers are dismal.
 Economists say there are multiple explanations for why young workers have suffered so much in this downturn, but they mostly boil down to being at the bottom of the totem pole.
 Recent college graduates, unable to find higher-paying jobs, are working at places like Starbucks and Gap, taking jobs once held by their younger peers. Half of college graduates under age 25 are in jobs that do not require college degrees, the highest portion in at least 18 years, Mr. Sum said. 
 Likewise, the reluctance or inability of older workers to retire has led to less attrition and fewer opportunities for workers to move up a rung and make room for new workers at the bottom of the corporate ladder.
 Increases in the minimum wage may have made employers reluctant to hire teenagers, said Marvin H. Kosters, a resident scholar emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute. 
 High teenage jobless rates may also be distorted by other factors. The ability of more young people to rely on family may allow them to be pickier about jobs and therefore to stay out of work longer than they did in previous recessions, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.
 Additionally, with more students applying to college, the remaining pool of job applicants may be less desirable to employers.
 ''Maybe the most employable kids pull out of the labor force, making the numbers for what percent of kids are looking for jobs appear even worse,'' said Harry J. Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute.
 The decision of more young people to attend college, which could help them increase their earning potential later in life, may be one silver lining of the recession, economists say. Similarly, back when graduating from high school was a rarer achievement, the Great Depression pushed potential dropouts to stay in high school because work was so hard to come by. 
 But there is a bit of a catch-22: Many college students need to work to pay for college. Half of traditional-age college students work 20 hours a week, Lawrence F. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard, said.
 ''In today's labor market, the big margin comes from going on to college, not just graduating high school,'' he said. ''Unlike the decision to finish high school, that's not something you can do free of tuition.''

HEADLINE: Planned End to Bus Service Would Cut Lifeline for Rural Canada

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WINNIPEG, Manitoba 

 BODY:
Each day, a single Greyhound bus pulls into Ethelbert, Manitoba, population 312, and stops for just five minutes before moving on, a critical lifeline for the village's fragile economy. 
 But in a potentially painful blow to hundreds of small towns like Ethelbert, Greyhound plans to pull out of Manitoba and northern Ontario next month. 
 If the company, a subsidiary of Britain's FirstGroup, follows its plan, a huge swath of rural Canada will lose a crucial link with the rest of the world. Greyhound Canada, the country's largest intercity bus line, said Thursday that the longstanding routes were unprofitable. It said it might end bus service across Western Canada unless it gets government help. 
 ''It brings lots of people into the store and the town,'' said Robert Rewniak, 46, who owns a grocery store that also functions as Greyhound's bus stop. Greyhound is also Ethelbert's sole connection to larger communities, and a critical link for elderly people traveling to medical appointments. 
 ''First we lost our railway,'' Mr. Rewniak said. ''Now we're going to lose all our bus service. These towns are really shrinking, and nothing's helping at all.''
 Rural Canada has been in decline since the 1930s, when mechanization let farms grow and populations shrink. In later decades, the pullout of railway lines and the steady reduction of grain elevators meant that jobs and more people moved away. 
 The remaining sparse and far-flung population is a difficult market for transportation companies to serve. Competition on well-populated routes results in lower fares, which make it harder for a cross-country carrier to subsidize smaller, money-losing routes.
 It is unlikely that another company will fill Greyhound's void, said David Jeanes, president of Transport 2000 Canada, a consumer advocacy group. 
 ''The markets for many of these small towns just aren't big enough to sustain any sort of replacement service,'' he said. ''On the merchandise side, there are small businesses that are absolutely dependent on it. We've seen hospitals that use the bus parcel service to deliver their blood products.'' 
 Small towns are likely to face major problems unless the federal government steps in, he said.
 Richard Rounds, a retired professor of rural development from Brandon University in Manitoba, said the private sector may look at running scaled-down buses or passenger vans between towns, as has happened in the United States. 
 One passenger waiting outside Winnipeg's bus terminal on Friday, Richard Belhumeur, 38, a railway worker, said he rides a Greyhound bus about 100 times a year from Birtle, Manitoba, to the provincial capital, Winnipeg, to catch flights to job sites.
 ''I count on the bus,'' he said. Losing it ''would wreak havoc.''
 Small planes and local bus services also bring people from remote aboriginal communities to the cities. ''People need this kind of transportation,'' said Jeremy Monias of the Garden Hill reserve in northern Manitoba.
 Mr. Monias and his family were boarding a bus from Winnipeg to Brandon, to catch a connecting flight to the reserve.
 ''This is a good thing to fall back on if you don't have a ride,'' he said. ''Hop on a bus.''

HEADLINE: A Playbook Underwritten by Deep Pockets

BYLINE: By THAYER EVANS

DATELINE: STILLWATER, Okla. 

 BODY:
The turnaround in T. Boone Pickens's financial portfolio is far from complete. He talks openly about the ''huge hit'' he has taken during the recession and the millions of dollars that have drained from his fortune. 
 But as college football season kicks off this weekend, his attention will be diverted briefly from reviving his riches to the reversal of fortune for his beloved Oklahoma State Cowboys. 
 Pickens, the 81-year-old Texas oil tycoon, is considered in many circles to be the ultimate booster. His $458 million in contributions to Oklahoma State in recent years -- with more than half going to athletics -- has financed academic programs, helped erect state-of-the-art facilities and even provided athletes Las Vegas-style buffet meals every night.
 And when the No. 9 Cowboys open the season here on Saturday against No. 13 Georgia, they will be part of more than just a marquee game on college football's opening weekend. They will also take the first step this season toward answering a question on many minds: Can bushels of money help a university buy a national championship in football? 
 ''I think we could win,'' Pickens said in a telephone interview. He asked rhetorically how soon it could happen, then answered that it was possible -- though not likely -- this season. ''You've got to have breaks.''
 Oklahoma State is in the preseason top 10 for the first time. The program has never competed in a Bowl Championship Series game, and it often unsuccessfully fights Oklahoma for headlines in its own state, let alone nationally. Yet things are lining up differently this season, from the high-profile opener to the preseason ranking to the completion of the home stadium bearing the Pickens name. 
 ''It sets up very well,'' said Pickens, who graduated with a geology degree from Oklahoma State in 1951. ''We've got to deliver now.''
 Pickens's impact can be felt all around campus, including at the recently finished $180 million west end zone project in Boone Pickens Stadium. As buildings have risen, so has the optimism. 
 ''He's given us hope when there was very little if any before,'' Mike Holder, Oklahoma State's athletic director, said in a telephone interview. ''He's given us hope that we've got a chance to compete with the very best teams in our conference and collegiate football. It's a drastic, drastic change from where we've been for the last 50 years.''
 With that influx of money and hope has come a change in attitude from Pickens. 
 When he made a contribution of $165 million in the 2005-6 academic year, he said he stressed to Holder and Coach Mike Gundy that the football team should have a goal of being competitive in every game. But after the Cowboys were ranked as high as No. 6 last season and finished 9-4, he had a new message for them.
 ''Now,'' Pickens said, ''we're going to win.''
 That is considered much more feasible this season because Oklahoma State has several offensive players among the nation's best at their respective positions:
 Quarterback Zac Robinson, whose heath has been shaky during preseason camp, has played in the shadow of Colt McCoy at Texas and Sam Bradford at Oklahoma. But Robinson is one of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in college football. 
 Tailback Kendall Hunter is a slippery runner who led the Big 12 in rushing last season.
 Wide receiver Dez Bryant takes over Michael Crabtree's role as perhaps the most dominant receiver in the conference. 
 Left tackle Russell Okung is a candidate to be the first pick of April's N.F.L. draft.
 All of them are aware and appreciative of Pickens's gifts, and they hope to reciprocate. 
 ''As much as he's put in to us,'' Okung said, ''we want to give it back in wins and making him happy.''
 The offense was not the problem last season, when the Cowboys averaged 40.77 points a game and ranked sixth in the Football Bowl Subdivision in total offense at 487.69 yards a game. It was their anemic defense, which ranked 93rd in the nation last season. 
 Bill Young, the new defensive coordinator who was brought in from Miami, is the third person to hold that position in Gundy's five seasons. Young will have three new starters in the secondary, and the feeling is that the Cowboys could not get much worse. 
 In losses to their three top opponents last season -- Texas, Oklahoma and Texas Tech -- the Cowboys yielded 1,277 passing yards and 13 touchdown passes, and allowed the teams to complete just over 78 percent of their passes. 
 Pickens said there was nowhere for Young to go but up. 
 ''He's got to get us a defense,'' he said. ''He's got a good job, but a very tough job.''
 Yet it is Pickens's job as a major donor that is very much in demand in modern major-college football. 
 ''You have one of him on your team, it's going to be your most valuable player every year,'' Holder said.
 When Pickens met Florida Coach Urban Meyer five years ago, he said Meyer essentially told him the same thing. During that conversation, Pickens said, he asked Meyer what else he could do for Oklahoma State's football team beyond financial contributions.
 ''Be there for every game,'' Pickens recalled Meyer saying. ''And make sure they know.''
 So Pickens attends Oklahoma State's football games and does so by flying to them in his private jet. In fact, he said, victories by Oklahoma State had helped him get through the financial crisis. 
 ''What's it all about in business or in athletics?'' he asked. ''It's winning. If we're winning, sure it gives me a boost.''
 And that feeling is contagious on campus. A championship has not come yet, but the money has brought hope of one. 
 ''I think fans of Oklahoma State University now believe that it's possible,'' Burns Hargis, the university's president, said by telephone. ''Not necessarily this season, but I think they feel like we're on the course to compete at that level. I assure you that was certainly not the attitude before all this started.''
 And it all flows back to Pickens. 
 ''Money, I'm telling you, it can do anything,'' Okung said. 
 Now there is just the small matter of winning games.

HEADLINE: At Early Forum on Trade, Few Signs of Concessions

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
After two days of meetings, trade ministers said on Friday that they were ready to resume negotiations on a long-stalled free-trade agreement. But they appeared to have made little progress on bridging the differences between developing countries and the United States that had scuttled the deal. 
 Trade ministers from 36 countries said Friday that they were committed to completing the nearly eight-year-old trade talks known as the Doha round by the end of 2010. But the tenor and substance of the comments suggested that few were willing to make the concessions needed to achieve that goal. 
 The global downturn, which analysts say has led to increased protectionism, was a strong undercurrent at the meeting. While the delegates said the downturn made reaching a deal imperative, some acknowledged that it also made it harder for negotiators to sell free trade to political leaders who want to protect farmers and businesses back home. ''At this point of the game, we all have empty pockets, notably after the outset of the world economic crisis,'' Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, said. ''Many of us -- and frankly I see no exception -- have difficulties to live up to the efforts and reforms that the new commitments will require.''
 A deal would involve rich countries opening their markets for farm produce and cutting agricultural subsidies. In return, the wealthier developing countries, like India and Brazil, would lower tariffs on industrial goods and services. Advocates say this would help lift poorer countries out of poverty by increasing trade and growth.
 India's trade minister, Anand Sharma, hosted the two-day meeting to try to restart talks that collapsed in July 2008. Many analysts and ministers have blamed differences between India and the United States for that failure.
 Mr. Sharma said trade officials and negotiators would meet at the headquarters of the World Trade Organization in Geneva on Sept. 14 to prepare an agenda for renewed negotiations. ''There has been a breakthrough in this meeting,'' he said.
 The director general of the W.T.O., Pascal Lamy, was more restrained. He said negotiators still had ''tough nuts to crack.'' 
 ''What happened in these last two days was a reality check: do they have the political will'' to engage in negotiations, Mr. Lamy said. ''The unanimous answer is yes.''
 Even as ministers said they were ready to talk, they remained locked into positions they had held for months. Brazil said that developing countries had given all they could and that developed countries must make bigger concessions. The United States, however, insisted that the advanced developing countries must open their markets further to goods and services, in part because the deal thus far would not pass muster with Congress.
 Analysts and trade officials say the Obama administration, more than its European and Japanese counterparts, faces difficulty in selling a free-trade deal to a Congress preoccupied by health care, rising unemployment and the war in Afghanistan.
 The two camps appear still to disagree even on how to negotiate. The United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, pressed for more bilateral talks in which countries provide details of how they intend to enact agreements.
 ''Some nations want to maintain the flexibility of telling you what they want to do later,'' Mr. Kirk said. But that ''makes it more difficult for us to go to our constituents'' for approval.
 Leaders in the developing world said they were not interested in extensive bilateral negotiations, in which they worried they would be pressed to make concessions that would hurt their favored industries. 
 ''The consensus which was ringing and very strong was for a multilateral process,'' Mr. Sharma said.
 He remained coy about whether India was willing to give more ground on agricultural trade. The July 2008 deal was scuttled in part because India insisted that developing countries must be able to steeply and quickly raise tariffs at the first sign of a sharp increase in food imports.
 Just as in the United States, there remains significant opposition here and in other developing countries to reducing trade barriers in agriculture and industry. 
 On Thursday, hundreds of farmers protested the trade talks in the heart of New Delhi. Rally organizers said a softening of India's stance would ''ruin the peasantry and small and medium industries.''

HEADLINE: Construction Loans Falter, a Bad Omen for Banks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
EVEN as the economy may be starting to recover, banks across the country are confronting a worsening outlook for their construction loans, an area that boomed for much of the decade.
 Reports filed by banks with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation indicate that at the end of June about one-sixth of all construction loans were in trouble. With more than half a trillion dollars in such loans outstanding, that represents a source of major losses for banks.
 Construction loans were highly attractive in recent years for many banks, particularly smaller ones without a national presence. One reason was that other types of loans were not easy to make. A handful of big banks came to dominate credit card loans, for example, and corporate loans were often turned into securities. 
 Construction loans, however, needed local expertise and were not easy to standardize. In a booming real estate market, there were few losses on such loans. 
 The problems now extend well beyond loans for the construction of single-family homes, where banks have been taking losses and cutting back their commitments for a couple of years. At the end of June, $173 billion in construction loans related to single-family homes was outstanding, barely more than half the peak level reached in the fall of 2006, when the housing market was booming.
 It is in commercial real estate construction -- be it stores or office buildings -- that the pain seems likely to rise. At the end of June, $291 billion in such loans was outstanding, down only a few billion from the peak reached earlier this year.
 ''On the commercial side,'' said Matthew Anderson, a partner in Foresight Analytics, a research firm based in Oakland, Calif., ''I think we are fairly early in the down cycle.''
 Foresight estimates that 10.4 percent of commercial construction loans are troubled, but expects that to increase as the year goes on.
 The definition of troubled loans used in the accompanying charts includes loans that are at least 30 days past due, as well as those on which the bank identified problems that led it to stop assuming that interest on the loans would be paid.
 It is possible that some of the rapid rise in problem loans represents pressure from regulators to admit problems, rather than new problems. The number of newly delinquent loans seems to have declined in the second quarter, although it is hard to know if that is a trend that can continue. But the number of loans that the banks do not expect will be fully repaid has soared.
 The reports that banks file with the F.D.I.C. do not include details on all types of construction loans, nor on where the construction is. That information is estimated by Foresight, based in part on where each bank operates and on disclosures in other company reports.
 Foresight estimates the biggest problems are in loans for condominium construction, with 38 percent of all construction loans troubled. Mr. Anderson says even that might be an understatement. He pointed to Corus Bank, a Chicago institution that specialized in condo loans. Its latest report shows that its capital is gone and that it expects losses on two-thirds of its construction loans. 
 Foresight's estimates of the proportion of problem construction loans in the 20 largest metropolitan areas has one surprise: the one with the largest proportion of troubled loans is Seattle, where the recession has started to pinch. But it is also notable that just one of the 20 areas has less than 10 percent of construction loans in trouble. A year earlier, most of them were below that level.

HEADLINE: When Babies And Broadway Intersect

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Not long after the actress Sharon Wheatley wrote her first parenting column in the Actors' Equity Association's newsletter, a reader e-mailed her to say he had heard about a parent support network for actors a few years earlier -- but it turned out to be for people who were transitioning out of theater.
 The mix-up did not surprise Ms. Wheatley, 41, a mother of two and a Broadway veteran with the distinction of having performed in ''Cats,'' ''Les Miserables'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera.'' 
 ''The minute you say, 'I'm having a kid,' I swear to God, people hear, 'I'm getting out of the business,' '' Ms. Wheatley said. 
 Given the challenges of being a parent and a working actor, it's not the craziest assumption. Who could be expected, as a pregnant Ms. Wheatley did, to take a look at the touring schedule for ''Phantom'' and determine that she would need an obstetrician in Providence, R.I., because that's where she was most likely to deliver? In the end, her husband, Rob Meffe, a conductor and a professor of musical theater, landed a job that took them back to New York before her daughter was born. 
 Ms. Wheatley, who is an understudy in ''Avenue Q,'' has a lot of great stories about how she has managed to hold on to both of her roles, mother and Broadway performer; the problem has been finding people who will not just laugh, but nod along knowingly. 
 ''There just aren't a lot of Broadway moms,'' she said at her apartment in Inwood this week, as her 11-year-old daughter, Charlotte, baked oatmeal cookies and her 19-month-old, Beatrix, napped. ''Our childbearing years are exactly the same as our leading-lady years. A lot of women phase out.'' 
 Not enough women even think it can be done, in Ms. Wheatley's opinion, which is why she and the Actors' Equity Association Parents' Committee fought to get her a column in the newsletter, to create a sense of possibility and unity among a group that has yet to coalesce. 
 In that first column, Ms. Wheatley talked about a challenge that every working parent faces but one that poses particular economic hardships for the auditioning actor: child care. It's bad enough having to pay for child care to go to work; imagine having to pay for child care just to beg for the opportunity to work. For Ms. Wheatley, the sunk cost is usually $60 to $80 for the four or five hours it takes to get downtown, audition and come back. Rather than pay for full-time child care, she and her husband usually hire a sitter at the last minute -- sometimes, in desperation, one that her daughters have never met before.
 ''We have ridiculously detailed written instructions on file that I can just hand off because I'm usually flying out the door,'' Ms. Wheatley said. 
 It usually takes about six hours into rehearsal before actors start talking about how everyone there has started to feel like family (even if it's the highly dysfunctional kind). With so many metaphoric families forming and disbanding every day in the world of theater, the old-fashioned kind seems to have little space to flourish. Ms. Wheatley's column is one baby step toward the committee's goal of creating better support for parents in the theater, who often have to negotiate for perks like a nanny's airfare and hotel room when a show hits the road. 
 A day care center catering to the needs and the hours of actors is another dream project of the parents' group (it would also accommodate other workers with irregular hours near Times Square). The Rev. Richard D. Baker of St. Malachy's Church on West 49th Street, which is known as the Actors' Chapel, is raising money to move the plan ahead. 
 ''We see it as a God-given gift these people have,'' Father Baker said. ''They shouldn't have to give up their family.'' 
 When Ms. Wheatley was in her 20s, an agent told her that actors her age were a dime a dozen, that she would have a better shot at stardom in her 40s -- by then, there would be more parts available because her competition would start dropping out to have babies. If Ms. Wheatley had her way, all those women would have their babies and still give her a run for her money.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Players Vie to Tell DeLorean's Story

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
When it comes to developing film biographies, Hollywood has a rule: the more, the messier.
 Having already witnessed collisions involving dueling biographical projects about Truman Capote, Jean Harlow, Pablo Escobar, Bugsy Siegel, Dian Fossey and even Alexander the Great, the movie industry is now eying an epic pileup of about a dozen producers and filmmakers over three separate projects featuring a somewhat unlikely new film hero: the renegade automotive entrepreneur John Z. DeLorean.
 The chase involves players as seasoned as the director Brett Ratner, the producer Robert Evans and the writer James Toback. Their DeLorean project is pitted against a competitor being quickly pulled together by another film veteran, the producer David Permut. Both are squared off against yet another project from a young producing team -- Nick Spicer, Nate Bolotin, Aram Tertzakian and Tamir Ardon -- who are working with Time Inc. Studios; Mr. DeLorean's son, Zachary; and Alex Holmes.
 As it happens, Mr. Holmes, a young British filmmaker, was about to start what would have been a fourth DeLorean project when he instead signed onto the Time Inc. version. 
 Don't look for logic here. 
 Studios have been running the other way from serious biopics since last year, when ''Frost/Nixon'' and ''Milk,'' both from units of NBC Universal, burned up cash in the Oscar contest without getting a matching return at the box office. Sony Pictures Entertainment further tarnished the genre in June by halting its ''Moneyball,'' about the Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane, on the eve of production, though Brad Pitt was set to star and Steven Soderbergh was directing.
 Car industry movies do not have much of a track record, either. ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' had only $20 million in ticket sales in 1988, and ''Flash of Genius,'' released in 2008, in which Greg Kinnear played an engineer who invented the intermittent windshield wiper, stopped short at $4.4 million.
 ''It's about people wanting something they can't have,'' David Friendly, a film producer who is not in the DeLorean race, suggested of the perennial biographical matchups. As a journalist, Mr. Friendly in 1986 wrote about a face-off between Warner Brothers and Universal Pictures over competing projects about Ms. Fossey, the slain gorilla expert. The studios wound up sharing ''Gorillas in the Mist.''
 Filmmakers have been chasing the DeLorean story at least since 1984. That year Mr. DeLorean -- famous as a high-living executive who left General Motors and started making sporty stainless-steel cars named after himself, with doors that opened upward like wings -- was acquitted after being tried on charges of selling cocaine to prop up his failing company.
 ''John was really reluctant to make an endorsement'' of any film project, said Mr. Ardon, 29, who bought a vintage DeLorean car and then became acquainted with the carmaker himself, who died in 2005 at age 80. Mr. Ardon spent years making a still-unfinished documentary about Mr. DeLorean before becoming involved with Mr. Spicer, Mr. Bolotin and Mr. Tertzakian, who are partners in XYZ Films.
 With Mr. DeLorean's death, his life rights were no longer an issue for would-be filmmakers. More recently, the troubles of America's car companies have kindled new interest in a man whose struggle against the system was inherently cinematic. 
 ''What makes it prescient, his story, just look at GM and the auto companies, where they are today,'' said Mr. Permut, who got hooked on the DeLorean project while shooting ''Prayers for Bobby,'' a television movie, and ''Youth in Revolt,'' a theatrical film, in Michigan last year.
 More precisely, Mr. Permut met one of Michigan's best-known citizens, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who introduced him to one of the state's best-known lawyers, Mayer Morganroth, who had represented Mr. DeLorean in many of his legal tangles. 
 Interviewed by telephone this week, Mr. Morganroth said he is now an executive producer of Mr. Permut's project, which he said would be based in no small part on himself. ''It's my life rights, regarding John, over 10 1/2 years,'' Mr. Morganroth said of his contribution to the planned film.
 At the same time, Mr. Morganroth said, he has warned Time Inc. Studios, XYZ Films, Mr. Ratner and the DeLorean estate to be careful of his position: he is still owed about $7 million by the estate and would expect to collect the money from any rights it might sell, including those to an unpublished DeLorean memoir.
 William Courtney, a lawyer who represents the DeLorean estate, said the estate had not become involved with any of the projects. But, he said, he has talked to various would-be moviemakers on behalf of Mr. DeLorean's last wife, Sally, who wants any film to reflect ''the great things John has done.'' 
 In much the same spirit, Mr. Spicer said, Zachary DeLorean has become ''an exclusive consultant'' to his project, which he said was based on a wide range of sources, including Hillel Levin's book ''Grand Delusions: The Cosmic Career of John DeLorean,'' and articles in the various Time Inc. magazines over the years.
 None of this is likely to mean much until a major star and either a studio or an independent financier become connected with one or another of the films. According to Mr. Morganroth, that is about to happen with the Permut project. Mr. Morganroth declined to identify the star, and Mr. Permut declined to discuss the matter.
 But persistent Hollywood table talk has said that George Clooney may become involved as the lead actor and perhaps the director, which would clearly give Mr. Permut an edge in the race. ''There have been conversations, and that's all there have been,'' said Mr. Clooney's publicist, Stan Rosenfield. ''There's no deal in place.''
 Meanwhile, Mr. Toback said he was close to finishing his own DeLorean script, based largely on another book, ''Dream Maker: The Rise and Fall of John Z. DeLorean'' by Ivan Fallon and James Srodes.
 No stranger to filmic collisions, Mr. Toback recalled having been flogged by a nervous star, Warren Beatty, to finish his script for what became the 1991 film ''Bugsy,'' about Mr. Siegel. At the time a pair of star writers, Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, were hard at work on another Siegel script. 
 Competitors notwithstanding, Mr. Toback said he intended to deliver his version of the DeLorean story, which is being financed under an arrangement between Mr. Ratner and Reliance Big, the Indian media company that is now supporting DreamWorks.
 As for Mr. Ratner, he said that he had heard the talk about Mr. Clooney -- Mr. Permut mentioned the possibility to him months ago at a premiere -- and that he was not worried.
 ''I'm not even thinking about the other projects,'' he said. His plan, he said, is to join Mr. Evans in pushing Paramount Pictures, where both are based, to start the film soon, with or without a major star.
 ''I just don't think there is a more opportune time to make this movie,'' Mr. Ratner said, echoing Mr. Permut. ''Just because of what's going on with the auto companies, the economy and the world.''

HEADLINE: Where the Jobs Aren't

 BODY:
As is the case with so many economic indicators these days, the only good thing to say about the August jobs report is that it could have been worse. Employers shed another 216,000 jobs last month, a smaller loss than expected and the lowest monthly loss total in a year. 
 The losses would have been worse had it not been for federal stimulus spending -- proof that the government is indeed helping to ease the downturn in its role as the spender of last resort. 
 Still, the damage to the work force caused by the recession is deep, wide and ongoing. The economy is now coming up short by 9.4 million jobs, including 6.9 million positions that employers have eliminated and 2.5 million jobs that were needed to absorb new workers but were never created. 
 And unemployment is on the rise, jumping from 9.4 percent in July to 9.7 percent in August. For several demographic groups, the unemployment rate is already in double digits, including men (10.1 percent), Hispanics (13 percent), African-Americans (15.1 percent) and teenagers (25.5 percent). In all, 14.9 million workers are now jobless, of which fully one-third have been out of work for more than six months, the highest level of long-term unemployment by far in any post World War II recession. There are now nearly six workers available for every job opening, up from 1.7 workers per opening when the recession began in December 2007. 
 Worse, hiring is not expected to rebound anytime soon, even if overall economic growth resumes this year. Employers are likely to fill any additional workloads by adding hours to truncated workweeks and ending worker furloughs. Wage gains, which are always repressed when jobs are scarce and unemployment is high, will be an even longer time coming as employers restore pay cuts put in place during the recession before giving raises. 
 Without job growth and pay raises, consumer spending will not revive substantially because alternative sources of spending power -- home equity and credit cards -- are largely tapped out. And without an upsurge in spending, businesses will not add workers, and so on, in a decidedly unvirtuous cycle.
 It has become commonplace to explain each dismal job report by saying that a resurgence in employment always lags general economic recovery. But with the job market severely wounded, and with consumer spending expected to be weak for a very long time, it could easily take until 2014 for employment to recover. It's safe to say that five years or more of subpar job growth is not what most people have in mind when they think of a ''lag.'' 
 The question, then, is how bad does it have to get before the Obama administration and Congress make job creation a priority. 
 Will administration officials and lawmakers fight for new laws to make it easier to form unions, which are especially important in elevating and protecting the jobs of low-income workers? How will professed support for green jobs be translated into a manufacturing policy that promotes good jobs? Will efforts to improve the educational system also include serious efforts to train and retrain people for new jobs? 
 Help is wanted for out of work Americans.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Says Aid to Airbus For A380 Was Illegal

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK and CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
A preliminary report by the World Trade Organization has found that Airbus received illegal subsidies for the $13 billion A380 superjumbo jet and several other airplanes, hurting Boeing in the battle for sales, American and European officials said Friday.
 But the European Union was not determined to have systematically abused global trade rules, several people with knowledge of the report said. 
 Both American and European Union officials declared victory after the 1,000-page confidential finding was given to trade agencies. It is the first round of an acrimonious trade dispute that began almost five years ago. 
 Representative Norman Dicks, Democrat from Washington, where Boeing makes its jetliners, said he was pleased by what he considered to be a ''very broad'' ruling in Boeing's favor.
 He said that the W.T.O. found that a substantial amount of the low-cost loan money, known as launch aid, that European governments provided to develop the A380 jet was illegal and should be repaid by Airbus.
 Mr. Dicks said a panel of experts from the trade organization found that other series of Airbus planes -- the A300, A310, A320, A330 and A340 -- also benefited from similar improper subsidies. 
 The report is a response to a complaint filed by the United States on behalf of Boeing, which argues that the European Union and its governments funneled billions of dollars in illegal subsidies to Airbus from 1970 to 2004.
 The Europeans stressed, however, that the W.T.O. had rejected many of the specific arguments that were in the complaint. 
 The panel's findings could have a substantial impact on the competition between Boeing and Airbus for a $35 billion contract to build new aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force. Airbus won the contract last year but it was overturned by government auditors, and the Pentagon is expected to start a new bidding process soon.
 Mr. Dicks argued that it would be ''inconceivable'' for the Air Force to reopen the bidding without considering the W.T.O. panel's findings. ''The U.S. government cannot reward illegal market actions that have harmed U.S. manufacturers and stolen U.S. aerospace jobs,'' he said in a statement. 
 The United States had also claimed that Airbus received about $8 billion in research and development and facilities financing. Congressional aides in Washington said that the United States had won some -- though not all -- of those points as well.
 Both Airbus and Boeing have about six weeks to review the finding and comment on it. The trade body is expected to issue a formal ruling by the end of the year. Both sides can appeal that ruling, but W.T.O. rules limit the process to 90 days, making a final outcome likely in the spring.
 European officials who had been briefed on the report said that the W.T.O. panel had rejected 70 percent of the claims in the American complaint.
 ''Reimbursable investment loans for the A380 were not judged to be prohibited in their totality,'' said one person with knowledge of the report.
 American officials who had been briefed on the ruling disputed that the United States had lost on that many points. In some cases, they said, only one of the various arguments needed to be accepted for the panel to find that some subsidies were unfair. 
 Representatives for the European trade commission, the United States trade representative, Boeing and Airbus all said Friday that they were studying the report, and declined to comment.
 The most critical charge, experts said, involved about $15 billion in low-cost government loans to develop Airbus planes. Roughly $4 billion of the loans in question went to the twin-deck A380 jet, which entered service in 2007.
 Boeing lawyers had said that a ruling against Airbus could mean that it will be required to either refinance those loans on commercial terms or otherwise restructure them. Under the current terms of the loans, Airbus makes its repayments as its planes are delivered to customers. Airbus has delivered 18 of 200 orders for the A380.
 The panel's findings do not apply to European pledges of loans to help Airbus develop the A350 widebody jet. France, Germany and Britain have pledged a combined 2.9 billion euros ($4.1 billion) to finance the A350, which is still in the early design phase and is not expected to be delivered until 2013.
 ''This ruling confirms that Boeing has been competing on an uneven playing field for decades,'' said Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington State, who had urged the Bush administration to file the complaint.
 A counterclaim by the European Union, meanwhile, is being reviewed by a separate W.T.O. panel. That suit contends that Boeing has received at least $24 billion in backdoor subsidies through generous contracts with the United States military and space programs, as well as significant tax breaks from Washington State. An interim report on the Boeing case is expected in six to nine months and would be subject to the same comment and appeals process.
 ''It is important to recall that this report is only half the story and must be read together with an interim report on the E.U. case against the U.S. over aid to Boeing,'' said Lutz Gullner, a spokesman for the European trade commissioner, Catherine Ashton.

HEADLINE: Somebody's Watching ... And Ready to Sue

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
FENCES are supposed to make good neighbors. But that wasn't the case with a stone wall in Westport, Conn., which pitted neighbor against neighbor and has cost its owner $150,000 in legal fees -- so far.
 The story of the stone wall began in 2005 when Albert and Susan Hancock built it around their modest 1920s home in this affluent coastal town. While the wall was being built, one of the Hancocks' neighbors filed a complaint with the town. The town sent out inspectors but did not stop construction, though it later filed its own complaints against the Hancocks. Then, last year, the Hancocks' neighbor filed a separate suit claiming that because the wall runs along a private lane, all the homeowners on the road are liable. 
 How and when the story ends is still unclear. But the dispute opens a window into life in a wealthy suburb, where neighbors have enough money to fight for years over an issue that may have been quickly resolved in a less well-off town. In fact, Westport officials say such cases are not all that unusual. 
 ''More than 50 percent of my day is dealing with these disputes,'' said Gordon Joseloff, the first selectman. ''In Westport, the people are very wealthy, and at the first indication of anything, they'll threaten or file a lawsuit.''
 If nothing else, the Hancocks' story is a cautionary tale, illustrating what you should and should not do when your neighbors are watching you.
 The initial complaint about the Hancocks' stone wall was over its proximity to a wetland. The town then raised other issues, like the fact that the wall lay six inches on town property -- even though it was built largely where an old wall had been -- and that the Hancocks had not sought the necessary permits before construction. 
 After four years, the Hancocks have spent some $150,000 on legal expenses and $50,000 for modifications and inspections of the wall. These expenses have already exceeded the $170,000 cost of the wall. But with their case going to Stamford Superior Court on Thursday, Mr. Hancock's lawyer said the couple could spend $150,000 more before the matter was resolved. If they lose, it would cost them at least $120,000 to tear down their wall, not counting any fines.
 Jeffrey and Elizabeth Lillien, the neighbors who filed the initial complaint and the lawsuit last year, say they believe Westport has moved too slowly in the case. They argue that the wall violates environmental laws and that it rests on common property.
 ''The remedy is to remove the wall,'' said Mr. Lillien, a lawyer at UBS investment bank. ''We care about the environment. We care about our property being maintained in a safe and sound manner.'' He added: ''They're trying to turn this into an interpersonal issue. This is a legal issue.''
 The Hancocks counter that the Lilliens are busybody neighbors and say they are angry that the town has allowed the issue to drag on for so long. ''This is wealth destruction,'' said Mr. Hancock, a senior vice president at ING Investment Management. ''It's gone too far.'' 
 Ira Bloom, a lawyer representing Westport, said he did not know how much the town had paid his firm in the case but said he billed the town at a discounted rate of $200 an hour.
 Property disputes are nothing new in wealthy towns. But their effects are more pernicious in a bad economy. A town has to take taxpayer money that could have been spent on schools or the police, while residents have to have the resources to defend themselves. 
 As with all litigation, both sides in the stone wall dispute argue that they are right. But even short of a resolution in the case, there are lessons to draw. 
 GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING. The Hancocks said they inquired about a permit for a stone wall but were told they did not need one because it was under eight feet tall. They did not have a survey because the new wall was largely built on the site of an old one. Philip Law, the builder, said he would testify that he had built similar stone walls without permits or problems in Westport.
 Mr. Bloom, the town lawyer, said they should have gotten approval from the wetlands office, zoning office and building department. They also needed to get an encroachment waiver because of the portion of the wall on town property.
 The problem is the Hancocks have no documentation for their initial conversations with town officials. Yet had the Lilliens not complained about their wall, the Hancocks probably would have been fine, if not legally right. 
 To complicate matters, the Lilliens' suit is steeped in rarely applied town law about sight lines and common property. ''Rules are rules,'' Mrs. Lillien said. ''I guess other people can do whatever they want to do and cram it down people's throats.''
 It would have taken the Hancocks longer to get everything in writing but that might have saved a lot of grief.
 BEWARE THY NEIGHBOR. Both the lawyers for the town and the Hancocks said the driving force behind this has been the Lilliens. The Lilliens argue that the dispute is over principles and is more than a neighborly spat. They also say they have incurred their own legal bills to defend their property rights. 
 ''The reason this has gone on so long is because the town has put that private dispute in the middle of the other issues,'' said Gwen Bishop, the Hancocks' lawyer. ''They've taken that issue and used it to tie everything up.'' 
 The town said it has proceeded cautiously. ''We're not talking Egyptian-Israeli border disputes, but I don't make fun of them,'' Mr. Joseloff, the first selectman, said. ''They're important to these people.''
 And they are fairly common. Alan Spirer, the Lilliens' lawyer, said he had 30 property cases pending, most in Westport. In one, he is representing a woman whose vegetable garden was bulldozed by a neighbor. Typically, he said, these disputes cost clients $7,500 to $25,000 in legal bills.
 BE PREPARED TO LOBBY. Where the Hancocks admit they failed was in community relations. ''We're perceived as really bad guys,'' Mr. Hancock said.
 Local newspaper accounts of one town hearing painted the Hancocks as another wealthy commuter couple who thought they could do whatever they wanted. Yet the problem with class warfare in Westport is it becomes a battle between the haves and the have-mores. The median sale price of a home from May to July 2009 was $970,000, according to Trulia.com. 
 The Hancocks said their image at town meetings would have been different if they had been better at explaining their reason for building the new wall after eight years of living with the old one. On separate occasions, two cars and a town fire truck ran off North Avenue and onto their property. In one accident, only a tree stopped the car from landing in their dining room.
 Their safety concerns were not part of the public discussion, and this shows the importance of making your case early and personally.
 WHAT IS THE GOAL? At the end of the day, knowing how long you will fight is the hardest part. Most of these battles start off simply: one neighbor does something another neighbor dislikes. But then the legal bills, fines and arguing starts. ''If we knew we were going to be $150,000 into this on Day 1 and still only be halfway there, I'm not so sure we wouldn't have just torn down'' the new wall, Mr. Hancock said. 
 Fighting on has taken a toll. They may prevail, but the emotional cost has been high, and they have half-jokingly say they have begun to worry that the wall costs could surpass what they paid for their house.

HEADLINE: Fans Pay Either Way for TV Blackouts

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Mr. Goodell, lift those television blackouts 

 BODY:
-- and let the people of Detroit watch the Lions.
 O.K., the Lions are coming off an 0-16 season, but their fans still deserve to watch them at home. 
 In a city with a wheezing automotive industry and a jobless rate near 30 percent, people need diversions. 
 But N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said he would not waive the blackout policy to accommodate the wreckage of the Great Recession. His predecessor, Paul Tagliabue, properly waived it in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina sent the New Orleans Saints from the damaged Louisiana Superdome to ''home'' games at L.S.U. and in San Antonio. 
 And Goodell should waive it now. The economy, even in a slow recovery, did not physically devastate cities the way Katrina did. But it has devastated millions of lives through widespread layoffs, foreclosures and bankruptcies. In reducing, or eliminating, people's disposable income, the recession has slowed the sale of season tickets.
 But Goodell, on Thursday, affirmed that the league's 36-year-old blackout policy would stay in place.
 ''It's been, I think, very good for the game, for the fans, for the teams,'' he told a gathering of reporters at league headquarters. ''We continue to do what we can, knowing what our fans are going through in this environment.'' He listed various ticket-sale modifications and said that 24 teams had kept ticket prices flat.
 He contended that the economic woes causing N.F.L. ticket sales to slip by nearly 10 percent added up to a short-term problem. We all hope so. But it's been an awfully big short-term problem, hasn't it?
 ''We have 20 teams already sold out for the season,'' Greg Aiello, a league spokesman, wrote in an e-mail message on Friday. ''We have always believed in putting a high priority on selling tickets and filling out stadiums.''
 Full stadiums look better on TV than half-empty ones, which have been all too visible during the preseason.
 But if enough people can't afford the tickets, why penalize a team's hometown fan base with the blackout hammer -- making them drive 75 miles outside the market or searching for a pirated TV or Internet signal to catch the game?
 A Detroit fan, nicknamed BIGorangeD, pleaded with N.F.L. owners on a Lions blog earlier this week: ''Your fans have sacrificed for you. Can't you now sacrifice for them?''
 During Goodell's interview session, he said: ''Now accept that unemployment is 20 percent in Detroit'' -- actually it is 28.9 percent -- ''but things are tough in Buffalo, I can tell you that right now. Things are tough in New Orleans. But New Orleans is sold out for the season and Buffalo's pretty darn close to it.''
 Yes, things are rough all over, whether in Buffalo (where the jobless rate is 10.5 percent), New Orleans (11 percent), San Diego (10.3 percent) or Jacksonville (11 percent), where the Jaguars are in danger of multiple blackouts. The challenge of selling tickets in Jacksonville, he said, may extend beyond economic factors. 
 An economy meaner than any since the 1930s requires that Goodell say more than that 75 percent of the teams have not raised ticket prices or that ticket-selling policies have been eased.
 It requires what's really good for the fans, and that is to lift the blackouts this season. If 20 teams are sold out, then it will be an issue with 12 clubs, some of whom will eventually sell out some or all of their games. 
 What's the worst that can happen -- that fans will see TV images of stadiums that aren't full of fans?
 Last year, four percent of the 256 N.F.L. games were blacked out; five in Detroit, and two each in Oakland and St. Louis. This season, the league expects the number to jump to 25 to 50 blackouts -- a problem, but not a crisis. In the 1990s, there were anywhere from 39 to 88 blackouts, and in the 70s the number peaked at 114.
 Neal Pilson, a sports industry consultant and a former president of CBS Sports, said that Goodell's hewing to the blackout rules underscores how important selling tickets is to the league. ''It's been bedrock policy since they used to black out all home games,'' he said. ''They want people to come to the stadium.''
 But if they can't afford to, why stick rigidly to a policy made for better times? Relax it this season and revisit it next year. And Mr. Goodell, if you don't make this short-term, fan-friendly change, then stream the blacked-out games on nfl.com or let local stations replay the blacked-out games on Monday mornings. 
 You might please loyal fans in economic distress -- and grab some good public relations.

HEADLINE: Why the Cost of College Rises, Even in a Recession

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
If you have paid a college tuition bill recently, perhaps the sticker shock has abated and your children have been good enough to friend you on Facebook so you can see what they are doing on your dime. 
 What probably still lingers, however, is the desire to ask some pointed questions of the people who are doing the educating. Where does all that money go? And why can't the price tag fall for a change?
 Earlier this year, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities announced with some pride that the average increase in tuition and fees at private institutions this school year would be the smallest in 37 years -- 4.3 percent, just a little higher than inflation. 
 Is this where we are supposed to stand up and cheer? 
 To get some perspective, I set out to find a college president with an M.B.A. and some experience outside the academy. I found one at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. Its president, Daniel H. Weiss, is an expert in medieval art, but he also worked as a management consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton. So he knows his way around a corporate restructuring. 
 Lafayette does not have the strongest name recognition and tries to set itself apart through its location near both New York City and Philadelphia, its strong engineering program and liberal arts offerings, and by being one of the smallest colleges to compete in N.C.A.A. Division I athletics.
 That it is not a top-tier college by most measures, however, makes Lafayette an excellent test case as it and other private colleges cross the $50,000 annual cost threshold in shaky economic times.
 Public universities will always appeal on price, and Wellesley and Harvard are likely to remain oversubscribed forever. But Lafayette and colleges like it could have trouble justifying themselves and their cost soon, and the resistance may not simply pass once the economy improves. 
 Tuition costs have gone in only one direction -- up -- during Mr. Weiss's career. ''I genuinely believe that we are at a crossroads here in higher education,'' he said. ''I think we have reached a ceiling that we're beginning to bump into.''
 Mr. Weiss has not had to make any drastic budget cuts so far. He has frozen many salaries, cut some hours in the student dining halls and scaled back a few building projects. 
 This will seem rather tame to anyone who has lived through even a medium-grade corporate revamping. ''We haven't been good at cutting when we add,'' said Robert Massa, Lafayette's new vice president for communications, speaking of colleges in general. ''We just add.''
 Rising tuition and income from endowments have made this possible. But the unique structure of universities has also made it inconvenient to do otherwise. ''In some ways, higher education is more like a political environment than the management of a private corporation,'' Mr. Weiss said. Except that thanks to tenure, it is difficult to vote anyone out of office. Still, he added, ''Alienating some of your faculty members, if you can avoid it, is something you shouldn't be doing.''
 This is just one of the reasons why it is so hard to make big cuts to a college's budget and reduce tuition in turn. Here are some others:
 CUTTING DEPARTMENTS The political challenges with faculty make something as seemingly simple and obvious as cutting expensive and undersubscribed academic departments pretty hard. In fact, Mr. Weiss could not remember the last time Lafayette had done such a thing. 
 But such cuts are practically inevitable for programs that have fewer students. ''Fine arts has studio-based production, so capital and facility costs are high,'' said Jane Wellman, executive director of the nonprofit group Delta Project on Postsecondary Education Costs, Productivity and Accountability, speaking of colleges in general. ''Piano tutoring is pretty much one to one in a room with a piano. Pianos are expensive. Agriculture is expensive because of the lab costs, which means a barn.''
 An English student, however, is generally a profit center. ''They're paying for the chemistry major and the music major and faculty research,'' she said. ''They don't want to talk about it in institutions, because the English department gets mad. The little ugly facts about cross-subsidies are inflammatory, so they get papered over.''
 About all Mr. Weiss will say about this is that he agrees that Lafayette needs to do a better job of discriminating between the things it can and cannot do well. He is too good on the politics to single out any department. But there is little doubt that he and administrators like him will need to give up on some foreign languages, minor sciences or parts of the arts pretty soon. 
 FACULTY PRODUCTIVITY Professors at Lafayette teach five classes a year over two semesters and work with students on their independent research projects. At some colleges and universities, the number of classes is lower and at others it is higher. Couldn't Lafayette lower costs by demanding that the faculty perform less research and teach one additional class?
 ''The question is what is the quality of that interaction,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''Our faculty must have the opportunity to revitalize their teaching through research. If you're teaching the same old course the same old way every year, you're not keeping up with the discipline and not able to animate your own teaching with that experience.''
 Not every academic agrees. ''Am I, for example, as a tenured professor or any tenured faculty member necessarily, or even probably, a better undergraduate teacher because I am doing research?'' asked Burton A. Weisbrod, co-author of ''Mission and Money: Understanding the University'' and an economics professor at Northwestern. ''The answer to that is not clear at all.'' 
 Nevertheless, Lafayette is so certain in its convictions that it grants faculty members a year off every six or seven years for a sabbatical. How does a college defend such a practice to parents who have had to work ever harder to pay the growing tuition bill?
 ''What parents should be looking for is the opportunity for their children to have their lives transformed by what happens inside the classroom and out of it,'' Mr. Weiss said. And that cannot come, he continued, without access to faculty members who have had the opportunity to recharge their own intellectual reservoirs. ''At the end of the day, parents should want their children to have that experience, and we believe that's the cost of it.''
 Still, parents are helping to subsidize those sabbaticals. So the optics around this are all wrong in the current economic environment, even if this is one of those things no one can change. 
 ADMINISTRATIVE OVERLOAD Lafayette, like many colleges, spends more on nonfaculty salaries than it does on pay for the teachers. How did that happen? Mr. Weiss uses the evolution of career counseling as an example. He does not recall whether there was a placement office when he was an undergraduate at George Washington University in the 1970s. ''Now there is the expectation, and I don't think it's misplaced, that students can get help in entering the workplace,'' he said. If Lafayette did not create a rigorous support system, he noted, its graduates would be competing with students from other colleges and universities that had done so. ''And therefore, we've invested very significantly in new administrative staff.'' 
 Security is another area where costs have gone up. Just a quick glance at a dormitory bulletin board gives a sense of the breadth of what security departments deal with thesedays. One posting offered detailed instructions on what to do when encountering a bat, and an eye-opening piece of literature called ''Active Shooter Survival Tips.'' (Yes, I have linked to it from the online version of this story.)
 THREE YEARS Perhaps the biggest cost-saving measure for private colleges like Lafayette would be to allow students to pay the same price per year but graduate in three years instead of four. Hartwick College in New York is already trying this; 13 students have signed on this fall. 
 Mr. Weiss said this is worth considering, though he had not looked at how the numbers would work. ''Although without sounding in any way defensive, we also do offer time for personal development,'' he explained. ''And that is part of what college is supposed to be. Not only to learn stuff but to have your life changed. For some students, three years is more than enough, while for others four years is not nearly enough.''
 He's right, of course. Or at least that is how college used to be. The question all of us have to ask now is whether the price of that transformative experience is simply too dear -- and whether a basic education ought to be the highest (or maybe only) priority.

HEADLINE: How to Manage Dental Costs, With or Without Insurance

BYLINE: By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
MUCH has been said and written about the tens of millions of Americans without health insurance. But often overlooked in these discussions is another vital medical statistic: more than 100 million Americans go without dental coverage. 
 Many employer-sponsored health care plans do not include dental insurance, and those that do will typically offer only limited benefits. Individual private insurance is often too costly to be feasible. And Medicaid and Medicare offer only limited safety nets.
 For most people, a toothache that turns into an expensive procedure like a crown or implant means thousands of dollars out of pocket. Routine checkups, cleanings and fillings can set you back hundreds. No wonder 35 percent of Americans have not visited a dentist in the last 12 months, according to a Gallup report in March.
 Even if you're fortunate enough to have some kind of coverage, you have probably discovered just how little it pays if you have big problems. Most dental policies pay for preventive care like twice-a-year checkups, but cover only a fraction of higher-cost procedures like root canals. Even fillings can get short-changed, if the insurer decides the tooth-colored filler the dentist used was too ''cosmetic'' for the pothole being patched. 
 At the same time, dental care costs are rising faster than inflation, just as the evidence mounts that taking care of your mouth can be a critical gateway to good overall health. 
 The health care bills circulating in the House and Senate include dental care provisions for children, which is good. But it also means that for most of us relief from dental bills is not likely to come soon. That leaves it up to consumers to find smart ways to reduce their dental care costs without sacrificing their oral health. So we asked experts and patients for advice.
 PREVENTION Taking care of small problems keeps them from becoming big ones. Enough cannot be said about prevention, according to Dr. Matthew Messina, consumer adviser for the American Dental Association and a dentist in Cleveland. 
 Left unchecked, a small cavity that would cost about $100 to fill can easily turn into a $1,000 root canal. Skip those $80 cleanings each year, and you may be looking at $2,000 worth of gum disease treatments. An abscess that lands you in the emergency room will set you back hundreds of dollars for the visit, ''and you'll still have to go see a dentist, because emergency rooms don't handle dental work,'' said Dr. Messina. 
 Finally, your dentist also routinely looks for more serious problems, like oral cancer. More than 35,000 cases are diagnosed each year, according to the American Cancer Society. Early detection, usually during a dental checkup, is critical to successful treatment. 
 FULL DISCLOSURE It's important to know the price before you agree to the procedure. Often patients sit down for a routine cleaning and checkup, only to find they have a problem. The dentist offers to take care of the situation on the spot, and the patient agrees -- but then is socked with a surprising bill at the end of the visit. 
 That happened to Monica Gagnier of Beacon, N.Y., on a recent visit to her Manhattan dentist for a twice-yearly cleaning. Looking to save money, Ms. Gagnier was careful to tell the office when she made the appointment that she wasn't due to get X-rays and didn't need to see the dentist for a checkup. Without those two items, she figured she would save more than $100 on her bill. 
 During the cleaning, however, the hygienist told her that her gums were infected and she needed antibiotic shots. Her total bill was $400. 
 ''The antibiotics may well have been necessary,'' Ms. Gagnier said. ''But what I hate is being hit by surprise costs and treatments when I'm lying on my back, my mouth is wide open, and I can't talk about it.'' 
 You should always be given an opportunity to discuss any treatment, sitting up, without equipment in your mouth, says Dr. Messina. In addition, whenever you are facing an invasive dental procedure that is not an emergency, it makes sense to refuse treatment on the spot and get a second opinion, says Elizabeth Rogers, a spokeswoman for Oral Health America, a nonprofit advocacy and education group based in Chicago. 
 The range of prices on treatments like root canals, for instance, can easily differ by $1,000 or more. 
 SPREADING THE COST Patients can often space out treatments or negotiate payment plans with the dentist for extensive work. Working with the dentist on payments, says Dr. Mark Wolff, associate dean at the New York University College of Dentistry, is much better than putting the bill on your credit card and paying high interest.
 Another way to negotiate, says Dr. Wolff, is to plan extensive treatments in phases. Say you need a crown. Your dentist may be able to put in a temporary filling for several months while you use that time to save for the permanent crown.
 ''It's quite possible to phase in many dental procedures,'' said Dr. Wolff. ''And when it is, most dentists are willing to spread the work out over time.'' 
 DENTAL SCHOOL CLINICS Almost every dental school offers affordable care provided by dental students and overseen by experienced, qualified teachers. You can expect to pay as little as a third of what a traditional dentist would charge and still receive excellent, well-supervised care, Dr. Wolff says. 
 That is what Julie Kingsley of Portland, Me., did after a checkup for her two young children at a pediatric dentist set her back a total of $375. ''I realized that was as much as a car payment or a good chunk of our monthly food bill,'' said Ms. Kingsley. ''There had to be a better way.'' 
 Ms. Kingsley started asking around for less expensive alternatives and found out about the University of New England's dental college clinic, at the Westbrook campus in Portland. The bill for her children's latest checkups: $100. 
 Ms. Kingsley was pleased with the quality of care her children received. But she did warn that patients may sacrifice time for money. ''What was a 45-minute visit at the private dentist ended up taking three hours at the clinic,'' she said.
 If you have trouble finding a dental clinic in your area, you can seek help from Oral Health America (oralhealthamerica.org or 312-836-9900). 
 Many communities also subsidize low-cost dental clinics that offer free services to those who qualify, or charge fees on a sliding scale. To find a clinic in your area, you can check with your state's dental director. A state-by-state list is on the Web site of the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors, at bit.ly/kCCo7. 
 DISCOUNT NETWORKS Alternatives to employer-provided dental insurance are often a bad deal, Dr. Wolff said. But for the uninsured, a discount network can make a difference.
 Some networks like those on DentalPlans.com have formed to fill the void. Consumers pay roughly $100 to $200 a year in exchange for 15 to 50 percent discounts on service and treatments from participating dentists. ''Be sure to compare plans carefully,'' said Ms. Rogers of Oral Health America. 
 And, she added, make sure the discounts you are likely to use will be enough to cover the annual fee -- and look carefully for any limits and restrictions.

HEADLINE: Exhilaration as Giant Mall Springs Up in a Strike Against Blight

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Middle America has come to the South Bronx.
 A gargantuan mall right out of the heartland -- or perhaps just Westchester and Queens -- has set up shop in an area once known for arson, crime and an eight-story jail. And the mall comes with all the must-have accessories, like Home Depot, BJ's Wholesale Club and Bed Bath & Beyond.
 Such was her exhilaration at the neighborhood's new options that Keila Rivera, 32, a home health aide who lives a 10-minute walk away, visited the mall, at East 149th Street and River Avenue, every day for a week. She bought a Whirlpool washing machine at Home Depot; school supplies for her children, Rafael, 13, and Salsina, 12, at Staples; and clothes and pillowcases at Target. At BJ's, she picked up bushels of food and cleaning supplies for her patient. 
 ''You only have to go inside, and you can find anything,'' she said, eating some wings in BJ's cafe. 
 The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, as the three-block-long, orange-tinged mall is known, may be the maraschino cherry topping a revival of Mott Haven and other neighborhoods of the South Bronx that began more than two decades ago. Acres of abandoned or fire-gutted buildings and weed-strewn lots have been filled in with new suburban-style houses or rebuilt apartment buildings. Only a handful of empty lots remain, city officials say.
 ''It says the Bronx is getting better and better,'' said Tawanda Lewis, 36, who was shopping for school supplies with her sons, Wayne, 14, and Keyon, 9.
 But to her and the thousands of shoppers flocking to Gateway as more of the stores open, the mall is more than a symbol. It is a brass-tacks source of, well, brass tacks -- and thousands of other necessities and frills, an enclosed emporium for cheap, name-brand shopping that the South Bronx has long been without. And it has lots of parking -- 2,800 spaces -- that eases the strain of acquisition. 
 Shoppers like Antonio Segarra, 58, an unemployed security guard, and his wife, Carmen Delgado, were leaving BJ's, their baskets brimming with low-price bulk: a box of 150 Glad tall kitchen garbage bags for $7.99, a 25-pound bag of rice for $9, three packs of Hebrew National hot dogs for $6.
 ''You can't go wrong, man,'' Mr. Segarra said. ''We're low income, and we can get pretty nice quantities of merchandise.''
 As they were waiting for Antonio Jr. to pick them up by car, Mr. Segarra acknowledged going a little overboard in spending $508. But he figured he would be able to stock his apartment for many months to come. The couple said there was a dearth of supermarkets and clothing stores near them, and the few that were there seemed more expensive than the shops at the mall.
 ''They think we live in a rich area,'' Ms. Delgado said.
 The 18-acre mall, which cost $500 million and will have a million square feet of shopping, occupies what was once the Bronx Terminal Market, which sprouted in the 1920s and at its heyday housed scores of fruit and vegetable vendors. 
 In its final years, it had two dozen merchants, and its landlord was mired in court battles with the city. Hoping to transform an eyesore as well as the shuttered Bronx House of Detention, the Bloomberg administration offered tax breaks to a developer, the Related Companies, and paid for demolition. As part of the deal, Related, which built a successful, similar mall in once-blighted East New York, Brooklyn, agreed to transfer waterfront land to the city for a park.
 The mall promised 2,500 retail jobs, and it has been good for freelance peddlers and car services, too. Dozens of food carts station themselves outside the mall as if it were nearby Yankee Stadium on game day. A line of gypsy cabs await the emerging, weighed-down crowds.
 But local businesses fear losing customers, and there is concern even at the closest shopping nexus, at 149th Street and Third Avenue, made up of independent stores and a smattering of national chains. But several merchants interviewed in ''the Hub,'' as the district is known, said they expected a pinch, but saw a positive side.
 ''Everybody's in the mall right now,'' said Michael Key, the owner of Michael's clothing store. ''They got prices different from our prices, and it's easier to park. So it does hurt. But on the other side, it brings more people to the area.'' 
 Rashid Ahmed, manager of Kidstop Clothing, said business had declined about 5 percent, but added that it might not last long.
 ''We sell hip-hop clothing,'' he said. ''They sell Nikes and Guess.''
 Mr. Segarra said the mall should give the local economy a boost, particularly because so many workers lived nearby.
 ''It's good for everybody,'' he said. ''People who work here get paid, and they'll shop here, too. That's what you want. You want the money to stay in the community.''
 In fact, the mall is drawing shoppers from outside the community. Tracey Reed, 34, a lawyer, and her husband, Sean, 40, a financial manager, who live across the river in Harlem, were looking for a leveling tool and other hardware at Home Depot. They acknowledged the mall's impact on mom-and-pop stores, but said its advantages were irresistible.
 ''Personally, it suits me better,'' Ms. Reed said. ''I drive up in my car, park and get everything I need in one place. I'm going to be living here.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Report Details Lapses in Madoff Inquiries

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
An official at the Securities and Exchange Commission who later married Bernard L. Madoff's niece told investigators this year that if he had carefully reviewed a complaint about the disgraced financier's business, he would have investigated more deeply, a new report shows.
 The admission by Eric Swanson, who was an S.E.C. attorney and inspections official during a 2003-04 examination of Mr. Madoff's operations, is among a trove of revelations in the report by the commission's inspector general, H. David Kotz. 
 The 477-page document, released Friday evening, paints in excruciating detail how the commission's investigations of Mr. Madoff were bungled over 16 years -- with disputes among agency inspection staffers over the findings, lack of communication among S.E.C. offices in various cities, and repeated failures to act on credible, specific complaints that formed a sea of red flags.
 A summary of the report was released by the agency on Wednesday.
 Among the disclosures in the full report: At one point during an agency investigation in May 2006, Mr. Madoff feared that he had been caught.
 ''I thought it was the end game, over,'' he was quoted as saying when investigators queried him about what account he was using to clear certain trades.
 He said he felt very fortunate when there was no follow-up call to check on the account number he had given the investigators.
 ''After all this, I got away lucky,'' he told Mr. Kotz in a prison interview, though he added that he thought it was just a matter of time before he would eventually be caught.
 Mr. Madoff, who pleaded guilty in March, is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison in North Carolina for a Ponzi scheme that could be the biggest in United States history. It destroyed thousands of people's life savings, wrecked charities and gave investors' already shaken confidence in the financial system yet another big jolt.
 Revelations in December of the S.E.C.'s failure to uncover Mr. Madoff's vast scheme touched off one of the most painful scandals in the agency's 75-year history.
 ''It is a failure that we continue to regret, and one that has led us to reform in many ways how we regulate markets and protect investors,'' the S.E.C. chairman, Mary L. Schapiro, said in a statement Friday. ''In the coming weeks we will continue to closely review the full report and learn every lesson we can to help build upon the many reforms we have already put into place since January.''
 Ms. Schapiro, appointed by President Obama, took the helm in January. Enforcement efforts have been strengthened, and the agency has started a number of initiatives meant to protect investors in the wake of the financial crisis, officials say.
 Mr. Kotz's investigation found no evidence that the relationship between Mr. Swanson and Mr. Madoff's niece, Shana, who married in 2007, influenced the S.E.C. investigations of Mr. Madoff.
 But Mr. Swanson acknowledged in his testimony to the inspector general's office this year that if he had carefully examined complaints about Mr. Madoff's business, he would have dug more thoroughly, according to the report.
 Mr. Swanson said a complaint from outside the S.E.C. and financial articles on Mr. Madoff published in 2001 ''mean something different'' to Mr. Swanson today than they did at the time of the S.E.C. examination in 2003-04, the report says. It quotes Mr. Swanson as saying, ''I didn't know anything, very little anyway, about hedge funds and mutual funds and how they operated.''
 The S.E.C. enforcement staff ''almost immediately caught Madoff in lies and misrepresentations but failed to follow up on inconsistencies'' and rejected whistleblowers' offers to provide additional evidence, the report says. Mr. Kotz's investigation, begun in the days after Mr. Madoff's arrest, involved interviews with 122 people and reviews of thousands of documents.

HEADLINE: Investors Regain Some Losses To End Bad Week for Markets

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
In a day of light trading, investors clawed back some of their losses from earlier in the week after an unemployment report showed that job losses were continuing to ebb.
 Industrial companies like Caterpillar led the gains on hopes that a recovery would increase production on assembly lines and rekindle demand for capital goods. Markets in the United States and Canada will be closed Monday for Labor Day.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 96.66 points, or 1 percent, to 9,441.27, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 1.3 percent higher at 1,016.40. The Nasdaq composite index was up 1.8 percent at 2,018.78, bolstered by gains in wireless providers and semiconductor companies. 
 ''On light volume days, it's easy to move stocks around, it's easy to push them,'' said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading. ''All it takes is a few futures contracts, and you're off to the races. I'm not buying into the rally. It's a little suspect.''
 Investors showed an appetite for a range of stocks, including defensive picks -- like utilities and health care companies -- and financial firms and technology companies. Microsoft and its rival Apple each gained more than 2 percent, and retailers, including Saks, Macy's and Coach, rose despite worries that high joblessness would crimp consumer spending.
 The latest report on employment showed that the United States economy lost an additional 216,000 jobs in August -- the 20th consecutive month of job losses -- and unemployment surged to 9.7 percent, the highest level in more than two decades.
 In the bond markets, investors seemed to see signs of a recovery in the employment numbers and sold off their positions in the safety of government debts. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 25/32, to 101 18/32, while the yield rose to 3.44 percent, from 3.34 percent late Thursday.
 Even with Friday's gains, Wall Street rounded out its worst weekly performance since mid-July, just before stocks began a summer rally that catapulted the S.& P. 500 some 15 percent higher. For the week, the S.& P. 500 was down 1.2 percent and the Dow was off by 1.1 percent. 
 Shares of the battered insurance company American International Group, which dropped 4 percent on Friday, were among the week's biggest losers. Investors bid up A.I.G.'s stock by 400 percent in recent months on rumors about the company's future, but its shares fell from $50 at the start of the week to $40.05 on Friday. 
 This summer, the higher Wall Street flew, the more concerned analysts became that its gains had far outpaced the real economy, where some 14.9 million people are unemployed and millions more are working part time for lack of a full-time job, or have given up looking for work.
 The pace of job losses has slowed markedly since the first quarter, when the economy was shedding an average of 691,000 positions a month, and many economists say the recession has bottomed out and the economy is already growing again, from a very low base line. But economists say job and wage growth could come slowly next year, weighing down consumer spending and an economic recovery.
 ''With the workweek flat and temporary help still declining, there were no leading indicators in the report suggesting that we'll actually be adding jobs this year,'' Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a research note.
 With so much uncertainty ahead for the economy and corporate revenue, some analysts say stocks have become too expensive, and they are betting on a pullback in the markets.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Charities Rarely on Hollywood's 'Must Do' Lists

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
When Michael Jackson was memorialized at the Staples Center here in July, celebrities sang, eulogized and openly wept. What they did not do was offer to pick up the city's $1.4 million tab.
 This is getting to be a habit in Los Angeles.
 After helping to build some of the city's most impressive monuments over the last century -- including the downtown music center, with its Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and Disney Concert Hall -- show business has been stepping back, according to nonprofit organizations in the city and some people in the entertainment industry.
 While big companies and their leaders have historically helped out their hometowns in a pinch, out of benevolence or for bragging rights, Hollywood has been playing a relatively minor role in the civic life of Los Angeles, preferring national and international charities, say political leaders and many who care for those in need in the city.
 ''You might even call it an exodus,'' said Peter Douglas, the president of a Los Angeles-oriented foundation, started by his parents, Kirk and Anne Douglas, referring to Hollywood's tendency to look past the locals. 
 Though there are signs that some in the entertainment industry are increasingly uncomfortable with its largely out-of-town donations, the pattern has been clear for years: Homelessness in Santa Monica is eschewed in favor of starvation in Darfur, health care in South Los Angeles draws less than a search for cancer cures.
 The reasons vary: Hollywood companies, once local, are now part of multinational corporations; the recession has taken a toll; some celebrities prefer issues that bring publicity, or support the towns they come from; and the insular nature of star life in a car-bound city may limit knowledge of local needs.
 ''We have had publicists sniff us and ask if we're expanding across country,'' said Carla Sanger, the president of LA's Best, a nonprofit agency that runs recreation programs in elementary schools. ''When they find out the answer is no, they back off.''
 The City Council president, Eric Garcetti, who represents the Hollywood neighborhood, said his office had been frustrated in efforts to get studios to donate even small amounts to save a popular Hollywood Christmas parade. 
 While some entertainment companies have contributed to the city's Heritage Month Celebrations and some celebrities have donated reading time at the Gregory Peck Reading Series, which benefits the city's Library Foundation, stars and their employers have done little to pay for major civic events in the last few years in Los Angeles, according to data provided by the mayor's office. 
 ''You do have people who get very engaged in hospitals and universities, but people forget that building a great city takes the building of great infrastructure,'' Mr. Garcetti said. ''Building a civic culture is less than engaging to Hollywood.''
 Statistics on giving by the entertainment industry are spotty, partly because reports on tax-exempt giving typically become available long after contributions are made. Spokesmen for Fox, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Universal and Warner declined to disclose charitable budgets. A foundation associated with NBC Universal gave about $870,000, or 46 percent of $1.9 million in total contributions, to Los Angeles charities in 2007, according to a tax filing.
 But a July survey by The Los Angeles Business Journal of local corporate givers found not a single entertainment company among the top 20, which were led by Kaiser Permanente, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and the Target Corporation. The Walt Disney Company probably would have joined the top 20, but would not provide information, The Journal said.
 The most broad-gauged charitable group of the industry -- the Entertainment Industry Foundation, representing studios, television networks, talent agencies and professional guilds -- gave $12.6 million of its $15.5 million in grants to national and international health-related causes in 2007, with only about $1.5 million for community-based organizations here, according to a public report. 
 Lisa Paulsen, the foundation's chief executive, said in an e-mail message that much of its health-related giving went to Los Angeles-area recipients, including $3 million to the cancer center at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 But Ms. Paulsen acknowledged that a survey of entertainment leaders found that many wanted Hollywood to do more locally -- and she expects more city-oriented gifts to result soon.
 That would reverse a trend. 
 Mr. Douglas, of the Douglas Foundation, and others are pushing to get show business re-engaged. Jim Wiatt, the former William Morris Agency chairman, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the DreamWorks Animation chief executive, are among the hosts of a planned gala for the Los Angeles Police Foundation. 
 Similarly, Casey Wasserman -- the grandson of MCA Inc.'s Lew Wasserman -- has refocused his family foundation on the local schools. 
 ''People are going to other things, which is why we've made an extra effort to have our money go to Los Angeles,'' Mr. Wasserman said.
 Groups here need the help. Gisselle Acevedo, president of Para Los Ninos, a nonprofit group helping impoverished children around the metropolitan area, said Hollywood dollars have dwindled to nearly nothing. 
 Last year, money coming from the entertainment industry represented about three-fourths of 1 percent of the $3.7 million the group raised, Ms. Acevedo said. The exception is Walter F. Parkes, a film producer who is on the board of the charter elementary school run by the group and who paid for its library with a $125,000 gift.
 Some studio executives said privately that giving had shrunk during the current recession, but declined to speak publicly, citing corporate policy. Most pointed toward continuing support for projects like A Place Called Home, a youth center helped by Universal, or AIDS Walk Los Angeles, which has been supported by Paramount.
 Walt Disney, whose headquarters are in Burbank, said it gave about $20 million to Los Angeles-area charities in the last three years, and donated $12.4 million in Orange County, where its original theme park is located, last year.
 Some say Los Angeles can shoulder its own burdens. ''This is a world-class city, and we provide fire and police protection, period,'' said Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa when confronted with the bill for services connected to the Michael Jackson memorial. 
 But other cities -- notably New York -- do get their richest to pay for events like the Sept. 11 memorial or parades for sports teams.
 Officials in Glendale, Calif., where Mr. Jackson was buried on Thursday night, said they would accept an offer from the Jackson family to reimburse costs for the police and other city services. 
 Oil companies have a long history of giving in Houston, and as does Eli Lilly and Company in Indianapolis. In Pittsburgh, long a hotbed of civic philanthropy, the Heinz Endowments have used the region as a laboratory for social problem solving, with $75 million in grants.
 Mr. Garcetti, the Los Angeles City Council president, said some who help here keep it quiet. Jimmy Kimmel, he said, shows up at community board meetings in Hollywood, and the comedian George Lopez always says yes when it comes to causes for children. 
 Mr. Lopez recently heard about a school in south Los Angeles where the students lacked coats, and he bought one for each. 
 ''In New York everyone sees everybody always walking around,'' Mr. Lopez said in a telephone interview. But here, needs can be less obvious.
 ''People speak to you through your publicist,'' he said, ''so there are some things you never hear about.''

HEADLINE: Israel Announces a West Bank Settlement Approach No One Seems to Like

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Israeli officials said Friday that the government would authorize building hundreds of housing units in West Bank settlements, and that it then expected to freeze construction for six to nine months in anticipation of restarting peace talks with the Palestinians.
 The seemingly contradictory steps reflected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's balancing of interests as he tries to satisfy his own party, Likud, which wants settlements to continue unimpeded, and the Obama administration, which, joined by Palestinians and the Arab world, says all building must stop now. 
 Both sides criticized Mr. Netanyahu's plan, though some analysts said that the blend of half-measures was politically necessary to advance talks while holding his government together.
 ''As the president has said before,'' the White House said in a statement, ''the United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement expansion, and we urge that it stop. We are working to create a climate in which negotiations can take place, and such actions make it harder to create such a climate.''
 The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, meeting in Paris with President Nicolas Sarkozy, said the plan was ''not acceptable.''
 The leaders of the settlement movement, many of them Likud activists, also expressed displeasure.
 Three weeks ago, Israel's housing minister said that the government had not given final approval for any settlement building in the West Bank since the Netanyahu government took office in late March, a statement that prompted President Obama to say he saw ''movement in the right direction.'' But the housing minister also said there was no formal freeze in place. 
 On Friday, a senior American official said that the Obama administration had been informed of Mr. Netanyahu's plan on Thursday and that, while it was unhappy about it -- and it made that clear to the prime minister's aides -- it still hoped and expected that the subsequent freeze would lead to renewed peace negotiations.
 The target for the talks to resume is late September at the next gathering of the United NationsGeneral Assembly, which Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Abbas and Mr. Obama will all attend. 
 The Americans have been trying to persuade Arab states to offer Israel measures in exchange for a building freeze, including reopening Israeli trade offices in several countries and allowing Israeli planes heading to Asia to use their airspace. Some of those hopes may be jeopardized by the latest announcement.
 ''The freeze is not about removing Jews from the West Bank now, but about confidence-building measures, and confidence is what will now be lacking,'' argued Nahum Barnea, a leading Israeli newspaper columnist, in a telephone interview. ''I'm afraid Netanyahu will end up losing the confidence of everyone.''
 In his column Friday in Yediot Aharonot, Mr. Barnea said a senior American official telephoned him this week to lay out what Mr. Netanyahu would receive in exchange for the freeze: ''an improved personal relationship with President Obama; he will get gestures from the moderate Arab states that the Israelis can appreciate, including a reopening of the interests offices in a number of states, tourism and trade relations, flight rights.'' The column was written before the latest announcement. 
 Two Israeli officials returned Friday from meetings with the Obama administration's envoy to the region, George J. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell is expected in Jerusalem late next week for further negotiations over the renewal of the peace process. That is being defined as direct talks with the Palestinians and supportive gestures from the Arab world, in exchange for the freeze and moves by Israeli authorities to continue to improve security and the economy for Palestinians in the West Bank.
 Mr. Abbas is head of the Fatah movement, whose rival Hamas rules in Gaza. Fatah controls the West Bank, and he has increased his popularity among Palestinians as West Bank conditions improve and Gaza stagnates under an Israeli and Egyptian embargo, according to two new opinion polls. That may encourage Mr. Abbas to go ahead with talks.
 The Palestinian Center for Survey and Policy Research, which conducts quarterly surveys, found that support for Mr. Abbas and Fatah over Hamas and its leader, Ismail Haniya, continued to grow both in the West Bank and Gaza. A five-percentage-point advantage three months ago has nearly tripled, to 14 percentage points, the center reported, based on a mid-August survey. It also found a big increase in the sense of personal safety among people in the West Bank, something Mr. Abbas's security forces have been fostering, as well as a widespread belief that American involvement in peace talks would bring results.
 A separate survey, done in July and August by Stanley Greenberg, an American who has long polled for Democrats, also found enthusiasm for the Obama administration's role, and indicated that Fatah would beat Hamas by 10 points if elections were held today in the West Bank and Gaza.
 The Greenberg survey was carried out for the Israel Project, which seeks to improve Israel's image and has started to focus efforts in the Palestinian areas as well as in Egypt and Jordan. 
 Both the Palestinian Center and Greenberg polls found substantial support among Palestinians for a two-state solution, where the two are described as Palestinian and Jewish states. The Palestinian survey found the public evenly divided -- 49 percent to 49 percent -- over a final accord of mutual recognition and an end to conflict. The Greenberg poll found greater enthusiasm in the West Bank -- 69 percent to 29 percent -- than in Gaza, where 33 percent favored such a two-state solution compared with 56 percent opposed.
 The Greenberg survey found that the Israel Project had its work cut out for it in building Israel's image in the Arab world. Asked separate questions about their attitude toward Israel and Jews, Palestinians and Jordanians had a universally and completely negative response to both. Egyptians were only somewhat less hostile.
 On the other hand, a plurality of Egyptians -- 46 to 36 percent -- approved of their country's diplomatic relations with Israel. In Jordan, it went the other way -- 51 percent opposing those relations and 42 percent approving.

HEADLINE: A Story of Stimulus Success Ends Instead With Pink Slips

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ST. CLOUD, Minn. 

 BODY:
It was just five months ago that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made the New Flyer bus factory here a symbol of the stimulus. With several cabinet secretaries in tow, he held a town-hall-style meeting at the factory, where he praised the company as ''an example of the future'' and said that it stood to get more orders for its hybrid electric buses thanks to the $8.4 billion that the stimulus law devotes to mass transit.
 But last month, the company that administration officials had pictured as a stimulus success story began laying off 320 people, or 13 percent of its work force, having discovered how cutbacks at the state level can dampen the boost provided by the federal stimulus money. The Chicago Transit Authority did use some of its stimulus money to buy 58 new hybrid buses from New Flyer. But Chicago had to shelve plans to order another 140 buses from them after the state money that it had hoped to use to pay for them failed to materialize. The delayed order scrambled New Flyer's production schedule for the rest of the year, and led to the layoffs. 
 One of those laid off was David Wahl, 52, who had worked there for a decade and who sat behind the vice president at the town-hall-style meeting, soaking up the optimism of the moment. ''With mass transit being pushed so hard,'' Mr. Wahl recalled, ''I figured I'd be able to work until I was 75.''
 The layoffs at New Flyer are a vivid illustration of the way that some of the economic impact of the $787 billion federal stimulus law is being diluted by the actions state and local governments are taking to weather the recession. 
 While the stimulus law cut federal taxes to inject money into the economy quickly, at least 30 states have raised taxes since January, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal fiscal policy group. The stimulus will spend $27.5 billion in federal money on highway projects, but at least 19 states are planning to cut their highway spending this year, according to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, a trade group. And as the stimulus devotes $8.4 billion to mass transit, transit systems across the nation have been forced to cut service, raise fares and delay capital spending. 
 Dean Baker, an economist who was an author of a paper called ''The State and Local Drag on the Stimulus,'' said that while the stimulus had undoubtedly helped states, the cutbacks and tax increases at the state and local level threaten to offset much of its economic impact. 
 ''The economy doesn't care whether the dollars are coming from the federal or the state and local level,'' said Mr. Baker, a co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. 
 Mr. Biden did not respond directly to news of the layoffs at New Flyer, but another administration official said the stimulus money was expected to help transit agencies buy almost 8,000 new buses, which would help New Flyer and its competitors. Sasha Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation, said stimulus dollars had helped bus companies survive the economic downtown, and would have an increasing effect through the year.
 ''Without the boost provided by Recovery Act orders, bus companies like New Flyer would be even harder hit than they have been,'' Ms. Johnson said.
 In St. Cloud, though, all that red ink from the states dimmed the hopes for more federally financed green jobs, for now. Chicago transit officials -- who noted recently that their older buses had enough miles on them to have gone to the moon and back -- estimated that they needed $7 billion for capital improvements. But the State of Illinois, facing budget pressure, agreed to spend only $2.7 billion, and not all of that will go to Chicago. The city's hopes for another 140 buses from here were put off.
 New Flyer Industries, which is based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said over the summer that it still had a large backlog of bus orders, including some from California, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Rochester, that would use stimulus money. But because its buses are engineered to order for each customer, the company said in a statement, it cannot easily switch its production schedule to fill the gaps left by the delayed order. 
 So the company plans to cut 320 jobs, to reduce its production schedule to 36 units a week from 50, and to close its plants during the last two weeks of the year. Glenn Asham, New Flyer's chief financial officer, declined to comment further. 
 Even before New Flyer announced its layoffs, St. Cloud's mayor, David Kleis, was critical of the stimulus law. He said the two small road projects that were approved by the state were low on the city's list of priorities, while the city's top priority -- widening a busy, accident-prone intersection in a commercial area -- did not make the grade. Neither did his applications for money to pay for more police officers, or for the city's wastewater treatment plant. ''The expectations were just very high here after that town hall meeting,'' Mr. Kleis said.
 Mr. Wahl said the loss of his job was still sinking in. He joined New Flyer soon after it opened the St. Cloud plant in 1999 -- he was the 118th employee, he said -- and worked on everything from power steering to putting on side panels to installing engines. When the work force unionized, he became president of the local. Last November, he moved to a nonunion job working with transit systems as they prepared to take delivery of the buses. 
 ''It was a lot easier on the body,'' he said. But the switch to a nonunion job also made it easier for him to be in the first round of layoffs, despite his 10 years with the company.
 ''First it's shock, and then you get angry,'' Mr. Wahl said. ''And then you wonder, What am I going to do?''
 So far he has filed for unemployment benefits, and a couple of days after his 52nd birthday, he drove to the Workforce Center in Crow Wing County to see if he might qualify for help getting a driver's license allowing him to become a long-haul truck driver. 
 The stimulus law may have failed to save Mr. Wahl's job, but it is helping him out in a way that he hoped he would never need: thanks to a provision in the law that pays 65 percent of the cost of continuing health insurance for the unemployed under the Cobra law, Mr. Wahl's health insurance bills will now be closer to $400 a month instead of the $1,200 they would have been otherwise.

HEADLINE: Reliving The Past

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The president should listen to Joe Biden.
 Mr. Biden has been a voice of reason, warning the administration of the dangers of increasing our military involvement in Afghanistan. President Obama has not been inclined to heed his advice, which is worse than a shame. It's tragic.
 Watching the American escalation of the war in Afghanistan is like watching helplessly as someone you love climbs into a car while intoxicated and drives off toward a busy highway. No good can come of it. 
 The war, hopelessly botched by the Bush crowd, has now lasted nearly eight long years, longer than our involvement in World Wars I and II combined. There is nothing even remotely resembling a light at the end of the tunnel. The war is going badly and becoming deadlier. July and August were the two deadliest months for U.S. troops since the American invasion in October 2001.
 Nevertheless, with public support for the war dwindling, and with the military exhausted and stretched to the breaking point physically and psychologically after so many years of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, the president is ratcheting the war up instead of winding it down.
 He has already ordered an increase of 21,000 troops, which will bring the American total to 68,000, and will be considering a request for more troops that is about to come from Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan.
 These will be troops heading into the flames of a no-win situation. We're fighting on behalf of an incompetent and hopelessly corrupt government in Afghanistan. If our ultimate goal, as the administration tells us, is a government that can effectively run the country, protect its own population and defeat the Taliban, our troops will be fighting and dying in Afghanistan for many, many years to come.
 And they will be fighting and dying in a particularly unforgiving environment. Afghanistan is a mountainous, mostly rural country with notoriously difficult, lonely and dangerous roads -- a pitch-perfect environment for terrorists and guerrillas. Linda Bilmes, a professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, has been working with the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz to document the costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. She told me:
 ''The cost per troop of keeping the troops in Afghanistan is higher than the cost in Iraq because of the really difficult overland supply route and the heavy dependence on airlifting all kinds of supplies. There has been such a lot of trouble with the security of the supplies, and that, of course, becomes even more complicated the more troops you put in. So we're estimating that, on average, the cost per troop in Afghanistan is at least 30 percent higher than it is in Iraq.''
 The thought of escalating our involvement in Afghanistan reminded me of an exchange that David Halberstam described in ''The Best and the Brightest.'' It occurred as plans were being developed for the expansion of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. McGeorge Bundy, who served as national security adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, showed some of the elaborate and sophisticated plans to one of his aides. The aide was impressed, but also concerned.
 ''The thing that bothers me,'' he told Bundy, ''is that no matter what we do to them, they live there and we don't, and they know that someday we'll go away and thus they know they can outlast us.''
 Bundy replied, ''That's a good point.''
 We've already lost more than 5,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and spent a trillion or so dollars. The longer we stay in Afghanistan, the more resentful the local population will become about our presence, and the more resentful the American public will become about our involvement in a war that seems to have no end and no upside.
 President Obama is being told (as Lyndon Johnson was told about Vietnam) that more resources will do the trick in Afghanistan -- more troops, more materiel, more money. Even if it were true (I certainly don't believe it), we don't have those resources to give. It's obscene what we're doing to the men and women who have volunteered for the armed forces, sending them into the war zones for three, four and five tours.
 The Army, in an effort to improve combat performance under these dreadful conditions, is planning intensive training for all of its soldiers in how to be more emotionally resilient. And, of course, a country that is going through the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and that counts its budget deficits by the trillions, has no choice but to lay the costs of current wars on the unborn backs of future generations.
 Lyndon Johnson made the mistake of not listening to the Joe Bidens of his day. There's a lesson in that for President Obama.

HEADLINE: He Works for The Times, Too

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT. 
The public editor can be reached by e-mail: public@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DAVID POGUE, the popular technology columnist, is a high-energy, one-man multimedia conglomerate.
 In addition to his weekly ''State of the Art'' column in The Times, and his blog and videos on the newspaper's Web site, and his weekly e-mail newsletter, he appears regularly on ''CBS News Sunday Morning,'' CNBC and NPR. He also entertains lecture audiences with satirical ditties on the piano -- he once aspired to be a Broadway composer -- while informing them about the latest gadgets. You can even take a Geek Cruise to Bermuda with him next spring. Finally, Pogue originated ''The Missing Manual'' series of help books for the technologically challenged like me, who otherwise would never figure out how to get the most out of something like an iPhone.
 His multiple interests and loyalties raise interesting ethical issues in this new age when individual journalists can become brands of their own, stars who seem to transcend the old rules that sharply limited outside activity and demanded an overriding obligation to The Times and its readers. 
 Two Thursdays ago, two of Pogue's interests seemed to collide. In his Times column, he gave a glowing review to Snow Leopard, Apple's new operating system for Macs. At the same time, he was writing a ''Missing Manual'' on Snow Leopard -- two, actually -- already available for pre-order on Amazon. If you are now running Leopard on your Mac, Pogue wrote in the review, paying the $30 to replace it with Snow Leopard ''is a no-brainer.'' 
 It is no intended knock on Pogue's integrity -- he has panned Apple products and praised those of competitors -- to point out that the review put him in the kind of conflict-of-interest situation that The Times regularly calls others to account for: doctors with a financial interest in the drugs they recommend, or a presidential adviser whose clients have a direct interest in certain legislation. In this case, the better Snow Leopard sells, presumably the better Pogue's ''Missing Manual'' on how to use it will sell.
 I presented the facts to three ethicists: Kelly McBride at the Poynter Institute, a journalism training center in Florida; Bob Steele, a professor at DePauw University and a scholar at Poynter; and Stephen Ward, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. All agreed that Pogue and The Times were facing a clear conflict of interest.
 They didn't necessarily agree on how to resolve it. McBride said the paper should not deprive readers of Pogue's expertise, but she and Ward said there should be rigorous oversight and full disclosure to readers about his interests. Steele said disclosure doesn't make the problem go away, and it would be better if Pogue did not review products for which he has written manuals. 
 All agreed that The Times and other news organizations are going to face more of these situations as journalists worried about the economic health of their employers seek outside sources of income and as the companies turn to independent contractors, like Pogue, for more of their content.
 Pogue is by no means the only Times writer with other interests. Thomas Friedman commands $75,000 for a speech, and his books are blockbusters. Another Op-Ed columnist, Frank Rich, is a consultant helping HBO develop new programming. A. O. Scott, the film critic, is about to become co-host of ''At the Movies,'' produced by ABC Media Productions. Mark Bittman, The Minimalist, an independent contractor like Pogue, writes cookbooks and appears on PBS. John Harwood, who writes from Washington, is CNBC's chief Washington correspondent. 
 In another era, many of these activities would have been frowned on as diluting the Times brand and draining energy from the paper. Now, with what seems a mixture of resignation and sensed opportunity, editors say The Times can be enhanced by all the outside activity. ''We see their exposure in a quality venue as good promotion of The Times,'' said Bill Keller, the executive editor.
 But it creates tricky ethical terrain. No Times journalist is in quite the same position as Pogue -- reviewing products and simultaneously writing guides to them. He said he makes more money from the books than from The Times.
 Pogue and his editors said they talk frequently about how to deal with his varied interests, and the editors praised him as a straight shooter who has developed a large following precisely because of his honest assessments of hardware and software. Pogue said the conflict in his case was ''kind of an imaginative cause and effect. I can't imagine someone saying: 'This is a good product. I'll buy the reviewer's book.' '' He pointed out that he savaged Apple's iMovie '08 in his Times blog, even as he was writing a ''Missing Manual'' for it.
 Keller said that for Pogue and others like him, ''their jobs at The Times and their other revenue streams are dependent on their credibility. If they do anything that undermines or diminishes their credibility, they lose everything.'' But, as the paper's ethics guidelines stress repeatedly, appearances count, and Pogue has taken an occasional drubbing on the Internet over his conflict.
 When the paper signed Pogue in 2000, said William Schmidt, a deputy managing editor, it allowed him to continue the ''Missing Manuals.'' Editors anticipated that the books would be mainly about software and that Pogue would be reviewing hardware, but that distinction disappeared. Editors also may not have realized how quickly the manuals would be produced after the introduction of a new product, Schmidt said.
 Craig Whitney, the standards editor, said Pogue and The Times ''have tried to manage the conflict of interest, and I think successfully, but I acknowledge that it still exists. Could we do something more to minimize it? I would say yes.''
 Last Thursday, The Times did. Larry Ingrassia, the business editor, said that, prompted by my questions, editors decided to make disclosures to readers regarding Pogue's outside activities. On his Times Topics page online, Pogue posted a statement of ethics, saying manufacturers have no involvement in his manuals and that from now on, if he is writing a book about a product he is reviewing, he will disclose it to readers. It says his personal investments are in a blind trust to avoid any question of reviewing products in which he has a direct financial interest. A disclosure was appended to the Snow Leopard column online.
 These seem like the right steps. No option was easy. The old-school way -- telling Pogue to give up the manuals or take a hike -- was not realistic. Telling him he could not review products for which he has written a manual would, as McBride said, deny readers his expertise.
 It was good that The Times addressed the issue now. Windows 7 is being released within a month. Pogue is planning to review it. The ''Missing Manual'' is already for sale.
 A reader's letter last week referred to Walter Cronkite's error-filled obituary. But it was an appraisal, not the obituary, that was filled with mistakes.

HEADLINE: The Recession Behind Bars

BYLINE: By KENNETH E. HARTMAN. 
Kenneth E. Hartman, the author of the forthcoming ''Mother California: A Story of Redemption Behind Bars,'' was sentenced in 1980 to life without parole for murder.

DATELINE: Lancaster, Calif. 

 BODY:
 EVERY weekday morning the prison's not on lockdown, the yard holds its collective breath waiting for the pale-orange package cart to appear through multiple layers of chain-link and razor-wire fences. For most prisoners, this lumbering vessel is their only tangible, physical connection back to the free world. The last couple of years the cart has arrived less often and with visibly lighter loads. 
 We get broadcast television, so the state of the economy outside is no secret. Our families and friends tend to come from the segments of society that are the worst off in the best of times, and worse off still in times like these. Our mothers and fathers, wives and children, those to whom the ties that bind haven't been unbound by the course of our lives, tell us how hard it is out there. 
 The first inkling of financial difficulties in here surfaced in the chow hall. All of a sudden prison officials became concerned about our overeating. In the last couple of years, our brown plastic trays have started to look and feel a lot emptier. Even the old staples, beans and rice, shrank into bite-sized portions. Luxury items like frosted cake and meat cut from the carcass of a once-living thing vanished. The new menus, chock full of potatoes and meat substitutes, seem right out of a Spartan's cookbook.
 Prison is a world reflected in a looking glass, however. The past 25 years were generally prosperous for California; the economy boomed and fortunes were made in the sunny San Fernando Valley. But during this time, the lives of prisoners became much drearier. We were forced into demeaning uniforms, with neon orange letters spelling out ''prisoner,'' and lost most of the positive programs like conjugal visits and college education that we had had since the '70s. Money was flowing outside the prison walls, but new ''get tough'' policies against criminals were causing our population, and our costs, to soar. 
 It is a quirk of California politics that it is among the bluest of states but has some of the reddest of laws. No politician here ever lost an election for being too tough on crime or prisoners. Consequently, all through the '80s and '90s billions of dollars were poured into a historic prison-building boom. Private airplane pilots tell me it's easy to navigate at night from San Diego to Los Angeles and on up the Central Valley to Sacramento by simply following the prisons' glowing lights. Good times in the free world meant, in here, ever-longer sentences, meaner regulations and ever-decreasing interest in rehabilitation. ''Costs be damned; lock 'em up and be done with it'' became the unofficial motto of the Department of Corrections. 
 The last time I received a visit from my family, in early July, the air-conditioning in the visiting room had been broken for more than a month. This matters because my prison is in the high desert north of Los Angeles. Temperatures here in the summer commonly rise above 100 dusty, windy degrees. Pack 150 people into an airless room and you've got the makings for human meltdown. Two industrial-sized fans only made a hot situation noisy, too.
 The next day I asked one of the administrators what could be done to get the air-conditioning fixed, and he told me an amazing story. The free-world contractor who services the prison's air-conditioning systems had refused to come out to replace the part that was broken, because the state owed the company tens of thousands of dollars in back fees and could pay only in i.o.u.'s. There would be no cool air until the state's budget negotiations were concluded.
 Now that the economy is suffering, there is talk of reforming the prisons, of reviving the discredited concept of rehabilitation, of letting some prisoners out early. Some people have even mentioned doing away with the death penalty because of the exorbitant cost to the state of guaranteed appeals. For those of us who have endured a generation of policies intended explicitly to inflict pain, this has a surreal quality to it. After all, it was only a year ago that the state authorities were planning the next phase of prison expansion. Obviously, all the passionate arguments that have been made about the moral wrongs of mass incarceration, of disproportionately affected communities, of abysmal treatment and civil rights violations were just so much hot air. Only when society ran out of ready cash did prison reform become worthy of serious consideration. What this says about the free world is unclear to me, but it doesn't feel like a good thing.
 The talk in here contains an element of schadenfreude. When the TV shows legislators complaining about how deep in the hole the state budget is, laughter fills the day room. Our captor turns out to be simply inept. 
 From the four-inch-wide window in the back of my cell, I watched, for seven years, the construction of a housing tract across the street -- a subdivision we call Prison View Estates. We marvel at the hubris of building chockablock stucco mini-mansions within shouting distance of a maximum-security prison. Today, a year after the gaudy balloons from the grand opening deflated, the row of houses directly across from my window looks to be unoccupied. 
 From my cell I can also observe the inner roadway on which prison vehicles pass. A fleet of new, shining-white super-security transportation vans still drives by daily. Leviathan hasn't quite adjusted to the Golden State's diminished firmament.

HEADLINE: The Show Must Go On

BYLINE: By CARLA BARANAUCKAS

 BODY:
WHETHER drama, comedy or musical, most New Jersey theater productions for the 2009-10 season will contain an element of magic. Not the rabbit-out-of-a-hat kind, but the sort of alchemy in which theater management works to keep tough financial times from affecting what appears on stage.
 Budgets, which were already tight, are being stretched even more, said Tim Shields, managing director of the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton. 
 ''The way our budget is constructed, about 60 percent comes from ticket sales and earned income and 40 percent comes from contributions,'' Mr. Shields said. ''The 60 percent of our budget is holding pretty steadily. But there is some diminution in some of the contributing sources.'' 
 Among the cuts were a $160,000 reduction in the McCarter's grant from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. The council, which relies on the State Legislature to appropriate money for its grants, received 25 percent less for the current fiscal year, which for many theaters started on July 1, ''because of the terrible state that our economy is in,'' said Steve Runk, its executive director. ''The funds we had available were less and so the council had to reduce funding pretty much across the board.''
 Even with the smaller budget, which resulted in some staffing cuts, the McCarter plans an ambitious season, starting on Friday with ''Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,'' written and directed by the McCarter's artistic director, Emily Mann, and adapted from the book by Sarah L. Delany and A. Elizabeth Delany with Amy Hill Hearth. A revival of a play first produced at the McCarter in 1995, it runs through Oct. 18. 
 That will be followed by ''She Stoops to Conquer,'' by Oliver Goldsmith, directed by Nicholas Martin; Dickens's ''Christmas Carol''; ''Fetch Clay, Make Man,'' by Will Power, directed by Des McAnuff; ''American Buffalo,'' by David Mamet, directed by Amy Morton (a co-production with the Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago); and ''Take Flight,'' with book by John Weidman, music by David Shire and lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr., directed by Sam Buntrock. 
 For Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, which just last year relieved itself of a $3.5 million debt burden by selling its land and buildings to the township of Millburn, the current economic downturn is not quite as daunting.
 ''We have mostly good news,'' said Mark W. Jones, executive director of the playhouse. ''That being said, we still live in the economic world we're in right now.
 ''We've extinguished our debt. So we got a fresh financial start,'' he said. The theater has found savings by cutting and reorganizing staff, collaborating on productions with other theaters, cutting one play from the season and reducing the runs of most of its productions to four weeks from five. 
 The season starts with ''Little House on the Prairie -- the Musical,'' starring Melissa Gilbert (who played Laura Ingalls on the television show) as Ma. It was originally produced at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Paper Mill's production is about 20 minutes shorter and has only two of the songs from the original production, Mr. Jones said; most of the first act has also been rewritten. After its run at Paper Mill from Thursday to Oct. 10, the musical will go on tour, giving production credits to both the Guthrie and Paper Mill. 
 Other productions on Paper Mill's schedule are the musical ''On the Town,'' the Neil Simon play ''Lost in Yonkers'' and the musicals ''Smokey Joe's Cafe'' and ''Peter Pan.''
 George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick ''shouldn't be looking at a gloom-and-doom picture,'' said the artistic director, David Saint, adding that the theater had finished last season without a budget deficit because some individual donors had stepped up. ''Hopefully the tide is turning economically,'' he said, but the theater is trimming its budget this season by cutting staff and administrative costs and looking to co-productions. 
 The season starts with the world premiere of ''Come Back, Come Back, Wherever You Are,'' written and directed by Arthur Laurents, from Oct. 6 through Nov. 1. That is followed by ''A Moon to Dance By,'' by Thom Thomas, starring Jane Alexander, from Nov. 17 through Dec. 13. And ''Calvin Berger,'' a musical by Barry Wyner choreographed and directed by Kathleen Marshall, will run from Feb. 9 through March 14. Two spring productions have yet to be announced. 
 ''We are trying to cut back on our budget in ways that do not affect the programming, which is really the life force of the theater,'' Mr. Saint said.
 Playwrights Theater of New Jersey in Madison has found an advantage of sorts in the economic downturn. Its production of ''Our Dad Is in Atlantis,'' by Javier Malpica, had originally been scheduled for last spring. But the production was postponed because of budget problems and opens the season this fall, from Oct. 1 through Oct. 18, instead.
 According to John Pietrowski, the theater's artistic director, the decision made the difference between a $10,000 surplus or a $15,000 deficit for last season. By waiting, the theater was able to take advantage of some opportunities, including a grant to tour the play in the state, a co-production with the Growing Stage in Netcong and some performances at Lehigh University, where the translator of the play, Jorge Ingacio Cortinas, will be teaching this fall.
 New works being presented at New Jersey theaters this season include ''The Rant,'' by Andrew Case, a drama running through Sept. 20 at New Jersey Repertory Company in Long Branch; ''Any Other Name,'' by George Brant, a drama, through Sept. 20 at Premiere Stages at Kean University in Union, and ''Fly,'' by Trey Ellis and Ricardo Khan, a drama about the Tuskegee Airmen, having its world premiere Oct. 1 through Oct. 18 at the Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick. 
 The Two River Theater Company in Red Bank is presenting ''26 Miles,'' by Quiara Alegria Hudes, Sept. 15 through Oct. 4, a co-production with the Round House Theater in Bethesda, Md.; it had its world premiere in Atlanta last season. 
 The Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey in Madison, which presents ''Hamlet'' Sept. 9 through Oct. 11, moves on to ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' adapted by Frank Galati, Oct. 21 through Nov. 15. Other highlights of the season include the one-woman musical ''Ethel Waters: His Eye Is on the Sparrow,'' by Larry Parr, Sept. 17 through Sept. 27 at Passage Theater Company in Trenton; the comedy ''Smell of the Kill,'' by Michele Lowe, Oct. 2 through Oct. 25 at the Women's Theater Company in Parsippany; the play '' 'Master Harold' ... and the Boys,'' by Athol Fugard, Oct. 28 through Nov. 15 at Cape May Stage; and the drama ''Loose Knit,'' by Theresa Rebeck, Feb. 19 through March 7 at Centenary Stage Company in Hackettstown.

HEADLINE: A Pharmacological Education

BYLINE: By WALTER KIRN. 
Walter Kirn is a frequent contributor and the author, most recently, of ''Lost in the Meritocracy.''

 BODY:
Low on energy, drained of resources and out of ideas about what to do, I consulted an expert on recovery and was given my personal stimulus package. It came in a small brown bottle of 60 pills, a dose of which was to be taken twice a day (but not too late in the day, because it might cause sleeplessness, and not too closely together, because it might cause dizziness). The psychiatrist who prescribed them predicted good things -- enhanced concentration, a new competitive edge -- and he minimized the risks, which is what finally sold me on Adderall. The drug was a compound of amphetamines meant to combat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, he said, that had proved safe in many trials -- if used as directed. I sensed an insult. Did I look like someone who couldn't take direction? I let it pass. 
 That was about a decade ago, during a one-man economic downturn that is, in miniature, reflected in the current national one. What I wished for back then -- a modest, short-term boost that would yield sustainable long-term gains -- is what so many of us want right now, particularly, I would think, worried college students who find themselves stumbling back to school in a season of grim, uncertain prospects. ''It'll help you get back on your feet,'' my doctor told me, using America's favorite metaphor for accepting a little help, but not too much help, when we're facing daunting circumstances that we're slightly ashamed to find daunting. The key word in this phrase, of course, is ''back,'' because it implies that the subject stood upright previously, and all by himself. 
 To strivers young and old, the lure of mental accelerants like Adderall and its many molecular cousins has only grown since I swallowed my first dose and started down a pharmacological path that was more dizzying than I expected. I found out the hard way that revving up your brain in order to win the race, or just stay in it, comes at a cost that may exceed the benefits. Lately, others are learning this lesson, too, sometimes in traumatic ways. In the last eight years, it was recently reported, calls to poison-control centers concerning overdoses of legal stimulants by young people shot up 76 percent. The increase tracked a near doubling of the rates at which such medications are prescribed, from about four million prescriptions eight years ago to eight million today. Neither of these figures surprises me. In matters related to modern pep pills, everything seems to double every few years, including, sometimes, a person's appetite for them.
 Adderall, I discovered during the courtship phase of what became our deeply tortured relationship, offers a kind of assistance to the brain that feels just right, at first, for the age of multitasking. The drug might as well have been invented by Microsoft and embedded in the Windows toolbar. It seemed to allow me to do three things at once and not completely fail at two of them. Far more important, however, it helped me do one thing at once and focus on it. If I was toiling at my computer, it sharpened the clicking sensations of the keyboard while lowering the volume of the phone whose ringing might have broken my work trance. It also, for me at least, suppressed emotion, freeing me from the claims of other people (my children primarily, because I work at home) who wanted a piece of my precious, deskbound time. 
 The ability to stay on task, even the dullest, most numbing task, was Adderall's first gift to me. It was also its first curse, because it encouraged me to take on work of an increasingly stupefying nature and do it well enough that I got more of it, until I was doing almost no other kind. I can see, though, how harried students might covet this power and why, according to some estimates, a quarter of undergraduates at certain colleges are availing themselves of such stimulants. They're well aware of the dire economic news -- big law firms instituting hiring freezes; whole industries, like publishing, imploding -- and it's natural that they would welcome any advantage in their quests to get the grades that will get them the jobs that will get them the insurance that will get them the medications to do the jobs. 
 A recent labor statistic suggests to me that this circular relationship between pressure and productivity is operating in full swing. In this year's second quarter, the numbers tell us, the American work force squeezed from its tired body the largest increase in output in the last six years. What caused the jump is open to speculation, but I imagine it was partly because of nervousness. The tension produced by the fear of losing a job suggests an adrenalized state perhaps not unlike the one that Adderall unleashes. Anxiety is nature's most plentiful stimulant. Under its influence, trembling fingers fly. 
 The flood of energy released by my pills was, like the recent surge in productivity, a bracing but also troubling development. How long would it last? What would happen when it slowed down? The writing I did on Adderall strikes me now, as I look back on it, as the work of a fellow trying to stay warm by burning semicolons. It was high on intensity, rather low on feeling and marked by a certain jazzy, hectic tone. The income it brought me got me over the hump, though, and I banked my savings, luckily. That's because a new hump soon emerged, more massive and forbidding than the first. And this time it wasn't financial, or merely financial. It was systemic, biological. It manifested as sores inside my mouth, a faint corona of gray hair and a case of hemorrhoids from nonstop sitting.
 I reached a point with Adderall that reminded me of a warning the United States Marine Corps is said to give its enemies: You can run, but you'll only die tired.
 Or graduate tired, in the case of college students. And what's so wrong with that? The course of a formal education is short but its consequences vast, so why not give it your spirit-crushing all, especially during a fiercely competitive age? ''Simply because,'' the parent in me says. He's been there, this man. He's weary, he's spent and he just knows.

HEADLINE: Stadium Sticker Shock

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''Tickets Are a Tough Sell for the New Giants Stadium,'' Aug. 31: The recession is a significant factor, but I believe sticker shock is the primary reason for the difficulty the Jets and the Giants are experiencing in selling season tickets for 2010 in their new stadium. 
 I have had Jets season tickets for 45 years. My two 2009 seats in Giants Stadium cost a total of $2,300. But the cost of two tickets in the same location in the new stadium is $60,000: $25,000 for each personal seat license and $500 a ticket for 10 games, including two in the preseason.
 Loyal and dedicated Jets fans, especially those who have endured mostly abject failure, should not be asked to share the burden of building a new stadium.

HEADLINE: Amy Gedal, Patrick Douglass

 BODY:
Amy Abra Gedal and Patrick Scott Douglass are to be married Sunday at the Prospect Park Boathouse in Brooklyn. Rabbi Frank A. Tamburello is to officiate, with the Rev. Dennis Cleary, a Roman Catholic priest, taking part. 
 The bride and bridegroom met at Cornell, from which they both graduated. 
 The bride, 28, is a research consultant at the Lewin Group, a health research firm, in Falls Church, Va., where she conducts research on Head Start programs for the federal government. She received a master's of public health in maternal and child health and a certificate in global health, both from the University of North Carolina.
 She is a daughter of Donna J. Karl and Stuart M. Gedal of Cambridge, Mass. Her father is the director of education and career development at Project Hope in Boston, a nonprofit organization that helps low income families. Her mother is a nurse practitioner and the newborn coordinator at Children's Hospital Boston. 
 The bridegroom, 29, is a research assistant at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington; he specializes in the Chinese economy. He received a master's in international relations from Johns Hopkins. He is the son of Cheryl L. Douglass and Paul W. Douglass of Chevy Chase, Md. His father retired as an acquisitions manager for Toll Brothers, the home builder; he worked in Ashburn, Va. His mother retired as a special-education teacher at Tuckahoe Elementary School in Arlington, Va. 
 The couple graduated in 2002 and two years later they went to different parts of China as Princeton in Asia fellows. Though far apart, they remained committed to each other. 
 When the two-year fellowships ended, Mr. Douglass decided to stay for a third year to continue his study of Mandarin at Qinghua University. Ms. Gedal returned to the United States. The continued separation tested their relationship. ''We realized we were ready to make decisions in our life to make sure we were in the same place,'' she said. 
 A year after Mr. Douglass returned to Washington, he wrote a proposal in Mandarin on a poster with pictures of them on their travels. Ms. Gedal was confused at first. ''I thought I was imagining what I wanted to read, recognizing all the characters but not really sure what he was saying.''
 ''I clarified by getting down on one knee,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tiara Sparkle and Glow: Partying on the Bowery

BYLINE: By LIZA GHORBANI

 BODY:
WHEN there's not an exclusive event going on -- like Jimmy Fallon's recent cocktail party, where a chef was on hand whipping up peanut butter and jelly sandwiches -- the bars in the Cooper Square Hotel are open to the masses. And though the two bars, much like the hotel itself, may at first glance come off as a bit imposing, that's not really the case. 
 The first-floor bar, part of the adjoining restaurant Table 8, has glass walls overlooking the Bowery, and a shiny black-tiled ceiling from which hangs a cocoon-inspired Marcel Wanders chandelier. A wall of imported Irish marble lines the back of the bar area. On a recent Saturday night, a woman in a veiled tiara was celebrating her bachelorette party, while a group of young men in cargo shorts, hoodies and Docksiders were clustered around the bar. 
 ''In New York everybody likes to go to the new places, and right now the Bowery's a hot spot,'' said Ellen Chang, who had her birthday dinner party at Table 8 and then moved along with her guests over to the bar area. ''On top of that, the hotel is super-swanky,'' she said, ''and that's kind of why I had my party here.''
 A blonde in a black and white Diane von Furstenberg dress with a zigzag print sat next to the birthday girl, who wore a sterling Hermes lock on a chain around her neck and carried a Chloe bag.
 Across from them, their friend Cindy Lawrence said that she was having fun on her night out with her girlfriends, adding: ''I'm not hunting. I'm in this stage where I don't look at guys -- I'm fishing, I actually don't hunt.'' Then she announced to friends sipping from champagne flutes that she had posted their whereabouts on Facebook.
 There have also been some sparkling parties in the penthouse, which offers cinematic 360-degree views of the city. One such party, given by Paul Sevigny, a Beatrice Inn owner, was tagged ''Save the Beatrice,'' and offered glamorous refuge to the club's regulars after it was abruptly shut down in April. 
 Up on the second floor, the bar features lots of white oak. The ambience is cozy, with a zinc bar, cognac leather sofas and shelves filled with books on art and design, many with well-worn bindings. The hotel bought some 6,000 books from Housing Works, a nonprofit organization that provides services to the homeless and those with HIV and AIDS, and the books are displayed throughout the hotel.
 Beyond the glass walls, a sweeping terrace with tables and chairs looked neglected. Oddly, it closes every night at 8, a relief to neighbors and a disappointment to patrons. Neighboring buildings are so close that a clothesline with men's underwear, deliberately or not, crossed over a corner of the terrace, and an adjacent fire escape was just a leap away.
 Inside, a man in a kilt swayed back and forth to the Euro-style music, with his arms around a woman. Otherwise the upstairs bar was calm. A woman in a sequined dress and a jet-black bob was engaged in a long kiss on a couch, while two Parisian men who had just arrived in town reunited with a local friend by the bar. 
 ''There's an opulence that is really impressive, like you are walking into a place wealthier than your own means,'' said Scott Sumption, an entertainment marketing executive. ''It feels a bit out of touch in this economic climate, but there's nothing wrong with escapism.''

HEADLINE: How Did Economists Get it So Wrong?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
Paul Krugman is a Times columnist and winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. His latest book is ''The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008.''

 BODY:
 I. MISTAKING BEAUTY FOR TRUTH
 It's hard to believe now, but not long ago economists were congratulating themselves over the success of their field. Those successes -- or so they believed -- were both theoretical and practical, leading to a golden era for the profession. On the theoretical side, they thought that they had resolved their internal disputes. Thus, in a 2008 paper titled ''The State of Macro'' (that is, macroeconomics, the study of big-picture issues like recessions), Olivier Blanchard of M.I.T., now the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, declared that ''the state of macro is good.'' The battles of yesteryear, he said, were over, and there had been a ''broad convergence of vision.'' And in the real world, economists believed they had things under control: the ''central problem of depression-prevention has been solved,'' declared Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago in his 2003 presidential address to the American Economic Association. In 2004, Ben Bernanke, a former Princeton professor who is now the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, celebrated the Great Moderation in economic performance over the previous two decades, which he attributed in part to improved economic policy making.
 Last year, everything came apart. 
 Few economists saw our current crisis coming, but this predictive failure was the least of the field's problems. More important was the profession's blindness to the very possibility of catastrophic failures in a market economy. During the golden years, financial economists came to believe that markets were inherently stable -- indeed, that stocks and other assets were always priced just right. There was nothing in the prevailing models suggesting the possibility of the kind of collapse that happened last year. Meanwhile, macroeconomists were divided in their views. But the main division was between those who insisted that free-market economies never go astray and those who believed that economies may stray now and then but that any major deviations from the path of prosperity could and would be corrected by the all-powerful Fed. Neither side was prepared to cope with an economy that went off the rails despite the Fed's best efforts.
 And in the wake of the crisis, the fault lines in the economics profession have yawned wider than ever. Lucas says the Obama administration's stimulus plans are ''schlock economics,'' and his Chicago colleague John Cochrane says they're based on discredited ''fairy tales.'' In response, Brad DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley, writes of the ''intellectual collapse'' of the Chicago School, and I myself have written that comments from Chicago economists are the product of a Dark Age of macroeconomics in which hard-won knowledge has been forgotten.
 What happened to the economics profession? And where does it go from here?
 As I see it, the economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth. Until the Great Depression, most economists clung to a vision of capitalism as a perfect or nearly perfect system. That vision wasn't sustainable in the face of mass unemployment, but as memories of the Depression faded, economists fell back in love with the old, idealized vision of an economy in which rational individuals interact in perfect markets, this time gussied up with fancy equations. The renewed romance with the idealized market was, to be sure, partly a response to shifting political winds, partly a response to financial incentives. But while sabbaticals at the Hoover Institution and job opportunities on Wall Street are nothing to sneeze at, the central cause of the profession's failure was the desire for an all-encompassing, intellectually elegant approach that also gave economists a chance to show off their mathematical prowess.
 Unfortunately, this romanticized and sanitized vision of the economy led most economists to ignore all the things that can go wrong. They turned a blind eye to the limitations of human rationality that often lead to bubbles and busts; to the problems of institutions that run amok; to the imperfections of markets -- especially financial markets -- that can cause the economy's operating system to undergo sudden, unpredictable crashes; and to the dangers created when regulators don't believe in regulation.
 It's much harder to say where the economics profession goes from here. But what's almost certain is that economists will have to learn to live with messiness. That is, they will have to acknowledge the importance of irrational and often unpredictable behavior, face up to the often idiosyncratic imperfections of markets and accept that an elegant economic ''theory of everything'' is a long way off. In practical terms, this will translate into more cautious policy advice -- and a reduced willingness to dismantle economic safeguards in the faith that markets will solve all problems.
 II. FROM SMITH TO KEYNES AND BACK
 The birth of economics as a discipline is usually credited to Adam Smith, who published ''The Wealth of Nations'' in 1776. Over the next 160 years an extensive body of economic theory was developed, whose central message was: Trust the market. Yes, economists admitted that there were cases in which markets might fail, of which the most important was the case of ''externalities'' -- costs that people impose on others without paying the price, like traffic congestion or pollution. But the basic presumption of ''neoclassical'' economics (named after the late-19th-century theorists who elaborated on the concepts of their ''classical'' predecessors) was that we should have faith in the market system.
 This faith was, however, shattered by the Great Depression. Actually, even in the face of total collapse some economists insisted that whatever happens in a market economy must be right: ''Depressions are not simply evils,'' declared Joseph Schumpeter in 1934 -- 1934! They are, he added, ''forms of something which has to be done.'' But many, and eventually most, economists turned to the insights of John Maynard Keynes for both an explanation of what had happened and a solution to future depressions.
 Keynes did not, despite what you may have heard, want the government to run the economy. He described his analysis in his 1936 masterwork, ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,'' as ''moderately conservative in its implications.'' He wanted to fix capitalism, not replace it. But he did challenge the notion that free-market economies can function without a minder, expressing particular contempt for financial markets, which he viewed as being dominated by short-term speculation with little regard for fundamentals. And he called for active government intervention -- printing more money and, if necessary, spending heavily on public works -- to fight unemployment during slumps.
 It's important to understand that Keynes did much more than make bold assertions. ''The General Theory'' is a work of profound, deep analysis -- analysis that persuaded the best young economists of the day. Yet the story of economics over the past half century is, to a large degree, the story of a retreat from Keynesianism and a return to neoclassicism. The neoclassical revival was initially led by Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago, who asserted as early as 1953 that neoclassical economics works well enough as a description of the way the economy actually functions to be ''both extremely fruitful and deserving of much confidence.'' But what about depressions?
 Friedman's counterattack against Keynes began with the doctrine known as monetarism. Monetarists didn't disagree in principle with the idea that a market economy needs deliberate stabilization. ''We are all Keynesians now,'' Friedman once said, although he later claimed he was quoted out of context. Monetarists asserted, however, that a very limited, circumscribed form of government intervention -- namely, instructing central banks to keep the nation's money supply, the sum of cash in circulation and bank deposits, growing on a steady path -- is all that's required to prevent depressions. Famously, Friedman and his collaborator, Anna Schwartz, argued that if the Federal Reserve had done its job properly, the Great Depression would not have happened. Later, Friedman made a compelling case against any deliberate effort by government to push unemployment below its ''natural'' level (currently thought to be about 4.8 percent in the United States): excessively expansionary policies, he predicted, would lead to a combination of inflation and high unemployment -- a prediction that was borne out by the stagflation of the 1970s, which greatly advanced the credibility of the anti-Keynesian movement.
 Eventually, however, the anti-Keynesian counterrevolution went far beyond Friedman's position, which came to seem relatively moderate compared with what his successors were saying. Among financial economists, Keynes's disparaging vision of financial markets as a ''casino'' was replaced by ''efficient market'' theory, which asserted that financial markets always get asset prices right given the available information. Meanwhile, many macroeconomists completely rejected Keynes's framework for understanding economic slumps. Some returned to the view of Schumpeter and other apologists for the Great Depression, viewing recessions as a good thing, part of the economy's adjustment to change. And even those not willing to go that far argued that any attempt to fight an economic slump would do more harm than good.
 Not all macroeconomists were willing to go down this road: many became self-described New Keynesians, who continued to believe in an active role for the government. Yet even they mostly accepted the notion that investors and consumers are rational and that markets generally get it right. 
 Of course, there were exceptions to these trends: a few economists challenged the assumption of rational behavior, questioned the belief that financial markets can be trusted and pointed to the long history of financial crises that had devastating economic consequences. But they were swimming against the tide, unable to make much headway against a pervasive and, in retrospect, foolish complacency.
 III. PANGLOSSIAN FINANCE
 In the 1930s, financial markets, for obvious reasons, didn't get much respect. Keynes compared them to ''those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those that he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors.''
 And Keynes considered it a very bad idea to let such markets, in which speculators spent their time chasing one another's tails, dictate important business decisions: ''When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.'' 
 By 1970 or so, however, the study of financial markets seemed to have been taken over by Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss, who insisted that we live in the best of all possible worlds. Discussion of investor irrationality, of bubbles, of destructive speculation had virtually disappeared from academic discourse. The field was dominated by the ''efficient-market hypothesis,'' promulgated by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago, which claims that financial markets price assets precisely at their intrinsic worth given all publicly available information. (The price of a company's stock, for example, always accurately reflects the company's value given the information available on the company's earnings, its business prospects and so on.) And by the 1980s, finance economists, notably Michael Jensen of the Harvard Business School, were arguing that because financial markets always get prices right, the best thing corporate chieftains can do, not just for themselves but for the sake of the economy, is to maximize their stock prices. In other words, finance economists believed that we should put the capital development of the nation in the hands of what Keynes had called a ''casino.''
 It's hard to argue that this transformation in the profession was driven by events. True, the memory of 1929 was gradually receding, but there continued to be bull markets, with widespread tales of speculative excess, followed by bear markets. In 1973-4, for example, stocks lost 48 percent of their value. And the 1987 stock crash, in which the Dow plunged nearly 23 percent in a day for no clear reason, should have raised at least a few doubts about market rationality.
 These events, however, which Keynes would have considered evidence of the unreliability of markets, did little to blunt the force of a beautiful idea. The theoretical model that finance economists developed by assuming that every investor rationally balances risk against reward -- the so-called Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM (pronounced cap-em) -- is wonderfully elegant. And if you accept its premises it's also extremely useful. CAPM not only tells you how to choose your portfolio -- even more important from the financial industry's point of view, it tells you how to put a price on financial derivatives, claims on claims. The elegance and apparent usefulness of the new theory led to a string of Nobel prizes for its creators, and many of the theory's adepts also received more mundane rewards: Armed with their new models and formidable math skills -- the more arcane uses of CAPM require physicist-level computations -- mild-mannered business-school professors could and did become Wall Street rocket scientists, earning Wall Street paychecks.
 To be fair, finance theorists didn't accept the efficient-market hypothesis merely because it was elegant, convenient and lucrative. They also produced a great deal of statistical evidence, which at first seemed strongly supportive. But this evidence was of an oddly limited form. Finance economists rarely asked the seemingly obvious (though not easily answered) question of whether asset prices made sense given real-world fundamentals like earnings. Instead, they asked only whether asset prices made sense given other asset prices. Larry Summers, now the top economic adviser in the Obama administration, once mocked finance professors with a parable about ''ketchup economists'' who ''have shown that two-quart bottles of ketchup invariably sell for exactly twice as much as one-quart bottles of ketchup,'' and conclude from this that the ketchup market is perfectly efficient.
 But neither this mockery nor more polite critiques from economists like Robert Shiller of Yale had much effect. Finance theorists continued to believe that their models were essentially right, and so did many people making real-world decisions. Not least among these was Alan Greenspan, who was then the Fed chairman and a long-time supporter of financial deregulation whose rejection of calls to rein in subprime lending or address the ever-inflating housing bubble rested in large part on the belief that modern financial economics had everything under control. There was a telling moment in 2005, at a conference held to honor Greenspan's tenure at the Fed. One brave attendee, Raghuram Rajan (of the University of Chicago, surprisingly), presented a paper warning that the financial system was taking on potentially dangerous levels of risk. He was mocked by almost all present -- including, by the way, Larry Summers, who dismissed his warnings as ''misguided.''
 By October of last year, however, Greenspan was admitting that he was in a state of ''shocked disbelief,'' because ''the whole intellectual edifice'' had ''collapsed.'' Since this collapse of the intellectual edifice was also a collapse of real-world markets, the result was a severe recession -- the worst, by many measures, since the Great Depression. What should policy makers do? Unfortunately, macroeconomics, which should have been providing clear guidance about how to address the slumping economy, was in its own state of disarray.
 IV. THE TROUBLE WITH MACRO 
 ''We have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle, having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand. The result is that our possibilities of wealth may run to waste for a time -- perhaps for a long time.'' So wrote John Maynard Keynes in an essay titled ''The Great Slump of 1930,'' in which he tried to explain the catastrophe then overtaking the world. And the world's possibilities of wealth did indeed run to waste for a long time; it took World War II to bring the Great Depression to a definitive end.
 Why was Keynes's diagnosis of the Great Depression as a ''colossal muddle'' so compelling at first? And why did economics, circa 1975, divide into opposing camps over the value of Keynes's views?
 I like to explain the essence of Keynesian economics with a true story that also serves as a parable, a small-scale version of the messes that can afflict entire economies. Consider the travails of the Capitol Hill Baby-Sitting Co-op.
 This co-op, whose problems were recounted in a 1977 article in The Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, was an association of about 150 young couples who agreed to help one another by baby-sitting for one another's children when parents wanted a night out. To ensure that every couple did its fair share of baby-sitting, the co-op introduced a form of scrip: coupons made out of heavy pieces of paper, each entitling the bearer to one half-hour of sitting time. Initially, members received 20 coupons on joining and were required to return the same amount on departing the group.
 Unfortunately, it turned out that the co-op's members, on average, wanted to hold a reserve of more than 20 coupons, perhaps, in case they should want to go out several times in a row. As a result, relatively few people wanted to spend their scrip and go out, while many wanted to baby-sit so they could add to their hoard. But since baby-sitting opportunities arise only when someone goes out for the night, this meant that baby-sitting jobs were hard to find, which made members of the co-op even more reluctant to go out, making baby-sitting jobs even scarcer. . . .
 In short, the co-op fell into a recession.
 O.K., what do you think of this story? Don't dismiss it as silly and trivial: economists have used small-scale examples to shed light on big questions ever since Adam Smith saw the roots of economic progress in a pin factory, and they're right to do so. The question is whether this particular example, in which a recession is a problem of inadequate demand -- there isn't enough demand for baby-sitting to provide jobs for everyone who wants one -- gets at the essence of what happens in a recession.
 Forty years ago most economists would have agreed with this interpretation. But since then macroeconomics has divided into two great factions: ''saltwater'' economists (mainly in coastal U.S. universities), who have a more or less Keynesian vision of what recessions are all about; and ''freshwater'' economists (mainly at inland schools), who consider that vision nonsense.
 Freshwater economists are, essentially, neoclassical purists. They believe that all worthwhile economic analysis starts from the premise that people are rational and markets work, a premise violated by the story of the baby-sitting co-op. As they see it, a general lack of sufficient demand isn't possible, because prices always move to match supply with demand. If people want more baby-sitting coupons, the value of those coupons will rise, so that they're worth, say, 40 minutes of baby-sitting rather than half an hour -- or, equivalently, the cost of an hours' baby-sitting would fall from 2 coupons to 1.5. And that would solve the problem: the purchasing power of the coupons in circulation would have risen, so that people would feel no need to hoard more, and there would be no recession.
 But don't recessions look like periods in which there just isn't enough demand to employ everyone willing to work? Appearances can be deceiving, say the freshwater theorists. Sound economics, in their view, says that overall failures of demand can't happen -- and that means that they don't. Keynesian economics has been ''proved false,'' Cochrane, of the University of Chicago, says.
 Yet recessions do happen. Why? In the 1970s the leading freshwater macroeconomist, the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, argued that recessions were caused by temporary confusion: workers and companies had trouble distinguishing overall changes in the level of prices because of inflation or deflation from changes in their own particular business situation. And Lucas warned that any attempt to fight the business cycle would be counterproductive: activist policies, he argued, would just add to the confusion.
 By the 1980s, however, even this severely limited acceptance of the idea that recessions are bad things had been rejected by many freshwater economists. Instead, the new leaders of the movement, especially Edward Prescott, who was then at the University of Minnesota (you can see where the freshwater moniker comes from), argued that price fluctuations and changes in demand actually had nothing to do with the business cycle. Rather, the business cycle reflects fluctuations in the rate of technological progress, which are amplified by the rational response of workers, who voluntarily work more when the environment is favorable and less when it's unfavorable. Unemployment is a deliberate decision by workers to take time off.
 Put baldly like that, this theory sounds foolish -- was the Great Depression really the Great Vacation? And to be honest, I think it really is silly. But the basic premise of Prescott's ''real business cycle'' theory was embedded in ingeniously constructed mathematical models, which were mapped onto real data using sophisticated statistical techniques, and the theory came to dominate the teaching of macroeconomics in many university departments. In 2004, reflecting the theory's influence, Prescott shared a Nobel with Finn Kydland of Carnegie Mellon University.
 Meanwhile, saltwater economists balked. Where the freshwater economists were purists, saltwater economists were pragmatists. While economists like N. Gregory Mankiw at Harvard, Olivier Blanchard at M.I.T. and David Romer at the University of California, Berkeley, acknowledged that it was hard to reconcile a Keynesian demand-side view of recessions with neoclassical theory, they found the evidence that recessions are, in fact, demand-driven too compelling to reject. So they were willing to deviate from the assumption of perfect markets or perfect rationality, or both, adding enough imperfections to accommodate a more or less Keynesian view of recessions. And in the saltwater view, active policy to fight recessions remained desirable.
 But the self-described New Keynesian economists weren't immune to the charms of rational individuals and perfect markets. They tried to keep their deviations from neoclassical orthodoxy as limited as possible. This meant that there was no room in the prevailing models for such things as bubbles and banking-system collapse. The fact that such things continued to happen in the real world -- there was a terrible financial and macroeconomic crisis in much of Asia in 1997-8 and a depression-level slump in Argentina in 2002 -- wasn't reflected in the mainstream of New Keynesian thinking.
 Even so, you might have thought that the differing worldviews of freshwater and saltwater economists would have put them constantly at loggerheads over economic policy. Somewhat surprisingly, however, between around 1985 and 2007 the disputes between freshwater and saltwater economists were mainly about theory, not action. The reason, I believe, is that New Keynesians, unlike the original Keynesians, didn't think fiscal policy -- changes in government spending or taxes -- was needed to fight recessions. They believed that monetary policy, administered by the technocrats at the Fed, could provide whatever remedies the economy needed. At a 90th birthday celebration for Milton Friedman, Ben Bernanke, formerly a more or less New Keynesian professor at Princeton, and by then a member of the Fed's governing board, declared of the Great Depression: ''You're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, it won't happen again.'' The clear message was that all you need to avoid depressions is a smarter Fed.
 And as long as macroeconomic policy was left in the hands of the maestro Greenspan, without Keynesian-type stimulus programs, freshwater economists found little to complain about. (They didn't believe that monetary policy did any good, but they didn't believe it did any harm, either.) 
 It would take a crisis to reveal both how little common ground there was and how Panglossian even New Keynesian economics had become.
 V. NOBODY COULD HAVE PREDICTED . . .
 In recent, rueful economics discussions, an all-purpose punch line has become ''nobody could have predicted. . . .'' It's what you say with regard to disasters that could have been predicted, should have been predicted and actually were predicted by a few economists who were scoffed at for their pains.
 Take, for example, the precipitous rise and fall of housing prices. Some economists, notably Robert Shiller, did identify the bubble and warn of painful consequences if it were to burst. Yet key policy makers failed to see the obvious. In 2004, Alan Greenspan dismissed talk of a housing bubble: ''a national severe price distortion,'' he declared, was ''most unlikely.'' Home-price increases, Ben Bernanke said in 2005, ''largely reflect strong economic fundamentals.''
 How did they miss the bubble? To be fair, interest rates were unusually low, possibly explaining part of the price rise. It may be that Greenspan and Bernanke also wanted to celebrate the Fed's success in pulling the economy out of the 2001 recession; conceding that much of that success rested on the creation of a monstrous bubble would have placed a damper on the festivities. 
 But there was something else going on: a general belief that bubbles just don't happen. What's striking, when you reread Greenspan's assurances, is that they weren't based on evidence -- they were based on the a priori assertion that there simply can't be a bubble in housing. And the finance theorists were even more adamant on this point. In a 2007 interview, Eugene Fama, the father of the efficient-market hypothesis, declared that ''the word 'bubble' drives me nuts,'' and went on to explain why we can trust the housing market: ''Housing markets are less liquid, but people are very careful when they buy houses. It's typically the biggest investment they're going to make, so they look around very carefully and they compare prices. The bidding process is very detailed.''
 Indeed, home buyers generally do carefully compare prices -- that is, they compare the price of their potential purchase with the prices of other houses. But this says nothing about whether the overall price of houses is justified. It's ketchup economics, again: because a two-quart bottle of ketchup costs twice as much as a one-quart bottle, finance theorists declare that the price of ketchup must be right.
 In short, the belief in efficient financial markets blinded many if not most economists to the emergence of the biggest financial bubble in history. And efficient-market theory also played a significant role in inflating that bubble in the first place.
 Now that the undiagnosed bubble has burst, the true riskiness of supposedly safe assets has been revealed and the financial system has demonstrated its fragility. U.S. households have seen $13 trillion in wealth evaporate. More than six million jobs have been lost, and the unemployment rate appears headed for its highest level since 1940. So what guidance does modern economics have to offer in our current predicament? And should we trust it?
 VI. THE STIMULUS SQUABBLE
 Between 1985 and 2007 a false peace settled over the field of macroeconomics. There hadn't been any real convergence of views between the saltwater and freshwater factions. But these were the years of the Great Moderation -- an extended period during which inflation was subdued and recessions were relatively mild. Saltwater economists believed that the Federal Reserve had everything under control. Freshwater economists didn't think the Fed's actions were actually beneficial, but they were willing to let matters lie.
 But the crisis ended the phony peace. Suddenly the narrow, technocratic policies both sides were willing to accept were no longer sufficient -- and the need for a broader policy response brought the old conflicts out into the open, fiercer than ever.
 Why weren't those narrow, technocratic policies sufficient? The answer, in a word, is zero.
 During a normal recession, the Fed responds by buying Treasury bills -- short-term government debt -- from banks. This drives interest rates on government debt down; investors seeking a higher rate of return move into other assets, driving other interest rates down as well; and normally these lower interest rates eventually lead to an economic bounceback. The Fed dealt with the recession that began in 1990 by driving short-term interest rates from 9 percent down to 3 percent. It dealt with the recession that began in 2001 by driving rates from 6.5 percent to 1 percent. And it tried to deal with the current recession by driving rates down from 5.25 percent to zero.
 But zero, it turned out, isn't low enough to end this recession. And the Fed can't push rates below zero, since at near-zero rates investors simply hoard cash rather than lending it out. So by late 2008, with interest rates basically at what macroeconomists call the ''zero lower bound'' even as the recession continued to deepen, conventional monetary policy had lost all traction.
 Now what? This is the second time America has been up against the zero lower bound, the previous occasion being the Great Depression. And it was precisely the observation that there's a lower bound to interest rates that led Keynes to advocate higher government spending: when monetary policy is ineffective and the private sector can't be persuaded to spend more, the public sector must take its place in supporting the economy. Fiscal stimulus is the Keynesian answer to the kind of depression-type economic situation we're currently in.
 Such Keynesian thinking underlies the Obama administration's economic policies -- and the freshwater economists are furious. For 25 or so years they tolerated the Fed's efforts to manage the economy, but a full-blown Keynesian resurgence was something entirely different. Back in 1980, Lucas, of the University of Chicago, wrote that Keynesian economics was so ludicrous that ''at research seminars, people don't take Keynesian theorizing seriously anymore; the audience starts to whisper and giggle to one another.'' Admitting that Keynes was largely right, after all, would be too humiliating a comedown.
 And so Chicago's Cochrane, outraged at the idea that government spending could mitigate the latest recession, declared: ''It's not part of what anybody has taught graduate students since the 1960s. They [Keynesian ideas] are fairy tales that have been proved false. It is very comforting in times of stress to go back to the fairy tales we heard as children, but it doesn't make them less false.'' (It's a mark of how deep the division between saltwater and freshwater runs that Cochrane doesn't believe that ''anybody'' teaches ideas that are, in fact, taught in places like Princeton, M.I.T. and Harvard.)
 Meanwhile, saltwater economists, who had comforted themselves with the belief that the great divide in macroeconomics was narrowing, were shocked to realize that freshwater economists hadn't been listening at all. Freshwater economists who inveighed against the stimulus didn't sound like scholars who had weighed Keynesian arguments and found them wanting. Rather, they sounded like people who had no idea what Keynesian economics was about, who were resurrecting pre-1930 fallacies in the belief that they were saying something new and profound.
 And it wasn't just Keynes whose ideas seemed to have been forgotten. As Brad DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley, has pointed out in his laments about the Chicago school's ''intellectual collapse,'' the school's current stance amounts to a wholesale rejection of Milton Friedman's ideas, as well. Friedman believed that Fed policy rather than changes in government spending should be used to stabilize the economy, but he never asserted that an increase in government spending cannot, under any circumstances, increase employment. In fact, rereading Friedman's 1970 summary of his ideas, ''A Theoretical Framework for Monetary Analysis,'' what's striking is how Keynesian it seems.
 And Friedman certainly never bought into the idea that mass unemployment represents a voluntary reduction in work effort or the idea that recessions are actually good for the economy. Yet the current generation of freshwater economists has been making both arguments. Thus Chicago's Casey Mulligan suggests that unemployment is so high because many workers are choosing not to take jobs: ''Employees face financial incentives that encourage them not to work . . . decreased employment is explained more by reductions in the supply of labor (the willingness of people to work) and less by the demand for labor (the number of workers that employers need to hire).'' Mulligan has suggested, in particular, that workers are choosing to remain unemployed because that improves their odds of receiving mortgage relief. And Cochrane declares that high unemployment is actually good: ''We should have a recession. People who spend their lives pounding nails in Nevada need something else to do.''
 Personally, I think this is crazy. Why should it take mass unemployment across the whole nation to get carpenters to move out of Nevada? Can anyone seriously claim that we've lost 6.7 million jobs because fewer Americans want to work? But it was inevitable that freshwater economists would find themselves trapped in this cul-de-sac: if you start from the assumption that people are perfectly rational and markets are perfectly efficient, you have to conclude that unemployment is voluntary and recessions are desirable.
 Yet if the crisis has pushed freshwater economists into absurdity, it has also created a lot of soul-searching among saltwater economists. Their framework, unlike that of the Chicago School, both allows for the possibility of involuntary unemployment and considers it a bad thing. But the New Keynesian models that have come to dominate teaching and research assume that people are perfectly rational and financial markets are perfectly efficient. To get anything like the current slump into their models, New Keynesians are forced to introduce some kind of fudge factor that for reasons unspecified temporarily depresses private spending. (I've done exactly that in some of my own work.) And if the analysis of where we are now rests on this fudge factor, how much confidence can we have in the models' predictions about where we are going?
 The state of macro, in short, is not good. So where does the profession go from here?
 VII. FLAWS AND FRICTIONS
 Economics, as a field, got in trouble because economists were seduced by the vision of a perfect, frictionless market system. If the profession is to redeem itself, it will have to reconcile itself to a less alluring vision -- that of a market economy that has many virtues but that is also shot through with flaws and frictions. The good news is that we don't have to start from scratch. Even during the heyday of perfect-market economics, there was a lot of work done on the ways in which the real economy deviated from the theoretical ideal. What's probably going to happen now -- in fact, it's already happening -- is that flaws-and-frictions economics will move from the periphery of economic analysis to its center.
 There's already a fairly well developed example of the kind of economics I have in mind: the school of thought known as behavioral finance. Practitioners of this approach emphasize two things. First, many real-world investors bear little resemblance to the cool calculators of efficient-market theory: they're all too subject to herd behavior, to bouts of irrational exuberance and unwarranted panic. Second, even those who try to base their decisions on cool calculation often find that they can't, that problems of trust, credibility and limited collateral force them to run with the herd.
 On the first point: even during the heyday of the efficient-market hypothesis, it seemed obvious that many real-world investors aren't as rational as the prevailing models assumed. Larry Summers once began a paper on finance by declaring: ''THERE ARE IDIOTS. Look around.'' But what kind of idiots (the preferred term in the academic literature, actually, is ''noise traders'') are we talking about? Behavioral finance, drawing on the broader movement known as behavioral economics, tries to answer that question by relating the apparent irrationality of investors to known biases in human cognition, like the tendency to care more about small losses than small gains or the tendency to extrapolate too readily from small samples (e.g., assuming that because home prices rose in the past few years, they'll keep on rising).
 Until the crisis, efficient-market advocates like Eugene Fama dismissed the evidence produced on behalf of behavioral finance as a collection of ''curiosity items'' of no real importance. That's a much harder position to maintain now that the collapse of a vast bubble -- a bubble correctly diagnosed by behavioral economists like Robert Shiller of Yale, who related it to past episodes of ''irrational exuberance'' -- has brought the world economy to its knees.
 On the second point: suppose that there are, indeed, idiots. How much do they matter? Not much, argued Milton Friedman in an influential 1953 paper: smart investors will make money by buying when the idiots sell and selling when they buy and will stabilize markets in the process. But the second strand of behavioral finance says that Friedman was wrong, that financial markets are sometimes highly unstable, and right now that view seems hard to reject.
 Probably the most influential paper in this vein was a 1997 publication by Andrei Shleifer of Harvard and Robert Vishny of Chicago, which amounted to a formalization of the old line that ''the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.'' As they pointed out, arbitrageurs -- the people who are supposed to buy low and sell high -- need capital to do their jobs. And a severe plunge in asset prices, even if it makes no sense in terms of fundamentals, tends to deplete that capital. As a result, the smart money is forced out of the market, and prices may go into a downward spiral.
 The spread of the current financial crisis seemed almost like an object lesson in the perils of financial instability. And the general ideas underlying models of financial instability have proved highly relevant to economic policy: a focus on the depleted capital of financial institutions helped guide policy actions taken after the fall of Lehman, and it looks (cross your fingers) as if these actions successfully headed off an even bigger financial collapse.
 Meanwhile, what about macroeconomics? Recent events have pretty decisively refuted the idea that recessions are an optimal response to fluctuations in the rate of technological progress; a more or less Keynesian view is the only plausible game in town. Yet standard New Keynesian models left no room for a crisis like the one we're having, because those models generally accepted the efficient-market view of the financial sector.
 There were some exceptions. One line of work, pioneered by none other than Ben Bernanke working with Mark Gertler of New York University, emphasized the way the lack of sufficient collateral can hinder the ability of businesses to raise funds and pursue investment opportunities. A related line of work, largely established by my Princeton colleague Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and John Moore of the London School of Economics, argued that prices of assets such as real estate can suffer self-reinforcing plunges that in turn depress the economy as a whole. But until now the impact of dysfunctional finance hasn't been at the core even of Keynesian economics. Clearly, that has to change.
 VIII. RE-EMBRACING KEYNES
 So here's what I think economists have to do. First, they have to face up to the inconvenient reality that financial markets fall far short of perfection, that they are subject to extraordinary delusions and the madness of crowds. Second, they have to admit -- and this will be very hard for the people who giggled and whispered over Keynes -- that Keynesian economics remains the best framework we have for making sense of recessions and depressions. Third, they'll have to do their best to incorporate the realities of finance into macroeconomics.
 Many economists will find these changes deeply disturbing. It will be a long time, if ever, before the new, more realistic approaches to finance and macroeconomics offer the same kind of clarity, completeness and sheer beauty that characterizes the full neoclassical approach. To some economists that will be a reason to cling to neoclassicism, despite its utter failure to make sense of the greatest economic crisis in three generations. This seems, however, like a good time to recall the words of H. L. Mencken: ''There is always an easy solution to every human problem -- neat, plausible and wrong.''
 When it comes to the all-too-human problem of recessions and depressions, economists need to abandon the neat but wrong solution of assuming that everyone is rational and markets work perfectly. The vision that emerges as the profession rethinks its foundations may not be all that clear; it certainly won't be neat; but we can hope that it will have the virtue of being at least partly right. 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 6, 2009 Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Page 36 this weekend about the failure of economists to anticipate the latest recession misquotes the economist John Maynard Keynes, who compared the financial markets of the 1930s to newspaper beauty contests in which readers tried to correctly pick all six eventual winners. Keynes noted that a competitor did not have to pick ''those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those that he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors.'' He did not say, ''nor even those that he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of other competitors.''

HEADLINE: Eliminating Tennis Mulligans

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''Toss the Ball. Hit the Ball. Oops! Oops!'' Sept. 2: Eliminating the right to a mulligan after a first-serve default would do wonders to improve Grand Slam tennis. It would simultaneously reduce the influence of brute force on the outcome of the match, and enhance the reward from improved thinking skills -- mirroring the trend experienced in the economic development of nations. Ira Sohn 
 Montclair, N.J.
 The writer is a professor of economics and finance at Montclair State University.
 To the Sports Editor:
 The most glaring defect in the modern women's serve is that the toss is too high. I was taught more than 50 years ago to toss no higher than the point of impact, to hit the ball at the top of the toss, and to toss at the swing, not swing at the toss. Pancho Gonzalez's serve was used as the example of the ideal serve. His motion was compact, simple and effective.
 Nerves play a part, but it is a lot easier to overcome them if the toss is not so high that the ball is descending as it is struck. It is easier to time the swing with a shorter toss. Eric Lukingbeal

HEADLINE: The Women's Crusade

 BODY:
 I think the earlier cover article ''What Women Want'' has at last been answered. In short, the answer is equality, and it comes across shiningly in the extraordinary article by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. Now if you will just turn the lens onto our very own (developed) nation and have a similar expose of our levels of sexual harassment, assault, rape and domestic battery -- we will finally be getting somewhere. Or starting to. Or at least acknowledging we've got somewhere to get that is far away from where we currently stand. 
 MAUREEN K. DOLL New York
 I was so deeply moved by ''The Women's Crusade'' that I went directly to my computer and made a donation to one of the agencies that was listed. The Times and the authors are to be congratulated for continually calling attention to the conditions of women.
 DOROTHY ANNE BLATT Cincinnati
 The article asks, ''What should we make of stories like Saima's?'' -- a Pakistani woman beaten daily by her husband who extricates herself from gross poverty with a microloan for embroidering. What we should make of such stories is that they don't add up to a whole. Despite intense grass-roots efforts to eradicate poverty in the poorest countries, poverty rates in Africa, based on World Bank data, did not fall from 1981 to 2005. This is because, in the presence of mass unemployment and an overabundance of small entrepreneurs like Saima, a better-fed, -housed, -clothed and -schooled labor force can't usually find steady, remunerative work. More education for women simply leads to more unemployment, impoverished family firms or brain drain. What women deserve is greater efforts on the demand side, by governments, to create industries and jobs above the subsistence level.
 ALICE AMSDEN Barton L. Weller Professor of Political Economy Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, Mass.
 I applaud Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn for their remarkable work of highlighting the enormous multiplier effect that the empowerment of women has on families and entire communities. Their efforts have brought to life the dynamic stories of so many girls and women in developing countries who have overcome unthinkable hardship. Yet I was struck by the lack of attention paid to Latin America and the Caribbean in ''The Women's Crusade.'' Latin America and the Caribbean is a region of extreme contrasts. Its relative economic prosperity often masks a vast inequality -- the greatest degree of disparity between rich and poor in the world, which has significant implications for women. Thirty-five percent of women in the region give birth before the age of 20 and in rural areas that number jumps to 40 to 60 percent. It is the only region in the world where births to adolescent mothers represent the largest fraction of total births.

HEADLINE: A Harley Lands in America, by Way of Europe

BYLINE: By STUART F. BROWN

 BODY:
THE 2009 Harley-Davidson XR1200 took me by surprise. Sure, I knew about its unveiling in 2006 at a European motorcycle show. But even that unusual setting for the debut of a prototype by the most American of bike makers did not prepare me for how different this Harley would be.
 Now a production model as part of the Sportster model line, the XR1200 was developed to appeal to riders across the Atlantic, where Harley has been trying to expand its sales. Its focus is on performance, rather than the company's usual emphasis on relaxed cruising, and the ergonomics of its seating, foot pegs and controls make it what the industry calls a standard motorcycle these days. It feels quite right. 
 The XR1200 went on sale in April of 2008 -- but not in the United States. It was offered only in European markets, where the company expected to find the riders who would most appreciate a Harley with good handling and brakes. Of course, plenty of us Americans like those traits, but we have not gone shopping for them in a Harley showroom. 
 For 2009 Harley's management took note of the clamor from American dealers and rolled out the XR1200 in the United States. At $11,099, it costs roughly $1,000 more than any other Sportster; if you want orange or silver paint instead of black, that'll be another $280. 
 Harley has never built a bike that can hustle down a curvy road the way the XR does. That is because this time around the engineers paid closer attention to chassis rigidity and cornering clearance, and they fitted the XR with a capable chassis. The front suspension uses a 43mm inverted fork, the sort used on many sportbikes. The front discs are grabbed by a pair of excellent four-piston Nissin brake calipers that work powerfully and controllably, and both wheels are fitted with grippy Dunlop Qualifier tires. 
 This summer, Harley took the XR one step further, offering a $1,500 performance handling kit with fully adjustable shocks and front fork that are used on the European-market XR1200X.
 Such details have rarely been a priority for Harley's traditional customers, who are usually long-distance touring riders, or are interested mainly in casual riding, which entails a feet-forward riding position. 
 When sitting that way on a cruiser bike, the wind is constantly working to rip you off the bike, a situation I find very tiring. On the XR1200, you ride with your feet down below your knees instead of stretched out in front of them. And your torso leans slightly forward, where the oncoming wind takes a load off your wrists and back. 
 The XR's air-cooled engine is based on the 45-degree V-twin used in Harley's Sportster models, which are lighter and nimbler than the maker's larger family of bikes. The XR version is fitted with higher-compression pistons and performance camshafts, as well as additional oil circulation and cooling provisions to deal with the heat that comes with increased power.
 Cycle World magazine measured its output at 79 horsepower at the rear wheel, an unremarkable figure for a 1,200cc motor. Coupled with those horses, however, come 74 pound-feet of torque, the force that yields immediate results when you twist the throttle. And the torque curve is approximately flat (maximum torque is at just 4,000 r.p.m.), so the XR1200 pulls willingly from just above idle all the way up to the engine's redline. 
 The rider doesn't have to fuss with a lot of gear shifting, which frees up attention to savor the stable and well-planted feeling of this bike when it is heeled over in turns. At an idle, the XR1200's pushrod V-twin vibrates like crazy, but once under way a rubber engine mounting system smoothes things out. You know there is a brawny motor down there, but you can comfortably ride through a tank of gas, about 140 miles. 
 Riders from outside the Harley universe are known to mutter unsympathetic phrases like ''chrome don't get you home.'' The XR1200 takes this sentiment to heart. There is almost no chrome on the bike, and many surfaces have a silver powdercoat finish that makes engine parts look sand-cast, as are many parts on racing engines. 
 All of this is in keeping with the XR1200's styling inspiration, the XR-750 dirt-track racing machine that has won many championships for Harley over the years. The graphics on its slim 3.5-gallon gas tank, the over-and-under mufflers and the low-rise handlebars all add to the track-ready look. 
 The XR does have a few warts, including a side stand that requires a bizarre contortion of the left ankle to lower. Meanwhile, the rider's right ankle runs afoul of the master cylinder for the rear brake, which should have been tucked out of the way. And most puzzling of all, the big bolt that goes through the front fork's upper triple clamp looks as if it was pulled from a bin at the neighborhood hardware store. 
 Finally, like all Harleys, the XR1200 is heavy. With a full tank of gas, it weighs almost 600 pounds. One can imagine how much more fun this bike would be if it shed 100 or more of those pounds. 
 For those of us who grew up riding European and Japanese bikes with great handling and brakes, the XR1200 constitutes a nod of recognition. Harley is wise to begin building motorcycles like this. Fresh designs like the XR1200 will be just the thing to help Harley appeal to a broader group of riders when the economy finally gets its mojo back.

HEADLINE: Laura Adams, John Paul Kish Jr.

 BODY:
Laura Elizabeth Adams, the daughter of Cynthia A. Marlette and Randall W. Adams of Annapolis, Md., was married there Saturday to Lt. John Paul Kish Jr., the son of Bette A. Kish and Mr. Kish of Humble, Tex. The Rev. Byron Brought, a United Methodist minister, officiated at the United States Naval Academy Chapel. 
 Mrs. Kish, 28, is studying for a teaching license at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. She graduated from Vassar and is a part-time physical education teacher at the Virginia Beach Friends School in Virginia Beach, Va. 
 Her father retired as an economist at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. Her mother is the commission's general counsel.
 Lieutenant Kish, 27, is a Navy helicopter pilot stationed in Norfolk, Va. He returned in April from a nine-month tour of duty in Afghanistan. He graduated from the Naval Academy.
 His mother retired from teaching English as a second language at Humble Elementary School, and is now a part-time flight attendant for Continental Airlines. His father is a financial adviser in the Woodlands, Tex., branch office of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
 The couple met in 2001, when the bridegroom, then in his first year at Annapolis, accompanied his roommate to the bride's family's house to meet the young women they were to escort to a dance. Ms. Adams was home from college but was not one of the designated dates. Nevertheless, they took an immediate interest in each other.
 ''I slipped her my telephone number because she wasn't coming along,'' he said. ''So she called me.''
 Ms. Adams said that, while their introduction might have been potentially uncomfortable, the bridegroom is not the type of person bothered by a little awkwardness.
 ''It didn't seem to stop him,'' she said. ''We just looked at each other and there was definitely something there.''

HEADLINE: Get Lost. In Books.

BYLINE: By HAROLD BLOOM

 BODY:
More than ever in this time of economic troubles and societal change, entering upon an undergraduate education should be a voyage away from visual overstimulation into deep, sustained reading of what is most worth absorbing and understanding: the books that survive all ideological fashions. 
 There is general agreement on the indispensable canon: Homer, Plato, the Bible, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Milton. From the 19th century until now, keeping only to English and American authors, a slightly more arbitrary selection might include Blake, Wordsworth, Austen, Dickens, George Eliot, Hardy, Yeats and Joyce in England and Ireland. Among the Americans would certainly be Emerson, Thoreau, Melville, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Hawthorne; and in the 20th century, Faulkner and the major poets: Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, T. S. Eliot, Hart Crane.
 Many of these authors are difficult and demand rereading, but that doubles their value. A freshman may have read Shakespeare before, but the richest and most available of all writers is also the most profound and elliptical. Rereading ''Hamlet'' and ''King Lear'' should teach a student Shakespeare's mastery of the art of leaving things out.
 To think well you must rely, in part, upon memory, and possessing Shakespeare and Joyce, Montaigne and Whitman means that you can recall much of the best that has been written. 
 Whatever our current travails, we now have a literate president capable of coherent discourse, but too many other politicians are devoid of syntax and appear to have read nothing. Aggressive ignorance in aspirants to high office is another dismal consequence of the waning of authentic education.

HEADLINE: Finance Leaders Back Continued Stimulus, but Limits on Pay Are Elusive

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Finance ministers of the largest industrial countries vowed on Saturday to keep their multitrillion-dollar stimulus efforts in place, but at a meeting here they failed to agree on any firm limits on bankers' bonuses, a sign of the deep rifts that remain between American and European leaders.
 The ministers did agree on a blueprint to raise capital requirements at banks to strengthen the world financial system as the recovery takes hold, a major goal of the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. 
 Regarding the higher capital requirements, Mr. Geithner said here that his goal was to reach a final agreement on the new standards by the end of next year.
 Mr. Geithner added that while concerted action by central banks and governments had ''pulled the global economy back from the edge of abyss,'' he added that ''conditions for a sustained recovery led by private demand are not yet established.''
 The ministers agreed on broad principles to reform bankers' compensation, including an emphasis on rewarding long-term performance, but asked the Financial Stability Board, an international regulatory body, to come up with specific recommendations on bonuses to be presented at a Group of 20 summit meeting to be held in three weeks in Pittsburgh.
 In its final communique, the G-20 ministers called for ''global standards on pay structure,'' emphasizing long-term results in awarding pay and urging provisions to take back bonuses if bank profits tumble, known as ''clawbacks.'' They also suggested limits on guaranteed bonuses.
 That was a setback for French and German ministers who had been pushing hard in recent weeks for a more concrete plan to address bonuses, amid rising public anger that just months after they were rescued, major financial institutions are returning to old habits and rewarding executives who take excessive risks.
 In Europe, where Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, is running for re-election later this month and the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, faces a general election within the next year, bonuses have been met with controversy. 
 While bonuses are still a contentious issue in the United States, they have been overtaken recently by the debate over health care reform. Negotiations between the American and European delegations over bonuses grew tense Friday night, according to one official who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
 He said the European negotiators felt their American counterparts were seeking to sidestep the bonus issue out of fear the White House could be accused of yielding too easily to European pressure, which might endanger progress on health care reform.
 Mr. Geithner has been cool to proposals to restrict bonuses, instead emphasizing the need for higher capital requirements at banks and other broader regulatory measures to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis that began almost exactly a year ago with the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, tried to put the best face on the limited recommendations. ''We argued very hard and very convincingly,'' she said. ''We've agreed that the F.S.B. will come back to Pittsburgh with proposals on remuneration.''
 She added: ''Bonuses are quite outrageous, and we can't let that continue.''
 The tone of the meeting, a precursor to the meeting in Pittsburgh, suggested that although the worst of the global financial panic had passed, politicians and economists remained deeply concerned about still-rising unemployment.
 ''The classic errors of economic policy during crises are that governments tend to act too late with insufficient force and then put the brakes on too early,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''We are not going to repeat those mistakes.''
 With economic growth resuming in France and Germany last quarter, there has been increasing talk in Europe about a so-called exit strategy -- how to unwind the trillions of dollars in central bank lending and increased government spending without sending the global economy back into free fall.
 But even German officials, who have been wary of the risk of inflation posed by widening deficits on both sides of the Atlantic, agreed in London that it was still too early to withdraw government support of the financial system.
 ''Everyone is convinced that we have to support the financial markets by all measures and stimulus packages which are necessary,'' said the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck.
 Other top financial officials echoed the view that it was still too early to celebrate about signs of growth.
 ''I was afraid a few weeks ago when we began to have good figures that it might induce an attitude that the crisis is over,'' said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. ''It's not the time to implement exit strategies.''
 Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, said members of the G-20 ''have to make sure that we finish the job we started.'' He added: ''There is still a lot of risk, a lot of uncertainty and a lot of obstacles to negotiate.''

HEADLINE: A Down Payment Anomaly

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
HOME buyers are often advised to come up with at least a 20 percent down payment, or face the likely additional expense of private mortgage insurance. But this year, at least, that counsel would not have saved them as much money as in the past. 
 Rules put in place in late 2008 by Fannie Mae and similar rules adopted by Freddie Mac are less favorable to borrowers who put down 20 percent to 25 percent, considered to be the industry minimum. (Fannie and Freddie are the government-controlled companies that establish the underwriting standards for most of the nation's loans.) 
 For most people, it turns out, smaller down payments result in lower interest rates. Whether that benefits borrowers in the long term, though, is open to debate.
 Take, for instance, borrowers who want to buy a $400,000 home, and who have a credit score of 720, which is considered very good. 
 In late August, such borrowers who had $80,000 saved for a 20 percent down payment would have qualified for a 4.875 percent rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan, according to Regina Mincey-Garlin, an owner of RCG Mortgage in Montclair, N.J.
 But that was also the rate offered to borrowers putting down only 5 percent, and therefore required to have private mortgage insurance.
 Oddly, those who put down 25 percent, or $100,000, were saddled with a higher interest rate, 5.375 percent, Ms. Mincey-Garlin said. 
 The underwriting rules from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac consider borrowers in the 20 to 25 percent down payment category to be the riskiest, in part because they are not required to carry private mortgage insurance. At higher down payments, however, rates begin to fall.
 Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae, said that the policy wasn't meant to encourage lower down payments, which some have seen as the main culprit in the home foreclosure crisis.
 ''It's just a less risky loan from our point of view,'' Ms. Bonitatibus said, because the lender's exposure to foreclosure losses is largely eliminated by mortgage insurance.
 She said the policy didn't benefit only Fannie Mae and lenders that sell loans to the company.
 Borrowers benefit too, she said, especially those who would otherwise have had to stretch for a bigger down payment and leave themselves with no financial cushion. These borrowers can instead save the extra cash they might have put toward a bigger down payment, keeping it handy for emergencies.
 Besides, Ms. Bonitatibus noted, as soon as borrowers pay off enough of their loan principal to establish a 20 percent equity position in the home mortgage, insurance is no longer required.
 While borrowers who take out mortgage insurance can indeed enjoy lower interest rates, their monthly payments will be larger than those who made the larger down payments, because the loan itself is bigger.
 A borrower who put down 25 percent for a $400,000 home would make a monthly mortgage payment of $1,680, while the borrower who put 15 percent down would pay $1,906 -- or $1,799 in principal and interest, plus another $107 monthly in mortgage insurance. (The mortgage insurance is tax deductible, however, so depending on a borrower's financial circumstances, the net mortgage liability would probably be less.)
 Ms. Mincey-Garlin of RCG Mortgage says she still advises borrowers to make a down payment as large as they can, because the increased equity will help them in the long term. 
 She also suggests that borrowers maintain savings equivalent to at least nine months of mortgage payments.
 Those who choose to make a lower down payment in the expectation of terminating their private mortgage insurance after a few years may encounter a harsh surprise, Ms. Mincey-Garlin said. 
 With property values declining, she said, some lenders have balked at releasing borrowers from mortgage insurance.

HEADLINE: The Daughter Deficit

 BODY:
 Tina Rosenberg, quoting Monica Das Gupta, portrays ''development'' as a unitary concept. But there are different kinds of development with varied consequences within the same society. In China, the most comprehensive studies of female infanticide and the neglect of girls show that excess female mortality fell precipitously from the 1930s through the 1960s before rising again with the ''development'' that started in the late 1970s. Despite reasonable (and unreasonable) objections to the socialist government, these facts are not questioned by demographers. 
 What changed? First, the adoption of a one-child policy restricted family flexibility and exacerbated patriarchal preferences for male heirs. As Das Gupta reports, antifemale bias is stronger for later-born siblings. In that context, if only one child is permitted, she had better not be a girl. Second, the collapse of basic social support for the poor once again made family composition the main determinant of old-age security. For all its amazing growth, China's economy has flourished off the insecurity of the poor.
 It was not ''development'' that hurt China's girls. It was the turn away from the kind of development that supported cultural change toward gender egalitarianism.

HEADLINE: More Homeless Pupils, More Strained Schools

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: ASHEVILLE, N.C. 

 BODY:
In the small trailer her family rented over the summer, 9-year-old Charity Crowell picked out the green and purple outfit she would wear on the first day of school. She vowed to try harder and bring her grades back up from the C's she got last spring -- a dismal semester when her parents lost their jobs and car and the family was evicted and migrated through friends' houses and a motel. 
 Charity is one child in a national surge of homeless schoolchildren that is driven by relentless unemployment and foreclosures. The rise, to more than one million students without stable housing by last spring, has tested budget-battered school districts as they try to carry out their responsibilities -- and the federal mandate -- to salvage education for children whose lives are filled with insecurity and turmoil.
The instability can be ruinous to schooling, educators say, adding multiple moves and lost class time to the inherent distress of homelessness. And so in accord with federal law, the Buncombe County district, where Charity attends, provides special bus service to shelters, motels, doubled-up houses, trailer parks and RV campgrounds to help children stay in their familiar schools as the families move about. 
 Still, Charity said of her last semester, ''I couldn't go to sleep, I was worried about all the stuff,'' and she often nodded off in class. 
 Charity and her brother, Elijah Carrington, 6, were among 239 children from homeless families in her district as of last June, an increase of 80 percent over the year before, with indications this semester that as many or more will be enrolled in the months ahead. 
 While current national data are not available, the number of schoolchildren in homeless families appears to have risen by 75 percent to 100 percent in many districts over the last two years, according to Barbara Duffield, policy director of the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth, an advocacy group. 
 There were 679,000 homeless students reported in 2006-7, a total that surpassed one million by last spring, Ms. Duffield said.
 With schools just returning to session, initial reports point to further rises. In San Antonio, for example, the district has enrolled 1,000 homeless students in the first two weeks of school, twice as many as at the same point last year. 
 ''It's hard enough going to school and growing up, but these kids also have to worry where they'll be staying that night and whether they'll eat,'' said Bill Murdock, chief executive of Eblen-Kimmel Charities, a private group in Asheville that helps needy families with anything from food baskets and money for utility bills to toiletries and a prom dress. 
 ''We see 8-year-olds telling Mom not to worry, don't cry,'' Mr. Murdock said. 
 Since 2001, federal law has required every district to appoint a liaison to the homeless, charged with identifying and aiding families who meet a broad definition of homelessness -- doubling up in the homes of relatives or friends or sleeping in motels or RV campgrounds as well as living in cars, shelters or on the streets. A small minority of districts, including Buncombe County, have used federal grants or local money to make the position full time.
 The law lays out rights for homeless children, including immediate school placement without proof of residence and a right to stay in the same school as the family is displaced. Providing transportation to the original school is an expensive logistical challenge in a huge district like Buncombe County, covering 700 square miles. 
 While the law's goals are widely praised, school superintendents lament that Congress has provided little money, adding to the fiscal woes of districts. ''The protections are important, but Congress has passed the cost to state and local taxpayers,'' said Bruce Hunter, associate director of the American Association of School Administrators. 
 Fairfax County, Va., where the number of homeless students climbed from 1,100 in June 2007 to 1,800 last spring, has three social workers dedicated to the homeless and is using a temporary stimulus grant to assign a full-time transportation coordinator to commandeer buses, issue gas cards and sometimes call taxis to get the children to their original schools. 
 Like Fairfax County, the Asheville area looks prosperous, drawing tourists and retirees, but manicured lawns, million-dollar homes and golf courses mask the struggles of many adults working at low-paying jobs in sales and food service. 
 Emily Walters, the liaison to the homeless for the Buncombe County schools, is busy as school begins, providing backpacks and other supplies and signing children up for free breakfasts and lunches. But her job continues through the school year as other families lose their footing and those who had concealed their status, because of the stigma or because they were not aware of the benefits, join the list. 
 Sometimes it includes driving families in crisis to look at prospective shelters -- a temporary solution at best, Ms. Walters said. When the county receives a two-year stimulus grant next month, she said, she hopes there will be more money to help people avoid eviction or pay security deposits for new rentals. 
 The evening before school began, Ms. Walters drove 45 minutes to an RV campground to deliver a scientific calculator and other essential school supplies to Cody Curry, 14, who lives with his mother, Dawn, and his brother, Zack, 11, in a camper. Mrs. Curry had to downsize from a trailer, she said, when her work as a sales clerk was cut to two days a week. 
 The first day of school, Ms. Walters drove to a men's rescue shelter in the city to take Nate Fountain, 18, to high school. Nate said his parents kicked him out of the house last spring, during his senior year, because he was not doing his school work and was drinking and using drugs. With Ms. Walters's help, he said, he expects to finish high school this semester and study culinary arts at a community college. 
 ''I spend a lot of time just making sure the kids stay in school,'' Ms. Walters said. 
 The busing service was especially valued by Leslie Laws, who was laid off from her job in customer service last year and lost her rental apartment. 
 Ms. Laws and her 12-year-old son are staying in a women's shelter in Asheville, far from his former school. He is deeply involved with activities like chorus. Now he must catch the bus at 6:05 a.m. and ride one and a half hours each way. 
 Educators and advocates for the homeless across the country said that in the current recession, the law had made a difference, minimizing destructive gaps in schooling and linking schools with social welfare agencies. 
 Charity Crowell, despite her vow to bring up her grades, may be in store for another rough semester. Her stepfather works long hours delivering food on commission, but business is poor. Her mother, Katrina, wants to look for a job, but that is difficult without a car. 
 Food stamps help, but by the second half of each month the family is mostly eating ''Beanee Weenees and noodles,'' Ms. Crowell said. As school resumed in late August, the family was facing eviction from the $475-a-month trailer and uncertain about what to do next.

HEADLINE: Visions of an Energy-Starved World

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER STEINER was once the happy driver of a sport utility vehicle. Mr. Steiner, the author of ''$20 Per Gallon: How the Inevitable Rise in the Price of Gasoline Will Change Our Lives for the Better,'' makes this confession early in his book: ''I drove an old Toyota 4Runner all over the country for a decade -- running the odometer past 240,000 miles -- and I loved it.''
 Therefore, he is far from gleeful when he describes how many S.U.V. owners decided to ditch their beloved big cars when gasoline hit $4 a gallon in 2008. Then, of course, gas prices returned to more affordable levels. Did those owners act too hastily? 
 No, says Mr. Steiner, a staff writer at Forbes and a civil engineer. We could all end up forsaking our fossil-fuel vehicles in the near future, he says, because of what he calls the dwindling supply and burgeoning demand for gasoline. He says that ''Texas- and Saudi Arabia-style gushers'' are a thing of the past, and he points to the booming economies of countries like India and China, which will enable hundreds of millions of new drivers to hit the highways. 
 Ultimately, he contends, these forces will drive the price of fuel far beyond $4 a gallon. In each successive chapter of the book, he describes how an additional $2 price increase might affect us. But will prices climb to the alarming level he suggests in the title? 
 The author doesn't go that far. He describes ''$20 Per Gallon'' as ''a thought experiment on the what-ifs of high gas prices focusing on tangible changes rather than abstract ones.'' 
 In short, Mr. Steiner has written a book full of fanciful predictions, some of which should probably be taken seriously, though certainly not all of them. Here are just a few: $8 gasoline will doom most United States airlines. When gas reaches $10 a gallon, Disney World will close. At $12, suburbanites will no longer be able to afford McMansions or their long commutes. And, at $14, it will be too expensive for Wal-Mart to gas up the truck fleet that moves goods around the country.
 Mr. Steiner asserts that good would come from such a future. He writes that it would force us to upgrade our public transportation systems, renovate our cities, get around more on foot and eat more locally grown food. Someday, Mr. Steiner assures us, we might even enjoy the rarefied life of Bill, a fictitious 27-year-old whom he imagines as a beneficiary of this energy-market upheaval. Bill, who has what sounds like a fairly lucrative job at a company that designs tidal power stations, lives in a solar-paneled apartment building in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. 
 Bill hasn't traveled by plane in years. Instead, he zips around on ultrafast trains. He can be in Montreal in two hours. He doesn't even need an electric car -- he travels by subway in New York. 
 Every aspect of Bill's life -- even his workout garb -- reflects the shift to alternative energy sources.
 ''Bill's running shoes have natural rubber bottoms -- as in tree rubber -- since the composite petrol-based materials that used to be made from petroleum and were so common in the past's sneakers are all but forgotten,'' Mr. Steiner writes. 
 Yes, but how do we move from our smoggy, fossil-fuel-dependent existence to Bill's pristine utopia? The book acknowledges that the transition will be difficult, but glosses over just how painful it could be for the losers in this new, green economy (assuming that gasoline really becomes so unaffordable).
 Mr. Steiner writes that high gas prices will force suburbanites to move into cities where they don't need cars. That may bring a renaissance in rust-belt cities like Cleveland or St. Louis. But cities like New York are already crowded, so what happens when suburbanites from the far reaches of New Jersey descend on Brooklyn? One can only assume that rent will become as unaffordable as gasoline, forcing many people to stay behind in the exurbs in their drafty McMansions.
 They may not have many shopping choices, either. The author argues that expensive gas will create vacant suburban strip malls -- like one he visits in Coshocton, Ohio, that has been transformed into a graffiti-encrusted vision of suburban decay by the shuttering of a Wal-Mart.
 The author writes that such huge abandoned stores will ''dot the exurbian and rural landscape from coast to coast'' when gas reaches $14 a gallon.
 MR. STEINER thinks that this development will lead to a rejuvenation of small towns. But if it's too expensive for Wal-Mart to get diapers on the shelves, how will the mom-and-pop grocery on Main Street do it? You can't get everything at the local farm.
 The book's arguments are sometimes overstated in hyperbolic prose. In the chapter about the end of the airline industry as we know it, it says that some companies will be ''permanently torpedoed'' by high gas prices. It warns that a ''giant herd of people'' will lose their jobs. And it says that our grandchildren will ''undoubtedly gawp in awe'' when we recount our childhood trips to Disneyland. Well, that's something to look forward to in our old age.
 But it will be cold comfort. If Mr. Steiner is correct about the future of gas prices, many people will disagree with his premise that their lives are better. And even he may miss the days when he cruised around in his Toyota 4Runner. It sounds as if he already does.

HEADLINE: Back to School, but First, the Mall

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
As children of all ages dread the impending return to early morning wake-up calls and homework overload, a short-term antidote is the annual ritual of foraging for school supplies, clothes and shoes. The Queens Center mall in Elmhurst, a short walk from the Woodhaven Boulevard stop on the R, V or G train, has 70 stores, including most major chains, and is anchored by Macy's and J. C. Penney. But it is also a microcosm of its surrounding borough, one of the most diverse places in the country: Colombian teenagers bump up against elderly Chinese, Indian women in saris shuffle past Filipino toddlers. The mall offers translation in close to 50 languages. And what other mall allows for a nosh on empanadas, Italian ices or halal food just outside the air-conditioning?
 NOON The mall's large food court is filled with typical fast-food fare, so fuel up outside at Mama's Empanadas, just across the street (91-20 59th Avenue). It has empanadas fried and baked, corn and flour, plus arepas. Ground beef ($1.60) is the best seller, but there are also pockets stuffed with pork, tuna, macaroni and cheese, chicken parmesan and Italian sausage. The tropical shakes (try passion fruit, $3.25) are delicious. There are no tables, just a counter. 
 1 P.M. Best to begin with backpacks, since you can stuff later purchases inside them. Kamp New York, on Level 2 of the four-story mall, sells a steady supply of North Face, including the Hot Shot ($80), which has a laptop compartment, foam backing, a water bottle holder and the words ''hot shot'' stitched on. A more basic North Face backpack is available for $45, not a bad option since the high-profile brand can attract thieves. Teenage girls might choose Puma totes ($80) or smaller Puma bags that look like purses ($50). At Morning Glory (Level 3), younger children and their benefactors can funnel more money into Hannah Montana's already bulging coffers. Backpacks ($19.99) and lunchboxes ($11.99) are available in various iterations (innocent Hannah, sexy Hannah, rebel Hannah). There are also Transformers, Power Rangers and the perennial Spider-Man.
 2 P.M. Feet of all sizes have inevitably grown. Wild Pair, a few doors down on Level 3, stocks an array of Ed Hardy sneakers, the most popular being black with a painted-on skull and small rhinestones ($65.95) or with a large-fanged tiger ($85.95). A few paces away, at Underground Station, a manager said that the skateboard look is still hot and that Converse remains a back-to-school favorite ($39.99). Down on Level 1, Stride Rite offers sturdy shoes for young children, particularly those who wear uniforms to school (Molly's are $50, Anchor $52).
 3 P.M. Recession or not, teenagers are lining up for big sales at Aeropostale ( Level 3): Polo shirts were $12 on a recent visit, jeans were buy one get one free, and camisoles were two for $20. For the under-10 set, the Children's Place on Level 1 also had some good deals: Boys' polos (two for $20), rugby shirts ($15) and printed henley shirts for girls ($5).
 4 P.M. When stress builds and feet throb, the mall has many comfortable easy chairs sprinkled about. Across from the Gap on Level 3 is a cluster of auto-massage chairs ($1 for 3 minutes), and on Level 2 at the opposite end, you can get a Reiki massage ($12 for 10 minutes) from a human -- sharp, a tad painful, but still revitalizing.

Re-energizing is critical for the final stop, so swing by Pretzel Time or Haagen-Dazs on Level 3, or grab an Italian ice from a street vendor. Two blocks up the street at Queens Place Mall (88-01 Queens Boulevard) is Target, where the school supply section is in full disarray. Parents (with glazed looks) and children (with rolling eyes) march the aisles staring at supply-list print-outs, arguing over how much, how many and the precise meaning of ''required.''

Recession or not, teenagers are lining up for big sales at Aeropostale ( Level 3): Polo shirts were $12 on a recent visit, jeans were buy one get one free, and camisoles were two for $20. For the under-10 set, the Children's Place on Level 1 also had some good deals: Boys' polos (two for $20), rugby shirts ($15) and printed henley shirts for girls ($5). 2 P.M. Feet of all sizes have inevitably grown. Wild Pair, a few doors down on Level 3, stocks an array of Ed Hardy sneakers, the most popular being black with a painted-on skull and small rhinestones ($65.95) or with a large-fanged tiger ($85.95). A few paces away, at Underground Station, a manager said that the skateboard look is still hot and that Converse remains a back-to-school favorite ($39.99). Down on Level 1, Stride Rite offers sturdy shoes for young children, particularly those who wear uniforms to school (Molly's are $50, Anchor $52). 1 P.M. Best to begin with backpacks, since you can stuff later purchases inside them. Kamp New York, on Level 2 of the four-story mall, sells a steady supply of North Face, including the Hot Shot ($80), which has a laptop compartment, foam backing, a water bottle holder and the words ''hot shot'' stitched on. A more basic North Face backpack is available for $45, not a bad option since the high-profile brand can attract thieves. Teenage girls might choose Puma totes ($80) or smaller Puma bags that look like purses ($50). At Morning Glory (Level 3), younger children and their benefactors can funnel more money into Hannah Montana's already bulging coffers. Backpacks ($19.99) and lunchboxes ($11.99) are available in various iterations (innocent Hannah, sexy Hannah, rebel Hannah). There are also Transformers, Power Rangers and the perennial Spider-Man. NOON The mall's large food court is filled with typical fast-food fare, so fuel up outside at Mama's Empanadas, just across the street (91-20 59th Avenue). It has empanadas fried and baked, corn and flour, plus arepas. Ground beef ($1.60) is the best seller, but there are also pockets stuffed with pork, tuna, macaroni and cheese, chicken parmesan and Italian sausage. The tropical shakes (try passion fruit, $3.25) are delicious. There are no tables, just a counter.

HEADLINE: Composer Finds a Muse in the Mississippi

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
EVE BEGLARIAN, composer, experimentalist and collaborator, has built a career translating other people's obsessions into music. 
 ''So often the collaborative projects I do are initiated by another person, and my job is to get immersed in what their obsession is -- a text, an idea -- and follow that through,'' she said. ''In some ways I think of myself as a responder rather than an initiator, even though the end result might be very personal.''
 This time the obsession, the mighty Mississippi and its impact on American culture, is her own.
 On Aug. 1 Ms. Beglarian, 51, put her bright red, 17-foot kayak into the river's headwaters and -- buoyed by the example of Works Progress Administration artists who documented the state of the country during the Great Depression, as well as a bit of midlife contemplation -- began her passage downstream. 
 ''I thought, 'O.K., we're in a depression again, and I need to do this,' '' she said in a telephone interview from Little Falls, Minn. ''Part of it was a response to the economic free fall. Part of it was when Obama got elected, I thought, 'This is my country, this really is my country, and I need to know what my country is.'
 ''The river is sort of in this equilibrium between life and death all the time and is comfortable with that. And somehow it's really important for me right now to embrace that, as the condition of being alive and being conscious, and make my peace with it in some way.''
 For the next three months Ms. Beglarian, who has run a marathon and built a cabin in Vermont, will continue to glide the Mississippi's 2,300 or so miles, from Lake Itasca in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Along the way she is collecting snippets of sound, image and history from both her perch on the river and excursions into nearby towns, in wilderness and urban sprawl. 
 In late November, barring hurricanes and unfortunate barge encounters, she will arrive at the Mississippi's end. The next fall, after months of composing, Ms. Beglarian plans to head back upstream -- by car; she's not crazy -- with a small ensemble and perform new works for and with residents of the communities that inspired them.
 But somewhat to her surprise, what began as a solitary sojourn has morphed into a kind of floating artists' colony and mutual collaboration society, gathering members for days or weeks at a time.
 ''When I decided I needed to do this, I originally was going to do this alone,'' Ms. Beglarian said. Soon loneliness became an overriding concern; she hadn't set out to recreate Thoreau's ''Walden.'' 
 Seeking company, Ms. Beglarian sent an e-mail message to her mailing list and Facebook friends, saying: ''I'm doing this. If you want to come, come.''
 They came. Her first traveling companions were Mac Walton, a trombonist and musicologist she had met two years earlier while he was studying at Williams College, and Richard Steadman-Jones, a linguist and historian at the University of Sheffield in England with whom she has embarked on a project about displacement and language among the Ojibwa tribe in Minnesota and early European settlers. 
 The guest list continues to grow. Last week Heather Hitchens, the executive director of the New York State Council on the Arts, tagged along. Caroline Walker, an Illinois poet interested in the river's military history; Cori Ellison, the dramaturge of the New York City Opera; and Mary Rowell, a violinist in the string quartet Ethel, have signed on. Although each will affect Ms. Beglarian's work, and she theirs, no one is sure about the results. 
 Ms. Ellison, who envisions creating something of a musical dramatic nature, said: ''I think Eve has begun this journey with a complete tabula rasa. She'll just use the chemical reaction of who's there.''
 For armchair travelers, and as another layer of her artistic endeavor, Ms. Beglarian started a blog (evbvd.com/riverblog), which she fills with photographs and writings about whatever strikes her fancy during the 20 or so miles she tallies each day. It also lists books she is reading (Michael D. McNally's ''Ojibwe Singers: Hymns, Grief and a Native American Culture in Motion'') and music she is listening to (Delta blues, Bob Dylan's ''Mississippi'' and the Talking Heads and the B. B. King-Al Green versions of ''Take Me to the River''), as well as music she wrote before her trip (''The Flood,'' her setting of the Robert Frost poem in response to the great Mississippi flood of 1927).
 Still, her soundtrack on the river is mostly silence. ''When I'm kayaking, I definitely don't have my iPod on,'' she said. She hears mostly the rhythmic slice of oar through current, the scraping of vessel across reeds bent in submission to the water's downward flow. 
 Occasionally she records sounds to add to her extensive electronic database. Her current fixation is pumps, the kind found near dams and locks. On days when her traveling companions are taking their turns in the kayak, she gets into her car to scout out that night's campsite at a reasonable distance downstream and explore communities along the water's edge, with a visit to a different church each Sunday. When it's her turn to paddle, a fellow traveler climbs into the driver's seat; if she has two or more guests, someone generally boards the bicycle she has brought along and pedals to the next stop. By the time the Mississippi turns into a sort of superhighway below Cairo, Mo., with industrial vessels navigating a swift current, Ms. Beglarian said, she expects to bike more and kayak less. 
 On her off days and evenings she plugs in her computer and keyboard at her campsite or a public library. After a month of paddling she is finally feeling the desire to compose, though not yet with a sense of urgency. 
 ''Probably the most significant thing here,'' Ms. Hitchens, the arts council executive, wrote in an e-mail message, ''is the opportunity for so many people, whether it be friends like me who are throwing caution to the wind to join her for a few days or the random people she meets along the way, to be somehow involved in her creative process. This is important for her, but also for each one of us. As she has said to me a number of times, all the various people who participate will help color the experience and ultimately the work. There are not many works that get created this way, and I would venture to say that she is breaking some new ground here.''
 As Ms. Beglarian travels along what she called ''this secret path through the country,'' she is content to keep an ear to the Mississippi and go with the flow. 
 ''On this trip, it's my turn,'' she said. ''It's clear the subject is the river. But what that means, and how it takes shape, is something that the river is going to tell me.''

HEADLINE: Beyond The Blocks

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: Billund, Denmark 

 BODY:
 FROM the outside, there is nothing playful about the drab, two-story Lego Idea House here, where designers gather in whitewashed rooms to dream up new toys. But upstairs, behind a series of locked doors accessible only to employees with special passes, is a chamber that might as well be toy heaven for kids -- and more than a few adults.
 Multicolored Lego creations in every imaginable size and shape spill from the shelves, from Indiana Jones's biplane to Darth Vader's fighter. Boxes stamped ''confidential'' hold potential future blockbusters, like Buzz Lightyear, the hero of the ''Toy Story'' animated films, as well as a police station bustling with miniature cops and robbers.
 ''It's our way of looking at the world,'' says Soren Holm, the head of Lego's Concept Lab. ''We have happy criminals; even they are smiling. The sun is shining every day.'' 
 While that may be true of Lego's toys, until recently it was hardly the case for Lego's bottom line. But five years after a near-death experience, Lego has emerged as an unlikely winner in an industry threatened by the likes of video games, iPods, the Internet and other digital diversions.
 Even as other toymakers struggle, this Danish maker of toy bricks is enjoying double-digit sales gains and swelling earnings. In recent years, Lego has increasingly focused on toys that many parents wouldn't recognize from their own childhood. Hollywood themes are commanding more shelf space, a far cry from the idealistic, purely imagination-oriented play that drove Lego for years and was as much a religion as a business strategy in Billund.
 Just as the toys are changing, so is the company. Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, 40, a father of four and a McKinsey & Company alumnus who took over as Lego's chief executive in 2004, made it clear that results, not simply feeling good about making the best toys, would be essential if Lego was to succeed. 
 ''We needed to build a mind-set where nonperformance wasn't accepted,'' Mr. Knudstorp says. Now, ''there's no place to hide if performance is poor,'' he says. ''You will be embarrassed, and embarrassment is stronger than fear.'' 
 But the story of Lego's renaissance -- and its current expansion into new segments like virtual reality and video games -- isn't just a toy story. It's also a reminder of how even the best brands can lose their luster but bounce back with a change in strategy and occasionally painful adaptation. 
 Founded in 1932 on the principle of ''play well,'' or ''leg godt'' in Danish, by a local carpenter, Ole Kirk Christiansen, this privately held company had a very Scandinavian aversion to talking about profits, much less orienting the company around them. 
 Mr. Christiansen's family still owns Lego and its business may still be fun and games, but working here isn't. Before Mr. Knudstorp's arrival, deadlines came and went, and development time for new toys could stretch out for years; in 2004, the company racked up a $344 million loss. 
 Now, employee pay is tied to measuring up to management's key performance indicators (K.P.I.'s, in Lego-speak). And cost-saving touches are encouraged when it comes to designing new toys. 
 That has helped to lower development time by 50 percent, with some new products moving from idea to box in as little as a year. Mr. Knudstorp's bottom-line-oriented team, meanwhile, has shifted some manufacturing and distribution from Billund to cheaper locales in Central Europe and Mexico.
 Nevertheless, Lego hasn't entirely shed its Scandinavian sense of social mission when it comes to making toys. It kept quality high and never moved any manufacturing to China, avoiding the lead paint scare and grabbing market share when rivals stumbled amid multiple recalls.
 Now, with profits swelling and the turnaround firmly in place, Lego is preparing for a future that moves well beyond the basic brick but carries big risks as well. 
 Last month, it opened its first ''concept store'' in Concord, N.C., where parents can bring children for birthday parties and classes with master builders; another concept store is set to open near Baltimore this fall. It's all part of a broader retail expansion that will give Lego 47 retail stores worldwide by year-end, up from 27 in 2007. 
 In 2010, the first board game designed by Lego will go on sale in the United States, while its new virtual reality system, Lego Universe, will make its debut on the Web, with children able to act out roles from Lego games and build toys from virtual bricks.
 Video games -- yes, Lego is there, too -- are increasingly important to the company, as are Lego's legions of adult fans, who can now buy kits to build architect-designed models of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater and the Guggenheim Museum. What's more, the company is in talks with Warner Brothers about a mixed live-action and animation Lego-themed movie that would move the company and its Lego brand even further into the Hollywood orbit. 
 ''Developing a movie doesn't come cheap,'' says Soren Torp Laursen, a 23-year Lego employee who heads its North American operations. ''But five years ago, we were in the midst of a crisis, and now we're in a growth phase. We are definitely taking bigger risks than we previously did.'' 
 WHILE that shift has disappointed purists and prompted worries from experts that some of what has long made Lego special may be in jeopardy, it's paying off, at least in the short term. 
 Amid a 5 percent drop in total United States toy sales last year and the industry's worst holiday season in three decades, according to Sean McGowan, an analyst at Needham & Company, Lego's sales surged 18.7 percent in 2008. And despite a worsening global recession, Lego powered through the first half of 2009, with a 23 percent sales increase over the period a year earlier. It earned $355 million before taxes last year, and $178 million in the first half of 2009. 
 The numbers are all the more impressive given the sales declines this year at the two biggest toymakers, Mattel and Hasbro.
 ''I was stunned when I heard how strong Lego's performance was,'' says Mr. McGowan, who has covered the toy industry for 23 years. ''How could an $80 Lego set sell better than a $10 action figure?''
 The answer is as multifaceted as one of Lego's most complicated brick creations -- and, like the best children's stories, contains elements of luck, hard work and the loss of innocence.
 SOREN HOLM looks down at the machine gun atop Indiana Jones's jeep and winces. By the standards of video games like Grand Theft Auto and of other childhood attractions, it's mild stuff.
 But here in Billund, toy weapons have always been a touchy subject. ''I can tell you there's been a lot of debate about how far we can take it,'' Mr. Holm says. Right down to Indy's gun? ''Oh, yes,'' he says slowly. ''Oh, yes.''
 Since Lego overcame its initial hesitation about rolling out a ''Star Wars'' series a decade ago because the word ''war'' would appear on the box, the company has grown more comfortable with conflict.
 ''We've opened up slightly,'' Mr. Holm says. After all, he adds, ''when you give boys a bunch of bricks, they build a gun.'' 
 In fact, Lego has opened up more than slightly. Whether it's the Star Wars Assassin Droids Battle Pack or the Indiana Jones Ambush in Cairo set -- featuring a pistol-wielding Indy against a scimitar-swinging local -- many of Lego's most popular toys today seem inspired by the special effects and violence of the big screen. 
 In the United States, Lego's biggest market and the biggest toy market in the world, games with themes like ''Star Wars'' and ''Indiana Jones'' were among the reasons Lego sales jumped 32 percent last year, well above the global pace. But experts like Dr. Jonathan Sinowitz, a New York psychologist who also runs a psychological services company, Diagnostics, wonders at what price these sales come. 
 ''What Lego loses is what makes it so special,'' he says. ''When you have a less structured, less themed set, kids have the ability to start from scratch. When you have kids playing out Indiana Jones, they're playing out Hollywood's imagination, not their own.''
 Even toy analysts who admire the company and its recent success acknowledge a broad shift. ''I would like to see more open-ended play like when we were kids,'' says Gerrick Johnson, a toy analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. ''The vast majority is theme-based, and when you go into Toys ''R'' Us, you'd really be challenged to find a simple box of bricks.'' 
 Lutz Muller, an independent toy analyst in Williston, Vt., who has long followed the industry, estimates that 60 percent of Lego's American sales are linked to licenses, double the amount five years ago. 
 And the coming ''Toy Story'' sets have retailers salivating, as Disney prepares to release the latest movie in the hit series next June. '' 'Toy Story' is a fit made in heaven,'' raves Jerry Storch, the chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, which has increased the shelf space allotted to Lego in recent years. 
 Nevertheless, acquiring licenses to make toys linked to hot Hollywood properties like ''Toy Story'' carries risks. ''It's a slippery slope,'' Mr. Johnson says, and today's hit can quickly turn into tomorrow's dud, adding volatility that Lego never faced in the past. 
 Indeed, unlike the Cabbage Patch Kids or Atari or the Beanie Babies, it was Lego's seeming aloofness from the market that helped it endure, rather than ending up in the back of the closet like those toys of yesteryear. 
 For longtime Lego executives like Mr. Laursen, it's a delicate issue, and his own comments echo Lego's ambivalence over creativity and hallowed Lego traditions versus the appeal of more profitable, Hollywood-influenced toys. 
 He says that ''we're definitely more commercially oriented'' and notes that licenses play a bigger role in the American market than overseas. But he says that ''we've never sacrificed our values, and have never been a fundamentally profit-oriented company.'' 
 In fact, he says that there is often a long debate about values when acquiring new licenses, and that ''we're far from always agreeing to take on new ones.'' He won't specify which movies or themes Lego has passed on, but says that ''there are many licenses out there that represent a level of violence that is not suited to Lego and doesn't fit with the trust of parents.''
 As Lego ventures deeper into video games and virtual reality with Lego Universe, the question of violence, not to mention commercial temptations, will become only more charged.
 One answer, Mr. Laursen says, is to make ''violence not explicit, but humoristic.'' For example, when a minifigure ''dies'' in a ''Star Wars'' or ''Indiana Jones'' video game, he dissolves into a pile of bricks and then springs back to life, cartoon style.
 ''We think kids really want to have this good-against-evil play; they want this fighting against each other,'' says Charlotte Simonsen, a Lego spokeswoman. ''But we want to do it with a wink.''
 Analysts add that the recession has proved to be an unexpected boon for Lego, as parents favor spending more time at home with traditional toys instead of going out to the movies or taking trips with the children.
 Even parents who won't let video games in the house, like Alyson Richman Gordon of Huntington Bay, N.Y., say Lego has retained its innocence, especially when it comes to toys built around the traditional bricks. ''It echoes back to a bygone era,'' she said. ''And I find as a parent that I'm drawn to things from my own childhood that inspired my creativity.''
 Lester Munson, a father of two in Alexandria, Va., agrees, even though he sees a difference between the Legos of his own childhood and those favored by his 8-year-old son, Jonas. ''The most exotic thing I could build when I was a kid was an ambulance,'' he says. ''Now Jonas can build the Death Star.''
 ''I still like Legos, and I'm 41,'' he says. ''Instead of watching TV or playing computer games, the kids are building something, and Jonas and I will build stuff together. The pieces and the sets are a lot cooler than they were 30 years ago, and if the price you have to pay is these tie-ins, that's fine.''
 IT'S not only children who fight over toys. John Barbour, a former top executive of Toys ''R'' Us, recalls ''a series of truly frustrating meetings'' with Lego officials in Billund and New York at the beginning of the decade, which climaxed when Mr. Barbour bluntly told them that Toys ''R'' Us cared more about the Lego brand than they did.
 The most popular toys would run out, he recalls, and Lego was simply unable to ship more or manage the complex process of producing the plastic pieces for its most complicated sets. 
 That began to change in 2004, after Mr. Knudstorp took over in Billund and Mr. Laursen arrived at Lego's regional headquarters in Enfield, Conn. Besides reaching out to top retailers and cutting costs, they untangled a supply chain that churns out 29 billion pieces a year.
 The changes also filtered down to the ranks of Lego's toy designers, says Paal Smith-Meyer, head of Lego's new-business group. The number of different bricks or elements that go into Lego toys has shrunk to less than 7,000 from roughly 13,000, and designers are encouraged to reuse parts, so that a piece of an X-wing fighter from the ''Star Wars'' series might end up in Indiana Jones's jeep or a pirate ship.
 That's very different from when Mr. Meyer joined Lego a decade ago. Though creating a mold to make a new plastic element might cost 50,000 euros. on average, he recalls that 90 percent of new elements were developed and used just one time.
 Nowadays, Mr. Meyer says, ''you have to design for Lego. If you want to design for yourself, go be an artist.''
 For those would-be Lego artists out there, the company has created a Lego Certified Professional program, selecting adult Lego enthusiasts who don't work directly for the company but whose creations are aimed at Lego's vast population of adult fans as well as museum and gallery shows. 
 It's part of another broad new effort at Lego -- reaching out to those adult fans, who maintain thousands of Web sites and blogs, like GodBricks, which features Lego creations inspired by different faiths, and the Brothers Brick, which showcases all things Lego, whether a life-size Lego house, news, or advice on how to shine up yellowing bricks (hydrogen peroxide). 
 ''There's a huge community of people that treat Lego as an art form rather than just a toy,'' says Andrew Becraft, a technical writer at Microsoft who created the Brothers Brick blog. His site pulls in 125,000 unique visitors a month, and Lego officials estimate that 915,000 people worldwide attended Lego conventions and other events in the first seven months of 2009. Five to 10 percent of Lego toys are snapped up by adults.
 In the past, Mr. Knudstorp says, ''we considered the adult fans like vintage cars, a bit bizarre.'' But he called on another longtime Lego executive, Tormod Askildsen, to work with adult fans. Now Mr. Askildsen journeys to Lego conventions organized by adult enthusiasts, while working with 44 Lego ''ambassadors'' from 27 countries, seeking advice about new toys and heading off public anger when older lines, like Lego's 9-volt train sets, are phased out. 
 Ultimately, Lego came up with a new, profitable train set, after inviting the 9-volt enthusiasts to two workshops in Billund to brainstorm and help design it. ''If you rock the boat, people will notice,'' Mr. Askildsen notes. ''They were fighting furiously for us not to give it up, but we were able to turn tension into opportunity.''
 The same might be said for Lego as a whole, as it navigates the fiercely competitive toy market and ventures into movies and virtual reality while clinging as best it can to the more innocent, Scandinavian values that made it so popular in the first place.
 ''In the end, you've got to go where your consumer is going,'' Mr. Barbour says. ''And the reality is that themes and movies are what kids want. There's no point in developing the best product in the world if you can't put it on the shelf.''

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
 WILLIAM FITZSIMMONS had never seen so many expensive clothes in his life. It was the fall of 1963, the first day of his freshman year at Harvard, and the blue-collar scholarship student from Boston found himself agape, and angered, by a campus teeming with tweed and Top-Siders. 
 ''There was an overwhelming sense of affluence, and it was really reflected in the dress styles,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons recalled last week at his office here, where he now oversees admissions and financial aid at his alma mater. ''I was stunned to see people sockless in the winter.'' 
 Mr. Fitzsimmons entered Harvard at a time when its class lines were starkly drawn, and he has spent much of his 23 years as admissions dean helping the place become more welcoming to outsiders like himself. More than 60 percent of undergraduates now receive financial aid, and blazers are no longer required. 
 So more than a few brainy Cambridge brows began to furrow last month after word trickled out that Harvard had entered into a 10-year licensing agreement for a line of preppy clothing modeled after the type that Mr. Fitzsimmons encountered four decades ago. A New England patchwork of tartan, seersucker and old-school plaids, the collection is to arrive in national department stores beginning in February, under the name Harvard Yard. 
 There will be no Veritas seals or emblazoned 'H's. Instead, the designers at Wearwolf, a Manhattan-based private company that created the line, will add crimson-thread buttonholes and collar details, a subtle nod to their sartorial inspiration. Oxford shirts start at $165, and sports coats run to $495. The company declined to discuss its projected sales figures. 
 ''It's a modern rendition of a classic American heritage,'' said John Fowler, the creative director. ''We want to combine the power of Harvard with the power of a plaid shirt.'' 
 It's nothing new for the university to profit on branded clothing; any tourist in Harvard Square can pick up a JanSport hoodie for $30 or so. But, given a history of wealth and exclusion, prep at Harvard comes with its own set of complex connotations.
 ''Every move to paste the Harvard name on symbols of prosperity, wealth, privilege and class erects a subtle, insidious 'Members Only' sign at the university admissions office,'' Peter M. Conti-Brown, a 2005 graduate, said in an e-mail message.
 Mr. Conti-Brown served as the undergraduate director of an extensive outreach effort by the admissions office to broaden Harvard's appeal to students from poorer backgrounds. 
 The barriers were often psychological, Mr. Conti-Brown recalled. ''We were going up against 400 years of history,'' he said. ''Without a doubt, licensing preppy clothes with the Harvard brand is a move in the opposite direction.''
 The university, for its part, appears to be growing tired of the attention. ''Oh joy, rapture,'' a spokesman, John Longbrake, said when informed about the subject of this article.
 He disputed the idea that a preppy, Harvard-branded clothing line would diminish the university's efforts to appeal to students of diverse backgrounds. ''A single licensing agreement out of more than 100 apparel agreements has no bearing on those efforts,'' he wrote in an e-mail message.
 He noted that Harvard began licensing its name for clothing in the 1980s, in part to help raise funds for financial aid, and that such deals now generate about $500,000 a year in revenue.
 The columnist Michael Kinsley, who was was a keen observer of Harvard's culture during his undergraduate days in the early 1970s, said that he found the whole business astonishing. 
 ''I know that Harvard is hard up after last year (though only in comparison to Harvard in other years), but this seems absurd,'' Mr. Kinsley wrote in an e-mail message, referring to the 30 percent drop in the university's endowment. ''How much money is it bringing in, and will it even equal whatever the admissions office spends trying to correct the very misimpression that this arrangement reinforces?'' 
 No one at the university was willing to disclose the exact monetary benefits of the deal, except to emphasize that the revenue would go exclusively toward financial aid. 
 A ramble through Harvard Yard this week, as students returned for a new academic year, revealed more bow ties, polo shirts and Lacoste crocodiles than one might find on the average college campus. (Full disclosure: this reporter is a recent graduate who occasionally wears boat shoes.) But for the most part, today's Harvard students dress however they like. The usual hoodies, jeans and flip-flops are common. 
 ''Most of the time, people are way too stressed out to change out of their sweatpants,'' said Tim Olds, 21, a senior English major, who said he arrived at Harvard with the $2 T-shirts he'd been wearing since high school. (His girlfriend, who attends the Fashion Institute of Technology, later insisted that they be thrown out.)
 Mr. Olds recalled that he was initially taken aback by the more formal aesthetic among his peers. ''There's always one kid in Ec 10 who will wear the suit everyday,'' Mr. Olds said, referring to Harvard's introductory economics course, considered a boot camp for Wall Street.
 Upscale clothing is to be expected at a school where the average household income trends toward $200,000. ''It does represent something that is real on campus; there are still clubs that have pig roasts at the Harvard-Yale game and stuff,'' said Sarah Wick, a senior. (She noted that her own dress cost $19.)
 ''I was asked if I had to wear a uniform to go here,'' said Robert Tamai, a freshman from Hawaii, who was wearing a T-shirt and athletic shorts. His roommate, Denny Purcell of New York, admitted to feeling ''a little intimidated'' when he first arrived. ''Some people are dressed really good,'' he said warily. 
 Some students played down the significance of the licensing deal. In an editorial last week, The Harvard Crimson wrote that criticism of the line was unwarranted: ''It is misguided to blame the university for doing what it can to pay its bills, even if that means allowing Harvard's name to adorn crimson-lined blazers and madras shorts reminiscent of the 1950s 'good-old-boy' era.'' 
 Robert Corty, a senior studying biology, agreed. ''I think it's good that it's doing something to make money,'' he said, sporting a lemon-yellow Ralph Lauren polo shirt, blue shorts and tan boat shoes. He said the style represented by the clothing line ''is more of a stereotype and less of a reality.''
 Indeed, even on a campus where tradition looms large, students expressed the sense that the clothing line was playing off a manufactured nostalgia, a romantic notion of a Harvard that never quite existed. ''Who is that for? People who liked 'Love Story' and want to dress like the characters?'' asked Eduardo Azevedo, a graduate student in economics. 
 Experts in the field of prep agreed.
 ''Harvard was never the most preppy!'' said Lisa Birnbach, who put together ''The Official Preppy Handbook'' (Workman Publishing, 1980), on the telephone from her home in Manhattan. ''It probably was when it was the first college in America. But ever since the 70s, it's been hippie-ish, it's been diverse. It had Radcliffe, and truly, the preppiest of the Ivy League did not have girls.'' 
 Ms. Birnbach said that even if the styles of the line outwardly conform to preppy standards, its blatant commercialism runs against the entire ethos.
 ''It's not correct that preppies want the newest and the best. Many a preppy is a cheapskate anyway,'' she said, noting that prep outfits are often salvaged from the lost-and-found bin at the country club, rather than picked up off-the-rack at the mall. 
 Mr. Olds, the English major, said he did not mind the licensing deal as long as it went for student aid. He said his education in Cambridge has been virtually free; the university bought him a laptop and provides an annual $100 stipend for winter coats. 
 ''If it takes a clothing line to get all this stuff done, I'm O.K. with that,'' he said.
 And at the nearby J. Press boutique, where acres of Shetland wool sweaters implied the annual yield of an entire Scottish sheep farm, the staff members did not seem too concerned about their new rival. 
 ''We've been in business since 1902; there are many names that have come and gone,'' said Denis Black, the general manager, with the confidence of a man who once got a personal thank-you note from Bill Clinton for picking out a tie. ''Saying something is a Harvard jacket or a Yale jacket doesn't make it so.''

HEADLINE: Failure Offers Lessons Japan Would Rather Forget

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN. 
Peter S. Goodman, a reporter for The Times, spent nearly a decade reporting from Asia. He is the author of ''Past Due: The End of Easy Money and the Renewal of the American Economy.''

 BODY:
FOR Americans, failure tends to be accepted as an intrinsic feature of an economic system in which risk-taking often brings great reward. If necessity is the mother of invention, then failure is the unfortunate progeny of often-lucrative adventuring. 
 Failure is, of course, wrenching. Yet the American narrative is littered with examples of heroes' transcending past calamities, their failures worn as badges of resilience. 
 In Japan, by contrast, failure traditionally carries a deeper stigma, an enduring shame that limits the appetite for risk, in the view of many of the nation's cultural observers. This makes the Japanese far less comfortable with choices that increase the prospect of failure, even if they promise greater potential gains.
 Recent Japanese governments have sought to inculcate greater tolerance for failure -- often at the urging of American officials -- to inject new life in a long-stagnant economy. The Tokyo government even chartered an Association for the Study of Failure, which aimed to ''turn failure experience into knowledge at the society, corporation and individual levels.''
 But last week, the differing cultural conceptions of the United States and Japan snapped into view, as Japanese voters emphatically dismissed the party that had ruled almost uninterrupted for more than half a century. In so doing, they offered up a palpable message: Enough with the failure thing already. And enough with Americans offering up pain as the cure for what ails Japan.
 In the two decades since Japan devolved from a supposedly indomitable economic juggernaut in the 1980s into a stagnant economy mired in a Lost Decade, the country tried myriad reforms in the name of reinvigorating its economy. It took stabs at rooting out bad loans from the banking system and ending the inside dealing that had long defined Japanese business culture. It sought to pare down government-financed public works projects, a major source of jobs. 
 Yet all the while, Japan remained an economic laggard, a shadow of the nation that had previously occasioned overheated talk of Japanese global dominance. Despite the pain of reform, Japan never seemed to get the gain. 
 Many economists argue that Japan never shook off the hangover of speculative excesses on real estate that fueled the 1980s because it never genuinely reformed. Money-losing ''zombie'' companies were allowed to keep drawing fresh credit and survive. Insolvent banks were spared from collapse because they were deemed ''too big to fail.''
 Regardless, among ordinary people, the sense took hold that the reforms were both harsh and ineffective. Despite its capitalist trappings, Japan has sometimes been referred to as the world's most successful socialist economy, a land in which life-long job security seemed a birthright. Amid the attempts to rein in government spending and pressure banks to cut off money-losing clients, Japanese workers learned the humiliation of unemployment; Japanese companies confronted the embarrassment of going out of business. More than an economic event, this tore at the fabric of Japanese life.
 In 2003, I visited Kushiro, a port city on Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, which had for decades been sustained by government-led construction. Japan's reformist prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, was then rolling back public works spending and pressuring banks to clean up their books.
 The president of the Kushiro Credit Association complained that the new policies were effectively forcing him to inflict his customers with the stigma of failure.
 ''We can't just cut them off,'' he said. ''Everyone would know about it. It would be very difficult for people who failed to live here.''
 From the perspective of everyday Japanese life, shock treatment seemed both cruel and unnecessary. Japan had become a much darker place than in the 1980s, when the elixir of wealth seemed at hand, yet it was nothing like crisis-wracked Indonesia or Argentina, where people rioted in the streets as life savings vanished. It was a slow slide from a comfortable perch. 
 Tokyo never failed to shimmer with modernity. The national rail system was as efficient as any on earth. Even as ordinary Japanese gained economic anxiety and ratcheted down aspirations, most still had decent homes and cars, health care financed by the state, and a world-beating array of gadgets.
 Many Japanese seemed perplexed by the dire talk that accompanied the push for reform. In Nagano, a city that had boomed with construction during the 1980s, suspicions about the reform trajectory were intense as Mr. Koizumi pushed to cleanse the banks of bad loans. Newspapers and television were full of grim talk about the corporate failures this would entail.
 ''I don't really see how the economy will get better if you just close a big company and fire people,'' said a 37-year-old housewife whose husband worked at the electronics giant Fujitsu. His pay had been cut by one-fifth. The local work force had been slashed by half. But she said she was more inclined to hang on to what they had -- a 10-year-old Honda sedan, outdated kitchen appliances -- than risk his paycheck in a bid for what seemed an abstraction: a healthy financial system.
 By the time Japanese voters went to the polls last week, they must surely have noticed that, when crisis afflicted the United States, Americans seemed no more eager to ingest the medicine Washington once dispensed for Japan. Faced with soaring joblessness and financial calamity, Americans propped up their auto industry, saved banks deemed too big to fail, and unleashed nearly $800 billion in government spending to spare jobs. (Moreover, Americans have come to wish they had been a little more afraid of failure.)
 Japanese voters did not appear to be approving a coherent economic policy so much as rejecting a seemingly bankrupt one. The new ruling Democratic Party of Japan gained votes with vague promises of subsidies and job protections. 
 Ultimately, the vote seemed to signal Japan's verdict that the embrace of failure had, in the end, proven a failure, opting instead for the comfort of trying to muddle through.

HEADLINE: The Self-Storage Self

BYLINE: By JON MOOALLEM. 
Jon Mooallem, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about the Transition movement.

 BODY:
Statewide Self Storage spreads out near Highway 4 in Antioch, Calif., a suburban community between San Francisco and Sacramento. It's a phalanx of long, low-slung buildings separated by wide driveways and lined with red doors. The complex houses 453 storage units and is wedged between a car dealership and a Costco. 
 It was the last afternoon in May, and the sun seared all the concrete and corrugated steel. Statewide's gate opened, and a man named Jimmy Sloan made for the far corner of the property. Sloan, who dresses and styles his hair like James Dean, is a part-owner of the Harley-Davidson repair shop nearby. He rolled open the door of a 10-by-30-foot unit, the largest Statewide offers. It was his ex-fiancee's, but still leased under his name, and packed with, among other things, a particleboard shelving unit, some wicker items, a microwave oven, a box labeled ''Mickey's Hornet Neon,'' a floor lamp, a television and a wooden child's bed standing on its end on a desk. It was hard to tell how deep the inventory went. ''She hasn't seen most of this stuff in six years,'' Sloan said. 
 For five years, he stored most of it above the garage of his house. But he had to borrow on the house to keep the bike shop running, and last year, feeling in over his head, he opted to sell the house and downsize before he fell behind and risked foreclosure. ''Pretty much got out of that house at zero -- didn't make a penny on it,'' he told me with the kind of ascetic pride that wouldn't have made any sense before our economically crippled era. Sloan's fiancee insisted he rent a storage unit and move everything over the garage into it for her. So he did. Then they split up.
 He kept paying the rent on the unit for almost a year -- $217 every month. But Sloan finally lost his patience and told her: ''You know, we're not even together anymore. This stuff's gotta go.'' Everything here, he told me, was worth less than what he had paid to store it. ''Storage is always a bad investment, any way you look at it,'' he said. The rent was her responsibility now. But the former future Mrs. Jimmy Sloan never paid Statewide. By now, it seemed likely that the managers would end up auctioning off the contents of the unit in accordance with state law. 
 That was fine with Jimmy Sloan. But he wanted to get in first and make sure that his late father's collection of hunting knives and die-cast toy tractors, which he'd lost track of, weren't mixed in there. And so, to regain access, he'd just walked into the office and paid Statewide what was owed: $460. He'd counted out the cash unresentfully, like a man retrieving his dog from a neighbor's house for the 10th or 11th time.
 ''That stuff is Happy Meal junk,'' he now said, pointing to a see-through Rubbermaid bin in the storage unit's brickwork of boxes. It was full of brightly colored plastic toys and a pair of hot pink sunglasses that belonged to his ex-fiancee's children. ''The kids broke it, played with it once. It wasn't even for Christmas,'' he said.
 Sloan had not started rummaging for his dad's knife and tractor collections in earnest: he was still pecking at the concretion's surface, not tunneling into it. But already he'd found a Marilyn Monroe poster and a souvenir road sign for James Dean Boulevard and set them near the door. They were his, from his old living room. He had forgotten about them and wanted to take them home.
 Soon, he peeled back the top of a huge bin. Inside, I could see a VHS cassette of ''American Pie'' and a black-and-white toy football with the logo of the Oakland Raiders. ''Look at that!'' Sloan said suddenly. ''A Raider football!'' He put it next to the poster and the road sign. Apparently it, too, was just appealing enough to hang on to.
 The Self Storage Association, a nonprofit trade group, estimates that since the onset of the recession, occupancies at storage facilities nationwide are down, on average, about 2 or 3 percent. It's not a cataclysmic drop but enough to disorient an industry that has always considered itself recession-resistant, if not outright recession-proof -- so unstoppable that even having to engage in basic Marketing 101 stuff, like lowering prices, has struck some operators as a comedown. ''I feel so dirty,'' one manager wrote in the online forum of the trade magazine Inside Self-Storage. He had just started a promotion: a $20 move-in special. ''Now I need to go shower again,'' he added. A survey by BMO Capital Markets earlier this year showed that more than 80 percent of storage places nationwide were offering free rent for a month or more.
 The down economy has clearly created circumstances in which some people desperately need to rent storage units -- namely, people losing their homes. But more significantly, it seems to be upsetting a longstanding equilibrium -- a kind of psycho-financial inertia that has kept so many tenants in place.
 ''Human laziness has always been a big friend of self-storage operators,'' Derek Naylor, president of the consultant group Storage Marketing Solutions, told me. ''Because once they're in, nobody likes to spend all day moving their stuff out of storage. As long as they can afford it, and feel psychologically that they can afford it, they'll leave that stuff in there forever.'' Now, though, ''there are people who are watching their credit-card bills closer than before,'' he said. ''They're really paying attention to the stuff they're storing and realizing that it's probably not worth $100 a month to keep. So they just get rid of it.''
 After a monumental building boom, the United States now has 2.3 billion square feet of self-storage space. (The Self Storage Association notes that, with more than seven square feet for every man, woman and child, it's now ''physically possible that every American could stand -- all at the same time -- under the total canopy of self-storage roofing.'') According to the Self Storage Association, one out of every 10 households in the country rents a unit, making facilities like Statewide among our last national commons -- places where nearly every conceivable kind of American still goes.
 But the collapsing economy created an opportunity, and in some cases an ultimatum, for Americans to reassess the raft of obligations and the loads of stuff we accumulated before things went wrong. We've been making difficult decisions, and for a lot of us, that has involved rolling up the door of a storage unit and carting property in or out. The storage industry's expansion in the first flush years of this decade was both enabled by, and helped enable, the extreme consumption that defined America then. The people coming through the gates now are defining who we will be when this turmoil is over. 
 The first modern self-storage facilities opened in the 1960s, and for two decades storage remained a low-profile industry, helping people muddle through what it terms ''life events.'' For the most part, storage units were meant to temporarily absorb the possessions of those in transition: moving, marrying or divorcing, or dealing with a death in the family. And the late 20th century turned out to be a golden age of life events in America, with peaking divorce rates and a rush of second- and third-home buying. At the same time, the first baby boomers were left to face down the caches of heirlooms and clutter in their parents' basements.
 But by the end of the '90s, there seemed to be almost limitless, pent-up demand for storage around the country, more than life events readily explained. Storage was seen as an invincible investment and became the go-to solution for developers with awkward, leftover scraps of land. After an industry report found that Hawaii ranked among the states with the least amount of storage space in the nation, storage barons rushed in, almost doubling the available square footage there between 2004 and 2007. One man converted a network of caves on Oahu, used to house munitions during World War II, into a storage facility. (The caves are naturally climate-controlled, perfect for wine.) Around the United States, newcomers to the industry were building even against the advice of their expert consultants. ''We were cranking these things out at exponential rates,'' an industry veteran named Tom Litton told me. ''It was just nuts.''
 Litton's parents owned one of the earliest storage facilities, in Tucson. He now has two of his own, both in California, and manages 23 others. Among the ones he built and has since sold is a stunning 1,000-unit glass-fronted complex in Antioch. It could pass for a small corporate headquarters and is one of seven storage facilities within five miles of Statewide in either direction along Highway 4.
 Across America, from 2000 to 2005, upward of 3,000 self-storage facilities went up every year. Somehow, Americans managed to fill that brand-new empty space. In June, Public Storage, the industry's largest chain, reported that its 2,100 facilities in 38 states were, on average, still about 91 percent full. It raises a simple question: where was all that stuff before? 
 ''A lot of it just comes down to the great American propensity toward accumulating stuff,'' Litton explained. Between 1970 and 2008, real disposable personal income per capita doubled, and by 2008 we were spending nearly all of it -- all but 2.7 percent -- each year. Meanwhile, the price of much of what we were buying plunged. Even by the early '90s, American families had, on average, twice as many possessions as they did 25 years earlier. By 2005, according to the Boston College sociologist Juliet B. Schor, the average consumer purchased one new piece of clothing every five and a half days.
 Schor has been hacking intrepidly through the jumble of available data quantifying the last decade's consumption spree. Between 1998 and 2005, she found, the number of vacuum cleaners coming into the country every year more than doubled. The number of toasters, ovens and coffeemakers tripled. A 2006 U.C.L.A. study found middle-class families in Los Angeles ''battling a nearly universal overaccumulation of goods.'' Garages were clogged. Toys and outdoor furniture collected in the corners of backyards. ''The home-goods storage crisis has reached almost epic proportions,'' the authors of the study wrote. A new kind of customer was being propelled, hands full, into self-storage. 
 ''A lot of the expansion we experienced as an industry was people choosing to store,'' Litton told me. A Self Storage Association study showed that, by 2007, the once-quintessential client -- the family in the middle of a move, using storage to solve a short-term, logistical problem -- had lost its majority. Fifty percent of renters were now simply storing what wouldn't fit in their homes -- even though the size of the average American house had almost doubled in the previous 50 years, to 2,300 square feet.
 Consider our national furniture habit. In an unpublished paper, Schor writes that ''anecdotal evidence suggests an 'Ikea effect.' '' We've spent more on furniture even as prices have dropped, thereby amassing more of it. The amount entering the United States from overseas doubled between 1998 and 2005, reaching some 650 million pieces a year. Comparing Schor's data with E.P.A. data on municipal solid waste shows that the rate at which we threw out old furniture rose about one-thirteenth as fast during roughly the same period. In other words, most of that new stuff -- and any older furniture it displaced -- is presumably still knocking around somewhere. In fact, some seven million American households now have at least one piece of furniture in their storage units. Furniture is the most commonly stored thing in America.
 The marketing consultant Derek Naylor told me that people stockpile furniture while saving for bigger or second homes but then, in some cases, ''they don't want to clutter up their new home with all the things they have in storage.'' So they buy new, nicer things and keep paying to store the old ones anyway. Clem Tang, a spokesman for Public Storage, explains: ''You say, 'I paid $1,000 for this table a couple of years ago. I'm not getting rid of it, or selling it for 10 bucks at a garage sale. That's like throwing away $1,000.' '' It's not a surprising response in a society replacing things at such an accelerated rate -- this inability to see our last table as suddenly worthless, even though we've just been out shopping for a new one as though it were. 
 ''My parents were Depression babies,'' Litton told me, ''and what they taught me was, it's the accumulation of things that defines you as an American, and to throw anything away was being wasteful.'' The self-storage industry reconciles these opposing values: paying for storage is, paradoxically, thrifty. ''That propensity toward consumption is what fueled the world's economy,'' Litton said. The self-storage industry almost had to expand; it grew along with the volume of container ships reaching our ports. (Some storage facilities I visited in California are, in fact, made of shipping containers, which became surplus goods themselves as our trade deficit grew.)
 By 2007, a full 15 percent of customers told the Self Storage Association they were storing items that they ''no longer need or want.'' It was the third-most-popular use for a unit and was projected to grow to 25 percent of renters the following year. The line between necessity and convenience -- between temporary life event and permanent lifestyle -- totally blurred.
 ''There's a lot of junk stored in our properties,'' Ronald L. Havner Jr., Public Storage's chief executive, told a symposium in New York in June. Walking through his company's facilities around the country, he explained, ''I've sometimes said that we could put a torch to this building and it would have zero effect on the local economy -- because that's how much junk is stored in our properties.'' 
 Havner added that he believed all of this ''non-economic use'' had been flushed out by the recession -- that the dips in occupancy industrywide could be attributed to these customers' wising up and leaving. But really, there's no way of knowing exactly who is still out there, what they've got locked up and how they feel about it -- and, more important, how those complicated feelings might change if the psychology of the American consumer is substantially reshaped in a recovery.
 Tom Litton, for example, still keeps four storage units himself, at two facilities, all of them 10-by-30 units. I asked what's inside. ''I have a canoe, I have a vending machine, I have a drill press,'' Litton began. His old lawn mower was in one. (He got a bigger, riding lawn mower when he bought a ranch in wine country.) ''I've got some of my old clothes that I probably wouldn't wear anyway,'' he continued, and some trophies from college. ''I also have some old cassette tapes that I produced.'' 
 The cassettes are like audiobooks, he explained -- tutorials on how to get into the storage industry and succeed. He made them before the storage-facility building boom ended a couple of years ago. ''They didn't sell,'' Litton said, ''so they're all in storage now.''
 One afternoon in late May, a woman slouched inside one of Statewide's narrow hallways, reorganizing the innards of her unit. She said her name was Elizabeth -- no last name given, since, as she told me, ''this is not a high-self-esteem moment.''
 Most everything here belonged to Elizabeth's parents, who entered assisted living last year, and she needed to clear it out to cut expenses. She was keeping an eye out for particular family memorabilia, but otherwise it was a long, beleaguering purge. ''Just stuff? Like my mother's kitchen stuff?'' she told me. ''Whatever.''
 Boxed haphazardly inside the closet-size space was, as she put it, 53 years of married life. An empty pill bottle and an egg carton lingered on the little bit of visible floor space. ''I got rid of all the furniture,'' Elizabeth said, except her own drafting table, which, she pointed out, had wound up against the rear wall. She was an architect, accomplished but out of work (''Architecture is dead, dead, dead, dead,'' she explained) and was attacking this project with a conspicuously architect-ish methodology.
 She had brought with her dozens of new, perfectly uniform white boxes, each bearing the Harry Potter logo in one of several colors. They lined the hallway behind her, still flattened. ''When the books come out, there's just hundreds and hundreds of these boxes at every bookstore,'' she said. ''I just went around and got them.'' She repacked and erected a tidy column of Harry Potter boxes in one corner of the unit. She turned a few others, tops folded inward, into a kind of bookshelf. ''This was when 'The Half-Blood Prince' came out,'' Elizabeth said. ''They stack really nicely.''
 She was going to transfer these boxes, full of the few things worth saving, into a storage unit she recently rented in a nearby town. That unit housed most of what Elizabeth owned. Forced to leave her parents' old house and unable to afford a place of her own, she had moved in with a friend about eight months ago. As far as the storage industry was concerned, then, all the contemporaneous chaos of Elizabeth's and her parents' lives ultimately amounted to a wash: one old unit was being vacated, one new one was being rented.
 In fact, since last year, owners around the country have reported quickening rates of both move-outs and move-ins, making any occupancy rate -- the industry's fundamental yardstick -- feel kind of arbitrary, like the momentary averaging-out of a blur of activity, with no single, dominant trend (or maybe even logic) behind it. At Statewide, for example, those like Elizabeth renting smaller units -- traditionally the backbone of the business -- have been steadily leaving. ''All I hear is, 'I can't afford it anymore,' '' says Joe Dopart, who manages Statewide along with his daughter Amy and his wife, Evie, a retired schoolteacher. Renters tell the Doparts they'll find a relative's garage in which to keep their yearbooks, winter clothes or extra mattresses. Or they dump what they don't need and downsize into a smaller, cheaper unit. (''To me,'' Dopart told me, lowering his voice, ''most of the stuff is just junk.'') At the same time, though, Statewide's larger units -- mostly empty for years -- are now completely full. ''Every single one, practically, has a foreclosure in it,'' Amy told me. Others were being rented by endangered businesses, like a coffee shop and a tea room whose owners were forced to shutter their storefronts in Antioch's struggling historic downtown and move everything into storage while they plotted their next moves. 
 The upshot, while this traffic runs both ways in the background, is that Statewide has remained about 88 percent full -- about two or three points lower than last summer, right in line with the national estimate. But that may obscure a more meaningful shift. By shaking up the composition of renters, and their reasons for renting, the recession could be quietly tilting the character of American storage closer to what it was originally: a pragmatic solution to a sudden loss of space, rather than a convenient way of dealing with, or putting off dealing with, an excess of stuff. 
 Of course, some people don't fit entirely into one category or the other. Brad Molakides, who wound up with a mortgage on a three-bedroom house he never could have afforded, had just handed back his keys when I found him unloading a rental truck at Statewide not too long ago. Molakides, a fast-talking man with longish white hair who installs wireless equipment for Alcatel-Lucent, had vacated the house hastily and was now dealing with his last random, ungainly assets. He had spilled over into a second 10-by-10 unit, and it was stocked mostly with tools in giant metal carts. Far behind those, rubber garbage cans were stacked two-high. Those, Molakides told me, were his recyclables. ''I got plastic bottles in one, and the other is aluminum cans.'' They had collected in his backyard and he had never gotten around to redeeming them for the deposits. Now they would be marooned in the very rear of his storage unit.
 I found people who had been foreclosed on at most of the storage places I hung around at, and I met many more who were forced to walk away from places they were renting. Among them were two teenage brothers, Luis Jaramillo and Nikolas Aceves, in the city of Stockton, an hour from Sacramento, whose family was about to scatter to relatives' houses in surrounding towns. And Jason Williams, a 38-year-old father of three who was filling a unit with furniture before he and his family moved in with his stepmother. Williams's wages at a commercial printing house had just been cut; one of the plant's four presses had been dedicated, virtually 24/7, to printing Circuit City circulars before the retailer's bankruptcy, he explained.
 On one of my first mornings at Statewide, Evie Dopart introduced me to Danielle Johnson, who resembled a spunkier, smaller Demi Moore and who pulled her rent from a purse shaped like an old-school Nintendo controller. ''She's our most beautiful customer,'' Evie gushed, yentalike, after Johnson walked through the office door.
 Johnson worked at Dollar Tree and was also studying criminal justice. After her husband left to serve in Iraq, she couldn't afford the rent on their house in Oakland. So she locked everything but her clothes and schoolbooks in storage and moved in with her grandma. ''It's O.K.,'' she assured me, ''I'll get another one someday.'' She meant another house.
 That was a year ago. Her husband was now stationed in Kentucky, but if Johnson pulled out of school to join him, she would have to repay her student loans immediately and would end up with nothing. ''Well,'' she told me, ''I'm just going to finish, and I'll have my degree. He can wait.'' She seemed incapable of not putting a good face on the situation. 
 ''Actually,'' she told me and Evie, ''it's kind of cool living with Grandma. Home-cooked meals are awesome, and no one makes them like Grandma does.''
 ''Your family's Italian, right?'' Evie asked.
 ''No, we're redneck, though,'' Johnson said with a big smile. ''And I mean rednecks make some really good food. Gosh! My grandma's biscuits and gravy are screaming.''
 Virtually no one I asked, at any level of the business, took seriously the idea that this recession would produce a sea change in who uses self-storage and why. In an industry whose freewheeling success has been so closely tied to the evolving character and prosperity of our society, it can be hard to even talk about storage's future without getting philosophical or patriotic.
 ''I really think there's a spirit that things will turn around,'' Jim Chiswell, a Virginia-based consultant to the industry, told me. ''I believe that my children -- and both my children are proving it already -- they're going to have more at the end of their lifetimes, and more success, than I've had. And so will their children. I don't believe the destiny of this country as a beacon of freedom and hope is over. And I believe there will be more growth, and more people wanting to have things and collect things.''
 Tom Litton put it another way: ''The good news is that your age group'' -- I'm 31 -- ''has the same propensity for accumulating crap that I have. You guys got introduced to it in college, and you actually think you really need storage. You see storage the way that we all see cable and Internet access.''
 The truth is, there is no typical storage customer. As facilities crowded into the landscape, storage units became incubators for small businesses and artisans; warehouses for pharmaceutical reps, eBay merchants or landscapers. One unit at Statewide, the Doparts told me, functions as a kind of regional distribution center for Little Debbie cakes. I met a few homeless renters, who sometimes choose to pay to put a roof over their possessions instead of their own heads (living in units is not allowed); I met working-class renters using units as closets and safe-deposit boxes while serially couch-surfing or living in multifamily homes. I heard of a martial-arts instructor in Hawaii who trained clients in his unit, and a group of husbands in New England who watch sports in one on weekends. More than one operator told me they have a unit where, every morning, the renter goes in dressed as a man and comes out as a woman.
 Maybe the recession really is making American consumers serious about scaling back, about decluttering and de-leveraging. But there are upward of 51,000 storage facilities across this country -- more than seven times the number of Starbucks. Storage is part of our national infrastructure now. And all it is, is empty space: something Americans have always colonized and capitalized on in good times, and retreated into to regroup when things soured. It's tough to imagine a product more malleable to whatever turns our individual life stories take, wherever we're collectively heading. 
 But where are we now? Of all the storage units I toured, one sticks out as being most emblematic of this particular moment. It belonged to Terry Wallace, a 59-year-old veteran with white streaks in his hair and a broad, shaggy moustache who, when I stumbled across his 10-by-30 at a Storage PRO in Stockton, was sitting in a leather office chair, working at his desk under the open door, like a notary in a storefront. 
 Some open mail and a Herman Wouk novel were pushed aside, and the desk was covered with stacks of quarters, the ones celebrating the 50 states. Wallace was sorting them, state by state, into empty prescription-pill bottles. ''I've got 'em all,'' he said, astounded. ''I've got all 50.'' Then he invited me in. 
 A folded-up Nordic Track leaned against the desk, and a bucket of fire axes sat behind him. (After serving as a helicopter mechanic in Vietnam, Wallace worked as a back-country firefighter in Yosemite.) But otherwise, the unit looked warehouselike. Stacked, labeled boxes stretched down either side of the deep, rectangular space with a snug but passable aisle between. 
 This was everything Wallace owned, except the truck parked outside. A year ago, he was living in an apartment in Carson City, Nev., funneling the entire $1,200 he collected in retirement benefits and disability directly into his rent and alimony payments every month. ''So I started doing a lot of credit-card stuff,'' he said. Soon he was $30,000 in debt. 
 Wallace hated living in a city anyway, ''so because of my debt crisis and my marriage crisis and everything, I moved everything into storage and I just live out of my truck,'' he told me, resting his hands on his gut. That was June 15, 2008. At first, he rented a second unit across the way and spent a few months sorting, giving away items he didn't need to an organization for homeless veterans. ''You can call me homeless,'' he told me. ''But I'm not goofing around. I've got money, but I just want to get this debt down.''
 It was like a cleansing: the storage unit cost about $200 a month. But aside from gas, truck payments and food (he had several boxes of meals-ready-to-eat stocked here), it was his only major expense. He had cut out rent, cable, phone and electricity, and purged all the unnecessary fees from his bank statements. For the last year, he had been camping a lot and driving around the West visiting ex-firefighter friends. He saw a woman in Antioch occasionally. ''It's feeling good,'' he said, ''and it's working. That's the thing: it's working. Debts are down to almost zippo right now.'' He figured he'd be done by Thanksgiving.
 For a decade at least, storage has been a mechanism allowing Americans to live beyond our means. Wallace was using his unit as a center of gravity, to pull his financial life back within reach. He had even started saving, he told me, and was looking into a small condo in a suburb near Lake Tahoe. ''It's not my style or anything,'' he said; he'd prefer something more secluded -- bigger, and with land. ''But I could do that.'' He missed sleeping in his own bed. 
 He also missed his music collection -- and the books and rare coins he had collected. Also, his pins. ''Little pins, like flag pins,'' he explained. ''I've got veterans pins, and I've got Rose Parade pins, and pins that I got at fairs.'' He missed his stuff. ''Hey,'' he said as I left. ''I'll call you when I'm getting ready to load the truck.''

HEADLINE: Back to School, but First, the Mall

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
As children of all ages dread the impending return to early morning wake-up calls and homework overload, a short-term antidote is the annual ritual of foraging for school supplies, clothes and shoes. The Queens Center mall in Elmhurst, a short walk from the Woodhaven Boulevard stop on the R, V or G train, has 70 stores, including most major chains, and is anchored by Macy's and J. C. Penney. But it is also a microcosm of its surrounding borough, one of the most diverse places in the country: Colombian teenagers bump up against elderly Chinese, Indian women in saris shuffle past Filipino toddlers. The mall offers translation in close to 50 languages. And what other mall allows for a nosh on empanadas, Italian ices or halal food just outside the air-conditioning? LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: NOON: The mall's large food court is filled with typical fast-food fare, so fuel up outside at Mama's Empanadas, just across the street (91-20 59th Avenue). It has empanadas fried and baked, corn and flour, plus arepas. Ground beef ($1.60) is the best seller, but there are also pockets stuffed with pork, tuna, macaroni and cheese, chicken Parmesan and Italian sausage. The tropical shakes (try passion fruit, $3.25) are delicious. There are no tables, just a counter.
1 P.M.: Best to begin with backpacks, since you can stuff later purchases inside them. Kamp New York, on Level 2 of the four-story mall, sells a steady supply of North Face, including the Hot Shot ($80), which has a laptop compartment, foam backing, a water bottle holder and the words ''hot shot'' stitched on. A more basic North Face backpack is available for $45, not a bad option since the high-profile brand can attract thieves. Teenage girls might choose Puma totes ($80) or smaller Puma bags that look like purses ($50). At Morning Glory (Level 3), younger children and their benefactors can funnel more money into Hannah Montana's already bulging coffers. Backpacks ($19.99) and lunchboxes ($11.99) are available in various iterations (innocent Hannah, sexy Hannah, rebel Hannah). There are also Transformers, Power Rangers and the perennial Spider-Man.
2 P.M.: Feet of all sizes have inevitably grown. Wild Pair, a few doors down on Level 3, stocks an array of Ed Hardy sneakers, the most popular being black with a painted-on skull and small rhinestones ($65.95) or with a large-fanged tiger ($85.95). A few paces away, at Underground Station, a manager said that the skateboard look is still hot and that Converse remains a back-to-school favorite ($39.99). Down on Level 1, Stride Rite offers sturdy shoes for young children, particularly those who wear uniforms to school (Molly's are $50, Anchor $52).
3 P.M.: Recession or not, teenagers are lining up for big sales at Aeropostale ( Level 3): Polo shirts were $12 on a recent visit
jeans were buy one get one free
and camisoles were two for $20. For the under-10 set, the Children's Place on Level 1 also had some good deals: boys' polos (two for $20), rugby shirts ($15) and printed henley shirts for girls ($5).
 4:30 P.M.: Re-energizing is critical for the final stop, so swing by Pretzel Time or Haagen-Dazs on Level 3, or grab an Italian ice from a street vendor. Two blocks up the street at Queens Place Mall (88-01 Queens Boulevard) is Target, where the school supply section is in full disarray. Parents (with glazed looks) and children (with rolling eyes) march the aisles staring at supply-list printouts, arguing over how much, how many and the precise meaning of ''required.'' Basic folders (99 cents), globes ($14.99), book covers (89 cents) and notebooks spill out of bins. Locker decor is plentiful (kit with shelf, dry-erase board, mirror and magnets, $12.99). 4 P.M. When stress builds and feet throb, the mall has many comfortable easy chairs sprinkled about. Across from the Gap on Level 3 is a cluster of auto-massage chairs ($1 for 3 minutes), and on Level 2 at the opposite end, you can get a Reiki massage ($12 for 10 minutes) from a human -- a tad painful, but still revitalizing.(PHOTOGRAPHS BY DANIEL BARRY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) MAP: Map details The Queens Center in Elmhurst Queens, New York.

HEADLINE: Composer Finds a Muse in the Mississippi

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
EVE BEGLARIAN, composer, experimentalist and collaborator, has built a career translating other people's obsessions into music. 
 ''So often the collaborative projects I do are initiated by another person, and my job is to get immersed in what their obsession is -- a text, an idea -- and follow that through,'' she said. ''In some ways I think of myself as a responder rather than an initiator, even though the end result might be very personal.''
This time the obsession, the mighty Mississippi and its impact on American culture, is her own.
 On Aug. 1 Ms. Beglarian, 51, put her bright red, 17-foot kayak into the river's headwaters and -- buoyed by the example of Works Progress Administration artists who documented the state of the country during the Great Depression, as well as a bit of midlife contemplation -- began her passage downstream. 
 ''I thought, 'O.K., we're in a depression again, and I need to do this,' '' she said in a telephone interview from Little Falls, Minn. ''Part of it was a response to the economic free fall. Part of it was when Obama got elected, I thought, 'This is my country, this really is my country, and I need to know what my country is.'
 ''The river is sort of in this equilibrium between life and death all the time and is comfortable with that. And somehow it's really important for me right now to embrace that, as the condition of being alive and being conscious, and make my peace with it in some way.''
 For the next three months Ms. Beglarian, who has run a marathon and built a cabin in Vermont, will continue to glide the Mississippi's 2,300 or so miles, from Lake Itasca in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Along the way she is collecting snippets of sound, image and history from both her perch on the river and excursions into nearby towns, in wilderness and urban sprawl. 
 In late November, barring hurricanes and unfortunate barge encounters, she will arrive at the Mississippi's end. The next fall, after months of composing, Ms. Beglarian plans to head back upstream -- by car; she's not crazy -- with a small ensemble and perform new works for and with residents of the communities that inspired them.
 But somewhat to her surprise, what began as a solitary sojourn has morphed into a kind of floating artists' colony and mutual collaboration society, gathering members for days or weeks at a time.
 ''When I decided I needed to do this, I originally was going to do this alone,'' Ms. Beglarian said. Soon loneliness became an overriding concern; she hadn't set out to recreate Thoreau's ''Walden.'' 
 Seeking company, Ms. Beglarian sent an e-mail message to her mailing list and Facebook friends, saying: ''I'm doing this. If you want to come, come.''
 They came. Her first traveling companions were Mac Walton, a trombonist and musicologist she had met two years earlier while he was studying at Williams College, and Richard Steadman-Jones, a linguist and historian at the University of Sheffield in England with whom she has embarked on a project about displacement and language among the Ojibwa tribe in Minnesota and early European settlers. 
 The guest list continues to grow. Last week Heather Hitchens, the executive director of the New York State Council on the Arts, tagged along. Caroline Walker, an Illinois poet interested in the river's military history; Cori Ellison, the dramaturge of the New York City Opera; and Mary Rowell, a violinist in the string quartet Ethel, have signed on. Although each will affect Ms. Beglarian's work, and she theirs, no one is sure about the results. 
 Ms. Ellison, who envisions creating something of a musical dramatic nature, said: ''I think Eve has begun this journey with a complete tabula rasa. She'll just use the chemical reaction of who's there.''
 For armchair travelers, and as another layer of her artistic endeavor, Ms. Beglarian started a blog (evbvd.com/riverblog), which she fills with photographs and writings about whatever strikes her fancy during the 20 or so miles she tallies each day. It also lists books she is reading (Michael D. McNally's ''Ojibwe Singers: Hymns, Grief and a Native American Culture in Motion'') and music she is listening to (Delta blues, Bob Dylan's ''Mississippi'' and the Talking Heads and the B. B. King-Al Green versions of ''Take Me to the River''), as well as music she wrote before her trip (''The Flood,'' her setting of the Robert Frost poem in response to the great Mississippi flood of 1927).
 Still, her soundtrack on the river is mostly silence. ''When I'm kayaking, I definitely don't have my iPod on,'' she said. She hears mostly the rhythmic slice of oar through current, the scraping of vessel across reeds bent in submission to the water's downward flow. 
 Occasionally she records sounds to add to her extensive electronic database. Her current fixation is pumps, the kind found near dams and locks. On days when her traveling companions are taking their turns in the kayak, she gets into her car to scout out that night's campsite at a reasonable distance downstream and explore communities along the water's edge, with a visit to a different church each Sunday. When it's her turn to paddle, a fellow traveler climbs into the driver's seat; if she has two or more guests, someone generally boards the bicycle she has brought along and pedals to the next stop. By the time the Mississippi turns into a sort of superhighway below Cairo, Mo., with industrial vessels navigating a swift current, Ms. Beglarian said, she expects to bike more and kayak less. 
 On her off days and evenings she plugs in her computer and keyboard at her campsite or a public library. After a month of paddling she is finally feeling the desire to compose, though not yet with a sense of urgency. 
 ''Probably the most significant thing here,'' Ms. Hitchens, the arts council executive, wrote in an e-mail message, ''is the opportunity for so many people, whether it be friends like me who are throwing caution to the wind to join her for a few days or the random people she meets along the way, to be somehow involved in her creative process. This is important for her, but also for each one of us. As she has said to me a number of times, all the various people who participate will help color the experience and ultimately the work. There are not many works that get created this way, and I would venture to say that she is breaking some new ground here.''
 As Ms. Beglarian travels along what she called ''this secret path through the country,'' she is content to keep an ear to the Mississippi and go with the flow. 
 ''On this trip, it's my turn,'' she said. ''It's clear the subject is the river. But what that means, and how it takes shape, is something that the river is going to tell me.''

HEADLINE: A Political Puzzle Also Known as 'Space Alien' Is in Line to Lead Japan

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's presumptive next leader, Yukio Hatoyama, is a perplexing political figure: a bushy-haired management professor turned stern-faced prophet of change, a critic of American-led globalization who admires John F. Kennedy, a scion of privilege whose nickname is Space Alien, a political blueblood who overturned his country's postwar political order.
 Since his Democratic Party routed Japan's long-governing Liberal Democrats last Sunday, Mr. Hatoyama, 62, has added to the enigma by saying little about what he will actually do once he becomes prime minister, as is expected on Sept. 16. 
 It also remains far from clear what kind of leader he would become, and whether he will have what it takes to lift the Asian economic giant out of its deep slump.
 What is clear is that he is an unlikely political renegade to lead Japan's biggest political upheaval since World War II.
 This historical role became his seemingly by chance. He became the main opposition leader less than four months ago after his predecessor, Ichiro Ozawa, resigned in a political financing scandal. On Sunday, Japanese voters flocked to his party mainly because they wanted any alternative to the exhausted incumbents, the conservative Liberal Democrats, opinion polls found.
 But Mr. Hatoyama seemed to rise to the occasion, tirelessly touring the nation urging voters that it was time for a change in government -- something postwar Japan had experienced only once in the last six decades. While hardly a charismatic populist, his hoarse-voiced appeals for a gentler capitalism struck a chord with a public fed up with growing social inequalities and corruption in the governing party.
 Part of his message was a criticism of American-style laissez-faire economics. But the holder of a doctorate in engineering from Stanford, who taught before entering politics 23 years ago, Mr. Hatoyama is also a self-proclaimed admirer of the United States. On Thursday, he told President Obama in a phone call that the Japanese people found courage in his mantra of change.
 ''The people voted to end the old politics of bureaucratic control and special interests in favor of true popular sovereignty, equal opportunity and a fairer and warmer politics,'' Mr. Hatoyama said after Sunday's victory.
 Political analysts say Mr. Hatoyama's party will have a short honeymoon before Japan's recession-weary public starts demanding results. And he may be haunted by a financing scandal of his own that blew up in June, when Mr. Hatoyama's office admitted reporting more than $200,000 in donations in the names of unsuspecting friends and even dead people.
 There are also questions about whether he can break the mold for Japan's usually weak prime ministers, who govern by consensus, and grab his country's imagination like the quirkily charismatic Junichiro Koizumi did.
 He seems to have the right genes. A fourth-generation lawmaker, he hails from a well-known political family that is compared here with the Kennedys. When his Democrats smashed the Liberal Democrats on Sunday, he was humiliating the party that his grandfather, a former prime minister, helped found in 1955.
 He also grew up in Kennedy-like wealth, in a palatial English-style manor in Tokyo. His mother comes from the family that started Bridgestone, the Japanese tire company.
 One of his former political mentors, the retired opposition leader Masayoshi Takemura, said Mr. Hatoyama exudes a palpable air of privilege, which may become one of his biggest weak points as a leader. 
 ''How much can he understand the difficulties of regular people?'' Mr. Takemura asked. He said Mr. Hatoyama once admitted that he had never ridden a subway, having grown up with chauffered cars.
 The public may also have difficulty fathoming his distant personality. It was his fondness for peppering speeches with airy abstractions -- he likes to say ''politics is love,'' and once wrote that humanity needs ''cosmic consciousness'' -- that earned him his alien nickname. His wife, Miyuki, a 66-year-old former actress, raised eyebrows even further when she claimed in a book last year that she was once taken to Venus in an alien spaceship.
 Even longtime friends say his personality can be difficult to pin down because of his almost chameleon-like capacity to transform himself, as he has repeatedly during his career.
 ''He can be a Buddhist yesterday, a Muslim today and a Catholic tomorrow,'' said Jun Otsuyama, 63, a friend from Mr. Hatoyama's days as an undergraduate at the prestigious University of Tokyo.
 As a student, Mr. Hatoyama was so painfully shy that he sat silently in the corner during social gatherings, and the few jokes that he tried to tell usually fell flat, Mr. Otsuyama said. 
 ''He was the last person you'd expect to become a politician,'' Mr. Otsuyama said.
 The question now is whether Mr. Hatoyama can transform himself yet again, into a national leader. 
 Some former colleagues say he has a chance of pulling it off. Shoichi Ide, a retired lawmaker, said that he remembered how even as a quiet freshman Liberal Democratic lawmaker, Mr. Hatoyama had an air of natural dignity that stood apart. By the time the two of them joined a fledgling opposition party in 1993, Mr. Hatoyama was already a rising leader.
 ''He has the sort of personality you can set up on a pedestal,'' Mr. Ide said.
 Still, Mr. Hatoyama faces a huge challenge in fulfilling his party's ambitious agenda of strengthening Japan's social safety net and clipping the wings of the powerful, pro-business bureaucracy. 
 He must do it while holding together his party, whose members range broadly from former Socialists to right-wing Liberal Democratic defectors. He must also lead an inexperienced parliamentary majority; nearly half of the 308 Democratic lawmakers are freshmen.
 He must also retain the loyalty of other party leaders like Mr. Ozawa, his predecessor, who is seen as the power behind the throne, and who Japanese news media say could leave the party if he feels slighted. 
 Those who have worked with Mr. Hatoyama say he lacks the firm personality of Mr. Koizumi, the former prime minister, but say he is a flexible consensus-builder who can adapt.
 ''Mr. Hatoyama changes so often, it is hard to keep track of him,'' Mr. Otsuyama said. ''But his lack of dogmatism is also why people like him.''

 BODY:
THE HEART OF POWER
 Health and Politics in the Oval Office
 By David Blumenthal and James A. Morone
 Illustrated. 484 pp. University of California Press. $26.95
 This timely and insightful book puts Barack Obama's current quest for universal health insurance in historical context and gives new meaning to the audacity of hope. Universal health care has bedeviled, eluded or defeated every president for the last 75 years. Franklin Roosevelt left it out of Social Security because he was afraid it would be too complicated and attract fierce resistance. Harry Truman fought like hell for it but ultimately lost. Dwight Eisenhower reshaped the public debate over it. John Kennedy was passionate about it. Lyndon Johnson scored the first and last major victory on the road toward achieving it. Richard Nixon devised the essential elements of all future designs for it. Jimmy Carter tried in vain to re-engineer it. The first George Bush toyed with it. Bill Clinton lost it and then never mentioned it again. George W. expanded it significantly, but only for retirees. 
 David Blumenthal, a professor at Harvard Medical School and an adviser to Barack Obama, and James A. Morone, a professor of political science at Brown University, skillfully show how the ideal of universal care has revolved around two poles. In the 1930s, liberals imagined a universal right to health care tied to compulsory insurance, like Social Security. Johnson based Medicare on this idea, and it survives today as the ''single-payer model'' of universal health care, or ''Medicare for all.'' 
 The alternative proposal, starting with Eisenhower, was to create a market for health care based on private insurers and employers; he locked in the tax break for employee health benefits. Nixon came up with notions of prepaid, competing H.M.O.'s and urged a requirement that employers cover their employees. Everything since has been a variation on one or both of these competing visions. The plan now emerging from the White House and the Democratic Congress combines an aspect of the first (the public health care option) with several of the second (competing plans and an employer requirement to ''pay or play'').
 Devising a plan is easy compared with the politics of getting it enacted. Mere mention of national health insurance has always prompted a vigorous response from the ever-vigilant American Medical Association; in the 1930s, the editor of its journal equated national health care with ''socialism, communism, inciting to revolution.'' Bill Clinton's plan was buried under an avalanche of hostility that included the now legendary ad featuring the couple Harry and Louise voicing their fears that the Clinton plan would substitute government for individual choice -- ''they choose, we lose.'' 
 So, Blumenthal and Morone say, a new president must move quickly, before opponents have time to stoke public fears. After his 1964 landslide, Johnson warned his staff to push Medicare immediately because ''every day while I'm in office, I'm going to lose votes. I'm going to alienate somebody. We've got to get this legislation fast.'' George W. Bush started planning what became the Medicare drug benefit months before he was elected. 
 Clinton, by contrast, suffered from delay. Right after his election, national health insurance looked so likely that even some Republicans began lining up behind various plans. A year later, it was dead. In the interim, battles over Clinton's budget and Nafta drained his political capital, gave his opponents ample time to rouse public concerns about government-sponsored health care and soured key allies like organized labor and the AARP.
 Congress can be just as much of an obstacle: the lesson that one will probably take away from ''The Heart of Power'' is that a president must set broad health reform goals and allow legislators to fill in the details, but be ready to knock heads together to forge a consensus. ''I'm not trying to go into the details,'' Johnson repeatedly said of his Medicare bill, yet he flattered, cajoled, intimidated and bluffed recalcitrant members until they agreed. ''The only way to deal with Congress is continuously, incessantly and without interruption,'' he quipped. 
 Carter, on the other hand, pored endlessly over his incipient health care plan, scribbling opinions in the margins about every detail, and dealt with Congress at arm's length. And Clinton delivered a plan so vast and complex that even a Democratic Congress chose simply to ignore it. Republicans, meanwhile, decided that a defeat of Clinton's health care bill would be seen as a repudiation of the new administration and might give them a shot at retaking the House and Senate.
 Blumenthal and Morone's most provocative finding is that presidents who have been most successful in moving the country toward universal health coverage have disregarded or overruled their economic advisers. Plans to expand coverage have consistently drawn cautions or condemnations from economic teams in every administration, from Harry Truman's down to George W. Bush's. An exasperated Lyndon Johnson groused to Ted Kennedy that ''the fools had to go to projecting'' Medicare costs ''down the road five or six years.'' Such long-term projections meant political headaches. ''The first thing, Senator Dick Russell comes running in, says, 'My God, you've got a one billion dollar [estimate] for next year on health. Therefore I'm against any of it now.'' Johnson rejected his advisers' estimates and intentionally lowballed the cost. ''I'll spend the goddamn money.'' An honest economic forecast would most likely have sunk Medicare.
 It's not so much that presidential economic advisers have been wrong -- in fact, Medicare is well on its way to bankrupting the nation -- but that they are typically in the business of thinking small and trying to minimize risk, while the herculean task of expanding health coverage entails great vision and large risk. Economic advice is important, but it's only one source of wisdom. 
 Yet since Johnson, presidents have found it increasingly difficult to keep their economists at bay, mainly as a result of the growth of Washington's economic policy infrastructure. Cost estimates and projections emanating from the White House's Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office, both created during the Nixon administration, have bound presidents within webs of technical arguments, arcane rules and budget limits. To date, Democratic presidents have felt more constrained by this apparatus than Republicans, perhaps because they have felt more of a need to prove their cost-cutting chops. 
 The book was written before President Obama began his push for universal health care, but he seems to have anticipated many of its lessons. He's moved as quickly on the issue as this terrible economy has let him, and he has outlined his goals but left most details to Congress. Nor has he been too rattled by naysaying economists (although the cost estimates of the Congressional Budget Office set him back). The question remains whether, in the months ahead, he can knock Congressional heads together to clinch a meaningful deal, and overcome those who inevitably feed public fears about a ''government takeover'' of health care and of budget-busting future expenditures. ''The Heart of Power'' suggests that the odds are not in his favor. 
 But even if Obama fails, the authors offer one large consolation. There is an art to losing, too -- in a way that can tee up the issue for future presidents. Truman lost but nonetheless redefined the terms of debate, setting the stage for Medicare (which is why Johnson honored Truman when he signed it into law). Compare him with Clinton, who walked away from the wreckage of his health care plan and rarely mentioned the subject again. According to the authors, this allowed opponents to gain control over the spin and history, so that the Democrats' signature cause slipped out of political sight for a decade. 
 This fine book also contains a subplot with a supporting actor who, although he never became president, is repeatedly heard from offstage -- goading, pushing, threatening and pulling presidents of both parties toward universal coverage. Ted Kennedy first introduced his ambitious national health insurance proposal 40 years ago, and he never stopped promoting the cause. A deal he reached with President Nixon was the closest this country has ever come to universal care. Even before Kennedy's death last month, his illness had tragically sidelined him just when his powerful voice was most needed. Yet when and if America ever achieves universal coverage, it will be due in no small measure to the tenacity and perseverance of this one remarkable man.

HEADLINE: The University's Crisis of Purpose

BYLINE: By DREW GILPIN FAUST. 
Drew Gilpin Faust is president of Harvard. She is the author, most recently, of ''This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War.''

 BODY:
The world economic crisis and the election of Barack Obama will change the future of higher education. Even as universities, both public and private, face unanticipated financial constraints, the president has called on them to assist in solving problems from health care delivery to climate change to economic recovery.
 American universities have long struggled to meet almost irreconcilable demands: to be practical as well as transcendent; to assist immediate national needs and to pursue knowledge for its own sake; to both add value and question values. And in the past decade and a half, such conflicting and unbounded expectations have yielded a wave of criticism on issues ranging from the cost of college to universities' intellectual quality to their supposed decline into unthinking political correctness. A steady stream of books -- among them ''Declining by Degrees: Higher Education at Risk'' (also a PBS special), edited by Richard H. Hersh and John Merrow; Anthony T. Kronman's ''Education's End: Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life''; and Dinesh D'Souza's ''Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus'' -- have delineated what various authors have seen as the failings of higher education. 
 At the same time, American colleges and universities have remained the envy of the world. A 2005 international ranking included 17 American educational institutions in the top 20, and a recent survey of American citizens revealed that 93 percent of respondents considered our universities one of the country's ''most valuable resources.'' 
 Such a widespread perception of the value of universities derives in no small part from very pragmatic realities: a college education yields significant rewards. The median earnings for individuals with a B.A. are 74 percent higher than for workers who possess only a high school diploma. 
 In some respects, this is not new. Education has been central to the American Dream since the time of the nation's founding. But in the years since World War II, it was higher education, not just instruction at the elementary or high school levels, that emerged as necessary for a technologically skilled work force as well as fundamental to cherished values of opportunity. As late as the 1920s, enrollments in the United States stood below 5 percent of the college-age population. They rose to about 15 percent by 1949, in part as a result of the G.I. Bill. They have now reached nearly 60 percent. The United States has pioneered a new postwar era of mass college attendance that has become global in reach. 
 But today, for all its importance to individual and social prosperity, higher education threatens to become less broadly available. By the end of the 20th century, as Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz document in ''The Race Between Education and Technology,'' the rate of increase in educational attainment had significantly slowed, and the United States had fallen behind a number of other nations in the percentage of its youth attending college. Goldin and Katz demonstrate how this slowdown is creating a work force with inadequate technological abilities, as well as contributing to rising levels of American inequality.
 Escalating college costs have played a significant role in this slowdown, even as universities have substantially expanded their programs of financial aid. So, too, have declining levels of government support.
 After World War II, the country witnessed the establishment of a new partnership between Washington and the nation's institutions of higher learning, with the federal government investing in universities as the primary locus for the nation's scientific research. This model now faces significant challenges. Steep federal deficits will combine with diminished university resources to intensify what a 2007 report by the National Academies declared to be a ''gathering storm,'' one that threatened the future of scientific education and research in America. The Obama administration has set a goal of devoting more than 3 percent of gross domestic product to research. One hopes this highly ambitious aspiration can become a reality. 
 The economic downturn has had what is perhaps an even more worrisome impact. It has reinforced America's deep-seated notion that a college degree serves largely instrumental purposes. The federal government's first effort to support higher education, the Morrill Act of 1862, which established land grant colleges, was intended to advance the ''practical education of the industrial classes.'' A Department of Education report from 2006, ''A Test of Leadership: Charting the Future of Higher Education,'' concentrated on creating a competitive American work force and advancing ''our collective prosperity.'' But even as we as a nation have embraced education as critical to economic growth and opportunity, we should remember that colleges and universities are about a great deal more than measurable utility. Unlike perhaps any other institutions in the world, they embrace the long view and nurture the kind of critical perspectives that look far beyond the present. 
 Higher education is not about results in the next quarter but about discoveries that may take -- and last -- decades or even centuries. Neither the abiding questions of humanistic inquiry nor the winding path of scientific research that leads ultimately to innovation and discovery can be neatly fitted within a predictable budget and timetable. 
 In an assessment of the condition of higher education in the Anglo-American world, ''Multiversities, Ideas, and Democracy,'' George Fallis, a former dean at York University in Toronto, deplores the growing dominance of economic justifications for universities. They conflict, he argues, ''with other parts of the multiversity's mission, with . . . narratives of liberal learning, disinterested scholarship and social citizenship.'' University leaders, he observes, have embraced a market model of university purpose to justify themselves to the society that supports them with philanthropy and tax dollars. Higher education, Fallis insists, has the responsibility to serve not just as a source of economic growth, but as society's critic and conscience.
 Universities are meant to be producers not just of knowledge but also of (often inconvenient) doubt. They are creative and unruly places, homes to a polyphony of voices. But at this moment in our history, universities might well ask if they have in fact done enough to raise the deep and unsettling questions necessary to any society. 
 As the world indulged in a bubble of false prosperity and excessive materialism, should universities -- in their research, teaching and writing -- have made greater efforts to expose the patterns of risk and denial? Should universities have presented a firmer counterweight to economic irresponsibility? Have universities become too captive to the immediate and worldly purposes they serve? Has the market model become the fundamental and defining identity of higher education?
 Since the 1970s there has been a steep decline in the percentage of students majoring in the liberal arts and sciences, and an accompanying increase in preprofessional undergraduate degrees. Business is now by far the most popular undergraduate major, with twice as many bachelor's degrees awarded in this area than in any other field of study. In the era of economic constraint before us, the pressure toward vocational pursuits is likely only to intensify. 
 As a nation, we need to ask more than this from our universities. Higher learning can offer individuals and societies a depth and breadth of vision absent from the inevitably myopic present. Human beings need meaning, understanding and perspective as well as jobs. The question should not be whether we can afford to believe in such purposes in these times, but whether we can afford not to.
 This is the fifth in a series of essays exploring dominant themes and currents of thought in particular areas of American life. The next essay in the series, which will continue in this space over the coming months, is scheduled to appear Sept. 20. An archive can be found at nytimes.com/crossroads.

HEADLINE: A POLICY DEBACLE AND ITS LESSONS

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Before Congress's August break, the chief aides to Senate Democrats met in a nondescript Senate conference room with three former advisers to President Bill Clinton. The topic: lessons learned the last time a Democratic president tried, but failed disastrously, to overhaul the health care system.
 With the aides as divided as their bosses on President Obama's signature initiative, their typically tedious weekly session turned hotly spirited. So the Clinton White House veterans -- John D. Podesta, a former senior adviser; Steve Ricchetti, a Congressional lobbyist; and Chris Jennings, a health policy aide -- homed in on their ultimate lesson of the failure 15 years ago, that there is a political cost to doing nothing.
 In 1994, Democrats' dysfunction over fulfilling a new president's campaign promise contributed to the party's loss of its 40-year dominance of Congress. Now that memory is being revived, and it is the message the White House and Congressional leaders will press when lawmakers return this week, still divided and now spooked after the turbulent town-hall-style meetings, downbeat polls and distortions of August. 
 Republicans early on united behind the lesson they took from the past struggle, that they stand to gain politically in next year's elections if Democrats do nothing. But the Democrats' version similarly resonates with all party factions, giving Mr. Obama perhaps his best leverage to unify them to do something. In now-familiar financial parlance, this one is ''too big to fail.'' 
 ''Certainly if you undercut your own leadership, that shortens the honeymoon and could possibly even cripple the administration,'' said Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, a Democrat and member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition who opposed the Clinton plan and has criticized current efforts. ''And no one here wants that.''
 That 15-year-old lesson underscores how much the Clinton debacle has defined Mr. Obama's drive for his domestic priority from the beginning, providing a tip sheet for what not to do. Even Mr. Obama's decision to address a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night to jumpstart his health initiative left some aides wary, given the inevitable parallels with Mr. Clinton's September address 16 years ago to introduce his ill-fated plan.
 Before Mr. Obama was elected, advisers began debriefing Clinton veterans to draft ''lessons learned'' memorandums. According to interviews with more than a dozen participants in the debates then and now, those lessons have helped the president's proposals progress further through Congress's committees than the plan advocated by Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton did. All the while, the administration has held the tentative support of powerful associations for doctors, nurses, seniors, hospitals, drug makers and, as Mr. Obama recently put it, ''even the insurance companies,'' which did the most to defeat the Clintons.
 But Mr. Obama's performance has also raised questions about whether the administration has drawn too much from some lessons and underestimated some hurdles unique to today's battle. 
 The losses of two important confidants -- former Senator Tom Daschle's withdrawal as Mr. Obama's choice for health and human services secretary amid a tax controversy, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy's long illness and death -- have been ''incalculable'' setbacks for pushing legislation through Congress, said a top aide to Mr. Obama. Neither the House nor the Senate met his deadline for passing legislation before August. 
 Yet even if the administration did everything right, drafting legislation this complicated is never going to be easy.
 ''That period of defining the issue and developing the pieces and the resources to actually legislate is a relatively smooth river,'' said Charles Kahn, an insurance industry lobbyist in the 1990s who now represents for-profit hospitals. Once Congress starts filling in the details, he continued, ''then you hit the rapids. And they've hit the rapids now.''
 Mr. Obama has two disadvantages that Mr. Clinton did not. The deep recession has stoked concerns about deficits, and moderate Republicans willing to cut deals are nearly extinct.
 But Mr. Obama also has advantages flowing from his election by a 53 percent majority -- the highest number for a Democrat since 1964 and 10 percentage points more than Mr. Clinton won. Congressional Democrats, while hardly of one mind, are still more unified behind him than they were behind Mr. Clinton, committee leaders are more respectful and Mr. Obama is richer in campaign money and grass-roots support.
 Add to that, Democrats say, the benefits of the lessons of the Clinton era:
 Lesson 1: Failure Is Not an Option.
 As the Clinton-era veterans attest, and the Obama team is now arguing to Democrats, voting for a health bill might be difficult politically, but doing nothing at this point would be worse.
 ''When a party fails to govern, it fails electorally,'' said Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton aide who now is Mr. Obama's chief of staff.
 Lesson 2: Know your audience -- insured taxpayers.
 Even as a candidate, Mr. Obama showed that he was trying to avoid his predecessor's mistakes.
 Mr. Clinton had promised universal coverage, emphasizing care for the uninsured -- roughly 37 million then, now 46 million. That left the many more Americans with insurance, however flawed, to wonder what the complex and initially costly changes would mean for them.
 By the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama's Democratic rivals, including Mrs. Clinton, were again promising universal coverage. Mr. Obama never did, except for children. He emphasized that insured Americans would see lower costs, more choices and better coverage. 
 Then, as now, he more often cited as potential beneficiaries not the mostly poor uninsured but the working and middle classes, people like his mother, who had insurance but fought her carrier all the while she was dying of cancer. When he spoke of covering the uninsured, Mr. Obama argued that doing so would also help the insured because hospitals, doctors and insurers would no longer have to pass on unpaid expenses in higher premiums and prices to paying patients. 
 But for all his efforts, when Congress began writing legislation and its analysts priced the various proposals this summer, the sticker shock drew taxpayers' attention -- just as in Mr. Clinton's time -- to the main expense, which was covering the uninsured. Democrats' plans would expand Medicaid for the poor and subsidize both low-income workers buying insurance and small businesses seeking coverage for employees.
 So, just as in 1994, ''people are trying to figure out what they're getting aside from additional costs'' for taxpayers, said Howard Paster, Mr. Clinton's chief Congressional lobbyist. ''At the end of the day, most people will complain about their insurance company, will grumble about costs, but they're ultimately satisfied with the health care they're getting.''
 Some Democrats compare the current moment to the early spring of 1994. The insurance lobby's ''Harry and Louise'' commercials against the Clinton plan had come to embody the angst of the insured middle-class. Democratic lawmakers were panicky. ''It became irrevocably lost,'' said Mr. Daschle, who as a Senate Democratic leader was at the center of that debate. 
 Mr. Obama has more recently been spotlighting features that will appeal to the insured middle class, the proposed ''consumer protections'' that will not cost taxpayers. Among them, companies must cover anyone regardless of medical history, cannot drop policyholders who become sick and must cover preventive care like mammograms. 
 Lesson 3: Move before the honeymoon ends.
 This is one of the lessons Mr. Obama may have learned too well.
 In 1993 Mr. Clinton delayed his push for a health care bill until late that first year, by which time he was weakened by other legislative battles and personal controversies. Mr. Obama, by contrast, moved quickly to exploit his post-inaugural momentum, amid the demands of the worst economic crisis since the Depression.
 But some say he moved too quickly, setting the August deadline for the House and the Senate to each pass their bills, then appearing to take a loss when neither acted.
 ''The biggest mistake Obama made, and I want him to succeed, is trying to rush it,'' said former Senator Bob Dole, who as Republican leader in the 1990s first negotiated with Mr. Clinton and then led the opposition. ''Why put some arbitrary deadline on a piece of legislation that's going to affect every American?''
 Meanwhile, Mr. Obama, like Mr. Clinton, has lost some leverage and luster as his poll numbers have weakened. 
 Lesson 4: Leave the details to Congress.
 Mr. Obama got a faster start than Mr. Clinton by not repeating his mistake of trying to write the law for the lawmakers. The Clintons' secretive labors on a 1,342-page bill cost nine months and stoked resentment among Congress's proud Democratic committee barons, who felt left out.
 Mr. Obama went to the other extreme. He produced no plan, only fairly specific directives. He said he wanted to create ''exchanges'' offering private insurance plans and a public option. He called for insurance subsidies for individuals and small businesses. And he advocated changes in Medicare and Medicaid payments to give the health industry incentives to control costs and improve care.
 While Congressional Democrats welcomed the partnership, some now wonder if the president did not ''overlearn the lessons of 1994 by giving Congress too much leeway,'' as Mr. Cooper of the Blue Dog Coalition put it.
 Administration officials counter that the president's initiative would not otherwise have gotten as far as it has, with bills passed in four out of five committees, if he had not initially deferred to Congress. But with the fifth and most crucial panel, the Senate Finance Committee, still struggling for a bipartisan alternative, the president will most likely serve notice with Wednesday night's speech that he is taking the lead, with what aides call a ''more prescriptive'' legislative blueprint for Democrats to get behind.
 ''They're not going to get the ball over the finish line without his direct help and intervention,'' said Mr. Podesta, the former Clinton lieutenant, who headed Mr. Obama's post-election transition.
 Lesson 5: Co-opt the opposition.
 In a lesson that holds some irony for Mr. Obama given his campaign against special interests, he has mostly rejected the Clintons' industry-bashing populism. That has helped keep powerful groups at the table, to prevent their allying against him as they did against Mr. Clinton.
 The president privately reached early deals with the for-profit hospital group represented by Mr. Kahn, who led the ''Harry and Louise'' campaign, and with the drug manufacturers lobby. The industries agreed to accept roughly $230 billion in reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments over 10 years to help offset the cost of a health care bill, and the White House committed to support the deals through the legislative process despite liberals' demands for bigger concessions.
 For older Americans, the administration agreed with the advocacy group AARP that any bill would eliminate the gap in Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. 
 ''People have underestimated the strategic value of some of these alliances in terms of being able to keep this thing going,'' said a former Clinton aide, who asked not to be identified because he now lobbies for several industries.
 The Obama team's outreach extended even to the insurance industry, until the administration began going after it last month to shore up public support. White House officials remain divided over the tactic, with some fearful of provoking the deep-pocketed industry's fury -- as the Clintons did.
 Lesson 6: Take what you can get.
 What optimism remains among Democrats stems from their belief that Mr. Obama, unlike the Clintons, will take half a loaf and declare victory, and that most Democrats, mindful of 1994's election debacle, will go along. 
 In his 1994 State of the Union address, Mr. Clinton famously waved a pen and threatened to veto any bill that did not ''guarantee every American'' private health insurance. Even an aide who recommended that uncompromising signal, Paul Begala, now says it was a mistake. Others have said the White House forfeited a chance to compromise with Mr. Dole and other Senate Republicans.
 The question for Mr. Obama is whether he will have any Republicans with whom to compromise. More likely, he will have to mediate between the liberals and conservatives in his own party.

HEADLINE: The Wait for Financial Reform

BYLINE: By ALAN S. BLINDER. 
Alan S. Blinder is a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton. He was an economic adviser to President Bill Clinton and vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.

 BODY:
BACK during the Obama transition, the newly designated chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, enunciated what I'll call the Emanuel Principle: ''You don't ever want a crisis to go to waste,'' he said. ''It's an opportunity to do important things that you would otherwise avoid.'' He was right. But I fear that the Emanuel Principle is about to be violated in the case of financial reform.
 We are barely emerging from the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. From last September to March, it was downright frightening. Yet by the time Congress left town for its summer recess, financial reform appeared to be losing steam. 
 Monday is Labor Day, the psychological end of summer. So, starting on Tuesday, it's up to the administration and the Congressional leadership to breathe some life into what's left of the reform concept. 
 After all we've been through, and with so much anger still directed at financial miscreants, the political indifference toward financial reform is somewhere between maddening and tragic. Why is the pulse of reform so faint? I see five main reasons:
 IT'S YESTERDAY'S PROBLEM People have an amazing capacity to forget. Our financial system is now functioning much better than it was in March or last fall. So the Alfred E. Neuman Principle (''What, me worry?'') threatens to displace the Emanuel Principle. 
 You can see public attention shifting elsewhere -- to the budget, to health care, to torture, you name it -- not to mention baseball and football. I want to scream, ''Stop!'' The financial regulatory system needs fixing, and to accomplish it, Congress will have to hold a lot of feet to a lot of fires. It's not clear that many members have the stomach for that.
 LOST IN THE CROWD The problem of short attention spans has a first cousin: the overcrowded legislative agenda, which has spread the resources and time of Congress and the administration thinly over a vast array of issues.
 There is a budget to pass, health insurance to reform, energy to cap and trade, schools to overhaul, two wars to watch over and others to avoid -- and more. Amid all of this, the Treasury has sent Congress 16 pieces of financial reform legislation, totaling 618 pages. What are the chances that these 16 bills will surface to the top of the legislative agenda?
 THE MOTHER OF ALL LOBBIES Almost everything becomes lobbied to death in Washington. In the case of financial reform, the money at stake is mind-boggling, and one financial industry after another will go to the mat to fight any provision that might hurt it. 
 But your exercise instructor had it right: no pain, no gain. If we don't inflict a modicum of pain on financial players -- not out of spite, but because the system needs change -- we will accomplish little.
 BUREAUCRATIC INFIGHTING Industry lobbyists are not the only problem. Regulatory deck chairs need to be rearranged, and various government agencies are scrambling to maintain or expand their turfs.
 So, for example, other regulators don't want to lose influence to the Federal Reserve, and the Fed doesn't want to give up its consumer protection functions -- two changes that Treasury proposes. The bureaucratic turf wars have grown intense, with Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, reportedly berating regulators at a meeting last month.
 A LACK OF FOCUS Perhaps worst of all, it's hard to keep the public engaged in something as complex, arcane and -- frankly -- as boring as financial regulation. 
 We have a heavily checked-and-balanced political system. To get anything done, one must overcome both a strong status-quo bias and powerful lobbying. Normally, that requires constituents to pressure their elected representatives -- hard.
 Today, the electorate has a vague sense that it has been ripped off and that change is needed. But the sentiment is unfocused and inchoate -- with these two exceptions: People clearly want greater consumer protection and restrictions on executive pay.
 By no coincidence, those are the two pieces of financial reform that seem most likely to survive the Congressional sausage grinder. Don't get me wrong; we need both. But the two don't constitute the entirety of reform, or even its most important parts. 
 I'd attach greater importance to at least three major Treasury proposals that may wind up on the cutting-room floor:
 First, we need a systemic risk monitor or regulator. A monitor just watches risks develop and issues warnings, while a regulator is empowered to take action. In my last column, I explained the reasons for wanting a systemic risk regulator, and why the Fed should get the job.
 Second, we need a new mechanism to euthanize or rehabilitate giant financial institutions whose failure could threaten the whole system. Lehman was put into Chapter 11, with catastrophic effects. A.I.G. was turned into an appallingly expensive ward of the state. There must be no more situations like these. As both Mr. Geithner and Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, have observed, we need a better way out. 
 Third, something serious must be done to tame -- though not to destroy -- the derivatives markets. Today, virtually all derivatives trading remains unregulated and nontransparent. Much of it also has too little capital and, at crucial times, too little collateral behind it. The Treasury's draft legislation proposes to fix these problems by standardizing many derivatives and pushing trading into clearinghouses or organized exchanges, where more capital would be required and collateral would have to be posted often.
 And there is a great deal more in those 618 pages.
 So let's get on with the job, remembering the Emanuel Principle. There will never be a better time ''to do important things'' for our financial system.

HEADLINE: President Obama's Health Choices

 BODY:
President Obama's address to Congress about health care reform on Wednesday is the moment for him to stand tough for a large and comprehensive plan. This is no time to yield on core elements of reform or on the scale of the effort in search of enough Republican support to provide the veneer of bipartisanship, or even the one or two Republican votes needed to overcome a filibuster. 
 As a political tactic, Mr. Obama has thus far simply issued broad principles for reform and left it to Congress to flesh out the details, leaving great uncertainty as to what reforms he considers essential. Given the raucous, often ill-informed attacks on Democratic proposals over the past month, and the clear aim of most Republicans to oppose any bill, no matter how much he compromises, Mr. Obama now needs to spell out in some detail what he wants and how it would benefit both the uninsured and most other Americans as well. 
 Mr. Obama needs to highlight the concerns that got many people agitating for government help in the first place -- the rising premiums and co-payments required for their health insurance policies, and the likelihood that, if forced to buy insurance on their own, perhaps after losing a job, they would be unable to afford it or even be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.
 At a minimum, we believe Mr. Obama should declare himself in favor of covering as many of the uninsured as possible in the near future; should insist that insurers grant and renew coverage without regard to health status; and should insist on new insurance exchanges in which people without group coverage and those working for the smallest employers could buy insurance at large-group rates. 
 Despite calls from Republicans that he jettison support for a new public plan to compete with private plans on those exchanges, he should not do so now. If he decides to bargain it away later, he should insist, minimally, that a strong public plan be introduced if private insurers fail to hold costs down in the future. 
 We are alarmed at reports that the price for winning over Republicans and conservative Democrats might be a drastically scaled-down plan that would cost not $1 trillion over 10 years but perhaps only $700 billion or much less. That big a reduction would be a mistake. The insurance reforms that people most want -- and the insurance industry is willing to accept -- depend on achieving near universal coverage to spread the risks over a large group of healthy and unhealthy people.
 The big costs of reform involve expanding Medicaid to cover more of the poor and providing subsidies to help those with low or modest incomes buy insurance on the new exchanges. Scaling down too far would most likely result in subsidies too limited to really help people. Imagine the backlash if millions of Americans were required to carry insurance and found they could not afford to buy it. 
 The other major element of reform is slowing the rise in medical costs while improving quality. Mr. Obama should say whether he believes pending bills need an extra dose of cost-cutting reforms, or pilot projects, in Medicare. Nobody in either party has a sure-fire solution to rein in medical inflation. Mr. Obama should insist on an independent commission to monitor reforms, expand those that work and drop those that do not.
 If Mr. Obama is reaching out for broader support, he may be too diplomatic to point out the cynicism of Republican opponents who are late-blooming advocates of deficit reduction. The Bush administration and a Republican-controlled Congress enacted a Medicare prescription drug benefit that will cost the government almost $1 trillion over the next decade without raising or saving a penny to pay for it. 
 They also passed tax cuts for wealthy Americans that will cost more than $1.7 trillion over 10 years, again without making provisions to offset the costs. Now they are complaining that $1 trillion for health care reform -- fully paid for over the next 10 years -- is too much to spend on a problem that has been festering for decades. 
 Rather than yield to Republican intransigence, the Democrats ought to resort to a parliamentary maneuver known as ''budget reconciliation,'' which would allow them to push through most reforms by majority vote.

HEADLINE: Shake the Helping Hand. Or Bite It.

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 IT was a ''risky scheme,'' in the view of its passionate opponents, an example of ideological overreach and political hubris. The president's party wavered in the face of organized and spontaneous protests, especially from the elderly. Eventually, President George W. Bush's plan to add private investment accounts to Social Security, the centerpiece of his second-term agenda, withered and died.
 Just a few years later, echoes of that battle are reverberating around the country as the Republicans employ remarkably similar tactics to torpedo President Obama's drive for an overhaul of the health care system. 
 Summoning visions of a Frankenstein-like debacle, Republicans have labeled the Democratic approach a ''risky health care experiment.'' They have allied themselves with -- and stoked the fears of -- older voters. 
 Sensing that economic insecurity can be channeled into resisting change, they are trying to persuade Americans that they are better off with the system they know, however flawed and fiscally unsustainable it may be in the long run, than with one that would require a leap of faith.
 But the two showdowns are more than mirror images of political gamesmanship. Taken together, they help define the current boundaries of the unending American debate over how to balance big government against market forces. And the similarities help to explain the political climate President Obama faces as he tries to salvage his health care initiative with a take-charge address Wednesday evening to a joint session of Congress. 
 His job that night will be not just to sell a health care plan, but to reassure Americans that his approach will remain within their ideological comfort zone. To do so, he will have to convince the nation -- to a degree not required of him as he rushed to pass the economic stimulus package and take other emergency actions -- that it can trust government to be both competent and restrained. 
 His success or failure will not only have big political implications for him and his agenda. The outcome will say a lot about the nation's ability to deal with one of its biggest long-term problems, the huge and growing costs of supporting an aging population. While left-right arguments can be abstract to the average voter, the relative benefits of the free market and the government come home to people when they determine the quality of their health care and the security of their retirement.
 Looking back on it, the failure of the Social Security proposal in 2005 marked the symbolic end of more than two decades in which conservatives had pushed -- successfully, more often than not -- to diminish the role of government and to elevate the role of the market in the national economy and the lives of individuals. 
 In failing to alter the foundation of the social welfare system -- transforming a guaranteed government benefit into a hybrid that would allow people to invest in 401(k)-type accounts, with all the risk and reward that can entail -- the Bush White House found the outer limit of the public's willingness to embrace the market as a force for social good.
 Ever since, the ideological pendulum has swung leftward: the election of a Democratic Congress in 2006; the economic meltdown last year and the ensuing massive intervention in the private sector by Washington; President Obama's support for tighter regulation of Wall Street and other industries. 
 Now the question is whether that swing is already hitting its limit in the health care fight.
 The outcome will not be known for weeks or months, and it is still a matter of debate whether the opposition that flared over the last month represents a broad-based discomfort with the government's presumed role in a new system or just noise generated by conservative interest groups. 
 Liberals are confident Mr. Obama will prevail because ''the vast majority of Americans face increasing economic insecurity and feel the health care system isn't working,'' said Roger Hickey, a veteran progressive activist who has been in the thick of both the Social Security and health care battles. 
 But the spasms of anxiety and anger evident in the debate suggest that Democrats may have to scale back their ambitions. The administration has already signaled that it is wavering on its call for a government-run competitor to private health insurers, a proposal that liberals consider vital but that has helped fuel the opposition argument that Washington is moving perilously close to dictating personal health decisions. It is entirely possible that this so-called ''public option'' could end up as the Democratic equivalent of Social Security privatization, an ambitious effort whose failure ends up defining one of the nation's ideological borders.
 ''America in general is fairly nonideological and pragmatic, and we tend to play within the 40 yard lines,'' said Peter Wehner, a conservative commentator who was a top policy and political aide to Mr. Bush.
 ''Big policy changes don't come along very often, and when they do come along, especially when dealing with entitlement programs, you need a kind of civic propulsion to drive them through,'' he said. ''If you don't have that intense public sentiment on your side, you're not going to get it through.'' 
 There are times, though, when ideological boundaries are fungible, particularly in periods of crisis, a fact clear to Mr. Obama, who presented much of his agenda as an emergency response to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
 Even before Mr. Obama took office, the public seemed to have suspended philosophical judgment about economic policy, accepting that Mr. Bush and his team were justified in gigantic bailouts of Wall Street because the alternative was a likely calamity.
 Nearly eight months after the inauguration, the economy is still shaky. But it has stabilized sufficiently that the nation is no longer gripped by the sense of urgency that allowed Mr. Obama, almost without challenge, to carry out an audacious act of industrial engineering: reshaping the automobile industry from the Oval Office in a matter of weeks. 
 On health care, he is getting no such philosophical pass.
 The most relevant political framework instead appears to be a more problematic one inherited from his predecessor: a general loss of faith in government. Four years after the botched response to Hurricane Katrina deepened skepticism about Washington's ability to help ordinary people, Mr. Obama's opponents are benefiting from intense suspicion in some quarters about the government's motives and capabilities, helping them blunt the drive to give government a more active role in health care.
 So while Republicans would still have trouble these days sustaining an argument in favor of greater reliance on market forces, they are having little trouble mounting a defense against a larger role for government.
 ''We're still in a Reagan era, where people are leery about the difference between what politicians promise and what they can deliver,'' said Stephen Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University who is writing a book about Mr. Obama. ''Obama raised hopes, but he didn't allay the fears we have about overpromising and underdelivering.''
 Beyond crises, the other main route to vaulting past normal ideological limitations is presidential leadership. Roosevelt brought the nation along with him over intense objections from the right; Reagan did likewise despite apocalyptic warnings from the left. 
 But Mr. Obama, despite a legislative voting record that located him far more toward the left than the center, has built his political identity more around transcending old divisions than leading crusades. To lead his most liberal allies to where they want to go would require him to shed his reputation -- born of the dualities of his own life as well as the need to maintain an electoral coalition -- as someone who can bring divergent viewpoints together.
 So Mr. Obama faces this paradox: an electorate that on the whole tends to be reluctant to veer too far left or right, despite the passions emanating from both ends of the spectrum, is now represented by a remarkably polarized Congress that seems inclined to shun compromise. 
 Traditional crucibles of bipartisanship in Washington, like the Senate Finance Committee, have exhibited little of the philosophical flexibility or legislative creativity that create grand compromises. Of 218 elected Republicans in the two chambers of Congress, precisely one of them, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, is holding any meaningful negotiations with the administration, and only a small handful of others are even talking to Democrats about health care.
 And however the fight comes out, the ideological wars will go on. The White House is already making plans to put Social Security back on the national agenda next year.

HEADLINE: Bill T. Jones Salutes His Friend Lincoln

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
BILL T. JONES is fond of saying that when he was growing up, Abraham Lincoln was the one white man he was allowed to love unconditionally. Sometimes he includes John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert as well.
 It's a catchy sound bite, the sort that comes in handy for people who often find themselves in the spotlight. And it has served Mr. Jones well over the last two years, as he has undertaken one of the most ambitious and challenging projects of an ambitious and challenging career: a commission by the Ravinia Festival in Illinois to create a dance-theater work celebrating the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth.
But stop to consider, given the context, the full import of that line, uttered by this 57-year-old black man. Born to migrant farmworkers in the South, he rose to become one of the most prominent and provocative American choreographers of his generation, a scarred veteran of the culture wars and a Tony Award winner for his work on ''Spring Awakening.'' ''Fela!,'' his acclaimed Off Broadway musical about the Nigerian composer and musician Fela Anikulapo Kuti -- which he directed and choreographed -- opens Nov. 23 on Broadway. 
 For someone so preoccupied by politics and history, the Lincoln commission represented an enormous -- and risky -- opportunity, one Mr. Jones at first declined because his company doesn't take on projects with mandated themes. ''I feel my entire artistic life is flying at me like an asteroid belt,'' he said during a final intense rehearsal period in New York recently. ''I've been entrusted with so much.''
 It's easy to see why his longtime collaborator and companion Bjorn G. Amelan would describe the Lincoln piece, ''Fondly Do We Hope ... Fervently Do We Pray,'' which will have its premiere on Sept. 17 and then embark on a lengthy tour, as weighing more heavily on Mr. Jones's shoulders than any work he can remember. And he has created it during a remarkable time, when the United States has been in the throes of another historic campaign and presidency, two wars and an economic collapse: all echoes keenly felt by Mr. Jones, never an artist to lock himself in the studio.
 A hard-staring, chiseled man who favors an elegant speaking style, even in grueling rehearsal days, Mr. Jones described the country as fractured by much more insidious and ambiguous conflicts than the divisions during Lincoln's time.
 ''Who are the good guys and the bad?'' he asked, adding that one note he was trying to sound in the piece was ambivalence. ''Is it a war? I just think there's a mess.''
 Almost two years earlier, while beginning to immerse himself in what would come to be about 15 Lincoln books and half as many documentaries, he spoke of being afraid of the immense task. ''I feel Abraham Lincoln is a kind of spirit that inhabits a ghost world called Lincoln World on the planet of Kitsch,'' he said, laughing. ''He's a real spirit, but I have to go find him.''
 By October 2008, with Barack Obama's presidency looking likely and Mr. Jones intent on using the Civil War era as a mirror for today's world while avoiding heavy-handed parallels, the task was no longer abstract. He described himself as ''trying to turn myself inside out to make Lincoln's legacy be about what I have always felt it was about: something about human rights, and something about a politician who truly jumps head and shoulders above the discourse of his time.''
 Walking a fine line between formalism and storytelling, Mr. Jones has incorporated video by his associate artistic director, Janet Wong, and a score by Jerome Begin, Christopher Antonio William Lancaster and George Lewis Jr. that layers folk songs and classical music from Lincoln's day with original compositions. His movement, created by the dancers and edited by Mr. Jones and Ms. Wong, is set against these elements and a script that draws on Lincoln, Walt Whitman and the biographies of Mr. Jones and his performers.
 ''He has his doubts about a government of the people, by the people, for the people, but he keeps it to himself,'' reads the biography of a man born in 1952 (Mr. Jones's name is not used, but the parallels are obvious), recited onstage by the actor Jamyl Dobson. ''He is surprised that he never stops believing in great men, though he keeps it to himself.''
 The performers move through these loaded words amid Mr. Amelan's imposing set of movable white columns and sheer oval scrim that sometimes encloses the stage. Executing roiling phrases that resolve into sweeping tableaus or fragment and scatter, the dancers slip in and out of character. Layers of meaning cohere and then complicate themselves, playing a tug of war between accessibility and abstraction. ''I wanted someone iconoclastic, someone a little dangerous,'' said Welz Kauffman, Ravinia's president, explaining his decision to offer Mr. Jones the centerpiece of Ravinia, a major dance and music festival near Chicago. ''I wanted someone I could share with my Ravinia audience in a spectacular way. He's got a political bent, which I wanted.'' Nigel Redden, the director of Lincoln Center Festival and a longtime admirer, is presenting the work in 2010. ''Bill has always been politically engaged in an oblique way,'' he said. ''He spoke about it in a way that made me sit up and take notice.'' The festival is now a co-commissioner.
 Born in Bunnell, Fla., Mr. Jones was the 10th of 12 children. He burst on to the contemporary New York dance scene in the 1970s with his partner, Arnie Zane. Mr. Zane died in 1988, part of a generation of artists lost to AIDS. But Mr. Jones, though H.I.V.-positive, is healthy, and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, with a current budget of $2.6 million, has endured for more than 25 years, quite a milestone in the economically fragile dance world. 
 As part of an openly gay biracial couple, and as an artist unafraid to tackle big, thorny subjects, he endured his share of firestorms. The most famous came in 1995, when Arlene Croce, then The New Yorker's revered, powerful dance critic, labeled ''Still/Here,'' a work about people with terminal illnesses, as unreviewable ''victim art'' and chose to write about it without seeing it.
 But times have changed. The world seems little by little to be catching up to the purposeful, matter-of-fact diversity that has long characterized the company (though such integration is still scarce in the dance world). These days those people who recognize his name are as likely to associate it with the image of him dancing down the aisles at the 2007 Tonys after winning his award for ''Spring Awakening.'' It doesn't get more mainstream than that for American dance, yet he still sparks strong reactions.
 ''I think it's the residue of the culture wars, and people who needed a poster boy, they got one,'' Mr. Jones said. He marveled that some people still believe they can keep art walled off from politics. ''Well, come on, they're not separate anymore. I didn't let that genie out of the bottle.''
 Mr. Kauffman spoke of needing an artist who would complicate ''the saccharine part'' of ''Father Abraham'' and drew a comparison between Mr. Jones and Leonard Bernstein: ''He was always called a fake. But boy, do we miss him today -- the derring-do, the controversy.''
 Yet the idea of Father Abraham, greeted as a conquering hero by freed slaves in Richmond, Va., is profoundly moving for Mr. Jones, even as he acknowledges its sentimentality. And during the company's residency at Ravinia this May, when Mr. Kauffman got his first real look at an early draft of ''Fondly Do We Hope ...'' at a showing for local schoolchildren, his initial stir-the-pot motivation had given way to emotions that left him close to tears. 
 ''I was sitting with a bunch of rowdy guys, and at a certain moment they went absolutely silent, just transfixed,'' he said. ''To see it up on its feet is more overwhelming than I thought it would be.''
 Mr. Jones and his collaborators could relate to the overwhelming part. The residency had been mentally draining and physically demanding, with cold weather making the long days and nights of rehearsal in the open-air Pavilion theater a painful test of endurance. The performers congregated around heaters while not onstage. Everyone else huddled under blankets and as many layers of clothing as they could find. Emotions ran high, and as the amount of work still to be done seemed to increase, Mr. Jones's demeanor grew testy at times. He barked commands and stalked up aisles, and his words were not always kind.
 ''He has a way of pushing you,'' said Paul Matteson, the dancer given the hefty task of portraying Lincoln. ''He does it with the younger dancers, getting them to do something that's more than they know. It sometimes feels a little dangerous or cutting or inappropriate, but I kind of love that old-school thing about him.''
 Mr. Jones acknowledged his temper but didn't apologize for it. ''I know there's a certain irateness in me,'' he said. ''But I am trying to do my job. I don't have to be cuddly.''
 In making his way toward the Ravinia commission, he had already created two less ambitious Lincoln works: ''Serenade/The Proposition,'' a nuanced rumination on history that had its premiere at the 2008 American Dance Festival, and ''100 Migrations,'' a community piece seen later that year at the University of Virginia. With ''Fondly Do We Hope...'' he wanted to make something more concretely about Lincoln without falling into biopic territory, a piece that would serve as both a monument to Lincoln's legacy and a personal statement by Mr. Jones. 
 ''Bill was always a storyteller,'' Ms. Wong said. ''He has his heart on his sleeve.''
 Throughout the making of ''Fondly Do We Hope ...'' Mr. Jones struggled with the question of audience: for whom is he creating this work, which bears the added responsibility of being a commission? 
 ''I've been looking at Tyler Perry,'' he said last month, referring to the popular black filmmaker. ''I envy him. He understands very clearly who his audience is.''
 Like many artists who, as he put it, refused ''the orthodoxy of what a black artist is,'' Mr. Jones has sometimes felt caught in limbo between his roots and his ambitions. 
 ''I suppose maybe I could use 'great music' and make well-constructed dance visualizations of it,'' he said. ''And that will be satisfying to many people. But it's not the way I want dance. I want dance to be scragglier than that. I want to participate in the world of ideas.''
 In May, during a visit to the Chicago History Museum, Mr. Jones was mostly quiet walking around the various Lincoln artifacts. At one point he spent several minutes staring at a bust of the man he has spent the past two years with. At another he put his foot in a cast of Lincoln's foot, based on one of the president's moccasins. It fit pretty well.
 ''This is a commission, and it's a bicentennial piece,'' he had said the day before, ticking off a list of famous choreographers Ravinia could have asked. 
 Then he had paused, as if to emphasize his next words, or let them sink in. ''They asked me.''

HEADLINE: A Dream Interrupted at Boeing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

DATELINE: EVERETT, Wash. 

 BODY:
 IN Boeing's cavernous plant here, temporary scaffolding rises alongside several of the first 787 Dreamliners ever to be built. Workers climb steel steps to slip everything from wiring to hydraulic systems into some of the planes. 
 In other bays, crews operate giant tools that help shape parts of wings being built for older-model 747s, 767s and 777s. Staccato blasts ring out from air-powered rivet guns. Cranes hoist finished wings and fuselage sections onto the assembly floor.
 The scene is one of disciplined industry on a gigantic scale. But the fact remains that the scaffolding for the Dreamliners should never have been needed. The wings and major sections of the fuselage were supposed to arrive fully fitted from outside suppliers and simply be snapped together. 
 But the suppliers were at first too overwhelmed to install all the systems. Boeing says that they have since come up to speed, and that it should be able to wheel away the scaffolding soon. 
 The reverberating effects of Boeing's outsourcing missteps have taken a huge toll. The Dreamliner -- the first passenger plane to be made mainly with light plastic composites -- is now more than two years late and still awaits its first flight tests. 
 Boeing acknowledges that the problems have sorely tested the patience of suppliers and customers, and damaged its credibility. Already, 60 orders have been canceled, partly because of the delay. 
 The company's chief, W. James McNerney Jr., concedes that Boeing lost control of the process by farming out more design and production work than ever and not keeping close tabs on suppliers. He says the company is retaking control.
 ''You ultimately get to the question: Is it worth it?'' Mr. McNerney says. ''And my answer is yes. And that is why you take the risks. But could we have done it smarter? Yes.''
 Even after the cancellations, the Dreamliner has more advance orders from airlines -- about 850 -- than any other commercial plane in history. Part of what gives Boeing an edge is that its main rival, Airbus, does not expect to complete its first composite plane until 2013. 
 At an average sales price that aviation analysts believe to be about $125 million each, those 850 Dreamliners could turn into $110 billion. 
 The appeal to the airlines is clear: With half of its structure made of plastics reinforced with carbon fiber, a composite that is both lighter and stronger than aluminum, and more efficient engines, the 787 could cut fuel costs by up to 20 percent, Boeing says. That could enable it to fly greater distances, opening more routes for point-to-point service and lessening the need for passengers to change planes at hubs. 
 Boeing, which is based in Chicago, said recently that it was fixing the latest Dreamliner snag: a series of unexpected stresses where the wings join the fuselage. It says it expects to begin test flights this year and to start delivering the plane in the last quarter of 2010. 
 In many ways, Boeing's troubles could not have come at a worse time, with the recession curtailing orders for planes (making the 787 delays a relief to some airlines that do not have the cash now). 
 And Boeing's large military business, which helped buffer the company from a similar collapse in aviation after the terrorist attacks in 2001, has been hit hard by cuts in Pentagon spending on big weapons systems.
 Given the problems, the company is taking steps to conserve cash. It had about $5 billion on hand at the end of June, down from $7 billion at the end of 2007. It is also going through a management shuffle, with the announcement last week that James F. Albaugh, the longtime head of its military business, was taking over the commercial side. 
 And aviation analysts have begun to sound more skeptical about Mr. McNerney, 60, a former chief of 3M who won praise for cleaning up ethical scandals after he came to Boeing in 2005.
 ''There's a real feeling now that things are happening on his watch that aren't so great,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ''I think this is his test.''
 Others are asking a broader question: whether Boeing will be able to regain its old magic at driving projects home.
 ''It's very clear that this company excels in dreaming big, so big at times they've even taken their competitors' breath away,'' said Heidi Wood, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ''But there has been something of a pattern lately where those big dreams have been harder to realize.''
 AT the time the Dreamliner was being planned, in 2003 and 2004, Boeing's commercial aviation business was still suffering from the fallout of the Sept. 11 attacks. Boeing was also losing market share to Airbus, the European consortium that was winning the battle to sell midsize wide-body planes with its A-330 series. 
 Boeing knew that it needed to make the next technological leap if it was going to get back ahead of Airbus. And most aviation experts still think that the Dreamliner, set to replace the aging 767, could be a game-changer. 
 But after Boeing merged with McDonnell-Douglas in 1997, its top executives became more cautious about investing in new airplane projects. Boeing's goal in the merger was to broaden its military business and give it a more reliable revenue stream to help offset the boom-and-bust cycles in commercial aviation. 
 With the Dreamliner, Boeing aimed to expand its longtime outsourcing efforts, which had mainly focused on manufacturing parts, to a risk-sharing program in which the suppliers would also be Boeing's partners. 
 ''The idea was to get the risk off their books and get other people to do the heavy lifting for them,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. ''But the flaw was that led to a kind of 'engineering light' approach, and the problems on the 787 can be traced to that.'' 
 For instance, Boeing contracted out the design and construction of the wings -- one of the most exacting parts of the aircraft -- for the first time ever. It also let other companies wrestle with the complicated task of baking and shaping the plastic composites.
 And instead of being paid when they shipped parts, the partners agreed to wait and recover their capital -- and receive a share of the profits -- once Boeing delivered the planes to the airlines. 
 But Boeing officials now say that this left the whole process vulnerable, should any part of the chain face delays. Start-up problems and shortages of simple parts like nuts and bolts, along with a labor strike at Boeing last year, all caused delays and created a domino effect that intensified the pressure on the most poorly capitalized suppliers.
 ''I think there were places where we went too far,'' said Scott Carson, who led the commercial division. He plans to retire at year-end and was replaced in the division post on Tuesday by Mr. Albaugh. ''Clearly, we made some poor judgment calls in terms of what people's capabilities were.''
 Mr. McNerney has good relationships with several airline executives from his stint as head of the aircraft engine business at General Electric. As the Dreamliner problems mounted, he said, he called to ask them to be patient and to make new deals where needed.
 He visited the largest suppliers -- including Vought Aircraft Industries in North Charleston, S.C.; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan; and Alenia Aeronautica in Italy -- to get a better handle on the problems.
 He also visited Spirit AeroSystems of Wichita, Kan., which makes the front section of the fuselage at an old Boeing plant. Spirit cut costs by negotiating lower labor contracts than Boeing had, and Boeing cites it as one of the best examples of how it intended outsourcing to work. 
 Stock analysts estimate that the company initially planned to invest $8 billion to $10 billion in developing the project, but could end up spending $20 billion, including the penalties it will owe for delivery delays.
 STILL, by last spring, things seemed to be coming together, as the first plane was passing some of its ground tests. But in late May, the latest crisis began when there were signs of stress during a wing-bending test. 
 Patrick M. Shanahan, the vice president in charge of airplane programs at the commercial aviation unit, said the readings were totally unexpected but not initially worrisome. He said his technical team had been making bets about what type of last-minute problems might pop up to prevent one of the planes from making the first test flight by June 30. No one thought that the plane's structure, which had always exceeded testing expectations, ''was going to bite us,'' he says.
 But additional tests in mid-June showed that the plane's structure needed reinforcements, and the test flight had to be canceled. The problem placed more strain on the suppliers, particularly Vought Aircraft Industries, which ran a plant in South Carolina that builds the rear fuselage section.
 In 2008, Boeing had already bought out Vought's interest in a nearby facility that had become a production bottleneck. Boeing also advanced $422 million to the company to help it meet production demands. But Vought's chief executive, Elmer L. Doty, said he could not keep raising money to see the program through. So in early July, Boeing bought the rear-fuselage plant from Vought.
 Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm, says some of Boeing's other suppliers are angry about the delivery delays and are insisting that Boeing pay them an advance against some of their expected profits. Mr. McNerney said that Boeing would provide cash to some of them. 
 Boeing's purchase of Vought's operations was crucial in redrawing the lines of its partnership model and taking some of the most essential work back, Mr. McNerney said. He says its other top partners are all making solid progress in ramping up production. And while Boeing still believes in its model of teaming up with partners that share in the risks, it intends to retain a greater share of the engineering on future projects and monitor its partners' work much more closely, he said. 
 MR. McNERNEY says Boeing has the size and resources to handle the difficulties on the project. 
 Even though Pentagon spending is turning down, the company still expects its military revenue to stay flat over the next couple of years, at around $32 billion a year. And though the recession is hurting, Boeing still expects to deliver about 480 planes this year and has a total backlog of 3,400 additional orders. 
 Boeing has forecast total revenue of $68 billion for 2009, up from $60.9 billion in 2008. (Machinists went on strike that year, and Boeing's profit fell 34 percent from the year before, to $2.7 billion.) 
 On Aug. 27, when it announced the new flight test and delivery schedule for the Dreamliner, Boeing also said it would take a $2.5 billion charge, or $2.21 a share, in the third quarter to write off the cost of the research and development work on the first three Dreamliners. It is also cutting 10,000 jobs this year, or 6 percent of its work force. Its stock, which peaked at $104.99 a share in 2007 when the Dreamliner orders were pouring in, closed Friday at $49.15.
 Aviation experts caution that the 787 project could still falter if new problems arise in the flight tests and other certification checks.
 But Mr. McNerney says the company's Dreamliner bet will still pay off handsomely, especially if it can stay ahead of Airbus in using the composite technology to update other models. 
 ''We got the plane right,'' he said. ''And the good news is that when we get all this done, we're going to be far ahead of our competition.''

THE AGE OF REAGAN
 The Conservative Counterrevolution, 1980-1989
 By Steven F. Hayward
 753 pp. Crown Forum. $35
 We'll know it's safe to call Barack Obama's presidency a success if 25 years from now the most interesting arguments about the Obama legacy are happening among his ideological opponents. That's the way it's been with Ronald Reagan lately: while Republicans take their fealty to Reaganism for granted, American liberals have been engaged in a low-grade civil war about how their greatest foe ought to be remembered. 
 On one side you have the stalwart Reagan haters, for whom the 40th president will always be an overrated dunce who rode racism and jingoism to power and left behind a legacy of greed, polarization and fiscal irresponsibility. On the other you have those journalists and academics -- Richard Reeves, John Patrick Diggins, Sean Wilentz, for example -- who have sought ways to recognize Reagan as a consequential president, and possibly even a great one, without ceding too much ideological ground to his conservatism. (The debate even found its way into the 2008 Democratic primaries, when Barack Obama's admission that Reagan did more to change ''the trajectory of America'' than any other recent president inspired howls of outrage from Hillary Clinton and John Edwards.) 
 As fascinating as this feud can be, though, it's not the only Reagan-related argument worth having. Reagan would doubtless have appreciated the way his legacy has turned liberal against liberal, but he'd probably welcome a more spirited conversation within his own coalition. Especially lately, because in the post-Bush era of conservative retrenchment, there has often been more sloganeering than substance in the way the Gipper's would-be heirs remember him. He's become a plaster saint rather than a living, breathing politician.
 Steven F. Hayward's ''Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution, 1980-1989'' may not shake up this Reagan-worshiping complacency -- but it should. Like the first volume of ''The Age of Reagan,'' which traced liberalism's post-1964 eclipse and the rise of movement conservatism, this is history that assumes the premises that today's liberals are wrangling over. Reagan's greatness is taken for granted, and so (broadly speaking) is the correctness of his worldview, on foreign and domestic policy alike. It's no accident that Hayward's title echoes Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s ''Age of Roosevelt''series. Like Schlesinger's work, ''The Age of Reagan'' is an essentially partisan history, written from the same ideological vantage point as the politician it celebrates.
 There are obvious difficulties with this approach. This is not a book that's likely to win many converts from the ranks of Reagan skeptics, to put it mildly -- and not only because Hayward isn't quite in Schlesinger's league as a writer. ''The Age of Reagan'' has a lot of ground to cover, but it would profit from lengthier pauses in its often headlong narrative, and more serious engagement with the enduring liberal critiques of Reagan's record. 
 This doesn't require giving credit where it isn't due. Hayward is appropriately dismissive toward the anti-anti-Communist left, whose cringing posture toward the Soviet Union throughout the 1970s and '80s still has the power to appall. (As he notes -- harshly, but not unfairly -- it was often difficult to tell the difference between the criticism by Reagan's left-wing opponents and editorials in Pravda.) And his damning portrayals of Democratic politicians like Tip O'Neill and Walter Mondale, men who seemed incapable of imagining an economic policy that didn't involve divvying up a shrinking pie among an expanding array of interest groups, feels entirely appropriate as well.
 But not every argument from the 1980s is a dead letter today. In an age of counterinsurgency, the moral compromises that America's support for third world anti-Communism entailed deserve more scrutiny than ''The Age of Reagan'' gives them. So too, in an era of mounting deficits, do the long-term consequences of Reagan's fiscal policy -- for the country, but especially for the conservative approach to governance. (Hayward does criticize Reagan for claiming, as his supply-side advisers rarely did, that tax cuts would increase revenue in the short run. But he doesn't acknowledge the extent to which Reagan's assumptions, rather than the sounder views of his advisers, have become orthodoxy for right-wing politicians ever since.) 
 But ''The Age of Reagan'' demonstrates the strengths of partisan historiography as well. Because he takes for granted that Reagan's presidency was successful, Hayward is free to explore, as few authors have, exactly how he did it. Reagan the wordsmith gets his due -- the book is filled, appropriately, with extensive quotations from the Great Communicator's addresses, television chats and press conferences. So does Reagan the savvy diplomat, whose rapport with Mikhail Gorbachev played a significant role in easing the cold war to an end. But Hayward's most timely portrait is probably Reagan the wheeler-dealer, who came to office with the presidency's influence at a modern nadir and maneuvered sweeping domestic legislation through a Congress that was often controlled by the opposition party. (''The Age of Reagan,'' in other words, puts Rahm Emanuel's challenges in perspective.) 
 Hayward's ideological vantage point also leaves him well situated to analyze where and how Reagan's record should be deemed a disappointment by conservatives. This critique extends from specific fumbles, like the mishandling of the Robert Bork nomination, to the broader failure to significantly reduce the size and scope of government. 
 Many liberals have passed from underestimating the Reagan revolution to overestimating -- out of shock at its staying power, perhaps -- how revolutionary it really was. Hayward has a clearer view. ''Reagan successfully curbed the excesses of liberalism,'' he concludes, but ''he did not curb liberalism itself.'' The angst of his opponents notwithstanding, Reagan's budgets hardly touched the Great Society, let alone the New Deal. The conservative era he ushered in was, in fact, conservative: It halted liberals in their tracks, without significantly rolling back the state that Roosevelt and Johnson had built.
 Hayward obviously sees this as a lost opportunity. But it's one of his book's great strengths that he also recognizes the centrality of compromise to Reagan's overall success. This was something, he emphasizes repeatedly, that many right-wingers got wrong at the time. Again and again, movement conservatives misread and misunderstood their greatest champion, whether they were bemoaning Reagan's willingness to include moderate Republicans in his councils or condemning him, in his second term, as a sellout to the Soviets. 
 Ideological to a fault, Reagan-era conservatives failed to see that ''the most successful presidencies tend to be those that have factional disagreements,'' rather than those whose inner circles march in perfect lockstep. They often ''missed the signals of Soviet vulnerability'' that presaged Communism's peaceful fall. In both cases, Reagan knew better, and the country was better off because he did.
 Since ''The Age of Reagan'' will probably find more readers among conservatives than liberals, this is the message they ought to take to heart -- that being like Reagan can mean more than simply checking off a list of ideological boxes, or delivering a really impressive speech. It can mean marrying principle to practicality, tolerating fractiousness within one's own coalition and dealing with the political landscape as it actually exists, rather than as you would prefer it to be. (And in Hayward's account of the flailing Reagan-era Democratic Party, conservatives can find an object lesson in what happens if you don't.)
 There is also a message here for all partisans and all seasons -- for contemporary liberals as well as Reagan nostalgists, and for anyone who's invested himself in the redemptive power of politics. Reconsidering his hero inspires Hayward to meditate on leadership, on greatness and on the possibility of world-historical change. Channeling William F. Buckley, he ponders ''the limitations of politics,'' the fact that ''the most powerful man in the world is not powerful enough to do everything that needs to be done.'' From his lips, one hopes, to Barack Obama's ear.

HEADLINE: Obama Outlines New Initiatives Intended to Make It Easier to Save for Retirement

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama, noting that millions of Americans do not have enough savings to cover their retirement, announced a package of initiatives on Saturday to spur increased savings.
 The administrative actions, which do not require new legislation from Congress, are intended to make it easier and more automatic for people to put money into tax-advantaged retirement accounts. 
 ''The fact is, even before this recession hit, the savings rate was essentially zero, while borrowing had risen and credit card debt had increased,'' Mr. Obama said in his weekly radio address. ''Half of America's work force doesn't have access to a retirement plan at work. And fewer than 10 percent of those without workplace retirement plans have one of their own.''
 Mr. Obama outlined four new initiatives, all of which are based on new behavioral research on ways to encourage people to save in a systematic way.
 One key finding in that research is that people are more likely to contribute to a retirement savings account, like an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, if they are enrolled automatically. Workers have usually had to sign up for the plan, something that large percentages of people either postponed or never did at all.
 Under automatic enrollment plans, employees are automatically signed up unless they explicitly ask not to participate.
 Many large and medium-size companies have already adopted automatic enrollment plans, but White House officials said the new initiative was aimed at very small firms that often use a simpler system called the ''simple I.R.A.'' 
 Under the new initiative, the Labor Department will publish new guidance for small businesses on how to use automatic enrollment for the simplified plans. It will also encourage employers to institute an automatic ''step up,'' which increases a person's saving rate each year or with each raise.
 In a second move, Mr. Obama said the Internal Revenue Service would allow people to check a box on their tax returns and receive their tax refunds in the form of United States savings bonds. White House officials said there are about 100 million tax refunds each year, and the average is about $2,000.
 In a third change, the government will make it easier for employees to contribute the money for unused vacation time and overtime to their retirement accounts. At the moment, most employers simply cash out the extra time and give the money to their workers.
 Mr. Obama said the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service were also publishing an easy-to-read guide to help people understand the arcane rules governing retirement plans when people change jobs.
 White House officials said the new initiatives would go into effect immediately and come on top of two related proposals that Mr. Obama sent to Congress as part of his budget.
 One would compel all but the smallest employers to offer retirement savings plans, and the other would expand the saver's tax credit, which matches a family's savings up to $1,000 a year.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 15, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 6 about President Obama's new actions to encourage greater retirement savings misidentified the government agencies that are publishing new guidelines for automatic enrollment in employer plans. They are the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service; the Labor Department is not involved.

HEADLINE: Out of Work, And Too Down To Search On

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
They were left out of the latest unemployment rate, as they are every month: millions of hidden casualties of the Great Recession who are not counted in the rate because they have stopped looking for work.
 But that does not mean these discouraged Americans do not want to be employed. As interviews with several of them demonstrate, many desperately long for a job, but their inability to find one has made them perhaps the ultimate embodiment of pessimism as this recession wears on.
Some have halted their job searches out of sheer frustration. Others have decided it makes more sense to become stay-at-home fathers or mothers, or to go back to school, until the job market improves. Still others have chosen to retire for now and have begun collecting Social Security or disability benefits, for which claims have surged.
 Rick Alexander, a master carpenter in Florida who has given up searching after months of effort, said the disappointment eventually became unbearable. 
 ''When you were in high school and kept asking the head cheerleader out for a date and she kept saying no, at some point you stopped asking her,'' he said. ''It becomes a 'why bother?' scenario.''
 The official jobless rate, which garners the bulk of attention from politicians and the public, was reported on Friday to have risen to 9.7 percent in August. But to be included in that measure, which is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics from a monthly nationwide survey, a worker must have actively looked for a job at some point in the preceding four weeks. 
 For an increasing number of people in this country who would prefer to be working, that is not the case. 
 It is difficult to assign an exact figure, because of limitations in the data collected by the bureau, but various measures that capture discouragement have swelled in this recession. 
 In the most direct measure of job market hopelessness, the bureau has a narrow definition of a group it classifies as ''discouraged workers.'' These are people who have looked for work at some point in the past year but have not looked in the last four weeks because they believe that no jobs are available or that they would not qualify, among other reasons. In August, there were roughly 758,000 discouraged workers nationally, compared with 349,000 in November 2007, the month before the recession officially began. 
 The bureau also has a broader category of jobless it calls ''marginally attached to the labor force,'' which includes discouraged workers as well as those who have stopped looking because of other reasons, like school, family responsibilities or health issues. But economists agree that many of these workers probably would have found a way to work in a good economy. 
 There were roughly 2.3 million people in this group in August, up from 1.4 million in November 2007. If the unemployment rate were expanded to include all marginally attached workers, it would have been 11 percent in August. 
 But even this figure is probably an undercount of the extent of the jobless problem in this country. There are about 1.4 million more people who are not in the labor force than when the recession began. Some of these are retirees, stay-at-home parents, people on disability and students. But it is also rather likely that many of these people have given up looking for work at least partly because of economic reasons as well. 
 Here are four people's stories:
 Rick Alexander: A Builder by Trade, With Too Much Time
 In the worst case, Rick Alexander figured, he could scrounge up a job at Home Depot. 
 He was a master carpenter, after all. He had skills. He had run his own successful home-restoration business for 28 years.
 In early 2008, however, he moved to Florida to take care of his ailing parents, leaving his business in Connecticut to his daughter.
 After helping his parents into an assisted-living facility, he began applying for jobs. He devoted eight hours a day to the task, sometimes sending out three or four applications a day. 
 ''It was a full-time job,'' he said.
 At first, he focused on jobs in construction, applying to be a site supervisor. He looked for anything within an hour's commute of where he was living in Jensen Beach. 
 But the real estate industry had fallen off precipitously, bringing building to a near standstill. Mr. Alexander, 58, began branching out to suppliers, applying at lumberyards and other wholesalers. Eventually, he expanded his search to Home Depot, Lowe's and mom-and-pop hardware stores. Finally, he began applying for ''everything under the sun,'' even the overnight shift at convenience stores.
 By that summer, he had still received no callbacks for interviews. He went back to Connecticut for several weeks to do a renovation for an old client to earn some cash. When he returned to Florida in August 2008, he tried to start his own business, selling advertising on video displays mounted in coffee shops and other places. 
 He networked furiously with local businesses, but by then the economy had nose-dived. Mr. Alexander said he grossed a total of $150. He sank into a funk and stopped looking. 
 ''There are thousands of people applying for every job I'm looking at, and potential employers won't even give me the courtesy of acknowledging I applied,'' he said. ''The entirety of that causes me not to bother. It's a waste of my time and theirs.''
 He has applied to just two jobs this year, both several months ago. The unemployment rate in his area, Martin County, now exceeds 11 percent. After prodding from his companion, Dona Olinger, he went down to Home Depot a little over a month ago to re-activate his application there. 
 His savings are gone. He lives with Ms. Olinger, who makes $10 an hour as a volunteer coordinator at a food pantry, Harvest Food and Outreach Center, where they also get groceries every week. It is her salary that pays their rent. 
 Mr. Alexander's parents have since moved out of the assisted-living facility and back into their home, so he tends to them most days. He reads Robert Ludlum novels. He sleeps. To fill his time, he is looking into volunteer work. The other day, he cut the grass on his small lawn using just a pair of clippers.
 Ray Rucker: Feeling Counted Out With Years Still Left
 Ray Rucker came home from a job interview several months ago, sat down in his living room with his suit still on and wept.
 The meeting with the interviewer had lasted 10 minutes. The man did not even open a folder in front of him to study Mr. Rucker's resume. It was just ''jibber jabber,'' Mr. Rucker said later.
 Mr. Rucker, who lives in Overland Park, Kan., had little doubt about what had happened. He is 62 years old and, as he puts it, ''I look 62.''
 He lost his job as a facilities manager for Starbucks in Kansas City and Wichita, Kan., last November, when the company closed hundreds of stores across the country. He had done similar work for years for other national restaurant chains and retail outlets.
 He landed his first interview within a month, with a retail chain. He was invited back to talk to the vice president of operations and to the director of operations. He was also invited to meet with the company's chief executive. 
 But as Mr. Rucker was finishing with the director of operations, she asked him straight out whether he was retiring soon. Shocked, Mr. Rucker answered, truthfully, that he planned to work at least 10 more years. 
 The meeting with the chief executive never came. Mr. Rucker said he thinks his interviewer simply did not believe he planned to continue working.
 A month ago, he found a job posting that seemed tailored for him, a facilities manager for a national restaurant chain. He sent in his resume and three days later got called for an interview. The company official said he was in a hurry to fill the position. But Mr. Rucker soon learned that this one, too, had slipped from his grasp.
 ''That's the one when I kind of threw in the towel,'' he said.
 Mr. Rucker said he was done looking. His wife, who works at a small nonprofit organization, protested, saying there was more he could do to look.
 ''You don't know what I'm going through,'' Mr. Rucker said he told her.
 ''You send out so much, and you don't get responses,'' he said. ''Then when you get called in, you're treated like you're too old. Why am I doing this?''
 So he made an appointment with the local Social Security office to begin claiming benefits. He might try to get some kind of hourly job to help make ends meet. He has mapped out some home renovation projects he wants to do. 
 The Social Security checks will not equal even a third of what he used to make. But he is now preparing for semiretirement.
 Jenny Salinas: From a Nonstop Career to a Focus on the Home
 Jenny Salinas never envisioned being a stay-at-home mother, taking care of the children and keeping house. She was the one with the high-powered career, the six-figure salary, always jetting off to Russia or China.
 She put her 5-year-old daughter, Mia, in day care when she was three months old. Mia got so used to her mother going away she would simply say, ''Mommy's on a trip,'' and blow her kisses when she left.
 But after searching unsuccessfully since January for a job, Mrs. Salinas, 37, said her priorities had shifted. She is now content to stay home and focus on her family. She and her husband are even talking about having more children.
 ''It's just amazing how it changes your perspective on what's important,'' she said. 
 Mrs. Salinas had been a manager of corporate marketing and media relations at an oil and gas company in Houston, where she lives. She was so focused on her career, she said, that she never noticed her daughter had a lazy eye. Mrs. Salinas's mother mentioned something to her, but only after Mrs. Salinas was laid off did she realize that her daughter needed to see an ophthalmologist. 
 ''That's how much I was on my BlackBerry,'' Mrs. Salinas said.
 Mrs. Salinas was initially confident that she would land somewhere quickly. She seemed to be doing well, too, scoring interview after interview for senior-level corporate marketing positions. But each of those prospects dried up, usually because of a hiring freeze or some other obstacle. 
 So, for the last two months, she has not looked at all. Partly, she has been busy, selling their old house, moving into a new one they are renting at half the monthly expense, seeing her daughter off to kindergarten.
 She is helped by the fact that her husband, a vice president at an advertising agency, still has his job. After the couple realized that her job search might take time, they decided to cut back on their spending.
 She has in mind a specific set of companies, but they are all still not hiring. Unwilling to settle for just any job, she said, she would rather bide her time.
 But the process of searching for work and coming up empty has also left her feeling spent.
 ''I was just discouraged, fed up and angry, feeling like my career had betrayed me,'' she said.
 Her daughter used to be in day care or preschool from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., but Mrs. Salinas began dropping her off later and picking her up earlier. Some days, they skip day care completely and while away the day together.
 Tatjana Jovanovic-Grove: Moving From Serbia, Scraping By Online
 Tatjana Jovanovic-Grove now occupies her days with arts and crafts projects. She makes a little money selling them online -- $10 here, $50 there -- but mostly it beats the sense of futility that used to envelop her each day during her quest to find a job.
 ''I stopped looking because that feeling of being rejected again and again is hard,'' she said. ''It's just like somebody punching you in the face.''
 Ms. Jovanovic-Grove, 41, has struggled to find work since she immigrated in late 2005 to the United States from her native Serbia, where she was a biology researcher at a prestigious research institute in Belgrade. 
 She had married an American, Doug Grove, 42, a Wal-Mart mechanic she met over the Internet. The couple initially lived in Glendale, Ariz., with their three children from previous marriages, but they moved to Winston-Salem, N.C., in late 2007.
 They were attracted by the weather and the low crime rate. They also thought Ms. Jovanovic-Grove, who earned a master's degree in Serbia in environmental protection and zoology, would have an easier time finding a job in an area rich with universities. 
 ''I was really thinking I would have no problem,'' she said.
 The need for her to find work became more urgent after the couple took on thousands of dollars in additional debt after they turned their Arizona home over to a bank in lieu of a foreclosure settlement. They had been unable to sell it amid the state's collapsing real estate market. 
 But aside from a few temporary jobs, Ms. Jovanovic-Grove has come up empty on everything from research assistant positions to retail jobs. Meanwhile, her husband's hours at Wal-Mart, where he is paid a little more than $14 an hour, have been cut back. 
 In May, she stopped looking completely, concluding that the job market was saturated. Winston-Salem's unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent. 
 ''You figure out it's just like when you toss a piece of meat at a pack of hungry cats,'' she said. ''I just gave up because I could not compete.''
 Instead, she has turned to making wood handicrafts and selling them on Etsy.com, an online marketplace. The small payments she gets often mean she earns less than fifty cents an hour for her effort. But she reasoned it is better than wasting gas driving around applying for jobs she believes she cannot get.

HEADLINE: Despite Success, Fewer Fans Cheer Cyclones

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER; Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Since their inaugural season in 2001, the Brooklyn Cyclones have been a remarkable success story: locals have embraced the minor league club for returning baseball to the borough after a nearly half-century absence, as overflow crowds have poured into the Coney Island ballpark year after year. 
 Winning has not hurt either: the Cyclones have missed the playoffs only three times in their nine-year history. 
 This season seemed no different. The team has again outperformed its disappointing major league counterpart, the New York Mets, and the flailing economy made single-digit ticket prices -- often combined with clever discounts and promotions -- all the more alluring. To top it off this weekend, there was the two-game appearance of Carlos Beltran, the Mets All-Star center fielder, inside the intimate confines of a minor league ballpark. 
 Yet as the Cyclones concluded their regular season on Sunday, the team drew the lowest attendance in the Mets' Class A farm club's history. (The Cyclones will begin the playoffs on Tuesday against the Mahoning Valley Scrappers.)
 Over 38 games, including one doubleheader, the average attendance was estimated at 7,138 people, down about 230 from last year and more than a thousand from the year before that.
 The Cyclones still fill nearly all of their 7,500 seats at KeySpan Park and easily lead the New York-Penn League in attendance (the last place Oneonta Tigers drew fewer than 700 fans per game). But the drop-off is notable in a ballpark that normally sells several hundred and occasionally several thousand standing-room-only tickets. (This year's highest attendance was 9,284 on opening day.) 
 Steve Cohen, the team's general manager, said that it was unreasonable to expect to continue selling hundreds more tickets than there were seats year after year, so some drop-off was expected, even with tickets going for between $5 and $16. But he suggested that sales might have slipped because of the weather -- nearly half of the team's home games fell during an unusually cold and rainy July -- and the economy.
 ''Even though our ticket pricing is very affordable, you take a family of four to a ballgame and it adds up: you want a drink, a hot dog, you have transportation,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''You've got to cut back somewhere.'' 
 Before Sunday's game, Mo Sartor, 43, of Broad Channel, Queens, stood in the ballpark's parking lot, spatula in hand, grilling burgers and hot dogs with friends. ''It definitely can't be the economy, because these are the cheapest tickets around. We're die-hard Mets fans, but we don't want to see them. Besides the fact that you can't get into Citi Field unless your last name is Trump.''
 Bill Kuil, 50, a city bus driver from Glendale, Queens, added, ''It's $40 for tickets there, $8 here, and $5 to park instead of $18. This is a better deal.''
 Even so, he noticed a lot of vacant seats at the last game he attended.
 George and Patty Franke, of Bellerose, Queens, said they treasured their usual spot behind the dugout and have become friendly with many of the other regulars in the section but still cut back to two season tickets this year, instead of their usual six. 
 ''We cut back because of the economy,'' said Mr. Franke, 57.
 Overall attendance has dropped for 8 of the 14 teams in the New York-Penn League. 
 However, turnout for the Staten Island Yankees, who are third in the league in attendance, has increased to a record 6,000 per game, from about 5,200 per game last year (the stadium has 7,171 seats). ''In a bad economy, that's pretty incredible,'' said Joe Ricciutti, the team president.
 Kimberly Spell, a spokeswoman for NYC & Company, the city's tourism organization, said that overall tourism had been down about 5 percent for the summer, less than the double-digit decreases in many other American cities. She said that attendance at many attractions had been holding steady or growing. 
 ''It sounds like it is a little bit of an anomaly,'' she said, pointing out that the city has been marketing Coney Island more heavily than ever with the arrival of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. 
 Desiree Ehleiter, 43, a season-ticket holder from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who attended Sunday's Cyclones game, said she thought the novelty had worn off. ''When they first opened the park, it was 'baseball back in Brooklyn' and people came from all over. But they just couldn't keep that thrill up. It was too much to ask for.''

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Moving Out
 To Save Money
 From tenants at high-end buildings to those just scraping by, renters are feeling the squeeze -- and some are getting out in search of greener, cheaper pastures. 
 Camille Tokerud, a commercial lifestyle photographer and single mother of two teenage boys, decided that now was the time to cut her expenses.
 ''It was too much rent,'' Ms. Tokerud said in her old apartment in the Archive Building in the West Village. She was surrounded by boxes half-filled with mementos, old newspapers for wrapping and dozens of bright orange and green ''Fragile'' stickers.
 ''And so I looked at comparable apartments and saw there were much better deals without changing too much of your quality of life,'' she said.
 Ms. Tokerud says she does not shop for clothing as much or stay at the more expensive hotels when she travels. And while she refuses to cut her family's outings to art and music events, her high rent was an obvious candidate.
 ''Business is tough right now,'' she said. ''It's not for the weak.''
 In the end, Ms. Tokerud, 48, moved to a building on the Bowery on a two-year lease, saving $1,300 a month on rent for the first year and $1,000 a month the next.
 She has embraced the move as a chance to experience a new neighborhood, new neighbors and a new mode of life.
 ''My personal journey is important to me,'' Ms. Tokerud said. 
 About six miles and what seems a world away, Jessica Advocat and two friends piled the last of her things into the back of a U-Haul truck in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
 ''I just can't afford living in Brooklyn,'' Ms. Advocat said, sitting on the back of the truck, most of her possessions looming over her shoulder. ''It's just not the city for me.''
 Ms. Advocat lost her job three months ago, and while unemployment checks have kept her afloat, she has found it tough to pay the rent. So she is stepping out, on faith.
 ''I bought the JetBlue pass, so I'm going to just bop around for a month, enjoy my life for the first time,'' she said.
 Ms. Advocat, 25, said she planned to go from city to city, couch to couch, ''window shopping'' for a less expensive city and delivering her resume along the way.
 ''I'm born and raised in Brooklyn,'' she said, her long, coiled locks bouncing off her shoulders. ''Maybe this is an opportunity to start a life somewhere else.''

HEADLINE: Children's Aid Society's New Chief Faces Big Challenges

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
There are a few things about Richard R. Buery Jr. that made him a novel choice to lead the Children's Aid Society. He is 37, almost 30 years younger than the man he will replace. He is the first black person to run Children's Aid. And he has spent much of his professional life building organizations from scratch, not taking over established ones with venerable, 150-year-old reputations. 
 ''It's not a place that's broken and needs to be fixed,'' Mr. Buery (pronounced like fury) said of Children's Aid during a recent interview in his office in Brooklyn. ''I approach this work with a great deal of humility. I mean, there are people at Children's Aid who know a lot more about their work than I do.'' 
 But Mr. Buery, a child of East New York, Brooklyn, knows about poverty. Though he was the product of a stable two-parent family, he grew up in one of the most troubled neighborhoods in the city. 
 He still works there, in a third-floor walk-up office on Sutter Avenue, a run-down but bustling street that Mr. Buery said had come a long way from when he was younger. ''It used to look like a picture of the South Bronx, with the empty lots,'' he said. ''It has been physically transformed. But it remains a neighborhood with really profound challenges.''
 In October, Mr. Buery will take over as chief executive of Children's Aid, an agency renowned for its work in foster care, teenage pregnancy prevention, education, health and the arts. Until then, he is still running Groundwork Inc., a community organization in East New York that he founded seven years ago to help young people in high-poverty urban areas.
 On paper, the differences between the two agencies are stark. Groundwork had a $6 million budget. At Children's Aid, the budget is more than $100 million. He will earn $360,000 a year, a considerable increase from his present salary. 
 C. Warren Moses, who is leaving as chief executive at Children's Aid, had never heard of Mr. Buery until his name was mentioned as a possible candidate. ''I was not familiar with his work,'' Mr. Moses said, adding that he was proud that the board had selected him.
 ''He can not only walk the walk, but he has lived it since his earliest years,'' Mr. Moses said. ''He has the ability to speak with a high level of credibility on what this city needs to do.''
 For all his proximity to urban strife, Mr. Buery grew up in a solid family with two working parents, Panamanian immigrants who came to the United States in the 1960s. Both are retired. His mother, Olivia Buery, taught Spanish and English as a second language at the East New York High School for Transit Technology. His father, Richard E. Buery, was a laboratory manager at a maker of products for the visually impaired. 
 He attended a Roman Catholic elementary school, then Intermediate School 383 in Bushwick. Then there was Stuyvesant High School, that public-school magnet of some of the city's smartest students, many of them from Manhattan privilege. 
 For a teenager who had spent all of his life attending school in Brooklyn, it was Mr. Buery's introduction to what he calls ''the two New York Cities'' -- the city that exists for children of privilege, and the city that exists for poor children. 
 ''It was my first experience meeting people and having friends who weren't black and Hispanic,'' he said. ''For the most part, it was my first time meeting folks from wealthier communities and wealthier families. And it really made very real to me the truth about educational equality and the difference between what it means to be a child from a place like East New York and a child in a neighborhood like Park Slope or the Upper East Side.''
 High school was followed by Harvard, where he immediately began volunteering at an after-school program in Roxbury, the largely black neighborhood of Boston. Harvard was a good fit, and he graduated with honors. Still, ''I spent a lot more time hanging out in Roxbury than I did hanging out in Cambridge,'' he said. 
 He finished college and embarked on stints teaching at a rural school in Zimbabwe (''I learned that I wasn't a very good teacher,'' he said); getting a degree from Yale Law School; clerking for a federal judge; working as a staff attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University; and founding iMentor, an online matching service for teenagers and adults willing to mentor them. 
 In 2002, he created Groundwork, which runs after-school and summer programs and provides financial counseling, housing assistance and advice on accessing government social services -- focused on families in East New York. 
 Children's Aid, Mr. Buery said, will be ''a very different environment, in a million ways.''
 Given the impact the recession has had on nonprofit organizations, the Children's Aid job comes with a formidable set of challenges. Private donations are down, the government has made reductions in contracts and the stock market has battered the endowments for many nonprofit groups. While better off than most, the Children's Aid Society laid off 45 people this year and has cut its budget by $4 million.
 ''I'm sure that there will be things to learn about how you effect change in that kind of institution versus an institution like Groundwork,'' Mr. Buery said. ''There are some things that we're going to want to change, and there are some things that are actually working great, and we're just going to want to build. But I do understand that steering a ship of that size must, inevitably, be different than steering a smaller ship.''

HEADLINE: Africa to Press for End to Zimbabwe Sanctions

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Congo 

 BODY:
African leaders will step up calls on Monday for an end to Western sanctions against Zimbabwe and will urge South Africa to plead Zimbabwe's cause within the Group of 20 industrial and emerging nations, officials said. 
 The countries of the Southern African Development Community will also press Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, and its prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, to end their long dispute over a power-sharing pact that was holding up vital foreign aid, the officials said.
 ''We are convinced that if sanctions are lifted, Zimbabwe, within the framework of its current political agreement, will have the possibility to move toward development,'' said Foreign Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba of Congo.
 ''We will also ask South Africa, which is the only sub-Saharan African country that is a member of the G20, to plead for Zimbabwe's cause,'' said Mr. Mwamba, whose country is taking over the chairmanship of the development community and is hosting its summit meeting in Kinshasa starting Monday.
 President Jacob Zuma of South Africa is being watched for signs he will take a tougher line toward Mr. Mugabe than did his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki. Mr. Mugabe has been the target of sanctions by the European Union and the United States, including a travel ban, based on accusations of rights abuses and vote-rigging.
 Last month, Mr. Zuma called on the West to repeal the sanctions. But in what sounded like a stronger stance on Mr. Mugabe, he also stressed the need for respect for democracy and human rights. 
 A recovery in Zimbabwe's battered economy is important for South Africa because millions of Zimbabweans have fled to neighboring South Africa in search of work. Zimbabwe says it needs $10 billion in foreign reconstruction aid, but Western nations are reluctant to release aid without political and economic reforms.
 Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Tsvangirai, longtime foes, formed a power-sharing government in February as part of a deal, backed by the regional development community, to end a political crisis that followed disputed elections last year.
 The agreement called for Mr. Tsvangirai to condemn the sanctions and call for them to be dropped, as the development community's 15 member countries have pledged to do.
 But the power-sharing deal has encountered grave problems.
 Mr. Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, has accused Mr. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, of failing to honor an agreement to reverse the appointments of some of the president's political allies to key posts. In turn, ZANU-PF has charged that the Movement for Democratic Change has not done enough to have the sanctions lifted.

HEADLINE: The Fabric of New York

BYLINE: By NANETTE LEPORE and ROBERT SAVAGE. 
Nanette Lepore is a designer. Robert Savage is the president of the Nanette Lepore company.

 BODY:
IT seems like yesterday that we moved to New York City from Youngstown, Ohio. One of us came here to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology, and the other wanted to jump into the art world. We waited tables to make ends meet. With $5,000 in hand, we eventually opened a small office in New York City's Garment Center and began making Nanette Lepore clothing -- designed by one of us, marketed by the other, sold by both. 
 After many years of hard work, we managed to build a successful business. None of this could have happened if not for the garment center -- an area where zoning law protects apparel manufacturing space. 
 The blocks from 34th to 40th Streets between Broadway and Ninth Avenue have been home to America's fashion industry for more than 100 years. But all that could change. The district is in danger of disappearing, with its factories and workers forced out by landlords seeking higher-paying tenants -- a sad prospect on Labor Day (or any other day).
 Mayor Bloomberg is considering a solution that sounds fine on the surface, but we believe would mean the end of the district. Garment manufacturers would be given protected space in a large building or two, and the rest of the area would be up for grabs.
 It's fair to ask why we still need a garment district. But even in the Internet era, proximity offers many advantages. Designers are able to work alongside manufacturers. We can stop by factories to inspect garments, change the fit or correct the sewing. Manufacturing locally, as opposed to overseas, allows us to quickly increase or decrease production, depending on what customers want, and is the only affordable option for young designers with limited resources working on a small scale. 
 More important, in close quarters a mutual respect develops across the chain of production. The people who make the clothes are as passionate as the designers. Both vision and execution benefit from this relationship, and that's why we do 85 percent of our manufacturing within five blocks of our 35th Street office. 
 The city once recognized these benefits, and that's why it passed a zoning law limiting the conversion of the area's factory space to offices in 1987, in an effort to keep garment makers from being priced out (something that had been going on since the district's mid-century heyday.)
 But the city stopped enforcing the law in 1993, and although the Bloomberg administration devoted some new funds to enforcement in 2005, it simultaneously weakened the zoning restrictions. It's easy to see that many landlords still get away with breaking the rules, and we've heard of only one landlord ever getting prosecuted. So floor by floor over the years, manufacturing space has been quietly diverted to other uses, and manufacturing jobs have moved overseas. 
 The city's proposed exchange offers garment manufacturers 280,000 square feet in exchange for freeing the rest of the district from the zoning restrictions, but this is far less space than is needed. Currently apparel manufacturing occupies 16 percent of the area, or more than a million square feet. 
 In February, Mayor Bloomberg called the fashion industry ''a vital part of our city's economy, providing 175,000 jobs and generating billions of dollars annually'' and said that ensuring the industry's success ''is more important than ever as we work to retain and create jobs during these difficult times.'' 
 But the city has done far too little, and giving up on zoning isn't a solution. We need a zoning law that ensures that the space now devoted to garment manufacturing is preserved for that purpose, and we need the city to enforce it. The city should create a board with representatives from the fashion industry to review applications for leases within the zoned area. If an applicant qualifies and is granted a lease, the board should follow up to make sure the business is in fact a garment manufacturer. Misrepresentation should be prosecuted as a criminal violation. 
 If the zoning is lifted, the floodgates will open. Small shops, showrooms and jobs will disappear, along with a national landmark. A statue of an immigrant with a sewing machine stands at the center of this district, honoring the people who came to work here from around the world, and the sidewalks are carved with the names of our designers. American fashion has a rich history. We want to make sure it has a future -- and that depends on preserving New York City's Garment Center.

HEADLINE: Out of Work, Too Down to Search On, and Off the Jobless Rolls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Tatjana Jovanovic-Grove
 Moving From Serbia,
 Scraping By Online
 Tatjana Jovanovic-Grove now occupies her days with arts and crafts projects. She makes a little money selling them online -- $10 here, $50 there -- but mostly it beats the sense of futility that used to envelop her each day during her quest to find a job. 
 ''I stopped looking because that feeling of being rejected again and again is hard,'' she said. ''It's just like somebody punching you in the face.''
 Ms. Jovanovic-Grove, 41, has struggled to find work since she immigrated in late 2005 to the United States from her native Serbia, where she was a biology researcher at a prestigious research institute in Belgrade. 
 She had married an American, Doug Grove, 42, a Wal-Mart mechanic she met over the Internet. The couple initially lived in Glendale, Ariz., with their three children from previous marriages, but they moved to Winston-Salem, N.C., in late 2007.
 They were attracted by the weather and the low crime rate. They also thought Ms. Jovanovic-Grove, who earned a master's degree in Serbia in environmental protection and zoology, would have an easier time finding a job in an area rich with universities. 
 ''I was really thinking I would have no problem,'' she said.
 The need for her to find work became more urgent after the couple took on thousands of dollars in additional debt after they turned their Arizona home over to a bank in lieu of a foreclosure settlement. They had been unable to sell it amid the state's collapsing real estate market. 
 But aside from a few temporary jobs, Ms. Jovanovic-Grove has come up empty on everything from research assistant positions to retail jobs. Meanwhile, her husband's hours at Wal-Mart, where he is paid a little more than $14 an hour, have been cut back. 
 In May, she stopped looking completely, concluding that the job market was saturated. Winston-Salem's unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent. 
 ''You figure out it's just like when you toss a piece of meat at a pack of hungry cats,'' she said. ''I just gave up because I could not compete.''
 Instead, she has turned to making wood handicrafts and selling them on Etsy.com, an online marketplace. The small payments she gets often mean she earns less than fifty cents an hour for her effort. But she reasoned it is better than wasting gas driving around applying for jobs she believes she cannot get.

HEADLINE: Out of Work, Too Down to Search On, and Off the Jobless Rolls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Rick Alexander
 A Builder by Trade
 With Too Much Time
 In the worst case, Rick Alexander figured, he could scrounge up a job at Home Depot. 
 He was a master carpenter, after all. He had skills. He had run his own successful home-restoration business for 28 years. 
 In early 2008, however, he moved to Florida to take care of his ailing parents, leaving his business in Connecticut to his daughter.
 After helping his parents into an assisted-living facility, he began applying for jobs. He devoted eight hours a day to the task, sometimes sending out three or four applications a day. 
 ''It was a full-time job,'' he said.
 At first, he focused on jobs in construction, applying to be a site supervisor. He looked for anything within an hour's commute of where he was living in Jensen Beach. 
 But the real estate industry had fallen off precipitously, bringing building to a near standstill. Mr. Alexander, 58, began branching out to suppliers, applying at lumberyards and other wholesalers. Eventually, he expanded his search to Home Depot, Lowe's and mom-and-pop hardware stores. Finally, he began applying for ''everything under the sun,'' even the overnight shift at convenience stores.
 By that summer, he had still received no callbacks for interviews. He went back to Connecticut for several weeks to do a renovation for an old client to earn some cash. When he returned to Florida in August 2008, he tried to start his own business, selling advertising on video displays mounted in coffee shops and other places. 
 He networked furiously with local businesses, but by then the economy had nose-dived. Mr. Alexander said he grossed a total of $150. He sank into a funk and stopped looking. 
 ''There are thousands of people applying for every job I'm looking at, and potential employers won't even give me the courtesy of acknowledging I applied,'' he said. ''The entirety of that causes me not to bother. It's a waste of my time and theirs.''
 He has applied to just two jobs this year, both several months ago. The unemployment rate in his area, Martin County, now exceeds 11 percent. After prodding from his companion, Dona Olinger, he went down to Home Depot a little over a month ago to re-activate his application there. 
 His savings are gone. He lives with Ms. Olinger, who makes $10 an hour as a volunteer coordinator at a food pantry, Harvest Food and Outreach Center, where they also get groceries every week. It is her salary that pays their rent. 
 Mr. Alexander's parents have since moved out of the assisted-living facility and back into their home, so he tends to them most days. He reads Robert Ludlum novels. He sleeps. To fill his time, he is looking into volunteer work. The other day, he cut the grass on his small lawn using just a pair of clippers.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Volunteering Has Waned in Recession, Report Says'' (news article, Aug. 27): 
 While the Fresh Air Fund is concerned that volunteerism appears to be declining in this recession, it has not been our experience. The Fresh Air Fund has increased the number of volunteers in all our programs.
 In rural and suburban towns outside of New York City, we received hundreds of inquiries from families inspired to play host to our inner-city children for two weeks. During July and August, we sent more children to stay with volunteer host families throughout the Northeast than in previous summers.
 In 2009, hundreds of volunteers have been tutoring and mentoring adolescents in our Career Awareness Program. More children had volunteer tutors this year than ever before. 
 Volunteers are vital for nonprofit organizations, especially during tough economic times, and it is my hope that more people support all causes and missions.

HEADLINE: Despite Slump, U.S. Role as Top Arms Supplier Grows

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Despite a recession that knocked down global arms sales last year, the United States expanded its role as the world's leading weapons supplier, increasing its share to more than two-thirds of all foreign armaments deals, according to a new Congressional study.
 The United States signed weapons agreements valued at $37.8 billion in 2008, or 68.4 percent of all business in the global arms bazaar, up significantly from American sales of $25.4 billion the year before. 
 Italy was a distant second, with $3.7 billion in worldwide weapons sales in 2008, while Russia was third with $3.5 billion in arms sales last year -- down considerably from the $10.8 billion in weapons deals signed by Moscow in 2007.
 The growth in weapons sales by the United States last year was particularly noticeable against worldwide trends. The value of global arms sales in 2008 was $55.2 billion, a drop of 7.6 percent from 2007 and the lowest total for international weapons agreements since 2005.
 The increase in American weapons sales around the world ''was attributable not only to major new orders from clients in the Near East and in Asia, but also to the continuation of significant equipment and support services contracts with a broad-based number of U.S. clients globally,'' according to the study, titled ''Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations.''
 The annual report was produced by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. Regarded as the most detailed collection of unclassified global arms sales data available to the general public, it was delivered to the House and Senate on Friday, ready for members' return from the Labor Day recess.
 The overall decline in weapons sales worldwide in 2008 can be explained by the reluctance of many nations to place new arms orders ''in the face of the severe international recession,'' wrote Richard F. Grimmett, a specialist in international security at the Congressional Research Service and author of the study.
 Mr. Grimmett's report stated that the growth of weapons sales by the United States was ''extraordinary'' in a time of global recession and resulted from new arms deals as well as the sustained cost of maintenance, upgrades, ammunition and spare parts to nations that bought American weapons in the past. 
 In the highly competitive global arms market, nations vie for both profit and political influence through weapons sales, in particular to developing nations, which remain ''the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by weapons suppliers,'' according to the study.
 Weapons sales to developing nations reached $42.2 billion in 2008, only a nominal increase from the $41.1 billion in 2007. 
 The United States was the leader not only in arms sales worldwide, but also in sales to nations in the developing world, signing $29.6 billion in weapons agreements with these nations, or 70.1 percent of all such deals.
 The study found that the larger arms deals concluded by the United States with developing nations last year included a $6.5 billion air defense system for the United Arab Emirates, a $2.1 billion jet fighter deal with Morocco and a $2 billion attack helicopter agreement with Taiwan. Other large weapons agreements were reached between the United States and India, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, South Korea and Brazil. 
 Russia was far behind in 2008 with $3.3 billion in weapons sales to the developing world, about 7.8 percent of all such agreements. The report says that while Russia continues to have China and India as its main weapons clients, Russia's new focus is on arms sales to Latin American nations, in particular to Venezuela. 
 France was third with $2.5 billion in arms sales to developing nations, or about 5.9 percent of weapons deals with these countries.
 The top buyers in the developing world in 2008 were the United Arab Emirates, which signed $9.7 billion in arms deals; Saudi Arabia, which signed $8.7 billion in weapons agreements; and Morocco, with $5.4 billion in arms purchases.
 The study uses figures in 2008 dollars, with amounts for previous years adjusted for inflation to give a constant financial measurement.

HEADLINE: Natural Gas Hits a Roadblock in the Energy Bill

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
The natural gas industry has enjoyed something of a winning streak in recent years. It found gigantic new reserves, low prices are encouraging utilities to substitute gas for coal, and cities are switching to buses fueled by natural gas. 
 But its luck has run out in Washington, where the industry is having trouble making its case to Congress as it writes an energy bill to tackle global warming.
For all its pronouncements that gas could be used to replace aging, inefficient coal-fired power plants -- and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the process -- lawmakers from coal-producing states appear committed to keeping coal as the nation's primary producer of power. 
 Those influential lawmakers, from both parties, say that new technologies under development to capture and bury emissions of coal are a better bet than gas for long-term solutions to climate change.
 The difference of opinion is about more than what is best for the environment, of course. Industry profits are riding on the outcome of the discussion -- a rich mix of politics, environment, science and business.
 A climate-change bill that passed the House in June, intended to cap greenhouse gas emissions, delivered benefits to renewable fuels like wind and solar and strengthened building codes to conserve energy. 
 But the cost of emitting carbon dioxide emissions under the terms of the bill remained at levels that would continue to provide a price advantage for coal in many regions of the country.
 The Senate is planning to begin writing its own bill later this month.
 ''The Senate is more open to natural gas as a transition fuel than the House was,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, ''but the senators from the coal states who are crucial votes are going to want first consideration for coal.''
 The gas industry's leaders say they will descend on Capitol Hill in coming weeks to press their case about the advantage of gas, including that it emits about half the greenhouse gases as coal. 
 The industry has formed a new lobbying group, and it is planning a national campaign that includes television advertising. Executives want fewer allowances for coal. They also want legislation that gives incentives for companies to convert truck fleets from diesel to natural gas.
 ''Never in my life have I been confronted with something so obviously easy and good to do and have such Congressional apathy,'' said Aubrey McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy and a leading voice in the industry. He added that he was still hopeful the Senate can improve the House bill. 
 But the coal industry will also be active. Vic Svec, a senior vice president at Peabody Energy, a large coal company, said coal was still a better fuel because its price is more stable than gas. 
 ''Coal with carbon capture and storage is the low cost, low carbon solution and has fantastic implications for the nation's energy security,'' he said. 
 But it is not only coal-industry lobbyists and their Congressional supporters who favor the concept of carbon sequestration. David Hawkins, a climate change expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said simply replacing coal with natural gas for power generation was ''not a viable strategy'' because that would merely delay climate change by a few decades. 
 ''A coal plant with carbon capture and storage is a cleaner plant than an uncontrolled natural gas plant,'' he said.
 Natural gas gets some benefits from the House bill, which includes a cap-and-trade system that sets limits on emissions of greenhouse gases while requiring manufacturers and utilities to acquire pollution permits.
 Utilities that burn natural gas would earn $30 billion over 10 years in pollution credits that could be sold on the carbon-trading market. But utilities that burn coal will receive tens of billions of dollars worth of free pollution credits, savings that will be passed on to consumers but may serve to delay the closing of some coal plants. 
 The House bill also offers $10 billion for research and development of techniques to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions, which would help keep some coal plants open that might otherwise close.
 The Environmental Protection Agency projects that if the House bill became law, electricity generation from gas would increase by less than 1 percent from 2015 to 2025, while generation from coal would remain nearly unchanged.
 There will be more use of renewables, but power generation as a whole is expected to decline because of conservation efforts, including tightening of building energy codes.
 ''By allowing free emission allowances to maintain coal production from existing coal plants, while providing mandates that there be more wind and solar, you squeeze gas out in the middle,'' said William F. Whitsitt, an executive vice president at Devon Energy, a major natural gas producer.
 Without any new legislation, and if current policies remain in place, gas would beat out coal by a far larger margin, according to E.P.A. projections. 
 There would be nearly 30 percent more power generated by gas by 2025 than in 2015, while coal fired generation would grow by a more modest 7 percent. 
 Many legislators believe that carbon capture and sequestration -- a largely untested system that would bury carbon at power plants so it does not escape into the atmosphere -- can be made to work. 
 Developing the technology was particularly important for any global solution to climate change, since China and India depend on coal for their energy and growing economies, said Paul W. Bledsoe, director of communications and strategy at the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan research organization. 
 Currently, coal provides almost half the electrical power in the United States while natural gas provides more than 20 percent.
 Proponents of natural gas say they can deliver immediate reductions in greenhouse gases, an advantage that should not be discarded for an untested technology. 
 Senate officials and energy officials say it will be difficult to develop legislation that benefits both the gas and coal industries and reduces greenhouse gases.
 Gas executives say their day in Washington will come, especially as more jobs are produced in gas fields that now stretch across 32 states.
 ''The politics of natural gas are going to change dramatically,'' predicted Rodney Lowman, president of the American Natural Gas Alliance, the new gas lobby group. But, he added, ''it won't be overnight.''

In 1982, just as the VHS tape was taking off, a ''Star Wars'' buff named Mitch Lowe had a radical idea. What about building a vending machine that could rent movies? He called his invention Video Droid.
 It failed. People were not yet comfortable using credit cards for casual transactions, the tapes broke easily and the technology involved with manipulating their bulk proved too expensive. 
 But Mr. Lowe did not give up, and his moment seems to have finally come.
 Mr. Lowe, 56, is now the president of Redbox, a fast-growing company in Illinois that rents movies for $1 a day via kiosks. By December, there will be 22,000 Redbox machines in spots like supermarkets, Wal-Mart Stores and fast-food restaurants. 
 Redbox's growth -- it started with 12 kiosks in 2004 and now processes about 80 transactions a second on Friday nights -- has Hollywood's blood boiling. Furious about a potential cannibalization of DVD sales and a broader price devaluation of their product, three studios (20th Century Fox, Warner Brothers and Universal) are refusing to sell DVDs to Redbox until at least 28 days after they arrive in stores.
 Redbox is suing them on antitrust grounds. Leery of waging their own battles, two other studios, Sony Pictures and Paramount Pictures, have signed distribution deals with the vending company. Walt Disney permits third-party distributors to sell to Redbox but has so far shunned a direct relationship.
 Redbox and its vending rivals now have 19 percent of the rental market, compared with 36 percent for rent-by-mail services (Netflix) and 45 percent for traditional stores, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. NPD estimates that vending will grow to a 30 percent share by the end of next year, at the expense of traditional stores.
 Studios, aware that consumers are unlikely to pity their plight and muzzled by the lawsuits, are keeping quiet. Fox, Universal, Warner and Disney each declined to comment for this article. But Hollywood's powerful public relations machinery is in motion behind the scenes to connect the news media with a group that is equally threatened by Redbox but much more relatable: mom and pop rental store owners.
 ''These machines are to the video industry what the Internet was to the music business -- disaster,'' said Ted Engen, president of the Video Buyers Group, a trade organization for 1,700 local rental stores.
 Mr. Engen is enlisting lawmakers to attack Redbox for renting R-rated movies to underage viewers -- the machines simply ask customers to confirm that they are 18 or older by pressing a button -- and trying to rally the Screen Actors Guild and other unions.
 ''It's going to kill the industry,'' said Gary Cook, business manager for UA Local 78, which represents studio plumbers. 
 Mr. Lowe, meanwhile, is portraying the studios as greedy giants scheming to trample the little guy. ''Don't let a few movie studios prevent you from seeing the latest DVDs for an affordable price,'' reads a headline on a new Redbox Web site, savelowcostdvds.com.
 Redbox, formerly owned by McDonald's and now part of Coinstar, is only the biggest of a host of DVD vending companies. DVDPlay, whose kiosks are also red, has been aggressive in California, while MovieCube is big in Canada. 
 Blockbuster is scrambling to introduce its own rental kiosks. There are now about 500 Blockbuster Express machines, and plans call for 2,500 more by the end of the year; the company expects to open 7,000 in 2010, a spokesman said.
 The kiosk boom is fed by several consumer and business currents, all related to the recession.
 For starters, the dismal economy has made people think twice about buying DVDs, especially as the likes of Redbox have made renting easier. Consumers are also tiring of the clutter: The average American household with a DVD player now has a library of 70 DVDs, according to Adams Media Research.
 Over all, DVD sales are down 13.5 percent for the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008, according to the Digital Entertainment Group, a trade organization. Studios say some new titles are selling 25 percent fewer copies than expected. Rental revenue is up about 8 percent over the same period, according to the group. 
 Retailers, struggling to keep people shopping, have realized that having a DVD kiosk in a store creates foot traffic, making it easier for companies like Redbox to sign wide-ranging installation agreements. Some partners, like Walgreens, have offered discounts that essentially make rentals free.
 Redbox is also getting a hand because of Hollywood's troubles. Analysts say Sony and Paramount signed agreements with the company in part because their home entertainment units are under pressure to meet financial targets, set before the DVD decline.
 Sony's five-year deal is worth about $460 million in DVD sales to Redbox. Paramount's deal starts with a four-month test; if the studio decides Redbox represents a net gain to its home entertainment business, it can extend its relationship for five years and a guaranteed $575 million. 
 Paramount's deal involves revenue-sharing, a rarity for Redbox. The kiosk operator primarily follows the mom and pop model: it seeks to buy discs wholesale and makes a profit with repeat rentals. (Revenue-sharing deals typically allow a rental store to buy discs for half the wholesale cost or less.) Redbox can price rentals at $1 and still make money because its machines eliminate so much overhead.
 The $1 price is not the main issue for the studios, although they do not like that, either; it is the timing. New DVDs sell for about $25. Video-on-demand services price them at about $5. Multiday rentals of new titles cost $4.99 at Blockbuster.
 Now there is a $1 option at the same time. That could put downward pressure on the industry's price structure.
 ''Anyone whose business involves selling movies should be enormously concerned,'' said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Research.
 Analysts also see a threat to studios in Redbox's practice of selling about half of its DVDs into the used market (after renting them about 15 times at an average of $2 a transaction). By signing deals with Redbox, Paramount and Sony got the kiosk operator to agree to destroy their discs rather than resell them.
 ''Our position is that this is a strong consumer trend, and we figured out a way to minimize the negative aspects and maximize the positive ones,'' said David Bishop, president of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. 
 Rob Moore, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, said, ''This trial gives us access to information that will allow us to make an informed decision about Redbox's impact on our home entertainment business.''
 Mr. Lowe dismissed worries about the cannibalization of sales. He cited internal research indicating that 20 percent of Redbox's volume is additive -- people who did not previously buy or rent DVDs -- and that partners like Wal-Mart have had only a 1 percent decline in sales after Redbox machines have been installed at their entrances. 
 The kiosks hold about 500 DVDs and focus on new mainstream releases.
 Customers follow a series of touch-screen prompts to use the kiosks, which vend from slots on the side. Once a selection is made, the customer swipes a credit card through the reader. The card is charged a dollar (and tax) for each DVD rented; the charges for additional days, if any, are added when discs are returned. The charge for lost DVDs is $25. 
 ''If you make renting affordable and fun, people are going to watch a whole lot more movies than they did before,'' Mr. Lowe said.

HEADLINE: White House Official Resigns After Flood of G.O.P. Criticism

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Brian Stelter and Sarah Wheaton contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
White House officials on Sunday tersely accepted the resignation of the administration's special adviser for environmental jobs after a number of his past statements became fodder for conservative critics and Republican officials.
 The adviser, Van Jones, a controversial and charismatic community organizer and ''green jobs'' advocate from the San Francisco Bay Area, signed a petition in 2004 questioning whether the Bush administration had allowed the terrorist attacks of September 2001 to provide a pretext for war in the Middle East. 
 He also used a vulgarity to refer to Republicans just before being appointed to his White House post early this year, and he has publicly supported Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is on death row for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer.
 Mr. Jones was a relatively minor figure in the administration, in charge of a small White House program advocating for jobs in energy-efficient industries. But he threatened to become a significant distraction as President Obama is planning a prime-time address on health care to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night in an effort to regain traction on the issue. 
 The timing and manner of Mr. Jones's departure were unusual, coming in a pair of written statements just after midnight Saturday on a holiday weekend after the controversy over him, fueled on conservative talk radio and television, seemed to catch the Obama administration by surprise. 
 Mr. Obama's plan to speak to public school students on Tuesday has also drawn the ire of conservatives, and critics of his health care proposals have vocally expressed their opposition throughout the summer. 
 Mr. Jones's hiring and departure again raised questions about the quality of the White House personnel vetting process and the proliferation of so-called policy czars who are not subject to Senate confirmation or legislative oversight. 
 The Obama administration entered office promising the most thorough scrutiny ever of candidates for senior jobs, including an extensive questionnaire and time-consuming background checks that have left many senior posts vacant for months. But the process seems to have missed Mr. Jones's most inflammatory comments and associations, as well as the tax problems that scuttled the nominations of former Senator Tom Daschle to two top health policy posts and Nancy Killefer as chief performance officer.
 A White House official suggested that Mr. Jones's post was not seen as senior enough to warrant the full vetting given other officials. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the authorized White House account was delivered by administration officials in televised interviews on Sunday.
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama did not endorse Mr. Jones's views and that he had quickly accepted Mr. Jones's resignation so the controversy did not swamp the administration's larger mission.
 ''Well, what Van Jones decided was that the agenda of this president was bigger than any one individual,'' Mr. Gibbs said on ''This Week with George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC. ''The president thanks Van Jones for his service in the first eight months, helping to coordinate renewable energy jobs and lay the foundation for our future economic growth.''
 It was as cool a goodbye as is seen in Washington, intended to put an end to a week of intense criticism of Mr. Jones -- who has been associated with a number of radical protest movements, including one rooted in Marxist theory -- on television and radio talk shows and on the Internet. 
 Chief among those keeping the story alive was Glenn Beck, the conservative host of a Fox News Channel program. Mr. Beck began criticizing Mr. Jones in July, first in segments on his syndicated talk radio show and then, on July 23, on his Fox News program, said Christopher Balfe, the president of Mr. Beck's production company. 
 Mr. Beck, who regularly draws almost three million viewers on Fox News, called Mr. Jones a ''communist-anarchist radical.'' A few days later, Mr. Beck called Mr. Obama a racist on a Fox News show, leading Color of Change, an activist group co-founded by Mr. Jones four years ago, to call on Mr. Beck's advertisers to stop sponsoring his television program. Color of Change says Mr. Jones is no longer affiliated with the group.
 Mr. Balfe emphasized that Mr. Beck had spoken about Mr. Jones's background before Color of Change ''began targeting Glenn.'' In a statement Sunday, Mr. Beck said that Americans had demanded answers about Mr. Jones, but that ''instead of providing them, the administration had Jones resign under cover of darkness.''
 As the advertiser campaign heightened, Mr. Beck devoted more time to Mr. Jones's past remarks. Dozens of advertisers issued statements to distance themselves from Mr. Beck's show in the past month, but Fox said no revenue had been lost.
 Though Mr. Jones, 40, had apologized twice during the week for earlier comments, he was combative in his resignation letter. ''On the eve of historic fights for health care and clean energy, opponents of reform have mounted a vicious smear campaign against me,'' Mr. Jones said. ''They are using lies and distortions to distract and divide.''
 He said he had received numerous calls and notes from supporters urging him to stay and fight. But, he said, ''I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past. We need all hands on deck, fighting for our future.''
 Mr. Jones could not be reached for further comment.
 Mr. Jones's boss, Nancy Sutley, chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, unsentimentally accepted her aide's departure. ''Over the last six months, he has been a strong voice for creating 21st-century jobs that improve energy efficiency and utilize renewable resources,'' Ms. Sutley said in a statement. ''We appreciate his hard work and wish him the best moving forward.'' 
 On Friday, Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican conference, called on Mr. Jones to resign, and Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, called for a hearing on Mr. Jones's appointment. Mr. Obama has appointed more than two dozen special advisers, or ''czars,'' who are not subject to the confirmation process.
 Before joining the Obama administration, Mr. Jones wrote a book on environmental issues called ''The Green Collar Economy'' and co-founded several nonprofit groups, including the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, which promotes alternatives to violence and prisons, and Green for All, which works to bring energy-related jobs to inner cities.
 Former Vice President Al Gore and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, among others, endorsed his environmental work, and he has been a sought-after motivational speaker.
 Howard Dean, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, defended Mr. Jones on Sunday, saying he was being penalized for not realizing what the petition he signed in 2004 was.
 ''This guy's a Yale-educated lawyer,'' Mr. Dean said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''He's a best-selling author about his specialty. I think he was brought down, and I think it's too bad. Washington's a tough place that way, and I think it's a loss for the country.''

HEADLINE: Volunteers Find Muck And Meaning In Service

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: NORTH EAST, Md. 

 BODY:
 On a late summer morning so muggy that merely standing constitutes a workout, nine young adults in drenched T-shirts clear a trail in Elk Neck State Park. Three of them buzz expertly with chain saws through drooping oaks and pines, while six others haul the downed limbs deep into the woods.
 Horseflies and mosquitoes conspire to thwart their labor, but it is the bees, disturbed from a nest, that succeed. Sadie Stone, 24, clearing brush, takes a sting for her country. Then Hilary Griffin, 23, cutting with her chain saw, takes three. The work stops, but only for a moment.
 In the last few months, the combined experience of this team has also included cleaning up the muck after floods in West Virginia, building houses along the hurricane-pummeled Gulf Coast and working with children of low-income families in southern Georgia -- all for about $80 a week and $4.50 a day in meal money, and a $4,725 educational award once they have completed their 10-month hitch. 
 None of them is from Maryland. Ms. Stone, of Northborough, Mass., Ms. Griffin, of Arkport, N.Y., and their colleagues belong to AmeriCorps, whose roots in the American experience deepened a few months ago when President Obama signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act to reauthorize and expand the corps and other national service programs.
 Critics say that these bipartisan programs provide little more than busywork for volunteers; some even see dark forces at play. Michelle Bachmann, a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota, cautioned that they might morph into mandatory ''re-education camps,'' while the conservative commentator Glenn Beck recited the AmeriCorps pledge (''I will get things done for America,'' it begins) on television while wearing lederhosen -- to make either a strained analogy to National Socialism or a daring fashion statement.
 But these critics are fighting a rising tide. According to AmeriCorps officials, applications have nearly tripled in the last year. From November 2007 to August 2008, the agency received 67,283 online applications; from November 2008 to last month, it received 200,682.
 The increase has been so great that AmeriCorps has a prepared statement divining the reasons: the recession, of course; something called the ''Obama effect''; and what it describes as a ''strong altruistic streak among today's young adults.'' 
 Agency officials say that many young people have used the catastrophes of Sept. 11 and Hurricane Katrina as calls to action. Social networks like Facebook have simplified organizing around a particular cause. And high schools and colleges are frequently incorporating community service into the curriculum.
 In describing why they had joined AmeriCorps, these young people clearing a forest trail in work pants, not lederhosen, do not refer to Mr. Obama, or Hurricane Katrina, or the Kennedys. But the reasons they give echo Mr. Kennedy, with a postmillennial flavor. As one of them, Travis Sackett, 24, put it: ''I'm all about community service.''
 His means of service comes through the National Civilian Community Corps, an AmeriCorps residential program for people 18 to 24 years old that specializes in disaster response but also in conservation efforts like their trail work here. It is partly modeled after the long-gone Civilian Conservation Corps, the New Deal initiative that trained millions of the unemployed to preserve the nation's national resources, fighting fires, planting trees and building campgrounds.
 Several months ago, Mr. Sackett and his colleagues mustered with 150 other young people on the sprawling grounds of the V.A. Medical Center in Perry Point, Md., where the corps operates one of its regional campuses. The young people -- each of whom costs the government about $22,200 -- were divided into teams and assigned to run-down houses from World War I that stand a few dozen yards from the Chesapeake Bay.
 Roughly one-third of those enlisted have four-year college degrees, one-third have some college experience, and one-third have completed only high school. Their ranks are overwhelmingly white -- a concern that the corps says it is addressing by intensifying recruitment efforts in the cities its teams work in. 
 The recruits were instructed to keep in shape and to work and live in teams of about a dozen. They were advised to pool their $4.50-a-day meal allowances for groceries, to eat family style, and to work out any interpersonal problems, because there is not a lot of ''personal space'' in the corps. 
 Once training was completed, the recruits stuffed their N.C.C.C.-issue red duffel bags with N.C.C.C.-issue shirts and pants and steel-tipped boots, and waited to be dispatched to somewhere in America, to help. 
 Take wiry Alex Green, now dragging away another downed branch. Growing up in Topeka, Kan., he says, he dabbled in drugs and alcohol and had enough run-ins with the law that ''I saw community service as punishment.''
 Thanks to a nudge, or a shove, from his mother -- she basically signed him up behind his back, he says -- Mr. Green joined the corps a year out of high school and straightened out his life. He built houses in Waveland and Gulfport, Miss., worked on a children's garden in Camden, N.J., and cleaned up after flooding in Hanover, W.Va. Now 20, he is the leader of this elite team of certified firefighters and trained sawyers.
 He hopes to join another AmeriCorps program, because he likes the outdoors and helping people. ''Mother knows best,'' he says of his changed life.
 The crew breaks before noon for the lunch bought with their pooled $4.50 a day. They sit in the bed of a pickup, or on the hot ground, wood chips and leaves flecking their damp arms. They eat leftovers in Tupperware, some nuts, some fruit. The smell of chain saw fuel hangs in the air.
 Here is Laura Dierbeck, 23, from Milwaukee, a college graduate who a year ago was a clerk at a Blockbuster store, and hating it. So far this year, she has worked at a boys-and-girls club in Brunswick, Ga. (where she slept at night on the pool table), and demolished and built houses along the Gulf Coast. She also learned to operate a chain saw, a tool she had never held before.
 ''I wanted to say I'm a girl and I can do it,'' the small woman says. 
 And here is Mr. Sackett, the one who is all about community service. Tall, with long brown hair flowing from under his construction helmet, he is from the upstate New York town of Batavia. He enlisted in the corps shortly after earning a college degree in business administration, and so far he has ripped out ruined sheetrock in flood-damaged parts of West Virginia, put up no-dumping signs above sewer drains in Gainesville, Fla., and been surprised by how much he enjoyed volunteering at a New Orleans soup kitchen. 
 They all seem aware of how goofy it may sound to say, simply, that they want to help their country. But they say it anyway. Ms. Stone, a graphic designer who discovered that she did not like spending her days in front of a computer (''Funny how that works,'' she says), returned from an eight-week tour on the Gulf Coast and promptly got a tattoo. 
 That tattoo is legible on her right arm now as she sits on the ground, eating. ''Be Selfless,'' it says. ''Stay True.''
 Lunch ends, and nine young Americans go back to work.

HEADLINE: Obama Faces a Critical Moment for His Struggling Presidency

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama returned to the White House from his summer break on Sunday determined to jump-start his struggling presidency by reasserting command of the health care debate and recalibrating expectations that some advisers believe got away from him.
 With his honeymoon seemingly over and his White House on the defensive, Mr. Obama faces what friends and foes alike call a make-or-break moment in his young administration. Because he has elevated health care to such a singular priority, advisers said he must force through a credible plan or risk crippling his presidency.
 ''It goes without saying that a lot is riding now on his ability to re-energize the health care debate and bring it home to a successful conclusion,'' said John D. Podesta, who ran Mr. Obama's transition and still advises him on health care, energy and other issues. ''Nothing will influence the perception of the presidency more than whether he can be successful in getting a health care bill through the Congress.'' 
 Recognizing the stakes, Mr. Obama has worked on a strategy for autumn to regain the initiative. He talked on Thursday from Camp David with Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Harry M. Reid, the Senate majority leader. He spent part of Sunday working on this week's speech to the nation and dispatched top surrogates to the talk shows to try to reframe the health care debate. And he has two meetings scheduled for Monday with his health policy and political advisers planned around a trip to Cincinnati to observe Labor Day.
 As much as health care has consumed the president, other vexing issues await him in the fall. In the coming weeks, he will decide whether to order thousands more troops to Afghanistan and pursue new sanctions against Iran. He will host a meeting of the Group of 20 nations to spur the world economy and push forward with arms control negotiations with Russia.
 Now, as he prepares for Wednesday's address before a joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama and his team are simultaneously trying to figure out how they got into this dilemma and how to get out of it. An administration that swept into office just seven months ago on a wave of hope and optimism has burned through good will and public patience in swift fashion and now finds itself under fire from both the left and the right.
 He faces a crisis of expectations tough to manage. Can he form a health care compromise that satisfies both his liberal base and fiscal conservatives in his own party, much less the other one? Can he stanch the slide in support for the war in Afghanistan even as he considers sending more troops? Can he soothe discontent with an economy that appears to have bottomed out but remains moribund? Can he change the tenor of debate in a capital that seems as polarized as ever?
 ''To govern is to make choices, and to make choices is to make some unhappy,'' David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, said in an interview. ''He made some very tough decisions that pulled us away'' from a new Great Depression. ''But he had to expend some political capital to do that. He's expending some capital to do something that's very important, which is to bring security and health care to people who don't have it.''
 Some Republicans said Mr. Obama's fundamental mistake was believing his election presaged a larger ideological shift in the country. ''If they thought that his popularity and the good will he had would support liberal policies, they were wrong,'' said Charles R. Black, a Republican strategist who worked last year for Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Obama's Republican presidential opponent.
 White House officials have signaled that they are prepared to scale back their aspirations for the health care legislation. In private conversations, some said they would be happy even if they end up with a pared-back program that can serve as a basis for future efforts. 
 One element clearly on the table is a proposed government-backed health insurance plan to compete with private insurers. Just as they have in recent weeks, White House officials indicated Sunday that Mr. Obama would continue to push for the so-called public option but they did not make it a condition of signing whatever bill lands on his desk.
 Mr. Axelrod, appearing on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' said the public option ''is a valuable tool'' but added that ''it shouldn't define the whole health care debate.'' Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said on ABC's ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'' that Mr. Obama would ''draw some lines in the sand'' on Wednesday but ''I doubt we're going to get into heavy veto threats.''
 The conundrum for the president, though, was on display during a roundtable discussion later on the same program. Robert Dole, the former Republican senator from Kansas and onetime presidential nominee, said a public option would never pass the Senate. Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California and a leader of Congressional liberals, said no plan could pass with House without a public option.
 Mr. Obama is hardly the first president to run into trouble after the bunting and balloons have vanished, but his slipping support has fueled a narrative about a young and relatively inexperienced president who overinterpreted his mandate and overreached in his policies. His job approval rating has fallen to 56 percent from 62 percent since February in polls taken by The New York Times and CBS News. Other surveys register an even sharper drop. 
 But his overall standing with the public is still healthy, and his first seven months have not been as rocky as those of Bill Clinton or Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Clinton, at least, later recovered enough to win re-election. And Mr. Obama showed during last year's campaign that he has the capacity to ride out rough moments. If he ultimately gets some form of health care program passed that he can call a victory, this turbulence may ultimately be forgotten.
 Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota, said the backlash to Mr. Obama's spending and health care proposals had eroded his support but not fundamentally shifted the nation's politics. ''The American people are sort of returning to where they were,'' he said. ''I don't think they've made a big swing to the right. They're returning to their centrist moorings.''
 Of all the challenges Mr. Obama faces this fall, health care has come to dominate so much that the fate of the rest of his domestic program, particularly climate change legislation and new regulations on the financial industry, may depend in part on whether he wins this fight.
 ''He's gone all in,'' said Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, a Democratic-oriented advocacy organization, using a poker term. ''Everyone's watching. The bets are all on the table. And we're just waiting to see what the cards say.''

HEADLINE: Pace of Change Under Obama Frustrates Unions

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For eight years under George W. Bush, union officials barely set foot inside the White House. But 10 days after President Obama took office, the nation's most powerful labor leaders mingled in the Blue Room, moments after the new president, a man they helped put there, signed a string of executive orders undoing Mr. Bush's policies.
 The mood was euphoric. ''He walked in with the biggest smile,'' James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said of Mr. Obama, ''saying, 'Welcome back to your White House.' ''
 Today that euphoria is giving way to a mixture of frustration and unease, as union leaders are growing concerned that the Obama White House has not delivered as much as they had expected. Some criticize him for not pushing hard enough or moving fast enough on their issues, while others blame the deep recession and Republican opposition for his failure to do more. 
 Mr. Obama has delayed a push for the unions' No. 1 legislative priority, a measure to make it easier for workers to organize. He faces potential conflict with unions on trade, and on how fast to push for immigration reform. And on health care, friction between labor and the White House is suddenly spilling out into the open.
 In response, Mr. Obama is renewing his courtship of the labor movement, whose members worked as foot soldiers in his campaign and spent August doggedly defending his health plan at town-hall-style meetings across the country. On Monday, the president will mark Labor Day by speaking at an A.F.L.-C.I.O. picnic in Cincinnati. During his visit, he is expected to name Ron Bloom, who heads the president's automotive task force, to a second role in the administration as manufacturing czar. The next week, Mr. Obama will address the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Pittsburgh.
 ''He gets an A for effort, and an incomplete for results,'' the incoming president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard L. Trumka.
 While labor leaders, including the current A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, John J. Sweeney, say they remain extremely supportive of the president -- especially his handling of the economic crisis -- Mr. Trumka set off an uproar last week when he warned that unions would not support a health care bill that lacks a government-backed insurance plan. It was a shot across the bow to the White House, which is weighing whether to compromise on the so-called public option. 
 Another top union leader, Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cautioned that if Mr. Obama abandons the public option, ''it will be harder to gin our people up on other issues.'' Mr. McEntee said he had noticed a shift in sentiment even since July, when 14 union leaders spent 45 minutes in the White House Roosevelt Room with the president and top aides like David Axelrod.
 ''He said, 'You've stood shoulder to shoulder with me' -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- 'I want you there, and I'm going to fight for you,' '' Mr. McEntee said. ''When we left, I think we were all on maybe not cloud nine, but cloud four. I shook hands with all the staff, Axelrod was there. This was the person we elected; this was our president with a voice. It felt good.'' And now? Mr. McEntee paused. ''Well,'' he said, ''not as good.'' 
 Blue-collar workers have long been a little bit suspicious of Mr. Obama, who has never quite been able to demonstrate that he is one of them. Still, they stood strongly behind him once he became the Democratic presidential nominee, contributing money, running phone banks and knocking on doors in critical swing states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 The two main labor federations, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Change to Win, said unions and their political action committees had spent nearly $450 million in the presidential race. The addition of Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the ticket as Mr. Obama's running mate helped with his union bona fides. So did the endorsement of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. 
 Today, Mr. Biden continues to play an important role as a link between the unions and the president. But Mr. Kennedy's death is a significant loss, one that may force Mr. Obama to work that much harder to win union support for any health care compromise he might make, said Geoff Garin, a Democratic strategist.
 ''Ted Kennedy was an incredibly important Good Housekeeping seal of approval, and if he lent his prestige to whatever compromise Obama felt he had to make, that would mean an awful lot to people in the labor movement,'' Mr. Garin said. Mr. Obama, he added, must ''persuade labor unions and others that his commitment is to getting it right in the interest of the average working person.''
 He may have an easier time with some than others. Mr. Hoffa, for instance, said the public option was not a make-or-break provision for him; he is open to legislation containing a ''a trigger'' to create a public plan if private efforts to expand coverage fail. Mr. McEntee, by contrast, dismissed the trigger idea as ''not a real public option.'' 
 Dennis Rivera, the point man on health care for the Service Employees International Union, said simply that unions would have to be flexible. ''Politics is the art of the possible,'' he said, adding that Mr. Obama's ''heart is in the right place.''
 Still, there are tensions between unions and the White House on matters beyond health care. Trade is an especially contentious issue; unions are irked that Mr. Obama has backed away from his campaign pledge to reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement. And the United Steelworkers, which represents tire workers, is pressing Mr. Obama to punish China now that the United States International Trade Commission has ruled that China is hurting American manufacturers by inundating the market with cheap tires. 
 Union leaders have also been patient with Mr. Obama, both on immigration (they want legislation offering a path to citizenship for an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants) and the Employee Free Choice Act, the bill to make organizing easier. In the July White House meeting, Mr. Obama made a strong pitch that health care should come first.
 Labor leaders were willing to accept that strategy, said David E. Bonior, a former Michigan congressman who is the chairman of the National Labor Coordinating Committee, an umbrella group. But with Mr. Obama planning a major speech before Congress this week to lay out his priorities in a health bill, Mr. Bonior said, union members want reassurance that he will stick his neck out for their priorities.
 ''They don't want him to leave it up to seven or eight committee chairmen,'' Mr. Bonior said. ''They want him to be the leader and to fight for this stuff.''

HEADLINE: Greed Is Bad, Gekko. So Is a Meltdown.

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
Last Tuesday afternoon, a black Cadillac Escalade arrived at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Lower Manhattan, built in the 1920s to resemble the Renaissance-era palaces of Florence, Italy. From a rear seat stepped a man in a cashmere sweater and dark slacks.
 ''This is where the money is,'' he said, borrowing the words of Willie Sutton, the Depression-era bank robber. ''There is more gold here than anywhere in the world.''
 Look out, Wall Street: Oliver Stone is back. 
 This is familiar terrain for Mr. Stone: his father was a broker, and his 1987 film, ''Wall Street,'' became emblematic of an era of excess the filmmaker thought was fading, but in fact was only beginning. Now he is here to make a sequel, to capture greed on celluloid all over again, set against the backdrop of the financial collapse that began with the fall of Bear Stearns. 
 In a meandering walk through the crooked streets of Manhattan's financial district -- it was a week before shooting of the sequel, titled ''Wall Street 2,'' was scheduled to begin -- Mr. Stone said he never expected high finance to serve again as a tableau for his storytelling.
 ''I thought it was a bubble that was over,'' Mr. Stone said of the 1980s. ''I thought those days were going to come to an end. The excess.''
 Despite his own years of hard living and a peripatetic existence -- he would be heading to Venice in a few days -- Mr. Stone looked refreshed and, at 62, surprisingly young. His original film was a morality tale about greed and unvarnished ambition, and Mr. Stone's own views on the excesses of capitalism were obvious. But the film and its famous lines -- ''Greed is good,'' ''Money never sleeps'' -- have had a cultural endurance that he never expected, and perhaps never desired.
 ''I can't tell you how many young people have come up to me in these years and said, 'I went to Wall Street because of that movie,' '' Mr. Stone said, standing on a street corner between Federal Hall and the New York Stock Exchange. A recognizable face himself, he was stopped only once during the stroll, not by a broker but by a Stock Exchange security officer who wanted to talk about his time in Vietnam. (Mr. Stone is a veteran himself, and directed the 1986 film ''Platoon.'')
 After exchanging words with the officer outside the exchange, Mr. Stone stood in front of the building and marveled at how the culture of finance changed after the original movie. ''It became glamorous to cover Wall Street,'' he said. ''It had not been so before.'' 
 Another aspect of Wall Street that changed -- the financial press -- borrowed some of the glamour of the film's subject. Jim Cramer, the hyperkinetic host of ''Mad Money'' on CNBC and a former hedge fund manager, who certainly did his part to alter the complexion of financial news, will make an appearance in the film. 
 ''There's a line in the old film that kissing her was like reading The Wall Street Journal,'' Mr. Stone said. (It wasn't a compliment back then.)
 The stock exchange, whose hectic trading floor was a frequent image in the first film, will be less prominent in the sequel. Instead the Federal Reserve building, where several important financial meetings took place last fall during the early days of the crisis, will be a more important location.
 ''In the original '87 movie there was no Federal Reserve, we didn't get into that,'' Mr. Stone said. ''But now the world has changed radically. This is part of the bulwark of the system.''
 ''Wall Street'' earned a best actor Oscar for Michael Douglas, who portrayed Gordon Gekko, a ruthless corporate raider whose memorable statements are still quoted on trading floors. (Here's one of many: ''I'm talking about liquid. Rich enough to have your own jet. Rich enough not to waste time. Fifty, a hundred million dollars, buddy. A player.'')
 Mr. Douglas will reprise his role as Gekko, who when last seen by the movie-watching public was headed toward prison for insider trading. 
 ''When Gekko comes out of prison in the beginning of this movie, he essentially has to redefine himself, redefine his character,'' Mr. Stone said. ''He's looking for that second chance.''
 A few weeks ago Mr. Douglas and Mr. Stone ate dinner at Shun Lee, a Chinese restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, with an unlikely companion: Samuel D. Waksal, the founder of the biopharmaceutical company ImClone Systems, who spent five years in federal prison for securities fraud.
 ''That was for Michael to meet a guy who had been in jail,'' Mr. Stone said. 
 Mr. Douglas, in an interview, said actors are often hesitant to make sequels, ''particularly one where I got an Oscar the first time around.'' But he said the magnitude of the financial crisis erased any reservations.
 The continued resonance of Gekko, Mr. Douglas said, has ''probably been the biggest surprise of my career, that people say that this seductive villain has motivated me to go into this business.''
 To this day, Mr. Douglas said, it is a usual occurrence to finish dinner out and have ''a well-lubricated Wall Street businessman come up to me and say, 'You're the man.' ''
 Mr. Douglas added, ''There's an absurdity to it.'' 
 The rest of the cast includes Shia LaBeouf as Jake Moore, a young trader who is the fiance of Gekko's daughter, played by Carey Mulligan; Josh Brolin as the head of an investment bank; Frank Langella as Jake's mentor; and Susan Sarandon as Jake's mother. Charlie Sheen, who played the central role of Bud Fox, a young trader, in the original, will make a cameo in the sequel. Shooting for the film, which will be released by 20th Century Fox next April, begins this week in New York.
 A script for a sequel had been circulating for years, but last year, amid the financial crisis, 20th Century Fox hired the writer Allan Loeb to rewrite the screenplay and tether the story to current events. 
 ''We sort of started over with the story of a young man who is at the center of it, and how he needs Gordon Gekko's help to navigate those waters,'' said Alex Young, co-president of production at 20th Century Fox.
 While Mr. Stone's youth was steeped in the ways of finance, thanks to his father's profession, he did not inherit a facility for such matters. He did poorly in economics at Yale, and turned to filmmaking. He has spent the last several months researching the financial collapse by reading and by meeting with executives and academics.
 Earlier in the summer he brought Mr. LaBeouf to a cocktail party organized by Nouriel Roubini, a New York University economics professor and chairman of a consulting firm, and held in rented space at the Maritime Hotel in Chelsea. There Mr. Stone and Mr. LaBeouf discussed the financial collapse with hedge fund managers who are clients of Mr. Roubini's firm.
 ''In this financial crisis it was the traditional banks and the investment banks that had a larger role in doing stupid and silly things than the hedge funds,'' said Mr. Roubini, who earned acclaim for being early in predicting the financial crisis. (Mr. Stone offered Mr. Roubini a small role in the film as a hedge fund manager.)
 Mr. Stone also had conversations with Jim Chanos, a prominent hedge fund manager who urged him to focus less on hedge funds and more on the banking system. ''There was a much more important story, a bigger story, in what happened with the system,'' Mr. Chanos said. 
 In his first run at Wall Street, Mr. Stone produced characters and a portrayal that lived longer than he ever expected and with unintended consequences. But he never would have made a second version if it didn't appear that the system, and high finance, had finally been brought to its knees.
 ''We wouldn't have done this movie in 2006,'' he said. ''Things were too loose. I didn't want to glorify pigs.''

HEADLINE: Paperless Push Trims Costs And Lightens Backpacks

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: COMMACK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The back-to-school packets sent to all 7,800 students here in this hamlet on Long Island's North Shore grew thicker each year with dozens of pages of notices, fliers and forms -- adding up to more than $12,000 in postage alone last year. 
 But this year, amid a lingering recession and increasing online activity, school officials decided to stop the madness. Teachers and principals were given strict instructions: Limit mailings to a single, first-class envelope per student -- and post the overflow on the district's Web site, in a newly created back-to-school section. The savings: $9,000 in stamps plus $12,000 in salaries for clerks who used to spend up to two weeks assembling the packets. 
 And, for parents like Debra Miller, a shrinking pile of paperwork to keep up with. 
 ''Since the kids have been in school, there's never been a pile less than 12 inches high on my kitchen counter,'' said Mrs. Miller, a mother of two, who shoves the unsightly pile into a cabinet when she has company. ''I can never get out from under the pile, and I'm not alone. We all talk about it.''
 School districts across the country are aggressively cutting back on the avalanche of paper sent home, trying to exploit the much-cheaper communication channel of the Internet. While saving money is often the main motivation, some districts are finding that going paperless has other advantages, like eliminating classroom distractions, informing parents more quickly about test results or swine flu outbreaks, and promoting environmentalism.
 Schools in the Chicago suburb of Naperville have adopted paperless policies and begun a ''take back the backpack'' campaign to cut down on fliers handed out to students. School boards from Georgia to Arizona have switched to paperless meetings, where online agendas and minutes have replaced inch-thick information packets.
 Scarsdale Middle School will no longer print report cards this year -- grades will be available through a secure section of its Web site called the parent portal, which officials said would save $1,000 annually and, they hope, reduce peer pressure over comparing grades. The principal, Michael McDermott, also e-mails his welcome-back-to-school letters, personalizing each one with a student's name and homeroom assignment, rather than the generic ''Dear sixth grader'' printed notes of the past.
 In Ridgewood, N.J., the district's electronic newsletter includes happenings from school board meetings that would have missed the print deadlines. And a listserv for emergency information like school closings is a modern version of the classic school phone tree. ''We're not on there all the time,'' said Debra Anderson, a spokeswoman. ''We take a more conservative approach to using it so that when people do hear from us, they are more likely to open up.''
 But the demise of the time-honored tradition of letters stuffed in backpacks has worried educators and parents who say that some families still do not have regular access to the Internet and may miss important information -- and not even know it. 
 So districts like William Floyd, also on Long Island, have moved cautiously online, posting class assignments and schedules on its Web site but continuing to mail printed copies home. 
 ''We're doing both, with the idea we'll eventually do less paper,'' said Paul Casciano, superintendent of the district, where nearly 40 percent of the 9,700 students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. 
 Dr. Casciano said that many students go online because information is posted several weeks earlier there, but that a few parents expressed concerns about the district's move this fall to an electronic version of the school newsletter, Floyd Features, (estimated savings: $27,000) and electronic notifications about registered sex offenders who live in the area ($25,000). In response, the district will continue to make printed copies available at school offices, but will not send them home.
 Here in Commack, district officials said that less than 5 percent of students qualify for free and reduced lunches and nearly everyone had access to a computer. The drive to reduce paperwork began in April with Backpack News, a section of the district's Web site for posting information about scholarships, activities, PTA fund-raisers and Little League sign-ups. Previously, such fliers were collected at each school's main office, then handed out by classroom teachers once a week to students.
 ''Many parents didn't see that paper anyway because it stayed in their lockers, and at the end of the year, we were wading through paper,'' said James A. Feltman, the superintendent, who added that handing them out took time away from instruction -- by his count, as much as 20 minutes a week, or 800 minutes a year. ''That's at least two full days of instructional time,'' he said.
 While Commack officials say they have received few complaints, some PTA leaders worry that parents can more easily ignore electronic pleas for membership or fund-raising now that they have to find them on the Web site. 
 Still, Maryann Montella, vice president of the PTA at Commack Middle School, said she and other parents had been asking to go paperless because ''we saw the waste of paper.'' The PTA would typically send out 2,000 fliers for a fund-raiser, and get back no more than 100 responses, she noted.
 The electronic mailings have proved popular with computer-savvy students. Erin Storck, 12, who will be a seventh grader at Commack Middle School, said that she used to misplace the sports permission form after opening the back-to-school packet. Now she can just print it out whenever she needs one.
 ''With fliers, you have to go through tons of paper just to find one thing,'' she said, ''and this way you just click on a link and it says exactly what you need.''
 Stephanie Miller, who will be in fourth grade at Burr Intermediate School, said she was happy that the pile of paperwork on the kitchen counter was now about half its usual size. 
 ''It saves trees,'' she said. ''You used to get a piece of paper every day, and it kept getting bigger.''

HEADLINE: Getting a Leg Up on the Sequined Competition

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
Antoine Ashley, 29, a dancer and model, has worked full time for three years as a drag queen known as Sahara Davenport. Originally from Gaithersburg, Md., he went to college in Dallas, where he started performing in drag before moving to New York. He does shows, but also works for Screaming Queens Entertainment, which hires drag queens out as ''ambience girls'' for corporate events and bar mitzvahs. Mr. Ashley's companion also performs as a drag queen, Manila Luzon.
 Starting a drag career: I had to build my name here by doing talent nights, talent competitions and networking and meeting all the working girls and figure out how to work this animal of New York City. The New York scene is so much bigger than in Dallas. In Dallas it's just a strip. It's like, a block. What has helped me: There aren't a lot of girls who dance, who are as refined in dancing. That is what draws people to see me. The dance, and the prettiness. 
 Is it hard making a living as a drag queen? It's hard to make a living as an artist, period.
 The industry in a downturn: A lot of the ambience girls aren't getting as much work because of the recession. Whereas I can do something -- they get more bang for their buck. All my shows are movement-based because of my dance background. I'm having to kick extra high and push harder to survive.
 Work schedule: During the day I'm generally recovering from working at night. I have to be Sahara's manager -- taking class, booking gigs. I also teach during the day, private lessons in dance.
 How did you choose your name? I became part of a drag family, which is where I got part of my last name, Davenport, from. I got the name Sahara from one of my favorite performers at that time, Sierra. I was like, ''I'm black, so I should be the African one, Sahara.''
 Number of wigs: One hundred wigs. You have wigs for characters. You have short wigs, medium wigs, long wigs. I get a deal because one of my best friends makes wigs.
 Which bathroom do you use when you're in drag? When I'm a lady, I'm a lady. Can you imagine walking into a men's room and seeing a beautiful goddess standing at the urinal? It would be as much uncomfortable for them as it is for us. 
 Favorite outfit? I just have this one red-sequined cat suit that looks like a flying squirrel. I saw the sequins in a show on Broadway, and I was like, ''Oh, my gosh, I want something made out of that.''
 On learning his companion was also a drag queen: At first it was like, ''I don't want to date no drag queen.'' I guess it's considered taboo and funny. I always have to set my friends straight and say, ''We're two gay men, and that is why we're attracted to each other.'' We don't kiss in drag usually, it messes up our lipstick. Sometimes I'll try, and she'll be like, ''Get away from me.''
 The benefits: We do double our wardrobe.

HEADLINE: Mixed Returns At Summer Box Office

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Hollywood's crucial summer season delivered near-record revenue, but attendance drooped when an extra week was factored out -- confirming fears that this year's escape-the-recession surge in moviegoing has waned.
 For moviedom's so-called popcorn season, the period between May 1 and Labor Day that typically accounts for 40 percent of annual box office receipts, domestic ticket sales totaled about $4.4 billion on attendance of about 594 million, according to analysts. 
 But this year's summer selling period was a week longer than 2008's, since Labor Day fell so late, skewing seasonal comparisons. When those extra days are lopped off, ticket revenue did climb this year by about 2 percent, to $4.3 billion, but attendance fell, also by about 2 percent, to 572 million. 
 The mammoth success of the summer's top five films -- ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,''''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,''''Up,'' and ''Star Trek'' -- simply couldn't counter a parade of high-profile disappointments like ''Land of the Lost,''''Imagine That'' and ''Funny People.''
 The decline followed a huge surge in winter and spring moviegoing, a phenomenon analysts attributed to a mix of easy, mass-appeal titles like ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop'' and the brutal economic downturn. Americans, teetering between bust and bailout, seemed to want escape, and movies, despite climbing ticket prices, are still a very affordable form of entertainment.
 But moviegoers, aided by booming social networking services that make word of mouth immediate, started to become more discerning about value: films had to be perceived as worth their leisure-time investment.
 ''I think it still just comes down to the product,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst at Hollywood.com, which tracks box office statistics. ''People don't say, 'It's a recession, so I'm going to go see a terrible movie just to get out of the house.' '' Going into the summer, Hollywood.com said, attendance for the year was up about 16 percent. 
 The film business now turns its attention to awards season, and the decline in ticket buying bodes poorly for the months ahead. Studios, as usual, have stuffed the fall schedule with sophisticated adult dramas, a genre that has been particularly shaky at the box office this year.
 Veteran movie executives caution against reading too much into one batch of movies, but the industry always does it anyway. Among the topics being chewed over this year: whether A-list stars have just had a bad run, or whether their ability to draw big audiences is finally kaput, and to what degree the likes of Twitter are wreaking havoc on studio marketing campaigns.
 One clear lesson of summer is that 3-D in general and Imax in particular are no longer a moviegoing afterthought. ''Star Trek,'' ''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian'' and ''Transformers'' all received boosts from premium-priced 3-D screenings. 
 ''We're no longer a rounding error,'' said Greg Foster, Imax's chairman of filmed entertainment.
 Another take-away from recent months involves the international box office. Certain blockbuster-style movies have long performed better overseas. But two movies this summer heightened that phenomenon. 
 ''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' sold $194 million in tickets in North America, but its foreign gross was enormous: $614 million. Similarly, ''Angels & Demons,'' the ''Da Vinci Code'' prequel starring Tom Hanks, was judged a domestic disappointment, with $133 million in sales; overseas, where the film racked up $351 million, it was a different story entirely. 
 The 2009 summer season ended with its traditional Labor Day whimper. ''The Final Destination'' was No. 1 for the second week, with about $15.4 million for Friday through Monday, and a cumulative total of $50.6 million. Second place went to Quentin Tarantino's ''Inglourious Basterds,'' with about $15.1 million and a $95.2 million total.
 The Sandra Bullock comedy ''All About Steve'' opened a lukewarm third, with about $13.9 million. Another new offering, the thriller ''Gamer,'' was a disappointing fourth, with $11.2 million.
 The relatively low-budget science-fiction hit ''District 9'' chugged along in fifth place, selling about $9 million over the long weekend and edging over the $100 million mark to end the holiday weekend with $103.3 million.

HEADLINE: Despite Slowdown, Real Estate Market in Hong Kong Remains Strong

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Even by the standards of Hong Kong's skyscraper-studded skyline, the new International Commerce Center is big. Very big. 
 And in a testament to the strength of one of the world's hottest property markets, it is already nearly fully rented despite the global economic slump.
 At 1,607 feet, the gleaming, nearly complete tower is the tallest building in Hong Kong, with views of the Chinese mainland and the islands off its coast. 
 The 118 stories of the International Commerce Center, or I.C.C., also give it the rank of the world's fourth-tallest building, behind the almost-completed Burj Dubai in Dubai, Taipei 101 in the Taiwanese capital and the Shanghai World Financial Center. 
 It will be about 230 feet taller than the Freedom Tower at the World Trade Center in New York, and about 590 feet above that of the so-called Shard in London, which will be the tallest building in Britain once completed in 2012.
 The I.C.C., which is expected to be completed next year, further cements what has become a tradition in Asia: creating the world's tallest buildings as a symbol of the region's growing economic might.
 In Hong Kong, with its constrained topography and position as one of Asia's leading financial hubs, property prices and rents are high. 
 Sun Hung Kai Properties, the developer behind the I.C.C., says the tower is almost completely leased. The developer locked in three prominent tenants -- Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, in 2007 and 2008 -- long before the I.C.C. was near completion and while rents were still surging. The financial crisis meant that banks needed to find ways to save, and moving across Victoria Harbor from the central business district was attractive. 
 ''There are only certain times in the economic cycle when you can fill buildings like these -- tall buildings, where you need multistory tenants,'' said Paul Katz, president of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the design architecture firm for the I.C.C.
 Flanking the tower as it looks across Victoria Harbor is an array of buildings containing luxury residential apartments, an upscale hotel and a huge marble shopping mall with an ice rink.
 Office rents in the district known as Central -- home of the main business district, which hugs Hong Kong Island's northern flank -- are among the highest in the world, comparable only with those in Tokyo and well ahead of even London and New York, according to statistics compiled by the commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.
 The southernmost tip of Kowloon, on the mainland section of Hong Kong -- one subway stop from Central across the harbor -- has become the main spillover area for top-grade office space. It is here that the I.C.C. is located. 
 Despite the crisis, which threw Hong Kong into recession for much of the last year, vacancy rates in Central are among the lowest in the region -- 6.7 percent, with rents for A-grade offices averaging $11.31 a square foot a month, according to Cushman & Wakefield's latest statistics, for June and July.
 In Tokyo, where only 3.4 percent of such office space is unoccupied, rents average $9.80 a square foot, and in Singapore, the third main financial city in Asia, they are $5.98, with a vacancy rate of 5.1 percent.
 While housing prices languish elsewhere, the Hong Kong property market has almost fully rebounded this year as investors, including many from mainland China, take advantage of low interest rates to snap up apartments. Prices in the segment are near where they were a year ago, according to an index compiled by the Centaline Property Agency. By contrast, in the United States, home prices in major cities are still 30 percent off their peak.
 What makes Hong Kong so extraordinarily expensive -- and has helped Sun Hung Kai, the developer, to fill all but a dozen floors of the International Commerce Center tower -- is that very little new office space is coming available.
 Morgan Stanley committed to the I.C.C. in August 2007 and completed the move, even while construction on the I.C.C.'s topmost floors continued.
 Credit Suisse signed up for 10 stories in December 2007 and expects to have fully moved into the building by 2011. And Deutsche Bank signed up for 12 floors in May last year. 
 A 16-floor, 300-room Ritz-Carlton hotel will inhabit the very top. 
 The prospect for finding tenants for the remaining floors is good, said K. W. Lo of Sun Hung Kai, who is responsible for leasing the I.C.C.
 Despite an improving economy, the office rental market -- in contrast to the buoyant property market -- has stayed subdued. Rents have continued to fall modestly and by some forecasts are likely to continue to do so this year.
 Financial considerations may play a major role in luring tenants to the I.C.C. None of the parties involved divulge details of how much they are paying. But real estate agents say rents on the I.C.C. side of the harbor have been -- and remain -- much lower than in Central. 
 Average rents in the 88-floor International Finance Center, for example, are estimated at about twice those in the I.C.C.
 ''A lot of these banks are still under pressure to cut costs, so it makes sense for them to move,'' Mr. Lo said.

HEADLINE: Britain Convicts 3 in Plot to Blow Up Trans-Atlantic Airliners

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
After two trials and the largest counterterrorism investigation in Britain's history, three men were found guilty on Monday of plotting to bomb at least seven trans-Atlantic airliners on a single day with liquid explosives smuggled aboard in soft-drink bottles and detonated by devices powered with AA batteries.
 The convictions came three years after the global airline industry was thrown into chaos by the plot. The bombers' plan to drain plastic soft-drink bottles with syringes and refill them with concentrated hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent also used as a propellant for rockets, led to new measures prohibiting passengers from carrying all but small quantities of liquids and creams onto flights.
 With those measures still in force and causing backups at airport security checkpoints around the world, the police and intelligence agencies in Britain and the United States had waited anxiously for verdicts in the six-month trial at Woolwich Crown Court in London, where eight men were accused of conspiracy to stage the airliner bombings. 
 Prosecutors said the plot could have killed at least 1,500 people aboard the targeted planes, which by that measure would have made it second only to the Sept. 11 attacks as the most serious terrorist plot in modern history.
 ''Apart from massive loss of life, these attacks would have had enormous worldwide economic and political significance,'' John McDowall, Scotland Yard's counterterrorism chief, said after the verdicts.
 In Washington, the Obama administration praised the verdict on Monday. 
 ''British authorities have worked diligently to investigate and prosecute those involved in the 2006 aviation plot,'' Mike Hammer, a National Security Council spokesman, said via e-mail. ''We congratulate them on those efforts and extend our thanks to the British government for seeing these efforts through to today's conclusion.''
 Last year, a trial failed to reach verdicts on the airliner-bombing charges against the defendants then being tried. So the stakes were especially high in the second trial for the main agencies involved in uncovering the London plot, including Scotland Yard and Britain's secret intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6, as well as the C.I.A., the National Security Agency and the F.B.I., among American agencies involved. 
 The significance was all the greater because there have been no trials yet of anyone directly involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 After arrests in the liquid-explosives case were made in August 2006, documents found at the plotters' homes and on a computer memory stick belonging to the plot ringleader showed that they had earmarked airline schedules for seven flights leaving London for New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, Montreal and Toronto, with aircraft operated by American Airlines, United Airlines and Air Canada. Evidence at the trial showed that the plot aimed to detonate the bombs nearly simultaneously, with the aircraft over the Atlantic.
 The plotters' intent, intelligence officials said, was to show that security measures adopted after Sept. 11 were insufficient to foil the kind of low-technology, ''asymmetric'' attacks favored by Islamic extremists in their war with the West. Evidence at the London trial showed that several of the plotters, like those of Sept. 11, had traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan for indoctrination and training by extremist groups linked to Al Qaeda.
 The jury found three men guilty of conspiring to kill passengers and crew members aboard the flights: Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 28, named by prosecutors as the plot's ringleader; Tanvir Hussain, 28; and Assad Sarwar, 29, who was identified at the trial as the ''quartermaster'' of the plot, responsible for acquiring the explosives, detonators and other equipment and assembling them at a ''bomb factory'' in a London suburb. 
 A total of eight men were in the dock during the six-month trial. Four of the eight -- Ibrahim Savant, 28; Arafat Waheed Khan, 28; Waheed Zaman, 25; and Donald Stewart-Whyte, 23 -- were found not guilty of plotting to bomb the airliners. The eighth man, Umar Islam, 31, was found guilty of an alternative charge of conspiracy to commit murder, the charge on which Mr. Ali, Mr. Hussain and Mr. Sarwar were convicted at the first trial that ended in September 2008.
 The men who were convicted will be sentenced Monday.
 The jury in the second trial failed to reach a verdict on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder in the case of Mr. Savant, Mr. Khan and Mr. Zaman. It acquitted Mr. Stewart-Whyte, who was said by defense lawyers at the trial to have converted from Christianity to Islam only four months before his arrest. 
 The Crown Prosecution Service, responsible for filing charges in criminal cases, said after the verdicts that it would review the jury's failure to reach verdicts in the three cases of conspiracy to commit murder, and decide whether to seek a third trial in the case.
 Scotland Yard officials estimated the total cost of the case at more than $60 million, another factor that weighed heavily as the verdicts came in. Over the weekend, there had been fears the trial would end, like the first, with a hung jury on the key charges of plotting to bomb airliners. As the jury reached the end of a second week of deliberations, the judge called the jurors into court on Friday and told them he would accept 10-to-2 majority verdicts if they were unable to reach unanimous decisions, allowable under British law.
 Behind the scenes, the case caused major strains between American and British intelligence agencies and investigators. The Americans were deeply involved from the start because of the role that American electronic intercepts played in uncovering the plot, and because the principal targets were American planes and passengers. 
 But officials familiar with the case said there were bitter disputes over the arrests in 2006, with the Americans saying they believed that the British, who staked out the conspirators for months, waited too long to round them up, raising the risk of an attack. The British, by contrast, were angered by the American pressure, which they said forced them to make the arrests before they had all the evidence necessary to ensure convictions.
 A major stumbling block at both trials was that British court procedures do not allow the use of intercepted telephone conversations and other electronic intercepts. Television documentaries shown in Britain have included secret police videotapes showing some of the plotters engaged in what appeared to be preparatory work on the bombs at the suburban London bomb factory and discussing the destructive potential of the bombs.
 Mr. Ali and several other defendants testified at the trial that they had never intended to bomb airliners, but planned what they called ''a political stunt,'' involving setting off minor explosions in garbage bins outside airline offices in Terminal Three of Heathrow airport, the London base for the three airlines they earmarked in the flight schedules. Their purpose, they said, was to frighten people, not to kill them.
 But experiments by British explosives experts cited in court found that the bombs the plotters planned to use could blow aircraft apart at 30,000 feet.
 Prosecutors showed the court extensive evidence showing how the men bought material for the bombs, and how some of it, including the hydrogen peroxide, was hidden in woods outside a town northwest of London. The jury was also shown so-called martyrdom videos prepared by two of the plotters, Mr. Ali and Mr. Hussain. 
 A common theme in the videos was exacting revenge on Britain and the United States for their interference in Muslim countries, especially the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 ''We have warned you enough,'' Mr. Ali said. ''We have warned you again and again to leave our lands.'' In his video, Mr. Hussain said his only regret was that ''I can't come back and do this again and again until people come to their senses and realize, 'Don't mess with the Muslims.' ''

HEADLINE: Without a Job, but Working the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Candidates for city office usually scrape by with traditional sorts of volunteers: college students, retirees, the occasional neighborhood activist.
 But this year, a different crowd is landing on their doorsteps: bankers, lawyers, accountants, real estate brokers and other highly credentialed professionals, all of whom have been laid off. They are flooding the offices of even the most obscure campaigns, looking for purpose and fighting off the despondency and isolation that come with being unemployed.
''I was getting into kind of a depression, so to be a volunteer for Eduardo is like a medicine for me,'' said Maria Guillen of Queens, who lost her $100,000-a-year job as a loan officer in December and is volunteering for the City Council candidate Eduardo Giraldo.
 ''The contact with other people, the chance to do something different, the learning experience -- it can all help you out with your emotions,'' she said. 
 Candidates and campaign managers are amazed at the talented new arrivals -- and the intensity and hours they are willing to put in. And while they are cheering for their unemployed helpers to find jobs, they say they would feel a bit bereft without them.
 ''I've been working on campaigns in the city since the '80s, and the number of full-time volunteers who have the ability to help because they are unemployed -- I've never seen it at this level before,'' said the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who is running for a third term against two challengers. 
 ''These are folks who come from all walks of life and are all different ages and are incredibly well educated, well trained, successful,'' she said. ''These are folks who are there from the first thing in the morning until late at night, as opposed to before, when you'd get these folks after work.''
 The work is often mundane: Investment research analysts are now making cold calls to voters, and headhunters are handing out leaflets at subway stations and supermarkets.
 But the experience, coming at a time of crisis in their lives, has been surprisingly powerful for many of them. Volunteering, they say, restores some of what they lost along with their jobs: a place to go every day, a reason to put on a clean suit, people to work beside, a sense of purpose.
 And for some of the jobless, the experience has triggered a profound reassessment.
 Yukyong Choi, 36, a former litigator who has not worked in a year, is now an unpaid volunteer for P.J. Kim, a City Council candidate in Lower Manhattan.
 ''One thing that I've discovered through this process is I don't really want to go back to that life,'' Mr. Choi said. ''That was a life filled with 18-hour days, and having to work with people you may not enjoy. It's not the money anymore; I want to do things that will have a real effect on people's lives, as opposed to just trying to get a company out of a situation.''
 Charles Costanzo used to be a commercial litigator in Manhattan. But after his firm merged with another one late last year, he found himself out of a job -- with a newborn daughter. 
 He was intrigued by Brad Lander, a community organizer in Brooklyn who is running for City Council. So he volunteered. He has offered legal advice, called supporters, canvassed neighborhoods, trained volunteers. He now hopes to work in the nonprofit field.
 ''There was a time of being kind of ashamed and humiliated,'' he said. ''There was a time of, 'I'm never getting a job, what next?' And I would look at the crib, and saying, 'Oh my God,' and going through our savings as opposed to putting money away for college.
 ''But it's an odd blessing. I love the campaign. My wife says that when I come home from canvassing, from volunteering, I'm always in a good mood.''
 Employment counselors say it is easy for the newly jobless to get sucked into a cycle of denial, anger and depression, their days consumed by television and unproductive Internet searches. National surveys indicate that volunteerism during this recession has declined over all. But political campaigns, with their intensity, energy and obvious short-term goals, may be going against that trend.
 ''If you're working to get someone elected, it's always good to be around people who are positive and think the way you think,'' said Michael C. Lazarchick, a past president of the National Employment Counseling Association, who runs a counseling center in Pleasantville, N.J.
 Ms. Guillen said that she has bonded with other unemployed professionals who are regular volunteers for Mr. Giraldo's Council bid. In Ms. Quinn's headquarters, everyone seems to be living vicariously through the job struggles of Alexander Meadows, a 32-year-old pharmaceutical salesman.
 ''It's almost like I've been accepted as part of the family,'' Mr. Meadows said. ''It's very inspiring, especially when you find out that the interviews don't go your way.''
 He is so energized by the campaign that his grooming has improved. ''You shave, you wear the slacks and the shoes, no sandals, and it makes you feel like you're part of something, and that keeps you inspired,'' he said. ''It makes it that much easier to want to get out of bed.'' 
 Sometimes, there are echoes of another life. 
 On Thursday night, Mr. Kim, a 30-year-old Princeton and Harvard graduate who has worked as both a management consultant and an executive for a nonprofit group, and several unemployed volunteers fanned out across Wall Street, handing out literature about his campaign.
 One of the volunteers was Kwadwo Acheampong, a 25-year-old native of the South Bronx who graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and Duke University before landing a job as an equities analyst at Goldman Sachs. He lost his job this summer and moved back in with his family. 
 While handing out the literature, he approached some clean-cut young men to tell them why they should vote for Mr. Kim. Then both he and they did double takes: They were former colleagues from Goldman Sachs.
 ''After you get past the split second of, 'Hey, the last time I saw you, you were in corporate America, and now you're doing politics?' it's O.K., because at least I'm doing something valuable,'' he said. ''But I never thought I'd be here.''

HEADLINE: Leaving Google, Executive To Back Chinese Start-Ups

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Three days after announcing that he was resigning as the head of Google's Chinese operations, Kai-Fu Lee said on Monday that he had raised $115 million to create a company that would finance high-tech start-ups in China. 
 The company, Innovation Works, will search for talented Chinese engineers and entrepreneurs and help them develop the next generation of Internet and mobile computing technologies, Mr. Lee said in an interview by telephone. 
 ''We're going to collect the best ideas, and we're going to hire the best engineers and entrepreneurs,'' he said. ''After one year, we'll send the companies into the open. If they get venture capital funding, great; if they don't, they won't live.'' 
 Innovation Works is being backed by the YouTube co-founder Steve Chen as well as the Foxconn Technology Group, Legend Holdings, the New Oriental Education and Technology Group and the WI Harper Group. Foxconn is one of the world's biggest electronics companies, and it manufactures products including the AppleiPhone and Hewlett-Packard computers. Legend is the parent company of Lenovo, the Chinese computer maker. 
 Mr. Lee, 47, who was born in Taiwan and grew up in the United States, said he was leaving Google after four years because he had simply found a new challenge. 
 He dismissed as ''outrageously wrong'' the notion that his departure had anything to do with Google's difficulties in complying with China's strict censorship rules or with fierce competition from China's leading search engine, Baidu. 
 ''In my career, I've never run away from anything -- I run toward things,'' he said. ''There's clear evidence Google has doubled its market share in China under my leadership. It's on the upturn.'' 
 In a conference call with Peter Liu, chairman of WI Harper, one of the lead investors, Mr. Lee said part of the logic behind forming the company was the lack of early-stage financing of high-tech start-ups in China from so-called angel investors who could provide financing and coaching of young companies. 
 Talented managers now working for technology companies in China are primed to leave those companies to become great entrepreneurs, he said. 
 ''Our experience is in company building,'' he said. ''I can coach them with my many years of experience.'' 
 China is already a hotbed of high-tech growth, with fast-growing Internet companies like Baidu, Tencent, Shanda Interactive Entertainment and Alibaba Group already worth billions of dollars. 
 Venture capital funds are aggressively scouting out new companies that can capture share in what is already the world's largest Internet market, with over 300 million users. 
 Innovation Works recently signed a lease to rent part of a building in Beijing's high-tech district, next to Google's offices, and the company will house its start-ups there. 
 Despite the economic downturn, Mr. Liu of WI Harper said he had no trouble raising the money for Innovation Works. 
 ''We raised the money in less than 30 days,'' he said, and called the hiring of Mr. Lee ''a miracle.'' 
 ''He can identify the next Google in China, or the next Baidu,'' Mr. Liu said.

HEADLINE: Japan's Next Premier Vows to Cut Emissions Sharply

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's presumptive prime minister breathed new life on Monday into efforts to curb global warming, standing by a campaign pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent in the next 10 years from 1990 levels -- a target that environmentalists said puts Japan at the forefront of the fight against climate change.
 Nonetheless, the incoming prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, whose center-left Democrats swept to a landmark electoral victory last month, attached what appeared to be a new caveat to his pledge, saying it was contingent on similarly ambitious goals by other major polluters. 
 That could become a major obstacle because of a deadlock between industrialized and emerging economies over who should bear the most responsibility for emission cuts.
 ''Climate change is already upon us, and its effects are amplifying,'' Mr. Hatoyama said at an environment conference in Tokyo. ''Of course, Japan's reduction targets alone cannot stop climate change. We will seek to build an international framework that involves all major countries and is fair and realistic.''
 He also said, ''The condition for Japan's promise to international society is that all major countries agree to ambitious targets.''
 Japan has been under pressure to set tougher climate policies after its emissions hit a record in 2008, putting the country 16 percent above targets set 12 years ago in the global-warming treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol.
 Even with Mr. Hatoyama's caveat, environmentalists lauded Japan's new reductions target as going significantly further than the goals set by the departing government of Taro Aso, which had been roundly criticized. They also said Japan could help build momentum ahead of a summit meeting on climate change in Copenhagen this year.
 The European Union has promised to cut emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels, and by 30 percent if other wealthy nations follow suit. In the United States, Congress is debating a bill that would reduce emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels.
 Martin Kaiser, climate policy director at Greenpeace International, said Japan's target under the new government was ''the first sign of climate leadership we have seen out of any developed country for quite some time.''
 Yvo de Boer, executive secretary for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also praised Japan, saying its emissions target ''is commensurate with what science says is needed and will catalyze real change in the Japanese economy.''
 Still, Mr. Hatoyama's pledge is expected to face stiff opposition from industrial lobbies, which argue that Japanese industry is already highly energy efficient, and that committing to such steep emissions cuts will hurt an economy struggling through its worst recession in decades.
 A government report issued earlier this year showed that pursuing a 25 percent cut from 1990 levels could hurt important manufacturing industries, threatening almost 90 million jobs and weighing on household incomes.
 Keidanren, Japan's biggest business federation, has said it opposes any cut bigger than 6 percent from 1990 levels. 
 Others call Mr. Hatoyama's targets naive and a threat to Japan's competitiveness.
 ''I don't think Mr. Hatoyama realizes what he is committing Japan to,'' said Tsutomu Toichi, managing director at the Institute of Energy Economics, a Tokyo-based research group. ''He has to realize that this is not a campaign slogan. It's an international pledge to which Japan will be held accountable.''
 Some critics have pointed to other policies in the Democrats' campaign platform that seem to contradict their commitment to reducing greenhouse emissions. The party swept to power on a promise of wide-ranging measures to lift Japan out of recession. 
 To help households, for example, the Democrats have proposed ending highway tolls and a gas surcharge. Environmentalists say such moves could lead to a shift away from public transportation and increase pollution.
 It is also not clear how much of the emissions cuts will come from real reductions in Japan, rather than so-called carbon offsets, which allow governments to pay others to make their carbon reductions for them.
 ''We'll have to monitor how the Democrats balance various policies going forward,'' said Masako Konishi, climate policy adviser to the conservation group W.W.F. Japan. ''But Mr. Hatoyama's ambitions go far beyond anything we've seen in Japan.''
 Experts say Japan's new climate change agenda should press other countries to prepare similarly ambitious targets before the meeting in Copenhagen. Almost 200 countries are expected to attend Dec. 6 to 18 to set worldwide goals for reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutants.
 There is concern, however, that the Obama administration, embroiled in a debate over health care, will not have time to win Congress's support on emissions reductions before the conference.
 Deciding how much wealthy countries like the United States and Japan should cut emissions -- and how much that burden should be borne by emerging economies like China and India, which are big polluters -- will be a major issue in Copenhagen.
 Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a global scientific body, said the new Japanese government could play a leading role in those talks.
 ''With leaders like Mr. Hatoyama attending,'' Mr. Pachauri said, ''there is every reason to believe that we will get a strong agreement in Copenhagen.''

PERSON: Chuck Savitt 

HEADLINE: Environmental Ideas Put in Print With Select Audiences in Mind

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In 1984, Chuck Savitt joined forces with the proprietors of Island Press, a struggling California publishing company with a focus on land use. Aided by like-minded backers, he hoped to identify sharp thinkers on important environmental problems and publish books that made their ideas available to people who could use them. 
 Mr. Savitt was not looking to produce best-sellers. If a book had only a few thousand buyers, that would be fine if they were the few thousand resource managers, regulators or public officials who needed it. The venture would be supported not just by sales but also by foundation grants. It would be nonprofit.
 Things went well for years. Island Press turned out books on arcane topics like grazing management, as well as sweeping policy analyses by prominent figures in environmental policy debates, including former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. 
 When the United Nations convened researchers in a Millennium Ecosystem Assessment of the possible consequences of environmental change, Island Press published their findings. It had become ''the publisher of record in all aspects of the environment,'' according to the eminent biologist E. O. Wilson, who published his autobiography, ''Naturalist,'' there. 
 Now Island Press is in trouble. Sales have stalled. Worse, it is losing some of the philanthropic support that typically provides half its budget. 
 In an interview, Mr. Savitt, who is the president of Island Press, said major supporters, including the Dodge, Packard and Hewlett Foundations, had told him they could no longer provide the operating support they had in the past. 
 ''We at Island Press,'' Mr. Savitt said, ''are facing a kind of crunch.'' 
 In January, the company cut staff to 23 employees from 27, losing an editor and people in marketing, development and information technology. 
 ''I am not very happy about that,'' Mr. Savitt said, adding that he hoped those cuts would be enough.
 Some might argue that Mr. Savitt's original aim -- ''capturing knowledge'' that would otherwise languish unshared -- is obsolete in the Internet age, in which a vast quantity of information is available online.
 But others say the proliferation of material online has made credible sources of environmental guidance all the more important. 
 Findings that people post online can ''look like propaganda,'' said Brian Richter, who heads freshwater programs for The Nature Conservancy and is a co-author of ''Rivers for Life,'' an Island Press book on restoring and preserving natural water flows. 
 The company also lavishes old-fashioned editorial care on its manuscripts. 
 Orrin H. Pilkey Jr., a coastal geologist at Duke University who is a co-author of ''Rising Seas,'' an Island Press book out this summer, praised the ''detailed and thoughtful editing'' the manuscript received from its editor. 
 Mr. Savitt said he went into environmental publishing in the 1980s. He left a job at a foundation to work on a master's degree at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, where he focused on energy and environmental policy. He said he realized that workers in those fields ''produced a lot of information that had the potential to be useful that never saw the light of day.'' 
 When he graduated, he took a job with a nonprofit organization in Washington, where he recalled his colleagues telling him the same thing: ''We produce all this stuff, and it sits in boxes in basements.'' 
 By then, Mr. Savitt said, the original proprietors of Island Press, whom he first got to know in his undergraduate days at the University of California, Santa Cruz, ''were getting ready to go out of business.'' 
 Mr. Savitt worked with Catherine Conover, a conservationist and philanthropist who was a founder of Island Press, to turn it into a publishing house that would focus on environmental problems and their solutions. 
 ''We spend a significant amount of time,'' he said, ''trying to analyze what are the critical issues now and what do we think the critical issues are going to be three, four, five years down the road.'' 
 The company has 800 titles in print and publishes 40 to 45 new titles a year, a schedule Mr. Savitt said he would struggle to maintain.
 Some titles have become environmental landmarks, like those of Gretchen Daily of Stanford, whose work on the intersection of environmentalism and economics, including her Island Press books ''Nature's Services'' and ''The New Economy of Nature,'' have won her international acclaim and major prizes. 
 Others, like a book coming out this fall, ''Ecosystem-Based Management for the Oceans'' might sell 3,500 copies in its lifetime, Mr. Savitt said, mostly to people working or studying in the field. 
 There are those who regard Island Press as banging the drum for environmentalism. Dr. Pilkey recalled a colleague who warned him against taking a manuscript there, saying ''people will assume it is an environmental book and that will reduce its impact.'' Dr. Pilkey said he had not seen that happen.
 Mr. Savitt said the company's aim was ''advancing ideas, not advocacy,'' adding, ''We do not advocate policy.'' 
 He said, for example, that Island Press had published books on property rights by authors from organizations that include Earthjustice, a left-wing group, and the Cato Institute, a conservative research organization. 
 Mr. Savitt said that when he met people and told them he was from Island Press, ''they know who we are and how we have provided the work they used to guide their thinking and how we have defined the fields in which they work.''
 ''It's kind of like, wow,'' he continued. ''If I had any hair left on the top of my head, it would be standing up a couple of times.'' Clare Brauman Ferraro, president of Viking Penguin, said niche publishers like Island Press were important for books generally because they often did a better job on complicated issues than large trade book publishing houses. On the whole, she said, those houses ''are looking for books of general interest for the widest possible audience.'' 
 Publishers like Island Press, she added, ''identify causes, trends, very often before the rest of us, and they can do it with people who may not be obvious trade book authors.'' Mr. Savitt said he had faith in the future of books, as instruments of knowledge. ''Deep ideas have rarely been developed, no matter what field you are going to talk about, outside of a book,'' he said.
 Even so, Mr. Savitt said, he and his colleagues are looking to create an online ''knowledge environment.'' 
 Island Press has worked with researchers to establish organizations that advance the cause of communicating environmental information to the public. One of them is the Communications Partnership for Science and the Seas, an effort initiated by Jane Lubchenco, the marine ecologist who now heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
 Mr. Savitt is also on a hunt for new donors. Dr. Pilkey said he would contribute to that effort as he embarked on promotional talks and other efforts to draw attention to his book, which deals with the threat of a climate-related rise in sea levels. At least one appearance will be for a group including potential donors. ''I am very pleased to do that,'' Dr. Pilkey said.

HEADLINE: Stimulus-Assisted Schools Still Facing Crippling Cuts

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. 

 BODY:
Children are returning to classrooms across the nation during one of the most tumultuous periods in American education, in which many thousands of teachers and other school workers -- no one yet knows how many -- were laid off in dozens of states because of plummeting state and local revenue. Many were hired back, thanks in part to $100 billion in federal stimulus money. 
 How much the federal money has succeeded in stabilizing schools depends on the state. In those where budget deficits have been manageable, stimulus money largely replaced plunging taxpayer revenues for schools. But in Arizona, California, Georgia and a dozen other states with overwhelming deficits, the federal money has failed to prevent the most extensive school layoffs in several decades, experts said.
 When Lori Smallwood welcomed her third-grade students back to school here, it was a new beginning after a searing summer in which she lost her job, agonized over bills, got rehired and, along with all school employees here, saw her salary cut. 
 ''I'm just glad to be teaching,'' Ms. Smallwood said. ''After the misery of losing your job, a pay cut is a piece of cake.''
 In the hard-hit states, the shuffling of teachers out of their previous classrooms and into new ones, often in new districts or at unfamiliar grade levels -- or onto unemployment -- continues to disrupt instruction at thousands of schools. Experts said that seniority and dysfunctional teacher evaluation systems were forcing many districts to trim strong teachers rather than the least effective.
 And in some places, teacher layoffs have pushed up class sizes. In Arizona, which is suffering one of the nation's worst fiscal crises, some classrooms were jammed with nearly 50 students when schools reopened last month, and the norm for Los Angeles high schools this fall is 42.5 students per teacher. 
 ''I've been in public education north of three decades, and these are the most sweeping cutbacks I've seen,'' said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools. ''But it would have been worse without the stimulus.''
 Los Angeles Unified, the nation's second-largest district, sent layoff notices to 8,850 teachers, counselors and administrators last spring. Bolstered by stimulus money, it recently rehired some 6,700 of them, leaving about 2,150 demoted to substitute teaching or out of work. Hundreds of districts across California laid off a total of more than 20,000 teachers, according to the California Teachers Association.
 In Michigan, the Detroit schools' emergency financial manager closed 29 schools and laid off 1,700 employees, including 1,000 teachers. Arizona school districts laid off 7,000 teachers in the spring, but stimulus money helped them rehire several thousand. Tucson Unified, for instance, laid off 560 teachers, but rehired 400.
 Florida's second-largest system, Broward County Schools, laid off 400 teachers, but aided by stimulus money, rehired more than 100. In Washington State, many districts let employees go; Seattle laid off about 50 teachers. 
 Lauren Stokes, who taught high school English last year in North Carolina's Charlotte-Mecklenburg district, was laid off with about 650 of her colleagues. She sought other jobs, but stimulus money sent to the state helped her district hire her and many others back. One disappointment: her classroom this year is a portable trailer. 
 ''But I'm rehired, thank goodness,'' said Ms. Stokes, who is 23. ''I'm looking forward to trying new things out on this year's batch of students.'' 
 Catherine Vidal, a language teacher laid off in May from a high school in Moorpark, Calif., is still out of work. Fifty-nine years old, Ms. Vidal has given up her apartment and is living, for now, on a friend's boat. Teaching has become too iffy, and she will change professions, she said.
 Not only school staff members are feeling the pain, of course.
 ''I struggled this year getting my three boys everything they needed,'' said Mary Lou Johnson, an unemployed office worker who went back-to-school shopping last month at a Wal-Mart in Chamblee, Ga. ''Buying their backpacks, sneakers, all the stuff for their classes -- it nearly cleaned me out.''
 In Ohio, students in the South-Western City district south of Columbus returned to schools with no sports, cheerleading or band, all cut after residents voted down a property tax increase. Stimulus money allowed the district to expand services for disabled students, but it could not save extracurricular programs, said Hugh Garside, the district's treasurer.
 Driving the layoffs was a precipitous decline in tax revenues that left states with a cumulative budget shortfall of $165 billion for this fiscal year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute. About half of the 160 school superintendents from 37 states surveyed by the American Association of School Administrators said that despite receiving stimulus money, they were forced to cut teachers in core subjects. Eight out of 10 said they had cut librarians, nurses, cooks and bus drivers.
 Districts unable to avoid layoffs should seek to do minimum damage by retaining outstanding teachers and culling ineffective ones, said Timothy Daly, president of the New Teacher Project, a nonprofit group. But most districts are simply dismissing teachers hired most recently, because union contracts or state laws protect tenured teachers in most states and because few districts have systems to accurately evaluate teacher performance, he said.
 ''Districts tend to make their problems worse by laying off good teachers and keeping bad ones,'' Mr. Daly said.
 The Hall County district northeast of Atlanta, which has 35 schools, dismissed 100 of its 2,000 teachers, said William Schofield, the superintendent. John Stape, who taught high school Spanish, and his wife, Janie, who taught third grade, were among them. 
 Ms. Stape, 50, is still out of work. Mr. Stape, who is 65 and has a Ph.D., found a job teaching this school year, for less pay, in a rural high school southeast of Atlanta. He said that no administrator had ever observed his teaching before the day he was laid off. 
 ''They didn't know whether I was a good teacher or not,'' Mr. Stape said. Mr. Schofield said the district used student achievement data and professional judgment to identify mediocre teachers for dismissal, but he acknowledged that Hall County had to cut so many teachers that strong ones were let go, too.
 ''We downsized about 50 pretty good folks,'' Mr. Schofield said. The district also trimmed salaries of all district employees by 2.4 percent. Mr. Schofield said he cut his own by 3.4 percent, bringing it to $183,000 this year, and relinquished $23,000 in bonuses. 
 The Hall County schools received more than $18 million in stimulus money, and without it, ''those 100 layoffs could easily have gone to 150,'' he said. 
 Among the Hall County educators helped by the stimulus was Ms. Smallwood, who is 25. After she lost her job teaching kindergarten, she went to her mother's home to cry, then regained her composure and circulated her resume. A principal eventually hired her to teach third grade.
 ''I feel like I'm starting over again,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Bloody Crossroads

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1965, Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Daniel Bell started a magazine called The Public Interest. Their idea was that the great ideological clashes between socialism and capitalism were in the past. In the age of consensus what was needed was a policy journal that would pragmatically weigh costs and benefits.
 But as the years went by, they ran up against the limits of technocratic thinking. They found that they could not escape the murky depths of character, culture and morality. ''At root, in almost every area of public concern,'' James Q. Wilson wrote in the 20th anniversary issue, ''we are seeking to induce persons to act virtuously, whether as schoolchildren, applicants to public assistance, would-be lawbreakers, or voters and public officials.'' 
 The Public Interest closed in 2005, when the last of the original editors, Irving Kristol, retired. It left a gaping hole. Fortunately, a new quarterly magazine called National Affairs is starting up today to continue the work. The magazine, edited by Yuval Levin, occupies the same ground: the bloody crossroads where social science and public policy meet matters of morality, culture and virtue. 
 The first essay concerns a great test of American national character. Today, James C. Capretta argues, America's leaders are in the same position that General Motors's executives were in a decade or two ago. The nation has made a series of lavishly unaffordable promises. The legacy costs are piling up. By the end of 2019, the nation's debt will soar to 82 percent of G.D.P. -- and that's without new programs and before the full fiscal impact of the boomer retirements.
 Creating a new and sustainable middle-class social contract isn't only an accounting matter. It's also a question of responsibility -- whether Americans are willing to face the costs of their choices, and refrain from stealing from their grandchildren. 
 The challenge isn't deciding whether to control spending, but how, in a democratic system, to pull it off. One answer is that we should smash through the special interests and hand power directly to the people. That's been tried in California, and, unfortunately, the consequences are disastrous. As Troy Senik points out in his essay, the California Constitution gives voters relatively direct control over fiscal decisions. The result is that Californians have voted to tax themselves like libertarians and subsidize themselves like socialists.
 California is in a fiscal meltdown. Direct democracy didn't stifle the special interests; it empowered them. Because of union power, California can't fire teachers -- even one who was found with pornography, pot and cocaine in school. California teachers are among the best paid in the country, while the schools are among the worst.
 The other alternative is to concentrate power and let public-policy professionals make the hard choices. But as Wilfred M. McClay argues, even highly trained experts get caught up in manias and groupthink -- as the failure to anticipate the economic crisis shows.
 Luigi Zingales points out that the legitimacy of American capitalism has rested on the fact that many people, like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, got rich on the basis of what they did, not on the basis of government connections. But over the years, business and government have become more intertwined. The results have been bad for both capitalism and government. The banks' growing political clout led to the rule changes that helped create the financial crisis. 
 If we can't trust the people and we can't trust the elites, who can we trust? How can change be effectuated? This is one of the problems National Affairs is going to have to think through in the years ahead.
 Another is: Can the state do anything to effectively promote virtuous behavior? Because when you get into the core problems, whether in Washington, California or on Wall Street, you keep seeing the same moral deficiencies: self-indulgence, irresponsibility and imprudence. 
 Two of my favorite essays in the first issue go right at this problem. Ron Haskins delivers a careful reading of the data on inequality and social mobility and cuts through a lot of the sloppy reporting on this issue. He points out that the surest way to achieve mobility is still the same: get married, get a degree, hold on to a job. ''Poverty in America is a function of culture and behavior at least as much as of entrenched injustice,'' he writes. But how does government alter culture?
 At the end of the issue, Leon R. Kass delivers an unforgettable article on why he decided to give up a career in the sciences to devote himself to the humanities. It nicely captures the spirit of the magazine -- the fierce desire to see the human whole, to be aware of people as spiritual beings and not economic units or cogs in a technocratic policy machine.
 In a world of fever swamp politics and arid, overly specialized expertise, National Affairs arrives at just the right time.

HEADLINE: Keen Eyes Might See What's Missing

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Venus Williams broke through more than a decade ago, tennis officials predicted a far-reaching impact: a deluge of young African-American players from places like Compton, Calif., and Harlem would be playing world-class tennis.
 More than a decade later, Venus and her sister Serena continue to dominate a sport that is still waiting for young African-American women to make the journey from urban areas to the world stage. Why hasn't there been another Venus or Serena? The question is asked during every United States Open, and there never seems to be a plausible answer. 
 ''I've been actually thinking about that, too, and wondering why and looking for them,'' Oracene Price, their mother, said Monday during a telephone interview. ''I was hoping that there would be one following them, but it seems like that hope is kind of fading. It's a disappointment.''
 Price and her former husband, Richard Williams, have presided over one of the great stories in tennis history: the rise of Venus and Serena Williams. Coached by their father, the sisters first played on public courts in Compton, and have grown to dominate women's tennis. But why hasn't their success been duplicated?
 Studies have shown that more African-American girls were attracted to the game when the Williamses did well. Few, however, have stuck with the sport -- fewer still in places where high unemployment and a lack of resources and exposure put the pursuit of a tennis career out of reach.
 ''You hear a name and they never come through,'' Price said.
 Kevin Clayton was hired this year as the United States Tennis Association's chief diversity officer. His mission was to begin an aggressive initiative to attract a larger pool of players that more closely resembles the United States' changing demographics.
 ''Our image as an industry has not really connected to that community,'' Clayton said Monday. ''It hasn't been a focused effort where we've said, 'Tennis is for everybody.' ''
 Clayton said that the U.S.T.A., with the best intentions, would show up in places like Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, put a few rackets in kids' hands and call that diversity. 
 The U.S.T.A. realized that there must be a deeper investment in the communities, targeting potential athletes and forging business relationships. Clayton is reaching out to historically black colleges and universities; African-American fraternities and sororities; and prominent social and service organizations to spread the word about tennis.
 Beyond that, the U.S.T.A. could use the guidance and counsel of two people who broke the mold and created two champions. The organization should formalize its relationship with Oracene Price and Richard Williams. There is not a title broad enough to encompass what they could do, but let's call them Ministers of Tennis, in charge of giving the sport its long-sought-after traction in underserved areas. 
 Price and Williams are divorced, but they have the answers to many questions that have puzzled the U.S.T.A. about bringing large numbers of African-American players -- especially young girls -- to tennis and turning them into champions.
 Williams is more of a training guru, a scout who recognizes talent. Price, as she did with her daughters, could prepare talented young women emotionally for the rigors of world-class tennis. Their greatest challenges would have nothing to do with what takes place on the court. The players Price and Williams find and mentor would enter a world that is largely unfamiliar, often uncomfortable, initially intimidating and hostile -- often without intending to be.
 Price and Williams have helped Venus and Serena negotiate this world and they have done it largely on their own terms.
 ''It's a totally different world,'' Price said. ''And if they don't know how to cope in it and deal with the things they have to deal with, they won't make it.
 ''If they can't stand on their own as women, not reading all their own press, they can't make it.'' They could do the same for an untapped population of players the U.S.T.A. says it wants to target.
 U.S.T.A. programs are commendable and tennis academies are often crucial, but if the Williams sisters have demonstrated anything it is that the major battles are fought and won in the mind.
 ''It's not just programs,'' Price said. ''They have to be trained in their heads. It takes a lot of mental ability. They have to be prepared for the ups the downs -- everything. If they're not willing or able to do that and they're not committed to doing that, then it's going to be difficult.'' 
 People often talk about the economic realities that make tennis seem unattainable for many. Money can be overstated.
 ''There's a way around that,'' Price said. ''You don't have to have the academy that's just a bunch of people hitting balls. Anyone can learn to hit a ball; what's important is what you have behind the ball, and what kind of mind you have when you hit it.''
 Where are the next Venus and Serena?
 Their parents could be pretty good judges of where and how to look.

HEADLINE: When Obama Speaks on Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Let's Get Fundamental,'' by David Brooks (column, Sept. 4):
 Mr. Brooks has it exactly right. Fundamental change in our dysfunctional and overpriced health care system is absolutely necessary, and it will be impossible to achieve that transformation while protecting the huge profits of big corporate contributors to Congress.
 Allowing Congress, itself dysfunctional and unable to look beyond industry lobbyists, to craft a mosaic that reinforces the most expensive and wasteful processes within our present system was a near-fatal mistake. 
 For those of us who fervently supported President Obama as an agent of change, settling for some Band-Aids on the present bloated systems, which focus on profit rather than on health, is a missed opportunity of colossal proportions. Not change we can believe in.
 Ray Bellamy Tallahassee, Fla., Sept. 4, 2009
 The writer is an orthopedic surgeon.
 To the Editor:
 If David Brooks is correct and ''the American health care system is dysfunctional at the core,'' the market solutions he proposes will fix nothing. The current system ''hides information, muddies choices, encourages more treatment instead of better care, neglects cheap innovation, inflates costs and unintentionally increases suffering'' precisely to make profits.
 The only real solution -- one that replaces the profit motive with actually keeping us healthy and operates in most civilized nations on the planet -- has already been taken off the negotiating table by our government-corporate plutocracy, and that is a single-payer system.
 Tom Orange Cleveland, Sept. 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks is right to call attention to the urgent need to ''bend the curve'' in health care, and he highlights many excellent ideas to do so. But I don't agree that President Obama has ignored these issues.
 President Obama has been extremely forceful in his advocacy for serious delivery system reform. The bills pending in Congress have many features that help get us there. The impediment has come from extremists who decry mythical ''death panels'' and make inherently untenable pledges never to reform Medicare.
 Any serious commitment to health care reform across the political spectrum would lead to the changes Mr. Brooks calls for and more.
 David M. Cutler Cambridge, Mass., Sept. 4, 2009
 The writer is a professor of applied economics at Harvard University.
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama to Speak Before Congress on Health Care'' (front page, Sept. 3):
 Jettisoning the public option, as even some Democrats suggest, would kill the cost-saving part of a health care bill. If insurers are going to be obliged to cover pre-existing conditions and insure all who apply, they are going to raise the cost of insurance substantially.
 Democrats should not allow the public option to be tarred as socialist. Public education, by comparison, is socialized. 
 The public option, which could make a reasonable profit that could help Medicare, would insure an honest price for your health care needs.
 Sebastian L. Muccilli Lake Park, Fla., Sept. 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, told the country that President Obama was willing to be a one-term president in order to pass a comprehensive health care reform measure.
 In Wednesday's address, Mr. Obama should back up such bluster with a renewed call for a strong public option.
 I, along with many members of a fickle youthful electorate, will be watching. Remember, Mr. President, you won big in November.
 Kyle Thomas Manchester, Conn., Sept. 4, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Your article indicates that the White House may seek to undermine the school-based health care provision in health care reform. If the aim of health care reform is to reduce inequities in access to health care services and provide more people with a medical home, then school health centers must remain an integral part of the reform.
 School-based health care is an essential component of the health care safety net. Consider that about 70 percent of school health centers report that more than half of their school population is eligible for free and reduced-price school lunches.
 School-based health centers have enjoyed bipartisan support because everyone knows that a healthier child makes for a more successful student. 
 Congress and the president should be working to expand access to medical homes by supporting school-based health care. Otherwise, the message to our children is that the government is foreclosing on their future.
 Dara Tom Oakland, Calif., Sept. 3, 2009
 The writer is communications director for the California School Health Centers Association.
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Roosevelt: The Great Divider,'' by Jean Edward Smith (Op-Ed, Sept. 3):
 Professor Smith's article on Franklin D. Roosevelt as divider could not have been more timely and should be a reminder that Roosevelt's lessons and strategies are just as applicable this month for health care as they were earlier in the year for saving the economy.
 Roosevelt once compared himself to a quarterback who had to call different signals from one play to the next as the game changed, and President Obama the basketball player shouldn't find it too hard to see the analogies in his sport. The opponents of health care reform have figured out how to stop the well-advertised and predictable effort at bipartisanship, and it's time to go with new plays and new tactics.
 As Professor Smith suggests, one of those alternatives is called partisanship. It seems that this generation of Republicans will not bend on health care, so why not try the aggressive strategy? The president's speech on Wednesday should be the start.
 One might even say if you can't join 'em, beat 'em.
 Peter Kovler Washington, Sept. 3, 2009
 The writer served as president of the F.D.R. Centennial Committee in 1982 and chairman of the Committee for Roosevelt History Month in 1996.

HEADLINE: In Michigan, the Disappearing State Fair

BYLINE: By MARY M. CHAPMAN

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Since 1849, Michigan residents have attended the annual state fair, where urban, suburban and farm dwellers can pet Clydesdales, attend rock concerts and watch heifers being born. Barring last-minute support, however, Michigan's State Fair, the nation's oldest, held its last event when it ended its 11-day run Monday. 
 Facing an approximate $1.8 billion state budget deficit, Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm proposed in February ending fair financing after this year, saying the state could no longer absorb its operating losses. Attendance has dropped in recent years, and corporate support has dwindled. 
 Pummeled by the auto industry's economic woes, Michigan had a 15.2 percent unemployment rate, the nation's highest, as of July 17. 
 ''We're facing very, very difficult decisions here in Michigan, and at a time of declining revenues, we cannot be all things to all people,'' Ms. Granholm's spokeswoman, Liz Boyd, said on Monday. 
 Under a bill before the House, the state would continue to cover any fair deficit up to an unspecified amount. Ms. Boyd would not say what the governor would do if the bill passed the Legislature. 
 Last year's fair losses came to $362,000, the former fair manager, Steve Jenkins, told The Detroit Free Press. Mr. Jenkins, who resigned his post after Ms. Granholm's announcement, led a weekend rally to keep the fair open. 
 Other efforts are afoot to keep the fair running. Members of the Michigan State Fair Authority, the fair's governing body, have asked state officials to consider transferring operations to a nonprofit organization. The authority's chairman, Mark Gaffney, said he was optimistic that some private entity would create a redevelopment plan for the fairgrounds that would include keeping the fair open. ''We just need more time,'' he said. 
 Ms. Boyd said that while Ms. Granholm was open to private efforts to continue the fair, she also recognized the value of the property on which it is located -- a 164-acre site along Woodward Avenue near Detroit's northern border, where the fair has been held since 1905. ''It's property that could be developed to create jobs in southeast Michigan,'' Ms. Boyd said. 
 Jaynemarie Hubanks, the finance director for suburban Ferndale, said she had gone to 50 consecutive fairs and particularly enjoyed the crafts and agricultural products. This year's visit was especially poignant. ''I think it's tragic,'' said Ms. Hubanks, 51. ''It's just a huge loss.'' 
 Mr. Gaffney put it another way. ''Kids here grow up in the city and never see a cow,'' he said. ''Here, they not only can see a cow, they can milk it.''

HEADLINE: A Nephew Of Kennedy Will Not Run For His Seat

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Joseph P. Kennedy II announced Monday that he would not seek the Senate seat that his uncle Edward M. Kennedy held for almost 50 years, probably ending for now the family's long and prominent role in Massachusetts politics. 
 Mr. Kennedy, 56, said in a statement that ''after much consideration'' he had decided instead to keep running the Citizens Energy Corporation, a nonprofit company he founded in 1979 to provide heating oil to the poor. His decision clears the way for other Democrats to enter the special election for the Senate seat in the coming days. 
 ''Given all that my uncle accomplished, it was only natural to consider getting back involved in public office,'' Mr. Kennedy, the eldest son of Robert F. Kennedy, said in the statement, which was posted Monday afternoon on the Citizens Energy Web site.
 ''My father called politics an honorable profession, and I have profound respect for those who choose to advance the causes of social and economic justice in elective office,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''After much consideration, I have decided that the best way for me to contribute to those causes is by continuing my work at Citizens Energy Corporation.''
 Mr. Kennedy would not have been a newcomer to politics; he was a member of the House of Representatives from 1987 to 1999, occupying the same seat another famous uncle, John F. Kennedy, won in 1946.
 Joseph Kennedy was a popular congressman, focusing on low-cost housing and veterans' health care and easily winning re-election. But after his first wife publicly fought his effort to annul their marriage and his brother Michael was killed in a skiing accident in 1997, Mr. Kennedy decided to leave office. 
 For the previous two years, he had struggled with the fallout of charges of improper sexual relations between Michael and a teenage baby sitter. Michael had been his campaign manager and had run his company. 
 Friends said that since his uncle's death on Aug. 25, Mr. Kennedy had been agonizing over whether to expose his second wife and twin sons, now 28, to the rigors of a campaign and the questions and attacks that would surely come with it.
 Only one Democrat -- Martha Coakley, the state's attorney general -- has entered the Senate race, but several others will probably jump in now that Mr. Kennedy is not running. Representative Stephen F. Lynch took the first step last week, picking up nominating papers from the secretary of state's office for the election, scheduled for Jan. 19. 
 Other possible Democratic candidates include Representatives Michael E. Capuano and Edward J. Markey, and Martin T. Meehan, a former congressman who is chancellor of the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. Mr. Kennedy's widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, was considered a strong candidate, but family friends say she has ruled out running. A primary is set for Dec. 8. 
 On the Republican side, several state legislators are considering a run. Also, Curt Schilling, a former Red Sox pitcher and an independent who has campaigned for Republicans, has expressed mild interest. 
 It remains unclear whether the state legislature will honor a request that Edward Kennedy made just before his death: to change the law and allow Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, to appoint an interim successor so the seat would not remain empty until the special election. A public hearing on the proposed change is scheduled for Wednesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Buildup: A Necessity?

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Does the United States need a large and growing ground force in Afghanistan to prevent another major terrorist attack on American soil? 
 In deploying 68,000 American troops there by year's end, President Obama has called Afghanistan ''a war of necessity'' to prevent the Taliban from recreating for Al Qaeda the sanctuary that it had in the 1990s. 
 But nearly eight years after the American invasion drove Qaeda leaders from Afghanistan, the political support for military action that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has faded. A war that started as a swift counterattack against those responsible for the murder of 3,000 Americans, a growing number of critics say, is in danger of becoming a quagmire with a muddled mission. 
 In interviews, most counterterrorism experts said they believed that the troops were needed to drive Taliban fighters from territory they had steadily reclaimed. But critics on the right and the left say that if the real goal is to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States, there may be alternatives to a large ground force in Afghanistan. They say Al Qaeda can be held at bay using intensive intelligence, Predator drones, cruise missiles, raids by Special Operations commandos and even payments to warlords to deny haven to Al Qaeda. 
 After all, they point out, the Central Intelligence Agency has killed more than a dozen top Qaeda leaders in the lawless Pakistani tribal areas, disrupting the terrorists' ability to plot and carry out attacks against the United States and Europe. 
 Andrew J. Bacevich, professor of international relations at Boston University, said the alternatives would have at least as much chance of preventing attacks on the United States as a large-scale counterinsurgency effort, which he said would last 5 to 10 years, require hundreds of billions of dollars, sacrifice hundreds of American lives and have a ''slim likelihood of success.'' 
 Despite the Obama administration's assertions that it has a new approach, ''the truth is they want to try harder to do what we've been doing for the last eight years,'' Mr. Bacevich said.
 But most specialists on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, inside and outside the government, say terrorism cannot be confronted from a comfortable distance, such as by airstrikes or proxy forces alone. It may take years to turn Afghanistan into a place that is hostile to Al Qaeda, they say, but it may be the only way to keep the United States safe in the long term. Many agree with the classified strategy for a troop buildup that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan, has presented to Mr. Obama and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in recent days. 
 They say a large American-led NATO ground force is needed to clear Taliban-held territory and hold it while instructors train sufficient, competent Afghan soldiers and police officers to secure those areas. The allied force, the argument goes, will buy time and space to help the Afghans build more effective local, provincial and national governments, and create some semblance of an economy. Since many polls in Afghanistan show little support for the Taliban, a stable, peaceful country would not be likely to become a home for terrorists. 
 The administration's ''clear, hold, build'' strategy is meant to win over Afghans. It is based on the counterinsurgency principle of protecting the population -- or, in this case, at least Afghan population centers -- to win confidence and support, before isolating remaining insurgents to be killed or captured. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have maintained that the United States cannot fight terrorists from afar.
 ''The notion that you can conduct a purely counterterrorist kind of campaign and do it from a distance simply does not accord with reality,'' Mr. Gates told reporters last Thursday. ''The reality is that even if you want to focus on counterterrorism, you cannot do that successfully without local law enforcement, without internal security, without intelligence.'' 
 Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, concurred, saying the argument that terrorism can be prevented essentially by remote control was ''immensely seductive'' -- and completely wrong.
 ''We tried to contain the terrorism problem in Afghanistan from a distance before 9/11,'' he said. ''Look how well that worked.''
 Airstrikes risk killing civilians -- as shown by international concern over the possibility that many civilians were among the scores killed in the NATO bombing of two fuel tankers in northern Afghanistan last week -- and making enemies of the very people American commanders are trying to sway. General McChrystal recently tightened rules on airstrikes to try to avert civilian deaths. 
 Mr. Hoffman said the success of strikes from Predators in killing Qaeda suspects in Pakistan depended on accurate information on terrorists' whereabouts from Pakistani intelligence. In Afghanistan, without such sources, ''we'd be flying blind,'' he said.
 Disengagement from Afghanistan could destabilize Pakistan and ''guarantee'' a future attack on the United States from the region, Mr. Hoffman said. For starters, a pullout could deny the United States bases from which it carries out some Predator missions.
 By all accounts, Pakistan remains the wild card that complicates all predictions on Afghanistan. Proponents of the increased American force in Afghanistan say a withdrawal would reinforce Pakistan's fears that the United States is not committed to security in the region, encouraging an old Pakistani strategy of maintaining ties to Islamic militants. 
 But Daniel L. Byman, director of Georgetown's Center for Peace and Security Studies, said calculations on Pakistan's role were complicated. ''The more we escalate in Afghanistan, the more we depend on Pakistan for logistics,'' he said, ''and the more Pakistan may feel it can resist our pressure to go after the militants.''
 As opposition to the war in Afghanistan builds, some of Mr. Obama's strongest supporters say he must do a better job of explaining how deploying a large American ground force there safeguards Americans at home. 
 ''He needs to reinforce that message more frequently and to the point,'' said Senator Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee who just returned from Afghanistan and Pakistan. ''He hasn't made it enough.''
