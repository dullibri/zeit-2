HEADLINE: For Flint, Mich., Takeover Adds to the List of Woes 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., July 9 

 BODY:
Even in a city used to hard knocks, this has been a bruising year.
 In March, Mayor Woodrow Stanley was recalled by voters frustrated with the city's deteriorating finances, and racial tensions simmered as the Rev. Al Sharpton came to rally support for the mayor, who is black. 
 In May, unemployment rose to 8.3 percent, far higher than even beleaguered Detroit to the southeast. 
Since then, Flint's municipal debt has climbed to nearly $40 million, alarming state officials, who began a review of the city's finances in the spring. Gov. John Engler, a Republican, said the city had no credible plan to turn itself around. Darnell Earley, the city administrator who became acting mayor when Mr. Stanley was recalled, went so far as cutting public ambulance service to try to bring the city's finances under control.
The denouement came on Monday when the state took control of the city's government, stripping elected officials of much of their power. Flint, a city of 125,000, is the largest municipality that has ever been run by the state. 
"I can't say I'm looking forward to it," said Edward Kurtz, a college president who has been appointed the city's financial manager, adding that his chief concern was the debt burden.
"If you have any money," Mr. Kurtz said with a laugh, "we'll take it."
Mr. Kurtz, 59, built the Flint-based Baker career college system from 200 students to 23,000 over more than three decades, creating the state's largest private college. A lifelong resident of the Flint area, he said he took his new job out of civic duty and would not accept pay.
As Mr. Kurtz gets to work, the City Council is challenging the state's action in court. Scott Kincaid, the Council president, said he did not believe a financial emergency existed.
"We're hoping that the court looks at the true financial condition of the City of Flint and determines that the governor appointed a financial manager not based on the city finances but based on some other reasons," Mr. Kincaid said. "We assume they're political."
But the acting mayor, Mr. Earley, a career administrator who is not running in the August mayoral election, said it was time to stop battling the state and to fix the city. 
"We should work towards eliminating this problem and getting beyond it," he said, adding that he hoped to work with Mr. Kurtz.
The state's action was set in motion by the Michigan Senate, which requested a financial review of Flint in the spring. When the city turned over its financial statements to the state, it was revealed that Flint's debt had doubled from June 2000 to June 2001.
The origin of the financial problems can be summed up in two words: General Motors. In the 1970's, G.M. employed 80,000 people in 15 factories here. Now there are fewer than 20,000 workers in three plants.
Little appears to have improved since the 1989 film "Roger and Me," which depicted Flint as a city ravaged by lost G.M. jobs. 
Though downtown is lively enough, the city's problems can be seen just beyond, where decaying factories create an ominous industrial ghost town in some areas. Abandoned apartment buildings, houses and businesses, along with the occasional prostitute, line the north end of Saginaw Street, a main thoroughfare.
"Everybody was like, what are we going to do now?" said Billye Williams, 38, describing the feeling when G.M. started closing plants in the 1980's. 
Mr. Williams had just gotten off a bus after a morning job search and stood next to an abandoned tooling shop. He said his family moved from Kansas in the 1970's, drawn by auto work. When the plants began closing, he said, "I was like, Mom, we should have just stayed in Topeka."
The jobs disappeared as the Big Three automakers faced withering pressure from foreign competitors. That opened plants in the South, where labor is cheap and local law discourages unions. The trend has led G.M. and the Ford Motor Company to move some work overseas. 
But the city bears much blame for its condition because it did not adjust to its rapidly declining tax base and curb spending, city officials and residents said.
The huge job loss "was a terrible warning sign to the leaders of the community," said Joe Conroy, 67, a retired Democratic state senator who was eating lunch at a food court. "More cuts had to be made." 
The job losses "had a devastating effect on our tax base," Mr. Earley said. "The city should have made tough decisions sooner."
Lawrence A. Roehrig, secretary-treasurer of the Flint chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said the state's takeover would stop "a case of absolute denial by the City Council that they've had anything to do with the problems of the city."
But Mr. Kincaid, the City Council president, said the union's resistance to job cuts and privatizing garbage collection hindered efforts to put the city's finances in order. 
"We are trying to protect as many of jobs we can in the city," he said, "but in the waste collection department they've been over their budget by over a million dollars every year for the past several years." 
The end result, said the state treasurer, Doug Roberts, was that the city had never reckoned with its deteriorating tax base.
"Why do you have to have the state come in and tell you that you have a problem?" Mr. Roberts said. "If we don't act now, when do we act?"

Raising School Standards And Cutting Budget: Huh?

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CONGRESS and the president have demanded that states raise academic standards, and every state has now complied. Yet state leaders have also recognized that disadvantaged students need extra help to achieve these higher standards.
 So several states, with some federal aid, have added summer schools, preschools and early childhood services. They have reduced class sizes and raised salaries to attract better teachers. From 1997 to 2002, school spending rose by 12 percent nationwide, after considering inflation and enrollment growth. Much of the increase was intended to help low-achieving students. 
 But now almost every state has a budget crisis. Programs that were added in recent years are either being cut or likely to be cut soon.
As reductions occur, most state and federal officials have ducked an obvious challenge: if programs like summer school and preschool and class size reduction were needed to reach higher standards, does cutting these programs call the standards into question?
A few policy makers have expressed concern. Thomas D. Watkins, Michigan's superintendent of schools, is one. His state has cut $100 million from its summer school and early childhood budgets, including a math and literacy program for 4-year-olds from low-income families. Mr. Watkins insisted that Michigan would not lower academic standards in response. "We don't lower standards in this state," he said.
But he acknowledged that the cuts would probably "raise the odds of not meeting the standards," with more failures and dropouts in the future.
In California, several districts had promised salary increases to attract more qualified teachers to urban areas. But falling revenues have forced these districts to break the promises or cut other programs. The Legislature's budget proposes eliminating monetary rewards for improved schools, dealing a blow to California's accountability system. In Los Angeles, class sizes are growing and the school board has voted to consider cuts in salaries and benefits as well.
Teri Burns, California's deputy superintendent of public instruction, said that next year the budget crisis would be even worse, making even larger classes likely. Like Mr. Watkins of Michigan, Ms. Burns insisted, "We would not consider lowering our standards." But she admitted: "We may have to reconsider how fast we can get there. If we can't provide the resources for schools to meet our expectations, we can't penalize schools for not reaching them."
Kentucky was a leader of the drive for higher standards, but its revenues have also declined. Class sizes are growing, art and music classes are being dropped, teachers' aides are being eliminated. But schools are still expected to meet Kentucky's learning standards. Now, 142 school systems (80 percent of the state's districts) have banded together to determine how much it would cost to meet the standards. The districts' next step could be a lawsuit against the state for its failure to finance the higher standards it requires.
National leaders, too, have not squarely faced the contradiction of wanting higher standards while states cut the dollars needed to meet them. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, took the lead in getting President Bush's education bill passed last winter. Senator Kennedy believed he had a commitment from the president to support more aid to education in return for higher standards, more testing and more accountability.
But the administration endorsed less new money than the senator expected. Last month the Senate defeated a bill, sponsored by Mr. Kennedy, to provide $150 million in emergency spending for summer school programs. The money was partly intended to offset budget cuts that states are making.
Mr. Kennedy has not yet said that sanctions for failure to raise achievement should be postponed until adequate resources are provided. But this would be logical, because proponents of the new education law often cited summer school as a way that higher standards could be met.
In New York, an appellate court ruled last month that the state Constitution only required Albany to finance an education that gets children to eighth-grade achievement levels. But the court did not say whether, the Constitution aside, it is reasonable for the state to adopt tough new Regents standards while failing to pay for smaller classes, better teachers, summer school and early childhood services. Most educators believe that these programs are needed to achieve higher standards in urban districts where low-income students are concentrated.
Higher standards and adequate finances cannot be separated. State budget crises are testing this relationship and, sooner or later, something will have to give. Without more money or lower standards, student failures are bound to increase.

HEADLINE: Robertson Stephens Will Dismiss Half Its Staff to Prepare for Sale 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 9 

 BODY:
Robertson Stephens, the investment-banking arm of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, said today that it planned to lay off half of its staff to reduce costs and allow a sale to employees. 
 A Robertson spokeswoman, Courtney Weber, said the firm, which lost more than $80 million in the last five quarters, would lay off 425 of its 950 employees over the next few months. 
The layoffs will affect all departments of the firm, based in San Francisco. 
 FleetBoston said last week that it expected to lose more than $282 million on the sale. Robertson Stephens management and FleetBoston have been in talks on the sale for weeks. An announcement may come as early as next week, Ms. Weber said. 
The terms being discussed call for management and employees to assume more than $200 million in liabilities and pay no cash for the firm, The Daily Deal reported. FleetBoston announced in April that it was seeking a buyer for Robertson Stephens, which caters to technology companies, after demand for arranging stock sales and mergers for technology companies dried up in the recession. 
Mike McCaffery, who ran Robertson Stephens for seven years before leaving to manage the endowment at Stanford University, will return as a nonexecutive chairman if the management buyout is completed, Mr. Weber said. 
BankBoston purchased Robertson Stephens for $800 million in cash and stock options in 1998 as investments in technology companies soared. BankBoston was acquired by Fleet Financial Group a year later to form FleetBoston.

HEADLINE: 2 Top Officers Quit Elan, Troubled Irish Drug Maker 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, July 9 

 BODY:
The two top executives of the Elan Corporation, the Irish drug maker, resigned today after six tumultuous months of questions about its accounting practices and a collapse of the company's stock price.
 Donal Geaney, 51, gave up the posts of chairman and chief executive, and Thomas Lynch, 45, resigned as vice chairman. The board named a member, Garo Armen, to take over as chairman, but no new chief executive was named. 
 The absence of Mr. Geaney, one of Ireland's best-known executives, from an hourlong conference call today attracted little comment, because the analysts and investors on the call were much more concerned about Elan's ability to stay solvent. Dr. Armen told them Elan would raise $1 billion over the next nine months by selling nonessential assets and businesses. 
In Dublin, shares of Elan, which have fallen 96 percent this year, closed unchanged at 2.35 euros; its American depository receipts fell 19 percent, to $1.80. As recently as Jan. 17 they were worth $44.60, and at their peak of $65 last June they gave Elan by far the largest market capitalization in Ireland, nearly as great as all other Irish stocks combined.
Elan now has $1.38 billion in cash, just about enough to cover its major bond payments and other commitments over the next 18 months, including a $959 million payment in December 2003. Another $200 million will be needed by the end of the year to complete product acquisitions that have already been initiated. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have downgraded Elan's debt to junk status.
"The foremost concern in people's minds, we believe, is a liquidity risk," Dr. Armen said in a telephone interview after the conference call. "The best way for us to remove that concern is to shore up our balance sheet."
Dr. Armen made an impression on analysts by fielding almost every question in the hourlong conference call himself, only rarely deferring to the company's chief financial officer, Shane Cooke. But they were disappointed that Dr. Armen did not offer revised earnings forecasts or explain just how he planned to raise the $1 billion.
"There was no sort of sense of strategy," said Eugene Kiernan, head of asset allocation at Irish Life Investment Managers. "It was more battening down the hatches for cash in the short term. They're going to be a forced seller in a weak market."
Dr. Armen said Elan's credibility in the marketplace would grow in line with its cash reserves, and that the company would publish new forecasts for 2002 within the next few weeks. "At $2 a share, earnings estimates are meaningless," he said.
In February, Elan forecast total revenue for 2002 of just over $2 billion, of which $1.6 billion came from product revenue. Net earnings were forecast to be $1.55 to $1.65 a share, or $570 million and $610 million over all, down from $696.5 million in 2001.
"People were questioning those figures that same afternoon," Mr. Kiernan said.
More recently, investors and analysts have called into question practices that even the company acknowledged were "aggressive accounting." To spread the risks of product development, Elan created 55 different joint ventures and partnerships, and did little to make the consequences clear to investors. Dr. Armen acknowledged today that Elan would have to write down the value of those ventures by $600 million in the second quarter.
Only recently did Elan reveal that it had been selling the rights to future royalties on some of its top products since 2000. It has the right to buy them back now for $550 million, but the terms of the sale call for the price to increase 25 percent a year. And analysts have asked whether the companies that bought the royalties are truly independent of Elan, raising echoes of the Enron debacle.
The company's practice of consolidating the ventures' results in its income statement but leaving them off its balance sheet prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to begin an investigation into its accounting in February. 
The company's product line has also run into trouble. It had to halt tests of an eagerly awaited drug for Alzheimer's disease in January after some patients developed brain inflammation. Over the last few weeks, the Food and Drug Administration approved three generic competitors for its best-selling pain management drug, Zanaflex.
Elan has not yet determined how the new competition will erode the product's sales and profits, saying only that it "expects a significant decline." In 2001, Zanaflex accounted for $161.7 million in revenues, or 9 percent of Elan's total.
The company is likely to focus its attention on neurology, pain management and autoimmune diseases. Dr. Armen said that research and development in those areas was "untouchable." Its diagnostics, hospital products and drug-delivery technology businesses are more expendable, Ian Hunter, senior equity analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin, said.
A five-person executive committee headed by Dr. Armen will oversee Elan while a new chief executive is sought, the company said. Mr. Geaney and Mr. Lynch remain on the payroll and will advise the committee on how to restructure the company. 
"There was no fight; there was no ugliness," Dr. Armen said of Mr. Geaney's and Mr. Lynch's resignations. "Because of internal and external factors, they were no longer able to operate effectively."
For most of the last decade, Elan was held up as the epitome of the Celtic Tiger economic boom in Ireland, and seemed to have the staying power that had eluded most Irish technology companies. Founded in 1969 as a specialist in drug delivery systems, the company was the first purely Irish company to list its shares in the United States, in 1984.
Mr. Geaney, a former accountant at KPMG, became chief executive in 1995 and chairman in 1997. Under his leadership, the company became a ravenous acquirer, absorbing 15 companies in six years. Last year, reported revenues reached $1.86 billion, though analysts said that because of the partnerships and joint ventures it was not easy to tell quite what that number meant.
"We want to simplify our balance sheet, and we want to be transparent, so that you don't have to go through 55 footnotes in order to be able to interpret what our cash level is, what our warnings are and what our future looks like," Dr. Armen said.
Analysts have said Elan's pipeline of new drugs and its beaten-down stock might make it a takeover candidate, though likely buyers might be scared off by the questions about its accounting. Dr. Armen said the board would entertain any offer of greater value than management thought it could deliver.

Complex Near J.F.K. to Get Building 3

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
With a November completion planned for the first of its two buildings, construction -- accompanied by the intermittent roar of jets taking off from Kennedy International Airport just across Rockaway Boulevard -- is set to begin next week on the third of what will be a four-building cargo and office complex. 
 The new building, with 178,000 square feet, will be the largest in the $100 million 530,000-square-foot project, the first large-scale development in decades within a three-mile radius of the airport. 
 As was the case with the first two buildings, each of them with about 100,000 square feet of space, construction is to begin on the third structure without a tenant in place, according to International Airport Centers of Highland Park, Ill., the developer. 
The project is on 25 formerly city-owned acres that were once part of a municipal landfill. Financing came from the developer's own equity and private sources, and New York City provided property-tax and other incentives that are expected to have a value of $37 million over 25 years. 
Building without a tenant may seem like a big gamble at a time when the economy is less than robust and airports are still reeling from the events of Sept. 11. But Jacob Citrin, managing director at the development company, said that while leasing at the project had been affected by those factors, the long-term trends were in his company's favor. Construction began last August and the first tenant in the initial two buildings signed on in January. 
"With the globalization of businesses and improvements at J.F.K.," Mr. Citrin said, "there will be a continued need for such space." And, he added, while some companies that were prospective tenants no longer exist or are considering half the amount of space they initially contemplated, others are willing to take twice as much. 
Some potential tenants also are repeat customers for his company, which started in 1995 with the idea of building projects near leading international airports and serving tenants that want multiple locations. Beyond the New York project, the company has six others, totaling 4.5 million square feet. The largest are in Los Angeles, with a million square feet of space, and in Detroit, with 900,000. 
In the last year the vacancy rate in the 4.5-million-square-foot Kennedy airport market rose to 6.5 percent from 4 percent, according to Reid Berch, a senior director at the Long Island office of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services firm. Much of the available space is in 20- to 30-year-old buildings, said Mr. Berch, who is the leasing agent for International Airport Centers.
This project "capitalizes on the unmet need for modern buildings near the airport," he added, noting that the first two buildings are collectively 70 percent leased to three tenants. Each is an international logistics company and rents space in at least one of the developer's other projects 
The buildings have ceilings 24 feet high, compared with 12 to 20 feet in older area buildings. They also have 200-foot-long truck courts that enable a 72-foot-long trailer to turn around with ease.
In the past, Mr. Berch said, tenants have gone to other places, including Nassau and Suffolk Counties in Long Island, to find comparable space. The average rent for warehouse and office space in the area is $12 to $17 a square foot a year, depending on age and location, he said, noting that rents at the new Queens development are at the higher end of that scale.
Getting the project to this point has taken six years. In 1998 the New York City Economic Development Corporation selected International Airport Centers to develop the site over others that had answered a request for proposals two years earlier. The company spent the next four years securing approvals and having the site rezoned.
The 25 acres were once part of Idlewild Park, a 200-acre area zoned for industrial use that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey transferred to the city in the 1950's. Ninety of those acres, including the International Airport Centers site, were formerly a landfill that was closed in the 1960's. 
Two decades later the city and Community Board 13, which guides growth in the area, designated the 25 acres for its current use. To meet the community's desire for open space, 110 acres of the site were rezoned and turned into parkland. 
Mr. Citrin said the buildings had been designed with concrete block and metal panel facades and the grounds would be heavily landscaped, giving the complex the look of a suburban business park. And the structures will also have special features like sound resistant windows to reduce plane noise.

HEADLINE: Wyeth Stock Falls 24% After Report 

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Shares of Wyeth, the drug company that makes the top-selling drugs for hormone replacement therapies, tumbled more than 24 percent yesterday after news that a large study had found that women taking one of the company's drugs had a higher risk of breast cancer.
 The hormone replacements are Wyeth's biggest-selling products. Sales of Prempro, the subject of the federal study, and the related products, Premarin and Premphase, generated more than $2 billion in sales last year, or nearly 15 percent of Wyeth's revenue. 
 Some Wall Street analysts said they thought Prempro sales would fall sharply as many women stopped taking the drug. But they said investors might have overreacted by pushing the stock price down so low. Shares of Wyeth dropped $11.94, to $37.30.
Viren Mehta of Mehta Partners, a health care investment firm in New York, estimated that the three drugs now accounted for about 20 percent of Wyeth's market value and said he thought most of the sales of Prempro, which is a combination of estrogen and progestin, could be lost. Prempro had sales of about $732 million last year, according to IMS Health, a health care information company.
But Mr. Mehta noted that the researchers had decided to continue the long-term federal study of Premarin, which contains only estrogen. Premarin sales were $1.3 billion last year.
"The market is reacting as if the products are being pulled from the market," said Rita M. Freedman, a health care analyst at PNC Advisors in Philadelphia. "This is not good news, but it is not a disaster."
Wyeth executives tried to calm investors yesterday, saying the hormone therapies still played a crucial role in treating the symptoms of menopause, which is the main reason women begin taking them.
The directors of the federal study, the Women's Health Initiative, sent letters to the 16,000 participants, telling them to stop taking Prempro. The researchers halted the study after finding a higher risk of breast cancer in women who were taking the drugs compared with those who were taking a dummy pill. 
Dr. Victoria Kusiak, vice president for global medical affairs at Wyeth, said that the risk of breast cancer found in the federal study was actually lower than the risk found in other studies and already stated in the drug's label.

 BODY:
S.& P. 500 Is Dropping Seven Foreign Companies
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is going all-American, and in the process it is producing a little bit of buying power for the struggling market. The S.& P. will drop the seven companies in the index not based in the United States, a move that involved replacing two companies that have been in the index for more than six decades.
 The companies being added are not as large as the ones being removed, and in a world where indexing is a huge investment strategy, that could provide significant buying power for stocks remaining in the index. Floyd Norris: Market Place. Page C11. 

Jackson's Feud With Sony
The pop singer Michael Jackson, left, has depicted Thomas D. Mottola, chief executive of the Sony Music Group, as the devil, waving photographs of the executive scrawled with horns and a pitchfork. He contends that the music business is racist. But it is widely believed in the industry that his new passion for struggling black artists is an attempt to extract concessions from Sony. C2.

HEADLINE: President of the Cleveland Fed to Retire 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9 

 BODY:
The president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve, Jerry Jordan, known for his vocal antipathy to inflation, will retire on Jan. 31, the regional Fed bank said today. 
 The deputy chairman of the Cleveland Fed, Robert Mahoney, will lead a committee to find Mr. Jordan's successor. 
 Mr. Jordan, 60, who took the helm of the Cleveland Fed in March 1992, dissented five times in 1998 when he was on the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee because he wanted to keep monetary policy tighter than other members. 
Mr. Jordan said he was looking forward to spending more time with his family.

HEADLINE: The Corporate Scandals; 
Cleaning Up

 BODY:
Reacting belatedly to the continual reports of malfeasance undermining investor confidence and threatening the economic recovery, President Bush came to Wall Street yesterday to deliver his "clean up your act or else" message to corporate America. He sounded at times like a sheriff, warning of jail time for crooks, and at other times like a preacher admonishing business executives to look deep into their souls before issuing their next quarterly reports. At its core, however, the president's address was disappointingly devoid of tough proposals to remedy underlying problems in accounting, corporate governance and the safety net of federal laws and regulations that is supposed to prevent abuses.
 It was one of those speeches that promise more than they can deliver, which is probably why expectant markets found no reason to rally after Mr. Bush left the lectern. For instance, his call to strengthen enforcement resources at the Securities and Exchange Commission by $100 million sounded good at first blush, but it falls far short of what is needed to revive a critical agency -- one that his administration was merrily weakening until the business scandals hit the headlines. 
 Mr. Bush rightly condemned the glaring conflicts of interest at Wall Street firms whose ostensibly independent research analysts have touted stocks solely because they were investment-banking clients. But it was New York State's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, not the Bush administration, who cracked down on these conflicts.
Mr. Bush missed an ideal opportunity yesterday to vault ahead of the pack and seize command of the reform campaign. He embraced sensible proposals that have already been introduced by others, such as the New York Stock Exchange, and that have already gained traction in response to the accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom and elsewhere. Mr. Bush's endorsement of the stock exchange's new guidelines calling for independent directors and shareholder approval of stock-option plans allowed him to appear bold while actually remaining on the sidelines in the fight to restore the integrity of financial markets and public trust in them.
The president was right in urging companies to ban outrageous loans to executives -- an easy call. But he should also have pushed for re-examining the more complicated issue of how corporations handle executive stock-option grants and finding ways to reflect them realistically as an expense.
The biggest disappointment was Mr. Bush's failure to insist on a forceful reform of the accounting industry. Auditors are the primary guardians of business integrity, and in the recent boom they lost sight of their mandate to serve the public, not company officers. The House passed a weak reform bill in the spring. But the president at best appeared to be equating it with the more meaningful proposal the Senate is currently considering. The Senate bill, proposed by Paul Sarbanes, would establish an independent oversight board for the industry, and place limits on the consulting work auditors can perform for companies. Mr. Bush would have best served the interests of the tens of millions of Americans who want to continue entrusting their retirement savings to the stock market if he had transcended partisanship on this one issue and directed his party's leadership in the House to adopt the Senate's version of accounting reform. 
Establishing a Justice Department task force on corporate fraud is a fine idea, as is Mr. Bush's effort to make corporate insiders personally liable for their misrepresentations, and to make them return ill-gotten gains. Americans no doubt appreciated the president's tough talk about punishing executives who commit crimes. But what they really wanted to hear from Mr. Bush was how he intended to prevent corporate fraud from occurring in the first place. He had little to offer on that score.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Is Jeered at AIDS Conference 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 9 

 BODY:
Jeering protesters today drowned out Tommy G. Thompson, the United States secretary of health and human services, as he addressed the 14th International AIDS Conference here about the Bush administration's global prevention program.
 It was a revival of militancy over issues relating to AIDS seldom seen in the past decade. 
 As Mr. Thompson, the chief of the American delegation here, began his speech this afternoon, about three dozen demonstrators from the audience -- mainly Americans from Act Up, a protest group -- marched onto the stage, blowing whistles and shouting through bullhorns, "Shame! Shame!" Mr. Thompson stopped talking until they retreated. 
Surrounded by security agents, he resumed speaking. But the protesters began jeering again, calling on the United States to support protected sex and needle-exchange programs, to spend more for AIDS drugs and to give billions more each year to a global fund to fight AIDS.
The shouting kept the audience of 17,000 from hearing Mr. Thompson. His prepared text said the United States had doubled financing, to $500 million over the next 18 months, for programs "to prevent the transmission of H.I.V. from mothers to infants and to improve the health care delivery systems in 12 African nations and the Caribbean."
"No administration in any nation has ever made fighting H.I.V.-AIDS as high a priority as the United States under this administration," Mr. Thompson said.
It was a day of protests seldom seen since the early years of the AIDS epidemic, when advocates for AIDS patients chained themselves to doors of drug companies, squirted red liquid at scientists and heckled political leaders. A similar demonstration in 1990 prevented participants at the International AIDS Conference in San Francisco from hearing Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, who was secretary of health and human services in the last Bush administration. Dr. Sullivan was near the front of the room for Mr. Thompson's speech.
At this conference, international AIDS leaders like Dr. Peter Piot, an assistant director general of the United Nations and chief of its AIDS program, have been urging the public to demand greater accountability from their governments in battling the epidemic. On Sunday, Dr. Ronald O. Valdiserri, a senior AIDS official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called on Americans "to revive the passion with which the U.S. once faced the H.I.V. epidemic."
But today Dr. Piot was among the leaders who assailed the protesters for not allowing the audience to hear Mr. Thompson.
Dr. Piot, who was a political activist in his youth, said in an interview that he supported the concept of protests, "but only after someone has had a chance to speak, and there's no way one can judge what Mr. Thompson wanted to say."
A spokesman for the protesters, Gregg Gonsalves of the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, a social service group, said they represented 12 groups in the United States.
The protesting focused on Mr. Thompson's statement here on Sunday that the Bush administration was committed to reducing the incidence of H.I.V. among American youth by 50 percent by 2010; to redressing racial and ethnic disparities fueling the epidemic in the United States, and to supporting domestic and international programs to reverse the epidemic.
Protesters called those promises hollow, saying in a news release that the administration was "attacking science-based prevention programs that talk frankly about sex and supporting abstinence-only prevention programs."
Mr. Thompson criticized the protesters as "closed-minded." In a telephone interview from his car as he left the conference center, he said he was "sorry that the militants had to rush the stage instead of listening, but that is their prerogative."
Later, Mr. Thompson talked with 10 protesters for about half an hour in a meeting that had been arranged before their demonstrations, said his spokesman, Tony Jewell.
At a news conference shortly after the demonstrations, a leading American economist, Dr. Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University, called the protests "a reflection of the utter confusion" within the administration about AIDS-related programs.
He said he had gone to the White House several times recently to discuss AIDS with senior staff members, though not with the president. "When I asked for numbers on the costs," he said in an interview later, "I found tremendous confusion, and it results from an absence of a plan."
Dr. Piot, Dr. Sachs and other experts said they expected to present an AIDS plan by October, in time for a board meeting of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, an organization set up at the urging of Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general. 
The White House has budgeted $988 million for worldwide anti-AIDS efforts this year, including $200 million for the global fund. But with Mr. Annan saying the fund needs $10 billion a year, advocates, including American lawmakers, say the United States' fair share is much greater.

HEADLINE: Slouching Towards Populism 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It must be frustrating for the George Bushes.
 They go through all the motions of proclaiming that they're self-made Texas bidnessmen. 
 They become president by acting more red-blooded than blue-blooded.
They whup small, backward countries that brutalize their own people and get dizzying approval ratings. 
And then, after everything they've done, after all the laurels and plaudits, that darn economy gets its knickers in a twist.
And they are hounded by the same old question they have designed their lives to avoid: Can a Bush -- born on third base but thinking he hit a triple -- ever really understand the problems of the guys in the bleachers?
Despite the efforts of W. and Karl Rove to use Poppy's one-term presidency as a reverse playbook, to instead aim for the populist two-term touch of Ronald Reagan, the junior Bush now finds himself combating the same accusations of elitism that cost his father re-election.
By November 1991, with the demise of the blue-collar bard Lee Atwater and the decline of the economy, the rich white guys running the first Bush administration were openly admitting they were in a fog of privilege.
"Bush's idea of solving a domestic problem is to fire the maid and yell at the butler," chortled the Democratic senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
The Democrats are going to town again on Bush obliviousness. America is repulsed by corporate gluttony and accounting racketeering. And the younger Bush must prove that his connection to the common man goes deeper than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
The 180-degree turn from "Kenny Boy" to "Book Kenny" is going to be tricky. 
How can Mr. Bush crack the whip on Big Business when he's a wholly owned subsidiary of it? His dynastic ties to business gave him his career in oil and baseball, provided the record-breaking $100 million that made him president, and spawned his C.E.O. administration. 
How can Mr. Bush lecture companies on setting a moral tone, getting tough on accounting practices and ending "malfee-ance," as he calls it, when there are pesky questions about his own windfall at Harken Energy? (His $848,560 stock cash-in made Hillary, the Cattle Queen of commodities trading, look like a piker for only taking home $100,000.)
The president's speech on Wall Street yesterday was a Karl Rove production, making all the right noises, with the reassuring blue "Corporate Responsibility" backdrop. But TV viewers who looked lower on the screen could see the Dow arrow sliding down steadily, off 178 points for the day.
Mr. Rove pushed W. out to the White House press room on Monday so he would not seem to be evading corporate responsibility for himself while preaching it for others.
But the president was acting petulant. When a reporter asked why he did not attend the N.A.A.C.P. meeting in Houston this week, Mr. Bush impatiently brushed off the question, noting that Colin Powell and Condi Rice work for him. So, once you give the estimable Colin Powell a job, you don't need to reach out to the rest of the black community?
Like his father before him, the president resents being challenged -- on his judgment or on his trustworthiness. He just wants the country to take it on faith that he and Dick Cheney, who got filthy rich at Halliburton, and Army Secretary Thomas White, who got filthy rich at Enron, are "good actors," as he puts it. 
Poppy, at some level, always knew and subtly acknowledged that his Texas up-from-bootstraps story line was a pose. He never gave up the summers in Kennebunkport, the preppy threads, the patrician posture, the upward tilt of his chin.
Junior, with his pseudo-James-Dean-in-"Giant" lectern slouch, believes he's the real thing, coated in Midland dust. He sees himself as self-made and anti-elitist. But given his slacker start, he ended up relying even more on family connections for business and political success than his father did.
He bought a dusty ranch in Crawford to show he's not a New England preppy. But he got the money for the 1,600-acre spread by having the famous name of a New England preppy. 
He talks the populist talk, while walking the elitist walk.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Nuclear Waste Site in Nevada Mountain 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9 

 BODY:
The Senate gave final Congressional approval today for the establishment of a nuclear waste repository deep inside Nevada's Yucca Mountain, a pivotal moment in the 20-year search for a home for the radioactive byproducts from the nation's nuclear reactors. 
 Opponents of the site, led by Nevada's senators, were dealt a stinging blow when the Senate voted 60 to 39 to consider the issue, a procedural vote that both sides had said would be the critical test. The Senate then approved the repository by voice vote. 
 The Senate action, coming after years of fierce lobbying and a recent blitz of the airwaves by environmentalists and industry, was a victory for President Bush, who endorsed the repository site in February. It cleared the way for the Energy Department to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license the repository, in the desert 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
The administration's plans call for the repository, 1,000 feet below the peak of Yucca Mountain, to receive high-level radioactive waste shipments of up to 77,000 tons from more than 100 civilian and military nuclear reactors around the country over the next quarter-century, the largest cross-country transfer ever of dangerously radioactive material.
The site is envisioned to open in 2010. But it still faces numerous regulatory and legal hurdles that are likely to delay the opening. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, a Democrat who is the assistant majority leader, vowed that the battle would continue.
"I don't want to be trite by saying I've just begun to fight," Mr. Reid told reporters, "but I'm still not tired."
Mr. Reid said that he would assist in his state's lawsuit against the designation of the site and noted that he could oppose financing for the repository. "We are going to make sure that all i's are dotted and all t's are crossed, which hasn't been done with the jam job of George W. on this issue," he said.
The vote was a defeat for Mr. Reid and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, who also fiercely opposed the site on safety grounds. The two men worked the phones and at a closed-door party lunch made a last plea to fellow Democrats to stand with them.
But they were unable to keep their colleagues in line. Fifteen Democratic senators joined most Republicans to support action on the waste site; among the Democrats was a possible presidential contender, John Edwards of North Carolina. Only three Republicans -- John Ensign of Nevada, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado -- voted to block it from the Senate floor. On Monday, Senators Orrin G. Hatch and Robert F. Bennett, the two Republicans from neighboring Utah who had been holding off on making a decision, declared they would vote for the Nevada site. 
Critics of the plan questioned its safety, asking whether the design would really safeguard water from contamination and protesting that it was unwise to transport waste from sites across the country, particularly when the terrorist threat is high.
"Once people thoughtfully consider the ramifications of moving 77,000 tons of nuclear waste through 39 states, they're going to have a lot of second thoughts about the advisability of doing so," Mr. Daschle said. Supporters of the repository argued that it would be more dangerous to leave waste at temporary sites around the nation. They also called the decision critical for the future of the nuclear power industry, saying the plants were not viable without a permanent disposal site. 
"Nuclear power is a clean, efficient source," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader. "It is being supplied in 39 of our 50 states. We need to deal with nuclear waste."
Mr. Lott called antinuclear forces unrealistic, saying: "There are people in America that don't want nuclear power, that don't want hydropower, that don't want oil. How do they propose that we fuel this growing economy in America?"
In defeat, some Democrats tried to use the vote for further accusations that the administration and Republicans were beholden to corporate interests like the energy industry.
"A lot of special interests are behind this," said Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who protested that the Nevada site risked contaminating her state's drinking water. "Who are we fighting for here?"
Nevada's senators had long acknowledged they faced an uphill fight, particularly because of the issue's regional politics. Lawmakers from states that are heavy users of nuclear power were eager for a permanent storage site far from their own borders. "Nimby," said Mr. Ensign, explaining his difficulty in getting supporters from other Republicans. "Not in my backyard."
The day's Senate vote took place under unusual procedures established in a 1982 act about the site search and subsequent legislation. In highly unusual deference to a state, Congress gave Nevada the power to veto any presidential decision about Yucca Mountain. After President Bush approved the site, Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican, exercised that veto in April. Congress had until late July to sustain or override the veto. The House handily overrode the governor earlier in May.
In the Senate, Mr. Daschle resisted bringing the Yucca Mountain site up for debate; usually, the Senate majority leader controls the floor. But under the rules established in 1982, any senator had the right to call for debate on the issue.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, the ranking Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, brought the measure to the floor for a vote, arguing that the nation could no longer afford delay.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE OVERVIEW; 
Bush, on Wall St., Offers Tough Stance

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
President Bush came to Wall Street yesterday vowing to "end the days of cooking the books, shading the truth and breaking our laws." He advocated legal reforms ranging from longer prison sentences for fraud to a new task force to prosecute corporate malfeasance.
 But critics, including Senate Democrats, said the reforms were not as far-reaching as some of the proposals now gaining steam in Congress. 
 In his first extensive policy speech in months on a subject other than combating terrorism, Mr. Bush tried to quell a growing political storm by asking Congress to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission with $100 million in additional funds to increase enforcement, far less than the increase some in Congress are demanding. He also urged the stock markets to adopt rules assuring that a company's directors are truly independent. Transcript, Page C4. 
"Self-regulation is important, but it's not enough," Mr. Bush said, striking a more aggressive tone than he did in the presidential campaign two years ago, when he regularly urged less government intervention in the economy so that American business would be free to innovate. "In the long run," Mr. Bush told an invited audience of chief executives, investors and city leaders in a hotel ballroom just blocks from the New York Stock Exchange, "there's no capitalism without conscience. There is no wealth without character."
Mr. Bush's speech was striking for the harshness of the criticism he leveled at corporate executives -- a list that clearly includes some of the biggest contributors to his presidential campaign, though he never mentioned a name or a company. But Mr. Bush's 27-minute speech was also notable for the changes he declined to endorse or mention. 
As a result, while chief executives praised the President's speech, saying it would help restore confidence in American business, many professional money managers expressed disappointment that there were not more specific proposals for cleaning up corporate America. Page C1. 
The White House's decision to call for longer prison sentences for anyone convicted of wire fraud or mail fraud appeared to be an effort to defuse a more far-reaching proposal now gaining considerable support in the Senate to create a new category of felony for any "scheme or artifice" knowingly used to defraud shareholders. 
Mr. Bush's aides dodged questions about whether Mr. Bush would support that Senate bill, sponsored by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat. A senior White House official told reporters that Mr. Bush "shares the goals" of the legislation but was troubled by its specifics. Similarly, Mr. Bush said Monday that he was uncomfortable with another provision the Senate was considering that would set up an independent board to regulate the auditors of public companies. 
Not surprisingly, Democrats leapt on the limited nature of Mr. Bush's proposals to argue that it created only the illusion of reform. The Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, urged Mr. Bush to endorse a series of more drastic changes that the Democrats have now seized on as a crucial issue for the November elections. 
In a measure of how partisan the battle has become, Mr. Bush was not even out of the ballroom yesterday before Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, was providing a critique to a group of reporters on the other side of the room. The speech was "not even sizzle and no steak; there wasn't any sizzle," Mr. Spitzer said.
"It was a lost opportunity," he said.
Republicans countered that Mr. Spitzer, who recently forced Merrill Lynch to pay heavy penalties after he charged that the firm's analysts had misled investors, is encroaching on the S.E.C.'s turf. 
Wall Street's verdict on Mr. Bush's speech was mixed at best. Stocks, which were flat when the president began his speech, began falling after he finished and ended the day sharply lower. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of major companies fell 24.15 points, or 2.5 percent, to 952.83, just above the four-year low it set last week. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 24.49 points, or 1.7 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average skidded 178.81 points, or 1.9 percent. But it was not clear how much of the declines could fairly be linked to the speech itself.
Politically, Mr. Bush was walking a fine line yesterday. He stood before a pale blue poster that had the words "corporate responsibility" repeatedly imprinted across it, a made-for-TV message. He was accompanied to New York by, among others, Karl Rove, his chief political adviser. Aides say Mr. Rove has taken on the difficult job of seeking to strike the right political tone for Mr. Bush, urging him to get out in front of the issue of corporate reform, while calming business leaders who fear that reforms will open American industry to an endless string of federal investigations and shareholder lawsuits. 
"Karl has warned that this issue has a lot of resonance around the country," one White House official said on Monday. "But he knows that there is a danger in going too far." 
While Mr. Bush sounded determined yesterday, his speech lacked the kind of passion he regularly brings to the subject of routing out terrorism or protecting the United States from further attack. But he was clearly comfortable with his surroundings and his audience, and he lingered for more than 20 minutes after the speech was over, signing autographs, slapping backs and greeting a few people he clearly knew from his past life as a student and then a Texas businessman.
His prescriptions were more detailed and expansive than a 10-point plan he laid out in March. His new measures indicate a greater willingness to use the courts, and the threat of jail time, to rein in chief executives. But the effectiveness of his series of new proposals is difficult to judge, experts say.
Mr. Bush announced, for example, that the new Corporate Fraud Task Force would "function as a financial crimes SWAT team," words that created the image of a financial F.B.I. empowered to swoop down on wrongdoers. But officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department described the new task force as a coordinating body and a clearinghouse for information, with no direct responsibility for investigations and prosecutions, which would remain under the F.B.I. and the United States attorneys.
To some experts, like Philip B. Heymann, a former deputy attorney general now teaching at Harvard Law School, the creation of the task force makes less sense than a steady, long-term emphasis on a particular kind of fraud.
Similarly, Mr. Bush's call to double the maximum sentence for various kinds of fraud might frighten some executives. But several former prosecutors said that increasing the odds that a guilty executive is actually caught is far more important.
"Someone who's about to lose their livelihood, their reputation, their income and their standing in the community -- it doesn't matter" if the maximum sentence is harsher, said Ira Lee Sorkin, a former prosecutor who currently practices at Carter, Ledyard & Milburn in New York. "It's not an issue of the penalties."
Lawyers also said that modifying the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which dictate a range of sentences that judges may impose for various crimes, would be more effective than doubling the maximum penalty for specific frauds. The guidelines take into account, for example, how many people were affected by the fraud, how much money was lost, and whether it was part of a complicated scheme, Mr. Sorkin said.
Lawyers who have prosecuted or defended executives charged with fraud said that the proposal to increase the staff and budget of the S.E.C. could prove the most important effect of the president's proposal. 
In a letter to Mr. Bush dated Monday, Harvey L. Pitt, the head of the S.E.C., said that "events have made it clear that we require significant additional resources" in the next fiscal year, and he asked for the $100 million increase that the president endorsed yesterday. If approved, the amount would raise the financing for the agency in the 2003 fiscal year to $567 million, enabling the hiring of 100 new staff members and the revamping of computer systems.
White House officials regard yesterday's speech as important because of the symbolism of the event: a Republican president coming to the heart of Wall Street to call for reform, and using some pretty unvarnished language to do so.
"The business pages of American newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet," Mr. Bush said. "The American economy today is rising, while faith in the fundamental integrity of American business leaders is being undermined. Nearly every week brings better economic news, and a discovery of fraud and scandal."
But he never mentioned Enron, or Worldcom or Arthur Andersen by name, and he certainly made no allusions to his activities as a board member of Harken Energy years ago. Much of a news conference at the White House on Monday had been spent with Mr. Bush parrying questions about his sale of Harken stock in June 1990, not long before the company posted a big loss.
Mr. Bush did seize the moment in his speech yesterday to talk about two groups of professionals that have seen their own approval ratings drop faster than almost any politician's: Wall Street stock analysts and chief executives who cash out before their companies hit the skids.
"Stock analysts should be trusted advisers, not salesmen with a hidden agenda," Mr. Bush said. "We must prevent analysts from touting weak companies because they happen to be clients of their own firm for underwriting or merger advice. This is a flat-out conflict of interest, and we'll aggressively enforce new S.E.C. rules against this practice."
And Mr. Bush, a former chief executive himself, said, "I challenge every C.E.O. in America to describe in the company's annual report -- prominently and in plain English -- details of his or her compensation package." Mr. Bush was more circumspect about his own salary while he was in private business, but now his salary, tax returns and assets are a matter of public record.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: INVESTORS; 
Those Feeling the Pain Now Await a Remedy

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
As the president wrapped up his speech on corporate responsibility in a Wall Street ballroom yesterday, Arthur Urrows stared into a small television screen at a discount brokerage office near Rockefeller Center and slumped in his seat.
 Maybe he was merely beaten down by the oppressive midday heat outside. But as he spoke he seemed more defeated by what he had just heard. 
 "I'm very skeptical of my president," said Mr. Urrows, 72, a fund-raising consultant for nonprofit groups. "I'm skeptical of whatever he says in most realms, but in this realm, I think he's largely on the side of the corporate executives." 
President Bush had just finished ticking off a litany of proposals meant to restore investors' confidence in the financial system, but Mr. Urrows was unimpressed, saying those measures -- including longer prison sentences and forfeited payouts for executives who commit fraud, more money for enforcement of securities laws, a new corporate-crime task force -- did not go far enough.
Mr. Urrows, who owns a few blue-chip stocks and invests in the market more broadly through a pension fund, said he had lived through many recessions and had been unemployed himself several times. But he said he could not remember a time when he felt so disillusioned about the nation's corporate and financial institutions and so unsure of the government's ability or resolve to clean them up.
"I think we need some harsh measures," he said. "Action is going to be more important than words."
Across the country yesterday, Mr. Bush's speech drew similarly underwhelmed reactions from a wide range of investors, from day traders and white-collar workers in the Northeast, to factory workers and pensioners in the South, to investment club members and venture capitalists on the West Coast. While all said they were glad that the president had finally addressed the rash of corporate misdeeds head-on, many said they remained doubtful that he was proposing sufficient reforms, or that what he was proposing would actually be done.
But others like Carl Hinton, a retired bank vice president from Norcross, Ga., applauded Mr. Bush's speech, saying it showed he was tackling the crisis of confidence in American corporations as aggressively as the war on terrorism. 
"He has really got the jump on this," Mr. Hinton said. "He ended up with saying there's no wealth without integrity. I think he's right. You know, he was talking about the attitude of the corporate executives, how they have to set an example of integrity for their companies. I think it's fortunate we've got a guy like President Bush to convey his integrity to the public."
Mr. Hinton, 70, said he was pleased by Mr. Bush's calls for freezing payments to executives accused of fraud, and for requiring executives to swear to the veracity of their financial reports. 
"If they don't, they'll be suspect," he said. "That's going to turn up some more stuff, get it cleaned up. That really gets to my heart. Another thing I liked is saying that these executives that cause losses, they should lose their compensation. Hell, if you deceive the public in your annual report and you want to leave the company and get paid for the next five years, that's ridiculous. I definitely liked that."
Dolores Fanton, a pharmacist from Victor, N.Y., welcomed Mr. Bush's call to bar dishonest executives from working at publicly held companies. "Prison by itself is not always a deterrent for people who are that slick," she said.
Those who praised Mr. Bush more often than not also found his proposals wanting in some respects, however. In Humble, Tex., Peter W. Hilgarth stayed up to watch the president after returning home from his graveyard shift as an airplane mechanic. He called the speech "a step in the right direction," and said he remained confident in America's economy. But he complained, for example, that the 10-year sentences Mr. Bush had called for -- a doubling of the maximum for people convicted of mail or wire fraud -- were still too lenient. 
"I think he should've went with 15 to 20," said Mr. Hilgarth, 64, who said he had a portfolio with shares of more than 100 companies but did not want his small-town neighbors to know its value. "I want to see these people go to jail, because they're ruining an awful lot of lives."
Frank North, 73, a retired manager for a crane manufacturer in Roswell, Ga., watched Mr. Bush from his family-room couch while nursing a pulled tooth, and sounded as irritated by what he had not heard as by the pain in his mouth. "There was an awful lot of bones but really no meat," Mr. North said. "It was like somebody went around and dusted a little here and dusted there and hoped it would make everybody happy."
"In my opinion they don't need new laws," he said. "They should just enforce the ones they've got. The chairman of the S.E.C., Harvey Pitt -- he boasted about making a friendlier S.E.C. That's not what we need. We need someone who will take it serious and do something about wrongdoers. Harvey Pitt should be replaced."
Most of those investors interviewed said they trusted that Mr. Bush had the best interests of individual investors at heart, if only because investors are becoming synonymous with voters. 
"I would say he's really out to protect the economy and people's confidence in it," said Michael Pullen, 43, a county government employee from Portland, Ore. "I would give him that. But obviously we're heading into an election in about four months where our two houses of Congress are very evenly divided. This is the last thing he needs, when he's already fighting a war, is to have to restore Americans' confidence in the basic financial institutions of the country."
Mr. Pullen added: "It just feels so much like the bubbles have burst. It's not just the dot-com bubble, but a number of things that have made Americans highly confident about their economy and their institutions just a couple of years ago all seem to be bursting. It's really an incredible confluence of events when you combine the biggest domestic terrorist attack in the country's history with the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the country's history and then the Catholic Church's problems. It's a number of institutions that people are losing faith in."
And the pain being felt by investors is quite real. John H. Sullivan, 52, a claims manager from Kansas City, said he had lost more than $100,000 already this year from his investments, 90 percent of which are in stocks. "WorldCom really hit me," he said. "It really hurts, seeing your portfolio go down 25 percent, especially when you have two teenage sons."
Mr. Sullivan doubted that the president's address would have immediate and lasting impact, and called it more of a political exercise than anything else. 
"The Democrats were going to come out and get him for his ties to business. He had to come out and say something. I viewed it as a political necessity."
Still, few investors who were interviewed expressed concern about the renewed attention to Mr. Bush's 1990 sale of shares of Harken Energy, where he was a director. Democrats have raised that trade, and a subsequent investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as evidence that the president is unsympathetic to smaller, less well-connected investors.
Mr. Hinton, the retired banker in Georgia, called that "ridiculous," especially since Mr. Bush had disclosed his intention to sell his shares beforehand. 
"If he was trying to defraud anyone, he wouldn't have told them in the first place," Mr. Hinton said.
But in the next breath, Mr. Hinton suggested that Mr. Bush's brush with the S.E.C. years ago might give him more credibility as a reformer now. "They always say it takes one to catch one," he said.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE REACTION; 
A Talk on Corporate Integrity Heard in the Street and the Suite

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Chief executives widely praised President Bush's speech yesterday, saying it would help restore confidence in American business. But many Wall Streeters and those who run large pension funds that own billions of dollars in stocks expressed disappointment Mr. Bush did not offer more specific proposals to clean up corporate wrongdoing.
 The two points of view represent competing visions of the current scandal over corporate behavior: executives who feel their credibility is at stake and investors angered by a cascading series of financial losses and a string of accounting failures. 
 While both sides praised Mr. Bush's focus on the need for integrity and ethical behavior among chief executives, from that point on, opinions diverged. Institutional investors felt more sweeping changes in boardroom rules and accounting oversight were needed while others, mainly business leaders, said they opposed any move toward greater regulation.
"I was hoping for more commitment to regulatory reform and to corporate governance reform in light of what happened," said Felix Rohatyn, the longtime Wall Street financier and former ambassador to France. "There are still too many holes in our regulatory dikes. They must be fixed; otherwise a very important national asset, namely our financial markets, will be badly damaged."
Mr. Rohatyn has advocated, among other changes, putting institutional investors on corporate boards and reporting stock options granted to top executives on income statements, items that were not on the White House's agenda.
By contrast, chief executives were lavish in their praise.
"We needed this speech because people are losing confidence," said George David, chief executive of the United Technologies Corporation, a diversified manufacturer in Hartford. "Some bad things happen and people say the system is broken. It's not. A huge percentage of corporate America is honest and his speech reinforced that."
Robert S. Miller, chief executive of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, amplified on that. "The president struck a nice bipartisan balance. He talked about doubling prison terms and going after the bad apples rather than imposing new burdens on the majority of American businesses."
At the same time, chief executives said that they, too, had little sympathy for unethical behavior within corporations and praised the president's high moral tone. "People who rob banks go to jail; people who rob shareholders should, too," said William Hickey, chief executive of the Sealed Air Corporation, best known for making bubble wrap packaging.
Larry Johnston, chief executive of Albertson's, the supermarket chain based in Boise, Idaho, thought "the president hit the nail on the head."
"He stood up as C.E.O. of this country and said the whole issue of integrity needs to be higher on the scale of awareness," Mr. Johnston added. "I can't argue with that."
Perhaps most disappointed were institutional investors and corporate governance advocates who were hoping Mr. Bush might endorse some proposals they had long advocated. These include greater financial oversight and a requirement that stock options be treated as corporate expenses. They were especially concerned Mr. Bush declined to endorse proposals in a Senate bill introduced by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, for overhauling the accounting industry. Instead, Mr. Bush praised a House version of the bill, which they contend is too weak.
"My concern is whether the speech was just more political rhetoric or whether it was truly a call for action," said James E. Burton, chief executive of the California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, with $150 billion in assets. "We think it is time for Congress to act."
Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents the nation's public pension funds, was also disappointed. "What he did was to do as little as he could possibly do and still give a speech," she said. " 'Putting people behind bars': It sounds good, but he ducked and took the easy way out."
Mr. Bush's failure to back proposals to treat executives' stock options as a normal business expense was seen as a shortcoming by corporate governance activists. "My feeling is sadness," said Robert A. G. Monks, an executive of the Corporate Library, a research group. "He had the perfect opportunity to start with a new morality," Mr. Monks added, "and stop this nonsense of not calling a stock option an expense."
On Wall Street, Mr. Bush's speech got mixed reviews. Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group and co-chairman of a corporate governance task force at the Conference Board, a business research group, called the speech "too little, too late and too general."
Mr. Peterson added that while "this business of putting people into jail is a laudable idea," the speech lacked specifics on things like executive compensation and the disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains.
Wall Street executives who attended Mr. Bush's presentation came away praising the speech as a much-needed confidence booster. "He lowered the hammer," said Henry M. Paulson Jr., chief executive of Goldman Sachs. "This shows he is serious about driving the abuses out of the system." Still, Mr. Paulson felt that the problems in corporate America were more systemic. 
"You are not going to get me to say it's just a few bad apples," Mr. Paulson said, adding that his firm backed proposals to tighten accounting standards and toughen punishment for financial fraud.
Philip J. Purcell, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, disagreed, saying that corporate wrongdoing was "not systemic at all."
Mr. Purcell praised Mr. Bush's proposal that chief executives sign and certify their companies' financial statements. "We've got to get beyond political parties and address what we think is best for confidence in the markets," he said. "If this is what it takes to restore confidence, let's sign them and move on."
On Wall Street, Mr. Bush earned points for talking forcefully about corporate responsibility. Sanford I. Weill, chief executive of Citigroup, has put out his own proposals for stricter accounting standards and the deduction of some stock options from corporate profits. "The president just being here," he said, "showed that he gets the message."

Bush's Dance: Moral Outrage Without Pain To Loyalists

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9 

 BODY:
On Wall Street today President Bush carefully positioned himself, politically and economically, as a leader willing to come down hard on unscrupulous capitalists without alienating the business constituency that remains his party's financial and ideological base.
 Mr. Bush had to be candid enough to acknowledge a crisis of confidence, but not so alarmist as to risk unnerving the financial markets further. He had to promise an aggressive response, but not one so harsh that it would leave him open to accusations of abandoning his deregulatory, free-market principles. 
 Speaking to an audience best known for its focus on the bottom line, Mr. Bush stressed the importance of character and conscience. But he did not mention his own history as a businessman, one that led him at a news conference on Monday to plead that when it comes to accounting, things are not always black and white.
The speech he delivered today was full of the moral tone that suffuses his major public pronouncements, and it ranged across the landscape of complex issues raised by cascading corporate troubles -- from criminal fraud prosecutions, to the independence of auditors, to the need to protect the pensions of workers. While it was light on new proposals, its emphasis on seeking stiffer sentences for executives convicted of fraud and its promise that the Justice Department would step up its prosecutions of criminal cases allowed Mr. Bush to portray himself as determined to root out wrongdoing.
As far as his broader goal of seizing back control of the policy agenda and insulating himself from political damage, it is not clear whether he was successful, at least by two early barometers.
The stock market fell after his remarks, suggesting no immediate surge in confidence that the worst is past for investors. And Democrats in control of the Senate showed no signs of relaxing efforts to push for broader legislation or slackening their criticism that the President is more protective of rich chief executives than of average investors. "I thought the president spoke loudly," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, "but he offered a very, very small stick."
Mr. Bush still has great opportunity to influence whatever legislation on the matter emerges from Congress, and his personal popularity, while eroding somewhat, remains very high. Should the economy and the stock market turn around, much of the pressure on him might dissipate.
But for now, Mr. Bush seems likely to remain on the defensive over corporate ethics.
"Not long ago, on homeland security, he saw an issue getting away from him and he gave a speech in an attempt to put himself back in a leadership position," said Thomas D. Gallagher, a political analyst at International Strategy and Investment, an advisory firm. "He could do that on homeland security pretty easily because he's got so much credibility in the war on terrorism. It's harder to do here. Instead of capturing the issue, he's just contributing to a political process that's still intensifying."
In a sense, Mr. Bush's speech today was an extension of a dance he has been performing since the 2000 campaign, blurring ideological lines to expand his political appeal and give himself maximum room to maneuver as circumstances dictate.
He is often cast as one of the best friends business has had in Washington, and in some respects that reputation is justified. On environmental regulation, taxes and other topics that are red meat to economic conservatives, Mr. Bush has delivered for the corporate constituency, or made a determined effort to do so.
But he has also proved willing to put political considerations first when he and his advisers deem it necessary to his electoral prospects, as when he imposed tariffs on imported steel earlier this year under pressure from steelmakers and their workers in battleground states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
In this case, Mr. Bush is trying to have it both ways, using some populist language, but trying to place strict limits on how far new laws and regulations should go. 
He said he would seek longer prison sentences for executives convicted of fraud, but he did not endorse a bill pending in the Senate that would create a broad new definition of corporate fraud to make it easier for prosecutors to bring cases. He criticized the practice of companies paying their top managers huge amounts for pumping up their short-term earnings, but continues to oppose legislation that would make it more expensive for companies to issue stock options to their executives.
"He ran on a platform of compassionate conservatism, and I guess that was amended today to ethical capitalism," said Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pimco, a bond-trading firm. "What he's trying to say is that we live with the tug and pull of democratic capitalism: as capitalists we respect the notion of one dollar, one vote, but in a democracy, it's one person, one vote."
The public is angry now, he added, and "we have to find a more happy union in the state of the union between capitalism and democracy."

Transcript of President's Address Calling for New Era of Corporate Integrity

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of an address yesterday morning by President Bush in Manhattan on his proposals to better enforce ethical business practices, as recorded by The New York Times: 

An Introduction
 I'm pleased to be back in New York City. New York City is a unique symbol of America's creativity and character and resilience. In the last 10 months, New Yorkers have shown a watching world the true spirit of your city, a spirit that honors the lost, remembers its heroes and goes forward with determination and with confidence. The people of this city are writing one of the greatest chapters in our nation's history. And all Americans are proud of New York. 
 I have come to the financial capital of the world to speak of a serious challenge to our financial markets and to the confidence on which they rest. The misdeeds now being uncovered in some quarters of corporate America are threatening the financial well-being of many workers and many investors. At this moment, America's greatest economic need is higher ethical standards, standards enforced by strict laws and upheld by responsible business leaders. The lure of heady profits of the late 1990's spawned abuses and excesses. With strict enforcement and higher ethical standards, we must usher in a new era of integrity in corporate America. 
I want to thank Bill for his introduction. There's nothing like being recycled. But thanks for having me. And I'm honored to meet your family and Uncle Jack. And I appreciate very much Secretary O'Neill and Secretary Evans traveling with me today. I want to thank the members of the New York delegation: Senators Schumer and Clinton as well as Congressman Fasella and Congressman Rangel. I appreciate so very much the mayor, my friend the mayor, for being here to greet me as I came in on the chopper. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thanks for the great job you're doing for New York. I'm honored that Cardinal Egan is here. And I appreciate so very much seeing John Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. And thank you all for coming as well. 
The American economy, our economy, is built on confidence. The conviction that our free enterprise system will continue to be the most powerful and most promising in the world. That confidence is well placed. After all, American technology is the most advanced in the world. Our universities attract the talent of the world. Our workers and ranchers and farmers can compete with anybody in the world. Our society rewards hard work and honest ambition, bringing people to our shores from all around the world who share those values. The American economy is the most creative and enterprising and productive system ever devised.
We can be confident because America is taking every necessary step to fight and win the war on terror. We are reorganizing the federal government to protect the homeland. We are hunting down the terrorists who seek to sow chaos.
My commitment and the commitment of our government is total. We will not relent until the cold-blooded killers are found, disrupted and defeated.
We can be confident because of the amazing achievements of American workers and entrepreneurs. In spite of all that happened last year, from the economic slowdown to the terrorist attack, worker productivity has grown by 4.2 percent over the last four quarters. In the first quarter of 2002, the economy grew at an annual rate exceeding 6 percent. Though there is much work left to do, American workers have defied the pessimists and laid the foundation for a sustained recovery. We can be confident because we're pursuing pro-growth reforms in Washington, D.C. Last year we passed the biggest tax cut in a generation, which encouraged job creation and boosted consumer spending at just the right time. 
For the sake of long-term growth, I'm asking Congress to make the tax reductions permanent. I'm asking Congress to join me to promote free trade, which will open new markets and create better jobs and spur innovation. I ask Congress to work with me to pass a terrorism insurance bill to give companies the security they need to expand and to build.
And I will insist on, and if need be enforce, discipline in federal spending so we can meet our national priorities without undermining our economy. 

The Integrity of Executives
We have much to be confident about in America. Yet our economy and our country need one more kind of confidence: confidence in the character and conduct of all of our business leaders. The American economy today is rising while faith in the fundamental integrity of American business leaders is being undermined. Nearly every week brings better economic news and a discovery of fraud and scandal, problems long in the making but now coming to light. We've learned of some business leaders obstructing justice and misleading clients, falsifying records, business executives breaching the trust and abusing power. 
We've learned of C.E.O.'s earning tens of millions of dollars in bonuses just before their companies go bankrupt, leaving employees and retirees and investors to suffer. The business pages of American newspapers should not read like a scandal sheet. 
The vast majority of businessmen and women are honest. They do right by their employees and their shareholders. They do not cut ethical corners and their work helps create an economy which is the envy of the world. 
Yet high-profile acts of deception have shaken people's trust. Too many corporations seem disconnected from the values of our country. These scandals have hurt the reputations of many good and honest companies. They have hurt the stock market. And worst of all, they are hurting millions of people who depend on the integrity of businesses for their livelihood and their retirement, for their peace of mind and their financial well-being. 
When abuses like this begin to surface in the corporate world, it is time to reaffirm the basic principles and rules that make capitalism work: truthful books and honest people and well-enforced laws against fraud and corruption. All investment is an act of faith. And faith is earned by integrity. In the long run, there's no capitalism without conscience; there is no wealth without character. 

Call for 'Sensible Reforms'
And so again today I'm calling for a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business community, an ethic that will increase investor confidence, will make employees proud of their companies and again regain the trust of the American people. Our nation's most respected business leaders, including many gathered here today, take this ethic very seriously. The Business Roundtable, the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq have all proposed guidelines to improve corporate conduct and transparency. These include requirements that independent directors compose a majority of the company's board, that all members of audit, nominating and compensation committees be independent and that all stock option plans be approved by the shareholders. 
I call on all the stock markets to adopt these sensible reforms, these common-sense reforms, as soon as possible. Self-regulation is important. But it's not enough. Government cannot remove risk from investment. I know that. Or chance from the market. But government can do more to promote transparency and ensure that risks are honest. And government can assure that those who breach the trust of the American people are punished. Bold, well-considered reforms should demand integrity without stifling innovation and economic growth. From the antitrust laws of the 19th century to the S.& L. reforms of recent times, America has tackled financial problems when they appeared. 
The actions I'm proposing follow in this tradition and should be welcomed by every honest company in America. First, we will use the full weight of the law to expose and root out corruption. My administration will do everything in our power to end the days of cooking the books, shading the truth and breaking our laws. 

A Fraud Task Force
Today by executive order, I create a new corporate fraud task force headed by the deputy attorney general, which will target major accounting fraud and other criminal activity in corporate finance. The task force will function as a financial times SWAT team, overseeing the investigation of corporate abusers and bringing them to account.
I'm also proposing tough new criminal penalties for corporate fraud. This legislation would double the maximum prison terms for those convicted of financial fraud from 5, to 10 years. Defrauding investors is a serious offense and the punishment must be as serious as the crime. 
I ask Congress to strengthen the ability of S.E.C. investigators to temporarily freeze improper payments to corporate executives and to strengthen laws that prevent the destruction of corporate documents in order to hide crimes. 
Second, we're moving corporate accounting out of the shadows. So the investing public will have a true and fair and timely picture of assets and liabilities and income of publicly traded companies. Greater transparency will expose bad companies and just as importantly, protect the reputations of the good ones. 
To expose corporate corruption, I asked Congress four months ago for funding to place 100 new enforcement personnel in the S.E.C. And I call on Congress to act quickly on this request. Today I announce my administration is asking Congress for an additional $100 million in the coming year to give the S.E.C. the officers and the technology it needs to enforce the law. 
If more scandals are hiding in corporate America we must find and expose them now so we can begin rebuilding the confidence of our people and the momentum of our markets. 

An Accountability Plan
I've also proposed a 10-point accountability plan for American business, designed to provide better information to shareholders, set clear responsibility for corporate officers and develop a stronger more independent auditing system. This plan is ensuring that the S.E.C. takes aggressive and affirmative action. 
Corporate officers who benefit from false accounting statements should forfeit all money gained by their fraud. An executive whose compensation is tied to his company's performance makes more money when his company does well. That's fine. And that's fair when the accounting is above board. Yet, when a company uses deception, deception accounting to hide reality, executives should lose all their compensation, all their compensation gained by the deceit. 
Corporate leaders who violate the public trust should never be given that trust again. The S.E.C. should be able to punish corporate leaders who are convicted of abusing their powers by banning them from ever serving again as officers or directors of a publicly held corporation. If an executive is guilty of outright fraud, resignation is not enough. Only a ban on serving at the top of another company will protect other shareholders and employees.
Our accountability plan also requires C.E.O.'s to personally vouch for their firm's annual financial statements. Currently a C.E.O. signs a nominal certificate and does so merely on behalf of the company. In the future the signature of the C.E.O. should also be his or her personal certification of the veracity and fairness of the financial disclosures. When you sign a statement, you're pledging your word. And you should stand behind it. 
And because the shareholders of America need confidence in financial disclosures right away, the S.E.C. has ordered the leaders of nearly a thousand large public companies to certify that the financial information they submitted in the last year was fair and it was accurate. I've also called on the S.E.C. to adopt new rules to ensure that auditors will be independent and not compromised by conflicts of interest. 
The House of Representatives has passed needed legislation to encourage transparency and accountability in American businesses. The Senate also needs to act quickly and responsibly so I can sign a good bill into law. 

Protecting Small Investors
Third, my administration will guard the interests of small investors and pension holders. More than 80 million Americans own stock and many of them are new to the market. Buying stock gives them an opportunity to build wealth over the long term. And this is the very kind of responsible investment we must promote in America. 
To encourage stock ownership, we must make sure that analysts give honest advice and pension plans treat workers fairly. Stock analysts should be trusted advisers not salesmen with a hidden agenda. We must prevent analysts from touting weak companies because they happen to be clients of their own firm for underwriting or merger advice. This is a flat-out conflict of interest. And we will aggressively enforce new S.E.C. rules against this practice, rules which take effect today. 
And the stock market should make sure that the advice analysts give and the terms they use have real meaning to investors. Buy should not be the only word in an analyst's vocabulary. And they should never say hold when they really mean sell. 
Small investors should also not have to have the decks stacked against them when it comes to managing their own retirement funds. My pension reform proposal would treat corporate executives the same as workers during so-called blackout periods when employees are prohibited from trading in their own accounts. It's fair for the workers. It's fair for the bosses. 
My reform proposal gives workers quarterly information about their investments. It expands worker's access to sound investment advice and allows them to diversify out of company stock. The House has passed these measures. I urge the Senate to do the same. 
Tougher laws and stricter requirements will help. It'll help. Yet ultimately the ethics of American business depend on the conscience of America's business leaders. We need men and women of character who know the difference between ambition and destructive greed, between justified risk and irresponsibility, between enterprise and fraud. 
Our schools of business must be principled teachers of right and wrong and not surrender to moral confusion and relativism. Our leaders of business must set high and clear expectations of conduct demonstrated by their own conduct. Responsible business leaders do not jump ship during hard times. Responsible leaders do not collect huge bonus packages when the value of their company dramatically declines. Responsible leaders do not take home tens of millions of dollars in compensation as their companies prepare to file for bankruptcy devastating the holdings of their investors. 
Everyone in a company should live up to high standards. But the burden of leadership rightly belongs to the chief executive officer. C.E.O.'s set the ethical direction for their companies. They set a moral tone by the decisions they make, the respect they show their employees and their willingness to be held accountable for their actions. They set a moral tone by showing their disapproval of other executives who bring discredit to the business world. 
And one of the principal ways that C.E.O.'s set an ethical tone is through their compensation. The pay package sends a clear signal whether a business leader is committed to teamwork or personal enrichment. It tells you whether his principal goal is the creation of wealth for shareholders or the accumulation of wealth for himself. 
The S.E.C. currently requires the annual disclosure of a C.E.O.'s compensation. But that information is often buried in long proxy statements and seldom seen, seldom seen by shareholders. I challenge every C.E.O. in America to describe in the company's annual report prominently and in plain English details of his or her compensation package, including salary and bonus and benefits. And the C.E.O. in that report should also explain why his or her compensation package is in the best interest of the company he serves. 

Responsibility of Directors
Those who sit on corporate boards have responsibilities. I urge board members to check the quality of their companies' financial statements. To ask tough questions about accounting methods. To demand that audit firms are not beholden to the C.E.O. And to make sure the compensation for senior executives squares with reality and common sense. And I challenge compensation committees to put an end to all company loans to corporate officers. 
Shareholders also need to make their voices heard. They should demand an attentive and active board of directors. They should demand truly independent directors. They should demand that compensation committees reward long-term success not failure. Shareholders should demand accountability not just in bad times, but especially in boom times when accountability frequently breaks down. Shareholders are a company's most important constituency. And they should act like it. 
The 1990's was a decade of tremendous economic growth. As we're now learning it was also a decade when the promise of rapid profits allowed the seeds of scandal to spring. A lot of money was made. But too often standards were tossed aside. Yet the American system of enterprise has not failed us. Some dishonest individuals have failed our system. 
Now comes the urgent work of enforcement and reform driven by a new ethic of responsibility. We will show that markets can be both dynamic and honest. That lasting wealth and prosperity are built on a foundation of integrity. By reasserting the best values of our country, we will reclaim the promise of our economy. 
Leaders in this room help give the free enterprise system an ethical compass. And the nation respects you for that. We need that influence now more than ever. 
I want to thank you for helping to restore the people's trust in American business. I want to thank you for your love of the country. And I want to thank you for giving me the chance to come and address you today. May God bless you all.

HEADLINE: Pirates on the Web, Spoils on the Street 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
LAST week, at age 29, John Sankus Jr. moved out of his parents' house for the first time. He and his parents drove 150 miles from their home in suburban Philadelphia to his new one: a federal penitentiary in Allenwood, Pa. 
 Mr. Sankus, who entered the minimum-security prison on July 2 to serve a 46-month sentence, is a soft-spoken, churchgoing computer technician who still has the plush stuffed whales from his childhood. 
 But United States Customs Service investigators and prosecutors say he was also a ringleader of an international gang of software pirates that deprived companies of millions of dollars through the illegal distribution of copyrighted software, games and movies on the Internet. In February, Mr. Sankus pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to commit copyright infringement. 
The piracy group, known as DrinkorDie, was among the chief targets of more than 100 coordinated raids in the United States and abroad last December. So far 15 people in the United States have pleaded guilty to criminal charges as a result of the raids, including a Duke University student, a programmer at the University of California at Los Angeles, an employee at an Internet service provider and several executives at technology companies. So far Mr. Sankus and five others have been sentenced to prison. 
Interviews with Mr. Sankus and others involved in the case, including customs and law enforcement officials, offer an unusual glimpse into the world of Internet piracy. It is a community of sorts, with perhaps 30 major groups that issue pirated products by cracking the copy-protection codes of software or making illicit duplicates of movies.
Many of the pirates say they were motivated less by money than by a sense of competition, prestige and the entertainment value of distributing the pirated goods, which they call "warez."
"Most of the people I have been around with are not out to cheat anybody," said Mr. Sankus, a large, shy man who worked as a computer technician at a Gateway store. "They are out to have fun. It's just a hobby."
In an interview before he went off to prison, Mr. Sankus said he earned no money from software piracy. He described it rather as a social activity that consumed him. 
He recounted the day when about 40 armed customs agents swooped into his workplace. "I felt like someone who had just murdered 50 people," he said.
Prosecutors say that Mr. Sankus helped steal millions of dollars' worth of intellectual property. And despite the guilty pleas from him and others, they add, the stealing continues because of the nature of the distribution medium.
"That's the difference -- in the old world, if you stopped the source, you stopped the piracy," said Michael DuBose, a Justice Department lawyer who played a pivotal role in the piracy investigation. "But all the stuff that DrinkorDie put out there continues to be out there."
While Internet piracy slowed immediately after the December raids, activity has picked up again, investigators say. For example, Warcraft III, an eagerly anticipated game from Blizzard Entertainment, was "cracked" and released to the Internet only one day after a master CD for the game was created in mid-June.
For DrinkorDie members, piracy was the technological equivalent of joy riding -- a form of bravado that could gain them acceptance in a hierarchical social sphere.
"It's all about stature," said David Grimes of Arlington, Tex., a DrinkorDie member who worked as a computer engineer at Check Point Software, a company that specializes in security solutions for software. "They are just trying to make a name for themselves for no reason other than self-gratification." Mr. Grimes is serving a 37-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to the same charge that Mr. Sankus did.
"It's the same reason that people join gangs," said Allan Doody, the Customs Service investigator who led the DrinkorDie investigation, part of a broader anti-piracy campaign called Operation Buccaneer. "They're hanging out on the cyber-street corner."
But in contrast to petty criminals and warring gangs, Internet piracy groups have a worldwide impact of at least tens of millions of dollars, if not more. Such groups secure their reputations by releasing thousands of free movies, games, music and software programs on the Internet each year. 
While such groups rarely profit financially from their activities, their warez (pronounced like the word wares), proliferate rapidly around the world, reaching those who do sell them for gain -- for example, people who hawk the software through pay-for-access Web sites or burn them on CD's for sale on the street, in shops or at Internet auction sites.
The copies "become the raw materials that others use for commercial piracy," said Bob Kruger, president of the Business Software Alliance, an industry group that asserts that software piracy costs $10.1 billion a year in lost sales worldwide.
The victims of piracy take the threat very seriously. Havard Vold, president of an eight-person company in Cincinnati called Vold Solutions, was horrified to discover that DrinkorDie had released a free version of a specialized engineering program that his company sold for $9,500. 
"That was very scary," Mr. Vold said. "They do not understand the impact of copyright infringement, especially on the smaller companies." 
Although the warez scene took root only in the early 1990's, piracy has expanded rapidly, particularly in the last five years.
Increasing access to the Internet worldwide, cheap computer storage costs and the proliferation of digitized media have helped set off an international online shopping spree in which just about anyone can obtain a pirated version of a coveted software program, computer game or movie openly and easily. 
By contrast, the warez groups themselves tend to operate in secrecy, relying on encryption technologies, disguised Internet Protocol addresses and invite-only chat channels. And their world is highly structured, with a strict hierarchy and rules.
The pirates are organized into two main types: release groups that produce the pirated works and courier groups that serve as worldwide distributors. 
Government investigators estimate that there are roughly 30 major release groups enlisting some 1,500 people around the world. In the DrinkorDie raids last December, warrants were served on suspected members in Britain, Australia, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Mr. DuBose said that at least half of DrinkorDie's members lived outside the United States. 
Different warez groups focus on different product lines. Groups like FairLight and Razor1911 are known for game releases. FTF and Immortal VCD release movies, a pursuit that relies less on overcoming protection schemes than on getting illegitimate access to recent films to duplicate them. A group called POPZ, for Parents on 'Puterz, focuses on children's games. 
DrinkorDie, which is perhaps best known for having cracked Windows 95 weeks before it was released by Microsoft, has more recently concentrated on expensive specialized software like Mr. Vold's engineering program. 
"It's cool to release something that costs $18,000," said Mr. Grimes, the DrinkorDie member from Arlington, Tex. "Basically, if it wasn't for us, you would never see this piece of software."
Warez involve frenzied competition. Groups race to be the first to release popular movies and games, but quality is important too. Groups take jabs at one another's releases. Immortal VCD called a competitor's release of the Disney film "Lilo and Stitch" subpar, describing the copy as "very dark, shaky and pixilated." It offered its own version as an improvement.
The release groups typically have one or two leaders, two or three other managers called "council members," 10 to 15 staff members who work on releases and 50 to 100 members who simply have access to the releases. 
Mr. Sankus, one of the two leaders of DrinkorDie, went by the online name Eriflleh, or "hellfire" spelled backward. The other leader, who goes by the online name Bandido, lives in Australia and has not not been charged, Justice Department officials said.
Like similar release groups, DrinkorDie divided the labor. Suppliers, often insiders at a software company, provided versions of the software. Crackers, who had the most technologically complex role, stripped the programs of their protections. Testers then made sure that the unprotected versions of the software worked properly. Finally, there were packers and "pre-ers" who were responsible for dividing the programs into small files and distributing them to release sites.
Mr. Sankus started out as a tester and a packer for DrinkorDie before moving into a leadership position. "There weren't that many people who wanted to do testing and packing because it was considered grunt work," he said.
The warez community has numerous databases to keep track of the thousands of releases. People can perform what are known as "dupe checks," or searches to determine whether a program or a movie has already been released. 
The Isonews Web site (www.isnonews.com) keeps a public database of the information files that accompany each warez release. Such files specify who was responsible for the release, when it was made available and how many files the product has been broken down into, as well as reviews. The warez groups privately maintain a database known as Checkpoint that has automated software agents, or bots, that keep abreast of warez releases as they occur.
Once the files arrive at the release sites, courier groups take over and move them through a systematic distribution chain. Within 10 minutes of a warez release, the pirated product is copied to a few dozen central distribution centers on the Internet.
Government officials estimate that within six hours, lower-level couriers then copy files to about 10,000 publicly available sites around the Internet. Within two or three days, the movies and program trickle onto Usenet groups and onto peer-to-peer software networks like KaZaA and Morpheus. Once the files become public, they are essentially available to anyone who goes looking for them.
"All it takes is one person to put it on a newsgroup -- then it explodes," said David Rocci, who runs Isonews.
The courier groups, like the release groups, are fueled by competition. The government estimates that 3,500 people are involved in the most elite courier groups, which include RISC and Moonshine.
Couriers are ranked in groups and as individuals with a scoring system. There are weekly rankings, all-time rankings and regional rankings (United States vs. Europe, for example). 
Courier groups are sized up in shadowy e-mail publications like American Courier Review and Courier Weektop Scorecard in sports-style commentary. "Just not quite enough for RISC this time but an awesome team effort in which we see some nice individual performance as well," a recent review read.
Although release and courier groups engage in little direct commercial activity, a 1997 extension in federal copyright law made piracy a crime even if there is no monetary profit. 
Prosecutors say that money is beside the point in the underground pirate economy. The releases form the basis of a bartering system in which members trade, hoard and collect warez. Access to software storage sites is granted in exchange for hardware, server space and other technological goods.
"You don't need to make money, when you don't need money to buy this stuff," Mr. DuBose said. "By participating in a group, they got the key to the candy store. Any movie, game, software they could ever want, they could get." 
Still, given the absence of personal profit, some DrinkorDie members were surprised by the prison sentences they received, generally from three to four years. "We weren't criminal-minded," Mr. Grimes said. "We never anticipated that a company would lose a sale as a result of one guy in China downloading it and burning it onto a CD and selling it to half of China." 
But that argument fails to resonate for copyright holders like Mr. Vold. "If you like torching houses for fun, you don't gain anything from torching somebody's house," he said. "But that homeowner will certainly suffer a material loss."

"They do not understand the impact of copyright infringement, especially on the smaller companies," he said of the pirates. (Kjell Lamgmyren for The New York Times)(pg. G7) Drawing (Steven Lyons)(pg. G1) Chart: "Inside the Organization"DrinkorDie is one of about 30 groups that break copy-protection codes of software and distribute the pirated programs, known as warez, on the Internet. Heres how DrinkorDie was structured. RELEASE GROUP Suppliers provide software through insider theft, interception between manufacturers and distributors or other means. A secure computer, often within a university network, serves as a central drop box for software at all stages of the process. Crackers overcome a programs embedded copyright protection or circumvent hardware security devices. Testers make sure that the software still works after the protection is removed. Packers split large programs into smaller files that can be easily sent. Pre-ers move files from the drop box to release sites. COURIER GROUPS Several levels of courier groups distribute pirated programs to Web sites, often within hours. (Source: U.S. Customs Service)(pg. G7)

HEADLINE: Cubicle Crimes 

BYLINE:  By Scott Adams; Scott Adams, a cartoonist, is the author of the forthcoming "Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel."

DATELINE: DANVILLE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Apparently, without anyone's noticing, our entire universe collapsed into a black hole and emerged in another dimension where everything is backward: Bill Gates (who used to be evil) is spending billions to vaccinate children in third-world countries, while the Catholic Church (which used to be good) is defending priests accused of molesting children. The stock market (which used to go up) now only drifts downward. And the surest way to lose respect is to mention you started a dot-com. 
 But here's the strangest backwardism of all: People seem surprised that captains of industry are stealing vast amounts of money at every opportunity. Back in our old dimension everyone assumed that C.E.O.'s and C.F.O.'s were weasels. Now it's big news. 
 I think it's useful to put these corporate scandals in perspective. Every employee I ever worked with in my old cubicle-dwelling days was pillaging the company on a regular basis, too. But the quantity of loot was rarely newsworthy. My weasel co-workers were pocketing office supplies, fudging expense reports, using sick days as vacation and engaging in a wide array of work-avoidance techniques. 
Most people rationalize this kind of behavior by saying that corporations are evil and so the weasel employees deserve a little extra. The C.E.O.'s and C.F.O.'s aren't less ethical than employees and stockholders; they're just more effective. They're getting a higher quality of loot than the rank and file, and for that they must be punished.
I have some friends in law enforcement who say the only crooks that get caught are the stupid ones. Assuming this holds true for C.E.O.'s, it's bad news for the economy. I have to think that at least a few of the executives who are running billion-dollar companies are smart, so we might be seeing the tip of the weasel's tail here.
The typical C.E.O. legal defense -- and it's a good one -- is to place the blame on plain old massive incompetence, not on evil. If I end up on the jury for one of those trials, I'll be torn. On the one hand, I'm predisposed to believing that executives are indeed clueless. But on the other, I'm enough of a weasel to vote guilty just to watch a C.E.O. cry. I lost a lot of money on Enron, Tyco and WorldCom. (Yes, I owned stock in all three.) So I might enjoy being a juror on one of those cases. I might even volunteer. And when I sign in to the jury room each morning, I'll steal the pen, because frankly, I deserve it.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Increase; Import Prices Decline Slightly 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
Wholesale inventories rose in May for the first time in a year, the Commerce Department reported today, as sales posted their first decline since December.
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said import prices in June declined for the first time in six months as falling petroleum prices helped restrain inflation pressures. 
 Wholesale inventories in May rose 0.1 percent, to $281.4 billion, the Commerce Department said, after a revised 0.9 percent fall in April. Analysts had expected a 0.2 percent fall. 
Sales at the wholesale level fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since a 1.0 percent drop in December, pulled down by sluggish demand for cars and nondurable goods.
The stocks-to-sales ratio, which measures the time it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales pace, increased to 1.24 months, from 1.23 months in April.
The 2.5 percent increase in auto inventories was the largest since a 3.5 percent increase in December 1998. Supplies of computer equipment rose 1.5 percent in May. Inventories of nondurable goods rose 0.6 percent, the largest since 0.9 percent in August. Car sales fell 1.1 percent after rising 1.1 percent in April.
The Labor Department said import prices fell 0.6 percent in June after rising 0.1 percent in May. Economists had expected a 0.2 percent drop. The June drop was the first since a 1.0 percent fall in December.
The June decline was prompted by a 6.6 percent decline in petroleum prices, the first decrease since a 6.1 percent drop in December. 
Excluding petroleum, import prices rose 0.1 percent in June after declining 0.1 percent in May. Prices of imported cars rose 0.2 percent after a matching decline in May.
Prices of exports were unchanged in June after falling 0.1 percent in May. Export prices of agricultural products rose a solid 1.1 percent in June after a 0.1 percent fall in May. The June rise in agriculture export prices was the largest since a similar increase in December 2000.

HEADLINE: Mobile Home Owners Remain House Hungry 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: NAHUNTA, Ga. 

 BODY:
On a muggy afternoon, James Gandy, 38, cleared debris from the installation of his new $55,000 Fleetwood double-wide mobile home. He has a side-by-side refrigerator; wood-burning fireplace; two bathrooms, with his-and-her sinks; and a game room with a pool table and a wet bar. Mr. Gandy, who is divorced and is a sales manager for a company nearly an hour away in Brunswick, lives there with his two teenage sons. 
 "You hear people say, 'I'm not going to live in a trailer,' " Mr. Gandy said. " 'I'm living in a house.' I want the yard to look nice. I want to be able to have company come in." 
 He said he would rather have a house, too, like the one where he grew up in Brunswick. But with a down payment of $2,000, the trailer was the most he felt he could afford on his earnings of $40,000 a year. He is content with his new home. 
The roads around this placid town east of the Okefenokee Swamp are lined with mobile homes. A few are rust-scarred and neglected, but many have gardens and swing sets. Developers carve subdivisions for mobile homes. Plumbers, electricians and hardware stores specialize in their care. In Brantley County, of which Nahunta is the seat, 58 percent of the residences are mobile homes, the densest concentration after neighboring Long County and Eureka County, Nev., the 2000 census said.
The county represents the extreme of a trend confirmed by the census. Over the last two decades, the number of mobile homes doubled as the number of single-family houses grew 30 percent, to 70 million. In 2000, there were nine million occupied mobile homes, slightly less than 1 in 10 of all residences. The nation built one mobile home for every five detached single-family houses. 
Though zoned out of populous cities and suburbs and criticized as storm magnets, mobile homes have spread through the rural reaches of every region of the country, mostly in the South and Southwest. One in five families in South Carolina and New Mexico lives in mobile homes. In chillier Idaho, they account for 12 percent of the housing, the same proportion as in Georgia.
"They're an important part of the housing stock," said John C. Weicher, assistant secretary for housing at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "They provide an opportunity for lower-income families to own their own homes. They're important for rural areas, the elderly, small households and families below median income." 
Low cost and transportability have made mobile homes the lone accessible option for many blue-collar families who gained little ground in the 1980's and 90's. They exchange of less durable housing and long commuting trips for price and space. 
A new mobile home costs an average of $47,0000, not including the lot that more and more owners buy, according to analyses by the Manufactured Housing Institute of America, a group that represents suppliers of mobile homes and homes assembled on site from factory-made modules. Similar new conventional houses costs at least twice as much. 
Mobile homes also signal the outer rim of urban sprawl, said Bruce Katz, director of the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
"People who can't afford to live in the metropolitan counties where they work jump out" to rural communities, Mr. Katz said. They earn too little and disperse too widely to entice builders to follow with houses.
At Coastal Homes in Brunswick, a red-letter banner saying "$19,900" stretches across a small mobile home. "That's a price leader for me," the president of the dealership, Joe Barlow, said. "That's $19,900 where it sits. Delivered and set up, with skirting, air-conditioning and mini-porches, it gets $26,900." 
For $50,000 to $65,000, Mr. Barlow can put a family in four bedrooms with as much space as many houses of the "Ozzie and Harriet" era, minus the attic. 
There are other costs, however. Interest rates on mobile homes installed on land that a family owns tend to run 3 percentage points higher than rates on conventional houses and twice conventional mortgage rates on homes unsecured by land. Values for mobile homes tend to drop as fast as they do for new cars. 
"My buyers are blue-collar workers who have a family income of $35,000 to $55,000," Mr. Barlow said. "That's in the family, because the $35,000 might be two incomes." 
The Brantley County economy turns on two wheels, logging and mobile homes. The median family income here was $35,534 in 2000, according to the census, $15,000 below the national median. The median home value was $60,900, half the national median.
People boast of the fishing, the forests and their lawns but, often, not their mobile homes. "The American dream is to have a nice site-built house," said Jeff Johns, part owner of Johns Realty, Nahunta's leading developer of mobile home sites. "Anything else has a stigma." 
Don Johnson, a tax appraiser whose model is 11 years old, said, "They echo as you walk across the floor." 
This is hurricane country. In the 90's, the Department of Housing and Urban Development imposed new standards on mobile homes, requiring tougher walls and roofs and more "tie-downs," three-foot augerlike devices bored into the ground. But no one here seems ready for a trial run. 
"You're better off in a ditch," said Linda Niece, co-owner of Nahunta Hardware and Building Supplies. 
David Brown, 29, a welder, sat on the stoop of a 13-year-old 24-by-60-foot double wide with clumps of impatiens planted around the base. He and his wife, Shana Widner, a substitute teacher and video store cashier, also 29, earned $43,000 last year. 
"This is not a house," Mr. Brown said. "It's a cheap way of putting a roof over your head." 
For reasons like that, buying a mobile home might violate the conventions of prudent personal finance. 
"But compared to what?" asked R. Eugene Crews, a vice president and the branch manager of the Southeastern Bank who began his adult life in a mobile home. "I got into a furnished home for $7 a foot. A house would have cost $15."
The trade in mobile homes also helps sustain the county. Just outside town is Patsy and Otis Bohanon's Magnolia Trailer Park, which rents 20 mobile homes for $255 to $400 a month. Three years ago, they opened a store to meet the rising demand for mobile home parts.
"Right now, you can't turn down a dirt road and not find a mobile home," Ms. Bohanon said. 
But mobile homes can be a drag, too.
"We have had about 400 mobile homes moving into the county every year for seven or eight years," said Sean Chapman, the county's chief tax appraiser. 
Because a mobile home depreciates, Mr. Chapman said, the county property tax declines an average of $30 a year for each unit. 
"Another problem is keeping track of them," Mr. Chapman said. "A lot of them move."
Because officials here expect mobile homes to continue to proliferate, the county hopes to draw some lines. 
"We have no zoning now," said Bobby Rowell, a county commissioner and the president of the Farm Bureau here. Last year, the county set up a panel on abandoned trailers and limiting the age and condition of newly installed mobile homes. 
"Mobile homes aren't all bad," Mr. Rowell said. "They're ready to move into. They have plumbing, wiring. They're fast and efficient. If we have the right kind of mobile home, it can be positive."

HEADLINE: Governor Says Tax Increase Is Not Cause Of Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 10 

 BODY:
Trying to ease fears that the business-tax increase New Jersey enacted last week may lead to higher unemployment, a defiant Gov. James E. McGreevey today disputed claims by executives of a major department store chain who said higher state taxes had forced them to lay off 50 workers.
 The governor's comments came one day after the executives from Federated Department Stores, the parent company of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, announced that it would trim its 10,000-person work force in New Jersey because its state taxes had been raised to $10 million a year from $4.4 million. 
 But Mr. McGreevey said that the company had begun laying off workers in New Jersey last year, before the business tax plan had even been proposed, and added that he was troubled by the "arrogance" of highly paid executives who would threaten the job security of minimum-wage employees as part of a political battle. The governor said that executives at Federated had been trying for years to skirt state taxes and were apparently angry because his administration would not let them use losses from a bankrupt subsidiary to avoid paying taxes on its profitable operations in New Jersey.
"All that we're asking is that they pay their fair share: not a dollar more, not a dollar less," Mr. McGreevey said today. "But when you have a C.E.O. making $1.5 million and upwards of $14 million in stock options threatening people who are making $25,000, that's what's wrong."
Last week, Mr. McGreevey won approval of a $1 billion increase in business taxes, which he said was necessary to close the loopholes corporate accountants had devised to unfairly shift their tax burden to middle-class families. But many lobbyists and business leaders warned that the increase would dampen the state's weak economy and cost jobs.
On Monday James M. Zimmerman, chief executive of Federated, released a letter to Mr. McGreevey saying that the company would cancel expansion plans and probably close some of its 37 stores in the state because of an "exceedingly unfriendly business environment that now exists in New Jersey."
Mr. McGreevey bristled at the suggestion that his administration was unsympathetic to the business community.
"The business community in this state and this nation know they have a governor who's strongly pro-business," he said. "But we need a little balance, we need a little fairness, we need a little equity."
Carol Sanger, Federated's vice president for corporate affairs, said on Monday that the company's decision to shrink its New Jersey operations was based solely on the tax rise. Company officials did not return calls seeking their reaction to Mr. McGreevey's comments today.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
An advertising forecaster revises his predictions for 2002 downward, pricking a bubble of hope.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE media executive widely deemed the dean of ad-spending forecasters yesterday deflated some of the growing optimism about a recovery this year.
 The executive, Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, revised downward his estimate for ad spending growth in 2002, partly because of the wave of corporate scandals and the continuing decline in stock prices. 
 So even as many forecasters adjust their predictions upward, Mr. Coen now estimates that American ad spending will grow just 2.1 percent in 2002, compared with the 2.4 percent increase he announced in early December. 
The predictions of Mr. Coen are closely followed because he has been tracking ad spending since 1948. Last fall, he was one of a handful of forecasters who predicted ad spending in 2002 would increase from 2001, when advertisers cut budgets for the first time in a decade. 
The credibility accorded Mr. Coen's predictions was demonstrated yesterday when the stock price of Viacom, one of the most advertising-dependent of media companies, dropped 11.5 percent, partly in reaction to his new forecast.
"We're still expecting to see some improvement unless something comes up and bites us," Mr. Coen said yesterday morning at a presentation in Midtown Manhattan sponsored by Universal McCann, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, and the parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies. "But things are coming along slower than we expected, and the stock market problems are a major cause."
"It's more of a psychological effect than absolute," he added, "but it's still impacting on all advertising demand." If consumers are not confident, they will not spend, and if consumers are not spending, marketers will not spend their ad budgets.
Karen R. Ficker, managing director at Advance Consulting in Morristown, N.J., who attended Mr. Coen's presentation at the University Club, said: "Directionally, we're headed the right way. But you need to have corporate confidence that a real economic recovery is under way before advertisers start launching new products they've been delaying."
Mr. Coen said decreased spending by brokers and marketers of mutual funds was one reason he reduced his estimate for 2002 ad spending to a total of $236.2 billion, down from his December estimate of $239.3 billion. Data he compiled for the first quarter showed spending by those advertisers had fallen 31 percent from the first quarter of 2001 -- the sharpest decrease for any nontechnology category.
"With consumer trust such an important issue, companies in the financial category have a wait-and-see attitude" about their ad budgets, said Kathy Kayse, publisher of Money magazine in New York, part of Time Inc., owned by AOL Time Warner. "The dollars are not coming back as quickly as they might have."
Through May, Money's ad pages had declined 32 percent from the first five months of 2001. "By the year-end, I'm anticipating being down 12 to 15 percent," she added, partly because "the comparisons will get easier" between the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2001, when advertisers sharply reduced spending after the terrorist attacks.
Mr. Coen also attributed his decision to reduce his ad-spending forecast to a reluctance among advertisers in big categories like food, computers, airlines and apparel, along with a softness in demand for help-wanted ads in local newspapers; commercials on national cable television networks; and ad pages in national magazines.
Counteracting that downward pull, Mr. Coen predicted, will be ad-spending increases in national media like broadcast network television and radio, as well as local media like yellow pages. Categories like automobiles, beer and wine, beverages and snacks, movies, restaurants and telecommunications, should also post gains, Mr. Coen said.
Mr. Coen's projected increase for 2002 of 2.1 percent is composed of a gain of 1.9 percent in national advertising, down from the 2.5 percent he forecast in December, and a gain of 2.4 percent in local advertising, up from the 2.3 percent he forecast previously.
Turning to ad spending overseas, Mr. Coen predicted 2002 would end with a total of $214 billion, up 2.1 percent from $209.6 billion in 2001. In December, he forecast a total of $226.8 billion for 2002 ad spending outside the United States.
Mr. Coen's estimated total for worldwide ad spending this year is now $450.2 billion, which would be an increase of 2.1 percent from $440.9 billion in 2001.
In his first forecast for ad spending for 2003, Mr. Coen said he saw a return to more historically typical growth levels because "we're in a good recovery" of the general economy that "should carry over quite well into 2003."
Mr. Coen is predicting an increase in worldwide ad spending next year of 5.5 percent, to $475 billion. That is composed of identical 5.5 percent gains in the United States -- to $249.2 billion, which would break the record set in 2000 -- and overseas, to $225.8 billion.
Mr. Coen's forecasts of higher ad spending this year had been welcomed by Madison Avenue because ad spending last year fell 6.5 percent, to $231.3 billion from the record $247.5 billion spent in 2000. That downturn was the largest since a decline of 8.1 percent suffered in the Depression year of 1938.
"When everyone else said 'down' in December, he saw there would be a recovery and said 'up,' " said Leland A. Westerfield, a media analyst at UBS Warburg in New York, who attended the presentation.
Mr. Westerfield's forecast for 2002 is for a gain of 1 percent compared with Mr. Coen's 2.1 percent. David Peeler, president and chief executive at CMR, the division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending, recently revised his forecast upward, to a gain of 2.5 percent from a gain of 1.5 percent. Lauren Rich Fine, analyst for Merrill Lynch, also recently revised her forecst upward, to an increase of 0.4 percent from a decrease of 1.5 percent.
"It's all fine tuning," said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at West End Communications/Consulting in New York, who also attended the presentation. "The business has been down so long, this looks like up to me."

HEADLINE: Study Finds Steady Overruns in Public Projects 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WILSON 

 BODY:
Cost overruns for large public works projects have stayed largely constant for most of the last century, according to a study of 258 projects published this week in The Journal of the American Planning Association.
 When predicting the expenses of transportation projects, economic forecasters and project promoters in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have made underestimates costing the public hundreds of billions of dollars, said Bent Flyvbjerg, a professor at Aalborg University in Denmark who wrote the study. 
 Project estimates between 1910 and 1998 were short of the final costs an average of 28 percent, the study found. The biggest errors were in rail projects, which ran, on average, 45 percent over estimated costs. Bridges and tunnels were 34 percent over; roads, 20 percent. Nine of 10 estimates were low, the study said. 
The study also noted that estimates are no more accurate now than they were 90 years ago.
"No learning is taking place among the professionals doing these budgets," Mr. Flyvbjerg said.
"Either the people who do the budgets are incredibly stupid, but this is highly unlikely," he added. "The other possibility is they manipulated the budgets to make sure the projects are approved." 
Alan Altshuler, a professor of urban policy and planning at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, applauded the study -- while stopping short of branding contractors as liars. 
"The whole structure of incentives is extremely strong to underestimate costs," he said. "The temptation is very strong to take the most optimistic view because it's helpful in getting the project approved."
Martin Wachs, a professor of city and regional planning at the University of California at Berkeley, agreed that large projects were particularly vulnerable to underestimates. "You have to make some assumptions of the future in preparing a forecast," he said. "Why not develop a forecast that supports a particular position?"
Public awareness of underestimated costs remains low, the study found, in part because news coverage is inconsistent, Mr. Altshuler said. The time between the first estimate and project completion -- up to 20 years in some cases -- can span generations in some newsrooms. 
A New York project in the study is the Holland Tunnel, completed in 1927 at a cost of $48 million. Mr. Flyvbjerg said initial estimates for the project were 52 percent lower.
The Channel tunnel between England and France came in 80 percent over budget. Boston's Big Dig -- to put the city's major highways underground -- which began 15 years ago with a projected cost of $4.5 billion now has a price of $14.6 billion. 
Mr. Flyvbjerg suggested more openness in the estimate process. The more public awareness and participation, the more accurate the estimate might become, he said. 
The study, though, found little incentive for change. Mr. Flyvbjerg said he had difficulty getting builders to discuss the subject. "People run away screaming," he said. "It doesn't look good for the profession."

HEADLINE: Report Disputes Bush Approach to Bridging 'Digital Divide' 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, the Bush administration announced good news: The "digital divide" between those who had access to computer and Internet technology and those who did not was narrowing. Then it proposed deleting two major programs that were designed in part to bridge the divide.
 Since then, supporters of the programs have rallied to save them, and today a coalition of civil rights and policy groups is releasing a study that re-examines the data used by the Commerce Department and comes to very different conclusions about the digital divide and the need for government to address it. 
 According to the report, "Bringing a Nation Online: The Importance of Federal Leadership," differences are indeed narrowing, and about half of Americans are online. But, the report says, "significant divides still exist between high and low income households, among different racial groups, between Northern and Southern states, and rural and urban households." 
While about 67 percent of Americans who earn $50,000 to $75,000 a year and about 80 percent of those earning more than $75,000 a year use the Internet at home, the report said, only 25 percent of people in households with less than $15,000 in annual income and 33 percent with incomes $15,000 to $35,000 do so.
The report was financed by the Ford Foundation. 
Schools and libraries provide Internet access, but advocates of the government programs say that home access opens up the true Internet benefits and that education programs provide the impetus for people to bring the technology home -- "the exposure that makes you go home and say, 'We've got to get one of those,' " said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of marketing and e-commerce at Vanderbilt University.
The two programs at issue are the Education Department's Community Technology Centers Program, which helps finance computer activity centers for students and adult education, and the Commerce Department's Technology Opportunities Program, which provides money and services to organizations that need a technology boost. Beneficiaries include groups like America's Second Harvest, a nationwide network of food banks, which uses the technology to track its donations and affiliates' needs.
The two programs had expected to receive about $45 million in the fiscal 2003 budget.
Amy Call of the Office of Management and Budget said that programs like Technology Opportunities had been created when "the Internet was an unknown" for most people, and that prices for computer equipment and training had dropped so much that the programs had, essentially, outlived their purpose.
Such arguments anger supporters of the programs.
"We're five years, maybe seven years into the Internet age and they're acting as if it's a mature industry and we know all the answers -- it's absurd," said Larry Irving, a Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration.
Phil Shapiro, a technology access advocate in Washington who works with many community computing centers, argued that progress in bridging the digital divide would be lost if government financing ended.
"If you water a plant and then decide to stop watering it," Mr. Shapiro said, "the result is the same as if you never watered it in the first place."
But Nancy J. Victory, the assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information, said administration policy focused on improving the economy through tax breaks and more aggressive depreciation schedules.
"The first prong of attack in trying to get services available to as many people as possible is to create the right environment so people have access to those products and services and have the means of purchasing them," she said.

HEADLINE: Profit Declines 1% At SunTrust Banks 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 10 

 BODY:
SunTrust Banks Inc. said today that profit fell 1 percent in the second quarter after it increased its provision for bad loans. 
 Net income totaled $343.7 million, or $1.20 a share, down from $347.1 million, or $1.19, in the comparable period last year. 
Higher investment banking fees and a rise in deposits helped offset the $111 million the bank, which is based in Atlanta, reserved for loan losses, almost triple the amount in the comparable quarter last year. 
 The chief executive, L. Phillip Humann, said a sluggish economy would prompt more loan losses. SunTrust wrote off $16.3 million to units of the bankrupt Enron Corporation in the second quarter and is owed $76 million by the Adelphia Communications Corporation, bank officials said. Bad loans have "by no means gone away as an issue," Mr. Humann said on a call with investors and analysts. The bank may face "further modest deterioration in credit quality" the rest of the year. 
At the end of June, SunTrust raised by 15 percent, to $497.2 million, the amount of loans it expected might not be repaid. The bank -- the ninth-largest in the United States, with $108 billion of assets -- also wrote off $83 million in commercial loans, more than three times the amount in the quarter last year.

Ad Resurgence Helps Buoy Latest Figures from Yahoo

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 10 

 BODY:
Yahoo Inc., the search engine turned Internet advertising hub, posted quarterly sales and profit figures today that exceeded the projections of Wall Street analysts. 
 The company, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., also increased its own earlier estimates for its performance for the year's second half, asserting that its capacity to attract advertising is reviving after a dismal decline in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. 
 On a day in which the stock market otherwise faltered -- and amid a time of great struggles for some corporate stalwarts -- Wall Street analysts said that Yahoo's performance signaled a bright spot, though not a wholly unexpected one. Still, the analysts added that given the rough economic environment over all, Yahoo would continue to find itself in a struggle to maintain its momentum. 
"Yahoo has to fight tooth and nail for every bit of market share it gains and every iota of cash flow it generates," said Jordan Rohan, a media analyst at SoundView Technology Group, but he added that the company was nevertheless performing as well as any online media competitor. He said the company's growth in advertising sales was "dispelling the myth that online advertising is down for the count."
Over all, the company reported a second-quarter profit of $21.4 million, or 3 cents a share. That compares with the 2 cents a share projected by a consensus of Wall Street analysts, and with a loss of 9 cents a share for the quarter a year ago.
The profits came on sales of $225.8 million, a rise from sales of $182.2 million a year ago.
Yahoo executives said the increase was all the more significant because of the way it was achieved: the company had increases in revenue from services like premium e-mail, from listings like classified ads and from taking a cut of the transactions made on the site.
The three areas, which Yahoo cited last November as integral to its growth, represented 40 percent of its sales. The company also noted that it had a million customers who were paying for things like the personals service or were paying for e-mail, an increase from the 600,000 who were using such services in the previous quarter.
That measure got mixed reviews from Wall Street analysts. Mr. Rohan said the figures suggested that Yahoo was finding sustainable and predictable forms of revenue. But some analysts questioned whether Yahoo had tried to diversify itself too much and might overextend itself in an effort to get the heady revenue levels it achieved during the boom time.
Pay services aside, it was its advertising base that Yahoo said was most revived, and that may have greater significance for the online ad market in general. The company said its sales from advertising -- which Yahoo calls marketing services -- was $136 million in the quarter. That is an increase of 12 percent from the previous quarter. But it is a decrease of 4 percent from the quarter last year.
Susan L. Decker, the chief financial officer, said that the second quarter last year had included some contracts from the Internet bubble. Since those contracts expired as last year went on, they will no longer provide a basis for comparison for Yahoo's quarterly reports, she said.
"The unwinding of bubble business is now behind us," she asserted, adding that the second half of 2002 would be "relatively clean," a term that means it will not be hampered by comparisons with quarters buoyed by bubble inflation.
Yahoo said it expected its sales for its full fiscal year to be $900 million to $940 million, an increase over the projection three months ago of more than $870 million to $910 million.
"The marketing services is going to turn in the second half," said Gordon Hodge, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners, "as we had hoped. This is a nice little piece of good news."

HEADLINE: By 2010, AIDS May Leave 20 Million African Orphans 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 10 

 BODY:
AIDS will leave 20 million children in Africa without one or both parents by 2010, the 14th International AIDS Conference was told here today. That is nearly double the current number, 11 million.
 The report, which assumes that treatment will not be made widely available soon, also said that by 2010, AIDS will have orphaned five million children elsewhere in the world. 
 For the purposes of the report, researchers defined orphans as children younger than 15 who had lost one or both parents. 
The orphan report "without doubt is one of the most shocking reports to come out at the conference," which has produced several grim assessment, Dr. Peter Piot, an under secretary general of the United Nations and head of its AIDS program, said at a news conference today.
The report was issued jointly by the United Nations program on AIDS; by Unicef, the United Nations children's fund; and by the United States Agency for International Development with statistical assistance from the Census Bureau. Officials from the agencies said theirs was the first unified effort to provide a consistent set of figures and was the most comprehensive report on children orphaned by H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. 
"Even if by some miracle the spread of H.I.V. stopped today," said Dr. Anne Peterson, an official of the Agency for International Development, "the number of orphans would still rise for a decade" because parents who are already infected will die in the next few years.
If the epidemic had not occurred, orphan rates would be declining in Africa, according to the report. In fact, the report estimates, the number of orphans from all causes will remain stable in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean over the next decade, at the current level of 107 million. But in Africa, the overall number of orphans is expected to rise, to 42 million, from 34.3 million today.
The United Nations has said that the virus is spreading so rapidly in many areas that 45 million people will become infected by 2010 if anti-H.I.V. therapy is not made widely available soon. Forty million people around the world are now infected, and an estimated 20 million people have died of AIDS-related causes.
Most AIDS orphans are not infants when their parents die; they usually are of school age and "can only watch as one parent, then often the other, gradually grows ill and dies," with little planning for the children's future, the report said.
Many of the 17,000 participants at the conference agreed with Dr. Piot's concern about the problem. One participant, Dr. Stefano Vella, president of the International AIDS Society, which is one of the sponsors of the conference, said more money was needed to treat infected mothers during labor to help prevent transmission of the virus to their babies. He also said that the therapy should be sustained in order to keep the mothers alive as long as possible. 
Even orphans who escape infection at birth are likely to become a group at high risk for acquiring the virus as they grow up, he said, because many will be poor, drop out of school and suffer abuse and stigma.
As AIDS has broken up the traditional family structure, more children are caring for children and orphans for orphans, participants said.
Although the report provides statistics from 88 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, it excludes India "because we weren't able to get the data, quite frankly," said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of Unicef. India has the second-largest number of H.I.V.-infected people in the world, after South Africa.
Ms. Bellamy said the orphan crisis, while severe, had not yet reached the point where officials were recommending international adoptions.
Nor did the report recommend orphanages as an appropriate first-line response to the problem, describing them as expensive and as often failing to meet the developmental and long-term needs of children. Experience has shown that orphaned children benefit more from the care and personal attention that families and communities can provide, according to the report.
Sometimes, however, extended families are unable to take in the orphans, who are then sent to different households and experience a second profound loss through the separation.
In a separate report today, the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Association, a private foundation in Switzerland, gave a much higher estimate of future AIDS orphans, at 100 million -- although that number was mentioned without a definite time frame. Neil Monk, its author, said that because he had not seen the United Nations report before today, he would withhold comment until he had a chance to read it.
To help prevent transmission of the virus from mothers to their infants, the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and a coalition of private foundations announced here that they had given the first 12 grants from a $50 million program for care and treatment of infected mothers, fathers and children at 40 sites in eight African and Asian countries.
Also, the United Nations Foundation and the Ad Council said they would begin a public service advertising campaign that would profile AIDS orphans to raise money and awareness of their plight.

HEADLINE: 6 Plans for Ground Zero Share Striking Similarities 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Born of a tragedy, the redevelopment of the World Trade Center was supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some of the brightest urban planners to come up with breathtaking innovations and urban solutions to fix what has been wrong with Lower Manhattan for decades.
 But the planners envisioning the future of the site have had to grapple with a latticework of financial considerations and commercial development objectives, which has resulted in some remarkable similarities for the six preliminary site plans that are to be released next Tuesday. 
 Directors of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, city and state officials, and executives at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have declined to discuss the proposals publicly. People involved in the process have been sworn to secrecy.
But in interviews with developers, planners and executives who have seen the plans, it has become clear that all six proposals started not with blank slates and lofty dreams, but rather with a set of givens: a relatively dense 11 million square feet of office space -- the equivalent of five Empire State Buildings -- 600,000 square feet of retail space and an 800-room hotel. 
Each plan sets aside land for a substantial memorial to the 2,823 victims killed in the attack, although the exact sizes of the memorials vary. 
Many of the proposals include a museum and one or two other cultural institutions, but none include the apartment houses that some planners and local residents say are essential in creating a 24-hour neighborhood. With nearly one out of every five floors of downtown office space vacant and little need for new skyscrapers, advocates suggest that more emphasis should be put on residential and cultural development. 
"The redevelopment of the trade center site has not been a matter of planning from scratch, but of planning within a serious set of fiscal and political constraints," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.
"The real challenge is to overcome the constraints and to recognize that the plans should be geared to the future, not the past. This is a once-in-a-century opportunity to rebuild Lower Manhattan with new transportation, housing and open spaces, as well as creative commercial development."
Perhaps the most restrictive piece of the latticework has been the desire of the Port Authority, which owns the land, to get commercial development that would continue to generate more than $120 million a year in revenue from the site.
Then there is Larry A. Silverstein, who with his partner, Westfield America, a shopping-mall operator, gained control of the trade center last July. By their contract, which it is hard if not impossible to ignore, he has the right to rebuild what was there and more. 
The Port Authority must also contend with the psychic wounds from the attack and the desire for a memorial.
Another element common to all six proposals, several executives say, is the rebuilding of the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, on which Gov. George E. Pataki insisted. Mr. Pataki, who established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation as a coordinating group and controls the New York side of the Port Authority, is the pivotal public figure in the process. 
Finally, there is an unknown financial barrier: a long list of proposals with multibillion-dollar price tags. Government officials say that at some point they will run out of money.
Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and Mr. Pataki's chief of economic development, acknowledged that the authority had "an economic interest" in the site. Mr. Gargano said the critical thing to do now was to identify the size and location of the memorial park. 
"We're still a long way off from a market for those office buildings," he said. "But we should be moving forward quickly on the transportation projects, which are key to saving Lower Manhattan."
Four of the six proposals call for building on part of the south tower's footprint, a volatile issue for the families of victims, who believe it is sacred ground. 
And all of the proposals allow for the restoration of at least two streets -- Greenwich and Fulton -- that crossed the trade center site before it was built in the 1970's. Many planners and local residents, however, have sought to rebuild all the streets, including Dey and Cortlandt.
People involved in the process said that one of the six proposals to be made public next week came from Mr. Silverstein and Westfield, while another is from John E. Zuccotti, chairman of Brookfield Financial Properties, which owns the World Financial Center.
Every plan envisions depressing a stretch of West Street, the seven-lane highway that forms a barrier between the western edge of the trade center site and the World Financial Center and Battery Park City. Above the buried highway would be a quiet street with a broad leafy median intersected by east-west streets that connect Battery Park City with the rest of Lower Manhattan. The estimated cost of burying West Street ranges from hundreds of millions to $2 billion.
The six plans vary on the size of the memorial and the exact site of the office buildings, the retail space and a new permanent PATH station linking New Jersey with Lower Manhattan and the city's subway system, according to several people who have seen the proposals.
Designs by David Childs, the architect for Mr. Silverstein and Westfield, call for five office towers, cultural and community buildings, a five-acre memorial and a vast retail complex, partly underground.
But underground shopping could conflict with the desires of those who would prefer more curbside stores to enhance street life. The plans also conflict with suggestions to move the PATH station eastward to Church Street, where it would allow for expanded trains to and from New Jersey and greater links to the city's subway system.
"Too much of the planning and thinking has been driven by the short-term demands of Silverstein and Westfield, rather than good planning for Lower Manhattan," said Craig Whitaker, an architect who teaches urban planning at New York University.
Mr. Whitaker and 11 urban planning students tackled many of these issues in a report, "Next Steps, Hard Choices," that calls for restoring most streets across the site, with seven office buildings along Vesey and Church Streets. Seven smaller buildings, which combine retail and cultural institutions at the ground level and apartments above, would ring a memorial. That would provide a more fitting context for the memorial, Mr. Whitaker said, than tall office towers would. 
The proposal also calls for moving the PATH station to Church Street and depressing West Street from the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel north to Chambers Street. The street above the highway would have a grassy median like Commonwealth Avenue in Boston. A garage for tourist buses could be built beneath the memorial. 
Mr. Silverstein declined to comment on the specifics, but he said he had confidence in the process. "It appears that the aim of all this is accomplish the best development plans for the 16 acres," he said.
The blueprint for rebuilding Lower Manhattan will take shape in the next five months. The Port Authority and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation are expected to winnow the proposals to three in September and adopt a final plan in December, which may or may not resemble the original proposals.
In the meantime, Imagine New York, a network of civic and community organizations that has planned a series of meetings to generate discussion on the topic, has invited 5,000 people to a discussion on July 20 of the six proposals and alternatives at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The group hopes to have an impact on the final plan. 
"This all started with a series of constraints, not a blank slate," said Holly Leicht, co-director of Imagine New York and director of design, planning and advocacy for the Municipal Art Society. 
"We have to live with the fact that the Port owns the land and Silverstein has a lease. But I hope it's still open-ended enough for planners and the public to weigh in in a meaningful way."
One downtown landlord said it remained unclear whether both residential and commercial development would occur on the site because of Mr. Silverstein's legal dispute with his insurance company over the attack. 
If he wins his case against his insurers and gets $6.7 billion, Mr. Silverstein brings too much money to the redevelopment plan to ignore. If he loses, he will receive $3.5 billion, and some real estate executives and state officials say the Port Authority could reach a settlement with him and scrap the contract and its requirements for office space, retail space and the hotel.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site, and a chart of planning events, misidentified the organization that is planning a "town hall" meeting on July 20 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. It is the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York, not Imagine New York. 

GRAPHIC: Chart: "WHAT HAPPENS NEXT -- Working Toward a Rebuilding Plan" SCHEDULE FOR DEVELOPING AN OFFICIAL SITE PLAN Tuesday, July 16: Six preliminary land-use plans for the 16-acre World Trade Center site at the Federal Hall National Memorial at Wall and Nassau Streets will be released publicly, beginning a period of public comment on the plans. Wednesday, July 17: The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation board will have its regular meeting. Saturday, July 20: A town-hall meeting of 5,000 people will be held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to discuss the plans and the planning process, under the sponsorship of Imagine New York, a network of civic and community organizations seeking to generate broad public discussion of the rebuilding plans. Monday, July 22: The six plans will be put on display at Federal Hall National Monument; the exhibit will last through early September. September: Out of the six plans and the resulting public comment, three semifinal plans will be produced.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL; 
Frustrated, Bud? There Are Ways to Avoid a Repeat

BYLINE:  By Jack Curry

 BODY:
As Commissioner Bud Selig searched for a solution that would help him end the All-Star Game on Tuesday night in any manner but a dreadful tie, he raised his hands above his shoulders in exasperation. He looked like a driver who put his foot on the brakes of a rusted economy car, but was still propelled into his neighbor's new luxury sedan. What should I do now?
 Poor Bud. This game was his party, his chance to beam. Selig is presiding over a sport that could have another work stoppage in weeks, a disturbing reality. But Selig wanted a few hours of bliss in Miller Park, the snazzy stadium he helped bring to his beloved Milwaukee. He got a few hours, but it must have felt like a few seconds. 
 After both managers told Selig they needed to protect their last pitchers, he ended the game with a 7-7 tie in 11 innings and heard thousands of people in his living room vilify his choice with their expansive lungs. It was a terrible finish to a promising night and left everyone debating Selig's actions and what could have been done differently. Some were serious and some were playful.
"I don't know how we could have broken the tie," said Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox. "Maybe we could pick the fastest guys and raced. Or flipped a coin. Maybe we could do it like in soccer, those kickoffs. Yeah, those penalty kicks. Do that on the side. You could have tie breaker with the most hits."
Stop. At least Konerko was polite enough to attempt an answer. But there are some changes that could be enacted in the future to prevent another tie and there are some things that should have been done to make Tuesday less irksome. Bud, put the car in park and consider these suggestions.
THREE-INNING STINTS The pitchers who start the All-Star Game should be expected to last at least three innings, and maybe as many as four. Curt Schilling and Derek Lowe pitched two innings each, a breeze. The last time both starters went three was when Roger Clemens and Dwight Gooden did it in 1986. Time to turn back the clock and turn up the pitch count.
THE AMERICAN WAY No one wants to see Freddy Garcia hit, as he did on Tuesday, so the game should always include a designated hitter. Lowe and Schilling were removed so they would not have to bat. I hate the D.H., but it works in this format and will allow pitchers to stay in the game longer.
NOT LITTLE LEAGUE It is time to stiffen the strategies and deal with the fact that some All-Stars, especially some pitchers in storage, might not play. Torre and Brenly are nice guys, so they wanted to play their entire 30-man rosters, a decision that backfired on them. It is their responsibility to save a pitcher so the game could have continued.
USE TAXI SQUAD In case you do run out of players, pick a four-man taxi-squad consisting of two pitchers, a utility player and a catcher. They should be first- or second-year major leaguers who would be thrilled with the assignment. These players would only be in uniform on the day of the game. If they are needed in an emergency, they are used. If not, they got a great seat.
SECOND CHANCES Give the managers the flexibility of using a player or a pitcher again after he has been removed. Other than the rubber-armed David Wells, it is doubtful any pitchers would do this. But the position players would. If Jason Giambi singled and was the potential tying run in the ninth, how cool would it be if Alfonso Soriano (who had left the game in the fourth inning) could pinch-run? 
HONORARY ALL-STARS Pitchers who start on the Sunday before the game can be named as All-Stars, but they do not count on the roster. Torre was worried about picking Oakland's Barry Zito because of this conflict and it haunted him as Zito faced only one batter. Zito is an All-Star, but a rested pitcher could have helped the game advance to the 12th inning.
PUT A RUNNER ON If everyone detests the idea of playing extra innings, let both teams start the 10th with a runner on first. If no one scores, move him to second in the 11th and third in the 12th. This is not ideal and will make purists grimace, but it is an exhibition and anything that produces a winner is better than a tie.
ALWAYS AN M.V.P. Baseball made a savvy move in naming its most valuable player award after the late Ted Williams, but then declined to present it Tuesday night because of concern that fans would boo the presentation. In this instance, baseball needed a little more fortitude. Barry Bonds and Williams have been cited as perhaps the two best left fielders in history, and Bonds should have received the Williams award last night. 
TURN P.A. OFF Never again tell over 41,000 fans in the middle of an inning that the game will be over if a team fails to score in that inning. Major League Baseball should have waited until after the 11th ended and then asked Robin Yount, an icon in Milwaukee, to take the microphone. Yount could have explained why the game was being halted and fewer fans would have booed.
THANK THE FANS In a frustrating situation like Tuesday's, baseball should have been shrewd enough to offer fans something in return for not getting to see a complete game. Autorgaphed items, tickets to another game, something. An official should set aside some memorabilia for this purpose from now on in case there is another bizarre ending.

HEADLINE: Japan Carves Out Major Role in China's Auto Future 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 10 

 BODY:
In what may be the first big step toward China's emergence as a major source of automobiles, Honda Motor of Japan announced today that it would build the first car plant there dedicated to exports.
 The new plant will be able to turn out as many as 50,000 vehicles a year, starting in 2004, the company said. Hiroyuki Yoshino, Honda's president, told reporters that the quality of cars built at the plant would match those made in Japan, but that production costs in China would be 20 percent lower. 
 The announcement comes at a time when all of Japan's five largest automakers have unveiled ambitious plans to expand production in China and serve the rapidly growing domestic market there, augmenting or replacing cars they now ship from Japan. Taking advantage of China's low labor costs -- one-twentieth of those in Japan -- the new Japanese investments could make China a car-exporting power by 2010, analysts said. 
"China today is our No. 1 geographic priority in terms of market development," Carlos Ghosn, president of Nissan Motor, said last month in Beijing, where he was attending the annual motor show. "Over the next 5 to 10 years, China will have the highest growth in all our markets."
And as it happens, the first consignment of Chinese cars exported to the United States is due to arrive in Florida in two weeks. The 252 Xiali sedans, built by the Tianjin Auto Group, are to be re-exported to Mexico, not sold in the United States, but the importer, American Automobile Network Holdings, hopes to win United States safety and emissions certificates for the Xiali so that it can market the model in the United States next year. 
The shipment has not escaped notice in Tokyo, where car executives still remember American complacency 30 years ago in the face of imports with exotic names like Toyota and Honda.
Honda already produces about 60,000 vehicles a year in China for local sale, and officials said at the Beijing auto show that they planned to double that output by next March at the existing plant, a joint venture in Guangzhou that builds a mix of Accord sedans and Odyssey minivans. The new export plant will probably be built in the same area. 
While Honda's Japanese rivals have not yet announced export plans, they, too, are jumping in or stepping up Chinese production ventures. At the show, Katsumi Nakamura, the new head of Nissan's China office, unveiled the Paladin, a sport utility vehicle to be built by a joint venture, Zhengzhou Nissan Automobile, beginning next year. The Xinhua news agency reported today that Nissan is also talking to Dongfeng Motor about jointly producing 150,000 vehicles a year by 2005.
"Everybody wants to get in on the ground floor, they don't want to miss the action later on," Christopher Richter, an auto analyst for HSBC Securities, said in Tokyo. "Eventually, the Japanese will use China as an export platform."
Automakers call Japan's market mature, a euphemism for stagnant, and they have more plant capacity in Japan than they need. In contrast, China's market is immature, shop talk for fast-growing. Forecasters expect car sales there to top one million this year and keep growing at double-digit annual rates for the rest of the decade. "In terms of automakers' investment, nobody is investing in carmaking capacity here," Mr. Richter said of Japan. "They are all either spending their money in the States or in China."
The main foreign player in China now is Volkswagen, whose joint venture has about half the car market. Among the American concerns, General Motors has the biggest presence; its joint venture, Shanghai GM, has built and sold Buick and Chevrolet cars since the late 1990's, and last month G.M. bought a stake in SAIC-Wuling Automotive, a light truck maker. DaimlerChrysler assembles Jeeps in China, while Ford Motor has a stake in Jiangling Motors, a car and truck maker.
Toyota Motor, the leading manufacturer in Japan, has a market share in China of just 1 percent, but it has set an ambitious goal of expanding it tenfold by 2010.
At the Beijing show, along with showing off its Japan-built cars, Toyota unveiled its first model for Chinese production, based on the Vitz compact sedan, which is not marketed in the United States. Some 30,000 of the cars will be built each month by Tianjin, now a subsidiary of First Automotive Works, known as F.A.W. Toyota is negotiating with F.A.W., China's largest domestic car company, over a broader alliance that may include a luxury model as well.
"Toyota is enlarging the Vitz for the China market, adding navigation equipment, so they are coming in with their very best product," said Michael J. Dunne, director of Automotive Resources Asia, a car markets consultancy based in Beijing.
Suzuki Motor and Mitsubishi Motor also have China plans. Suzuki wants to double its output of subcompacts to 100,000 by 2005, while Mitsubishi expects to begin building the Pajero Sport in partnership with Beijing Jeep. 
Rolf Eckrodt, Mitsubishi's new president, told his company's annual shareholder meeting in Tokyo on June 25 that the project, which will turn out 10,000 cars a year to start, "is a great chance to take part in the future growth of this huge market." Neither Mitsubishi nor Suzuki has spoken of building vehicles in China for export.
Some voices in Japan say the carmakers should think twice about building more cars there at all. They say that shipping cars to China from Japan is about to become much easier and cheaper. With China's entry into the World Trade Organization this year, import quotas are to be abolished and tariffs cut in stages, reducing the duty on cars from around 100 percent today to 25 percent by 2006. And, these people say, people who are affluent enough to afford a car are likely to prefer a made-in-Japan label over made-in-China, according to an essay published in June by C. H. Kwan, a senior fellow at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, a Japanese government research bureau. 
His view echoed wider Japanese industrial insecurity about China. Japan's economic ministry this year surveyed executives at 102 Japanese companies operating overseas about Chinese technical prowess. Only 17 percent said they thought their Chinese rivals were up to Japanese levels now, but 48 percent thought they would be in five years.
But Japanese manufacturers do not trust the government to deftly handle the increasingly crucial trade relationship with China. Last year, after conservative farming interests succeeded in pushing the government to restrict imports of leeks, mushrooms and tatami mat rushes from China, China responded with high duties on Japanese cars, computers and cellphones.
"The whole vegetable spat sent a signal to them that maybe they could not import cars into China," Mr. Richter said of the manufacturers. Though the trade dispute was defused in December after a nine-month standoff, many manufacturers hesitate to count on ready access to the Chinese market from Japan.
And from the China side, few people think Beijing will allow a flood of imports to swamp its domestic carmakers, any more than have South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia -- or for that matter, Japan.
"Across Asia, car imports as a share of total sales is less than 5 percent," Mr. Dunne said. "I don't expect the story to be any different in China."
Instead, he predicted that new joint-venture production would make the market intensely competitive, with the number of models exploding from 20 today to 70 in a few years. "Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Fiat -- they will all be here," Mr. Dunne said. "China will go from a seller's market to a buyer's market."
The Suzuki joint venture has already cut the price of its compact sedan twice this year, most recently by 15 percent, in an effort to step up sales volume.
A price war would savage what are now fairly fat profit margins on cars in China, but Japanese manufacturers are expected to hold up well in such a battle. 
Mr. Dunne said he expected the combined share of the market for Japanese manufacturers to rise to about 40 percent over the next five years, from about 25 percent now. "They have dealerships everywhere in China," he said. "People know Toyota, Nissan and Honda. By 2010, they will be making China a major exporter, like Korea, like Japan."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
S.&P.500 and Nasdaq Fall to Levels Last Seen in 1997

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The worst bear market in a generation deepened yesterday as stocks plunged for the second day, leaving two major indexes at their lowest levels since 1997.
 Corporate accounting scandals, global political instability and questions about the strength of the recovery have combined to produce a smog of fear over the market. Many of the same investors who two years ago viewed Wall Street as a risk-free way to make money now see it as a dangerous place that can destroy fortunes and wreck retirement plans. 
 Just as the boom of the late 1990's pushed shares to irrational highs, the current drop is causing investors to flee even from reasonably priced stocks, said James W. Paulsen, the chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management, which is based in San Francisco and manages $25 billion in stock. The bear market, he said, "has started to take on a life of its own; it builds on itself." 
Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a crucial gauge of the market's performance, fell 32.36 points, or 3.4 percent, to 920.47, its lowest level since November 1997. The S.& P. 500 has fallen 40 percent since its peak in March 2000, compared with a 48 percent decline for the bear market of 1973 and 1974. The index needed eight years to retrace that drop.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 282.59 points yesterday, or more than 3 percent, closing at 8,813.50. The Nasdaq composite index skidded 35.11 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,346.01, its lowest level since May 1997. In the last two years, the Nasdaq has lost almost three-quarters of its value, the worst performance by a major market index since the Depression. Many technology stocks have fared even worse.
Yet even after wrenching declines, most stocks are still not cheap by historical standards. Depending on who is calculating it and what definition is used, the S.& P. 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 16 to 20, slightly above its historical average. Although relatively few companies have warned of weaker-than-expected profits or growth in advance of second-quarter earnings announcements, which begin later this month, investors appear concerned that more warnings are coming.
As a result, the conservative investors who stayed on the sidelines during the bubble and today have cash available are not putting that money into stocks. Instead, they are buying bonds, which rose strongly yesterday.
"The market itself is not statistically cheap," said Scott M. Black, president of Delphi Management in Boston, which oversees $1.5 billion in stocks. "We way overshot it in the 1990's, and now there is a fundamental lack of earning power."
Since Sept. 11, the market has repeatedly tried and failed to rally, adding to discontent. During the 1990's, the prolonged bull market trained investors to "buy on the dips," because stocks seemed to bounce back quickly every time they fell for more than a few days. Now, some professionals seem to be selling into any rallies, disappointing small investors who are hoping to recoup losses they have suffered.
A fall in drug company shares, which have been battered recently, ignited yesterday's decline, and the selling quickly spread. But the panic selling and very heavy trading volume that big investors say can signal the end of a down move was absent.
Instead of that "capitulation," as professional traders call it, stocks ground steadily lower, and the indexes ended just above their lows for the session. The biggest losers included bellwethers like Pfizer, General Electric and Citigroup.
Wall Street's disappointment with President Bush's speech about corporate responsibility on Tuesday contributed to the decline, strategists said. Tobias M. Levkovich, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said Mr. Bush had lots of harsh words but offered few concrete steps to prevent scandals.
"There's disappointment that there wasn't something meaty to his comments, aside from the fact that people have to play by the rules," Mr. Levkovich said.
Mr. Black said the accounting scandals had caused a crisis in confidence. Especially disturbing is the fact that many corporations facing questions are "old bellwether companies, the bluest of the blue chips," like Xerox and Merck, he said.
Still, Mr. Bush's comments were only part of the reason that the market plunged, Mr. Levkovich, other strategists and investors said. "You've just got this downward momentum that's kind of overwhelming people's thought patterns," Mr. Levkovich said.
Mark Greenberg, the manager of the $1 billion Invesco Leisure Fund, said he thought that American and foreign economies were improving.
"But I don't think investors are focusing on that," he said. "They're upset about corporate wrongdoing and wondering where the other shoe will drop. They obviously don't want to own stocks right now."
The Invesco fund, based in Denver, is among the best-performing mutual funds over the last five years, with an average annual gain of 15.5 percent, compared with the S.& P.'s average annual gain of 2.3 percent. Mr. Greenberg said he thought many stocks in his portfolio had been unfairly damaged over the last month.
For example, Valassis Communications, a coupon-printing company and a longtime favorite of Mr. Greenberg, has fallen 13 percent since the end of May, even as Wall Street estimates of its profit have not changed. Valassis, which has grown steadily, now has a price-earnings ratio of 15, he said.
"There's a lot of companies that I go through in my portfolio that are like that," he said.
Among the biggest losers yesterday were seven Canadian or European companies that will be removed from the S.& P. 500 index, which is supposed to consist of American stocks. Royal Dutch Petroleum, the biggest company to be removed, fell $5.16, or 9.2 percent, to $50.73. On the other hand, the seven companies that will replace them, including Goldman Sachs and eBay, gained an average of 2 percent. --------------------

Treasury Prices Gain
(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bonds rose yesterday on expectations the Federal Reserve would delay interest rate increases until 2003 and as stock declines bolstered the allure of government debt.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased 27/32, to 101 30/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.62 percent from 4.73 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year bond rose 1 2/32, to 100 16/32, yielding 5.34 percent, compared with 5.41 percent in the previous session.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year inflation notes.

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 10 

 BODY:
As investors and politicians in the United States recoil from the collapse of WorldCom and other telecommunications companies, Europeans are nursing their own feelings of outrage and betrayal.
 Spurred in many cases by their own governments, Europeans in recent years put their money into the stocks of former state-owned telephone monopolies as those companies were spun off as commercial, competitive enterprises with global ambitions. For a period in the late 1990's, those stocks soared and European investors -- often first-time stock players -- had a taste of capitalism at its best. 
 But since the market bubble burst in early 2000, Europe's telecommunications giants have lost half a trillion dollars in market value. Investors here are realizing too late that those big, seemingly solid telephone companies -- household names like British Telecommunications, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom -- were actually high-risk bets. 
"I had reached the age where you worry that your pension may not be enough," said Monica Wiesler-Frisch, a 54-year-old retired social worker here. She bought about $6,000 worth of shares in Deutsche Telekom, Germany's former government-owned phone company, which issued its first public stock in 1996. "This seemed like a reasonable long-term investment," she said.
She was wrong. Since March 2000, Deutsche Telekom shares have plunged from 104 euros to just over 11 yesterday. Mrs. Wiesler-Frisch, who bought shortly after the peak, has watched the value of her shares drop to about $1,000. Not knowing what else to do, she still holds them. 
While shareholders have felt the pain, they are not the only ones. At Deutsche Telekom, powerful members of the board are battling over whether the chief executive, Ron Sommer, should be allowed to keep his job in light of the company's battered shares and staggering debt. Deutsche Telekom said today that its full board would meet next Tuesday. At that session the future may be decided for Mr. Sommer, who during the boom was the epitome of the new-style, deal-making European telecommunications executive. 
Deutsche Telekom, which accumulated more than $62 billion in debt as Mr. Sommer went on an acquisition spree, has lost $260 billion in its stock market value in a little more than two years -- a plunge of more than 80 percent.
France Telecom's market value is down more than $150 billion, about 90 percent, since April 2000, and its credit rating has slid to one notch above junk bond status.
The BT Group, formerly British Telecommunications, and Royal KPN of the Netherlands became so loaded with debt last year that each had to change its top management, sell off many businesses and desperately try to raise new cash.
All these companies were part of a global wave of telephone privatizations and stock listings that took place from Japan to Brazil and across much of Europe in the last decade. Investors have lost money in many parts of the world. But the losses suffered by investors in European companies seem to be fostering a special resentment, because companies whose businesses had seemed so conservative -- what could be a safer haven, after all, than the telephone company? -- turned out to be almost recklessly aggressive. 
"They were very much into empire-building," said Denis McCauley, director in charge of European telecommunications at Pyramid Research, a research company based in London. "It was, 'Let's buy new businesses, let's buy wireless licenses, let's buy our way into countries that we aren't in right now.' "
The European telephone companies made big acquisitions in Asia, Central Europe and the United States. They spent nearly $125 billion in frenzied auctions for licenses to radio frequencies that are designated for "third generation" wireless networks, which are supposed to be able to transmit video and innovative new services. They are now spending almost as much money on building the actual networks, and analysts like Mr. McCauley do not expect the new systems to generate significant sales until 2005. 
Meantime, the great profit engine in European telecommunications over the last decade -- conventional cellphones -- is running out of fuel. More than 73 percent of all Western Europeans now have cellphones, and the number of subscribers has not only stopped growing, it actually declined slightly in the first quarter of this year. 
"The key problem of the large telecom operators may have its origin in their origin as state-controlled companies," said Rolf Drees, a fund manager at Union Investment, one of Germany's largest investment funds. "They all look to being very large. They are more oriented to size than to profit." 
The collapse of the telecommunications giants will probably have a social and cultural effect, too. In countries like Germany and France, where much of the public had long considered the stock market too risky, millions of people ventured into the market for the first time through telephone stocks. The former monopolies seemed big and safe, and they promoted their public offerings with huge advertising campaigns on television and billboards.
But the companies were being forced by regulators to admit new competitors into their markets, which quickly grabbed big chunks of the lucrative long-distance businesses and drove down prices.
Rather than defend their home turf, the big telephone companies reacted by expanding. 
BT, for example, racked up $30 billion in debt buying stakes in companies across Europe and in Japan and Malaysia. Its plight might have been even worse had it not been for WorldCom, which outbid BT in a takeover battle for MCI Communications, the second-largest long-distance carrier in the United States after AT&T. 
Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest traditional telephone company, amassed even more debt. Under Mr. Sommer, it spent more than $24 billion in stock and cash to buy the United States wireless company VoiceStream -- which Deutsche Telekom may now be feeling pressure to sell. Deutsche Telekom also spent more than $14 billion on third-generation wireless telephone licenses in Britain and Germany, an additional $10 billion to buy Britain's smallest existing cellular phone company and hundreds of millions more on major stakes in telephone companies across much of Central Europe. 
Some European institutional investors are running out of patience with Deutsche Telekom. Union Investment put the company on its "name and shame" list this year, citing a lack of openness and lack of responsiveness to investors. 
For his part, Mr. Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's embattled chief executive, who was not available for comment today, has argued that investors have simply failed to understand the strategy. 
"The capital market is scarcely differentiating any more between winners and losers," Mr. Sommer told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in late May. "The events we have observed in the last few weeks are no longer comprehensible and can only be explained with psychological mechanisms." 
Despite Mr. Sommer's struggle to keep his job at Deutsche Telekom, the company in most acute distress at the moment is France Telecom, which went public in October 1997 at a price equal to about $36 a share. The stock, whose value soared as high as $159 a share, closed yesterday at 13.4 euros ($13.25). Analysts estimate that its net debt is $67 billion, at least $15 billion of which comes due within the next year. 
Many analysts say France Telecom must raise as much as $15 billion by selling additional shares in the very near future. The problem is that its stock has fallen so low that the company's total market value is only about $17 billion.
Michel Bon, France Telecom's chief executive, has vowed to block a new stock issue because it would drastically dilute the value of existing shares. In desperation, the French government recently hinted at the possibility of "renationalizing" the company. 
In the aftermath of WorldCom's accounting scandal, analysts have also begun to worry whether accounting issues might eventually embroil Europe's telecommunications companies. Deutsche Telekom is fighting off accusations that it inflated the value of its real estate for years. 
German magazines and newspapers began raising questions about the valuations several years ago, unearthing documents suggesting that the company had overvalued its land by billions of dollars at the time it went public in 1996. 
The company denied doing anything wrong, but then wrote down the value of its land holdings by nearly $2 billion last year. Now the issue has come up again. A German government agency has charged that Deutsche Telekom may have inflated the value of its buildings as well as its land. Company executives say they were following proper valuation procedures, but skeptics abound. 
Many of the European telephone companies have made use of legal but aggressive accounting policies, like booking labor costs associated with network construction as a capital investment. The practice allows them to write down the expense over many years rather than all at once, reducing their current-year costs and increasing their profits, or at least reducing their losses. 
"It is all perfectly legal, but after the WorldCom debacle these practices may come into focus," Frank Wellendorf, a telecommunications analyst at WestLB Research in Dusseldorf, said. "It is not conservative."

HEADLINE: Pacing, and Worrying; 
Hard Times Overtake New York's Harness Tracks

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y., July 10 

 BODY:
At the end of another long afternoon at the track, John Stubits found his assistant trainer sitting stiffly on a bucket in the stable. His back hurt, and so did his wallet.
 "We got nothing today," Carl Wellman announced with characteristic bluntness. Battleshoe Easy, a horse that Mr. Stubits co-owns and trains at Monticello Raceway, finished sixth out of a field of eight. The purse for Battleshoe Easy's race was $2,500 -- paltry compared to the $10,000-or-so purses on harness racing cards at premier tracks like the Meadowlands in New Jersey. 
 The annual handle, the total amount bet at the track, continues to slip year after year at Monticello. Grass grows through cracks in the empty parking lot. Stray cats roam the crumbling barns; one afternoon, Mr. Stubits shooed one away from the track during Battleshoe Easy's race. 
In the 1950's and 60's, racing -- both thoroughbred and harness -- was just about the only form of legal gambling. But as state lotteries and casinos boomed, the tracks suffered and have groped for ways to stay alive. And harness racing -- with its quirky rules, slower pace and without an event as prestigious and as well known as the Kentucky Derby -- has been hurt more than thoroughbred racing.
Now, the latest hope for salvation may be fading, too. 
A casino gambling law passed last year allowed the state's racetracks, Monticello and five others, to install video lottery terminals -- slot machines, essentially -- to make more money. But now the tracks say limitations on their operating hours and, more important, the state's share of the revenue (75 percent) would make installing and operating the machines unprofitable.
New York's law would give track owners and horsemen 12.5 percent each of the proceeds. In Delaware, which introduced the terminals in 1995, the state gets 40 percent; the tracks get 49 percent and the horsemen receive 11 percent.
The lobbyist for New York tracks haggled with legislators to increase their share, but made little headway in Albany this year.
Training and racing horses, especially the trotters and pacers of harness tracks, has never been for the faint of heart or wallet. Most of the 350 horsemen get by from paycheck to paycheck, eking out a living of about $20,000 to $40,000 a year, depending on how well the horses are running.
"There are martini days and no-martini days," said Norman Bradbury, a longtime trainer and driver.
While the harness tracks in New York have been slowly dying, a state subsidy in New Jersey helps keep purses high at the Meadowlands, and revenue from video lottery terminals has revived parks and bolstered the take in Delaware and Canada. At Dover Downs in Delaware, for instance, revenue from the 2,000 machines has pushed average daily purses to $150,000 now (Monticello's daily purse averages $20,000), from $10,000 before the slots, and attendance has jumped to 2.4 million (Monticello counts about 75,000 a year) from 32,000 a year.
The nearly abandoned Monticello grandstand, with its pale orange, blue, yellow and green seats, appears locked in the 60's. The track's summer schedule has racing from Saturday through Wednesday; a typical daytime card includes 10 to 12 races, with seven or eight horses usually entered in each two-minute, mile-long race.
Most of the fans, and a large number of the trainers and drivers, are middle-age or older. With just a smattering of patrons day after day, the running joke in the backstretch is, "There are not enough people to field a basketball team."
Mr. Stubits, 50, has been at Monticello since 1969, which means he has seen it at its best and at its worst. Nowadays is about rock bottom, he said, with some trainers and drivers working second jobs as carpenters and roofers and laborers to get by. Mr. Stubits himself now relies on income from running a supply shop at the track.
"We all used to make a living," he said. "Not that it ever was a great living. But it was a living."
Monticello, a half-mile oval track, opened in 1958. It catered to vacationers at a time when the Catskill Mountains were a popular destination and harness racing was taking off.
The sport traces its roots to nearby Goshen, where in the early 1800's bored farmers would race each other while sitting in buggies to see whose horses were the fastest. Eventually, trotting, as it was called, moved off the farms to tracks.
Nearly all of today's standardbreds, as the horses in harness racing are known, are descendants of a single horse, Hambletonian, born in Sugar Loaf, N.Y., in 1849, the father of 1,331 foals.
The horses are bred to pace or trot with a peculiar straight-legged gait. One quirk of harness racing is that unlike thoroughbreds ridden by jockeys, the standardbreds are disqualified if they break into a run during a race. For that reason, they do not bolt out of starting gate, but build up their pace behind a car with a swinging gate that races off when the horses reach the starting line.
By the 1960's, promoters were calling harness racing the fastest growing sport in the world, and Monticello rode the boom into the 70's.
Thousands filled the stands on a Saturday night and top entertainers, including Barry Manilow and Ike and Tina Turner, performed there.
"We were saturated," recalled John Manzi, Monticello's head of publicity, who has been with the track since 1974. That, of course, was when there were about 400 resorts and hotels in the Catskills; today there are three major ones.
Apart from the economic slide, a wave of race-fixing and horse doping scandals at several tracks helped drive some bettors away, even as track officials here and elsewhere said they took steps to curtail abuses.
At Monticello, the total annual handle dropped to $18.9 million last year from $28.6 million four years ago, even as improvements to its simulcasting signal and changes in racing hours helped keep the track afloat. Statewide, in the same period, the handle at harness tracks dropped to $158 million from $259 million, far from the peak of $870 million in 1974.
General Washington, 63, a veteran trainer, used to work with a dozen horses at various meets, but he is down to five now. "People don't want to buy a horse because they don't see where they are going to get the money," he said.
Costs have risen substantially as purse money has fallen. (The driver and trainer get 5 percent of a horse's winnings per race.) Top purses are now $4,000, compared to about $7,500 going back 25 years ago.
"That was a lot of money back then," Mr. Washington said.
A bag of oats that went for $8 then now costs $18. Shoeing a horse used to cost $25 but is now closer to $70. 
Mr. Washington's son, Cedric, 40, one of the top drivers here, dreams of moving on to more lucrative tracks in other states if prospects do not brighten here. "If it doesn't pan out next year I got to go," he said as he took Gloria Gloria for a walk.
Many other horsemen, however, plan to stay, hoping that the video lottery terminals will eventually come and improve things. 
Horsemen like Mr. Stubits find it hard to leave racing. He grew up around horses on a farm near Monticello and visits to the track, watching the graceful horses pull their drivers along in sulkies, hooked him on the sport. It didn't hurt, either, that on his first bet of $2 he won $100.
He was a driver at first but the care and tending of the horses interested him more, he said. Now he trains six horses, arriving at the barn at 6 a.m. to feed them and often not leaving until 5 p.m. or later, when racing is over.
He understands it may be difficult for outsiders to appreciate the subtle glories of this life. "We do it because we love it -- not because it is financially rewarding," Mr. Stubits said.
His assistant, Mr. Wellman, brushed Ricky's Future -- a new horse for them who recently ran fast enough in a qualifier to enter races down the road -- and then he shoveled a fresh mound of manure. He is in his element, here in the barn. 
"It's like a narcotic," Mr. Wellman said of harness racing. "When you're away from it, you get withdrawal."

One More Misstep For a Battered Sport

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
At a promotional news conference Tuesday morning, Major League Baseball unveiled its selections for the 30 most memorable moments in its history. The All-Star Game played that night will not be No. 31.
 In a worst-case scenario growing out of an evolution of baseball's popular midsummer game between the best players in the American and National Leagues, the 73rd game did not have a winner. The All-Stars played 11 innings and wound up with a 7-7 tie because the teams ran out of pitchers. 
 Perhaps this day had been coming. Once an often fiercely competitive contest, the All-Star Game has evolved into an event that is the hub attraction of an entertainment extravaganza. The managers still want to win the game, but they have made it a priority to attempt to get all 60 players into it. 
That's what Joe Torre of the Yankees and Bob Brenly of the Arizona Diamondbacks did in Milwaukee on Tuesday night, and by succeeding, they left themselves short of pitching when the game went into extra innings.
Commissioner Bud Selig, in whose city the game was played, was left with no other decision than to end the game after 11 innings. Fans at Miller Park lustily booed the announcement that was made with one out in the N.L. half of the 11th and chanted, "Let them play!"
In a telephone interview yesterday, Selig reflected on the outcome. "The more I thought about it, I'd have to make the same decision today that I made last night," he said. "The only option was to have position players pitch in the 12th inning. That would have been a travesty."
Nevertheless, he said: "We've already started discussing it, and we will continue in the off-season to make sure this doesn't happen again. How do you do it with 30 players? Have pitchers and position players play longer."
Instead of letting them play to a decision Tuesday night -- fans obviously want decisions even in exhibition games, which is what the All-Star Game is -- Major League Baseball was left with another questionable development that added to a growing list of problems afflicting it.
The owners and the players are negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement but are seemingly more on course to their ninth work stoppage in 31 years than to labor peace. Allegations of steroid use have called into question the achievements of baseball's most popular sluggers and have created demands for testing of all players.
The owners are trying to eliminate two teams for reasons of economic health and, in fact, would have already jettisoned the Minnesota Twins and the Montreal Expos had legal challenges not stepped in the way. Selig, in an interview in yesterday's Houston Chronicle, said one team might have difficulty meeting its payroll on Monday. And the television ratings aren't encouraging, either, with Tuesday night's game the lowest rated for an All-Star contest, down 14 percent from a year ago.
Even an attempt to honor the memory of one of the game's greatest players went awry, though through no fault of baseball. Ted Williams, who died Friday, was a central part of the pregame ceremony, but the script had to be revised because of the attempt by Williams's son to have his father's body frozen for possible future use.
And the All-Star Game's most valuable player award was renamed for Williams, but it wasn't given Tuesday because no M.V.P. was chosen. Had a player been named most valuable despite the tie and an award made on the field after the game, the scene would most likely have only incited the fans even more.
While standing by the decision to end the game, Selig acknowledged yesterday that the Tuesday night announcement had omitted one very important piece of information.
"We should have done much better," he said, agreeing that the announcement should have included the reason. "We did not communicate as well as we should have."
To understand two significant ways in which the All-Star Game has changed, one need only look at two games and one scene from each.
At Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati in 1970, Pete Rose scored the winning run in the 12th inning by crashing into the American League catcher, Ray Fosse, who was never the same player afterward. 
As the teams changed sides after the first inning Tuesday night, Barry Bonds met Torii Hunter, the A.L. center fielder, near second base and spontaneously picked him up and held him over his shoulder. It was Bonds's good-natured response to the catch Hunter had just made, leaping above the center-field fence and robbing him of a homer.
In the 12-inning 1970 game, the A.L. used seven pitchers and left two unused while the N.L. used five pitchers and left three on the bench.
The other night Torre, who played in the 1970 game, used all nine of his pitchers and Brenly used all 10 of his.
There was also a difference in the makeup of the staffs. All 12 of the 1970 pitchers were starters. Of the 19 pitchers in Milwaukee, 10 were closers and an 11th was also a reliever.
Managers like having closers on their teams now because closers are accustomed to pitching one inning and pitching it effectively. Tuesday's closers plus the 11th reliever, Mike Remlinger, pitched 10 2/3 of the 22 innings. None of the eight starting pitchers worked longer than two innings. In 1970, 4 of the 12 pitchers worked three innings each.
In the last 14 All-Star games only Greg Maddux, in 1994, pitched as many as three innings. The last time a game's two starting pitchers worked three innings each was in 1986, when Roger Clemens and Dwight Gooden did it. Two innings has become the limit for pitchers as managers have become more concerned about their arms and more interested in getting more players into the game, if not all of them.
Steve Rogers pitched in three All-Star Games during the 13 seasons he pitched for Montreal. 
"When I was on the team," Rogers related in a telephone interview yesterday, "at least one or two -- maybe three or four -- guys didn't play because you had to have them in reserve. But the players who didn't play felt they had missed out."
Rogers, who is a special assistant with the players union, said he had no problem with managers' using all the players, but he said, "If the guiding force is to make sure everybody gets in the game, then you really do have to consider that under special circumstances, which we witnessed last night, you might have to consider a tie."
The primary reason the game was ended was that Vicente Padilla of Philadelphia, the N.L.'s last pitcher, was in his second inning, and Brenly said Padilla had experienced trouble getting loose in the bullpen when he was warming up. Brenly said he would not have had him pitch a third inning. Nor did Torre want to use Freddy Garcia of Seattle, his last pitcher, for a third inning.
Larry Bowa, Padilla's manager, said Padilla was not throwing as hard as usual. "That's a red flag right away," Bowa said in a telephone interview.
Bowa said he could see that the managers were trying to use everybody. For that reason, he said, he agreed that the game should have been ended. 
But he added: "As a fan, do I agree with it? No, not at all. If I'm paying $100-125 a ticket, I want to see somebody win. That's what the baseball purist wants. If they're trying to be nice guys, which they both are, it's probably beneficial, because they got everybody in the game. But there's nowhere to go. You paint yourself into a corner."
Bowa and Rogers agreed that the All-Star Game was different from what it used to be. The leagues no longer play to see who is "king of the hill," Rogers said. "That's fine," he added. "There's nothing sacred about that."
The fans, on the other hand, believe there is something sacred about playing a game to a decision. The problem could have been avoided if one team had scored in the 10th or 11th.
Selig said his wife, Sue, left after the ninth inning. "I said, 'Don't worry, someone will hit one out and I'll be home shortly.' Little did I know."

HEADLINE: Uncle Sam Wants You (To Play This Game) 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN KENNEDY 

 BODY:
"BE all you can be"? Ancient history. "An army of one"? Last year's news. The military's newest promotional campaign is not even televised; it is America's Army, a free computer game produced by the military and aimed at winning the hearts and minds of tech-minded teenagers. 
 The game is the brainchild of Lt. Col. Casey Wardynski, director of the Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis at West Point. Although Colonel Wardynski is not a gamer himself, his two sons are, and his oldest, 17-year-old Casey, is a big fan of the action game Delta Force. The colonel said the idea for the game came to him three years ago while he was researching ways to attract computer-adept recruits for an increasingly high-tech military. 
 The Army is looking to hire 79,500 young adults this year -- and, as Colonel Wardynski said, "Gaming tends to be very interesting to young Americans." 
Colonel Wardynski concluded that releasing a free, high-quality game -- and encouraging gamers to copy it and share it with friends -- would be an effective (and relatively inexpensive) way to reach those budding computer whizzes.
America's Army is actually two games. The first, Operations, is a multiplayer first-person shooter inspired by the popular game Counterstrike. Players log on through the Internet, take on the roles of United States soldiers and team up to battle terrorists. 
But Operations is no Rambo-style shoot-'em-up. Although it uses the engine -- or basic structural programming -- from the newest version of the sci-fi game Unreal, the Army has gone to great lengths to make the game as realistic as possible, soliciting input from soldiers at bases nationwide.
The designers, primarily the Modeling, Virtual Environments and Simulation Institute at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., say they have modeled each weapon accurately. A player's aim will be affected by his stance, breathing and movement. A player who charges an enemy trench, wildly firing his rifle, is unlikely to hit very much.
Everything from the direction and velocity of shell ejection to the way soldiers high crawl when carrying a rifle is based on the way the Army really operates, said Michael Capps, the game's executive director and a professor at the modeling institute. 
Unlike many multiplayer games, Operations features mechanisms to ensure participants' good behavior. Gun down your drill sergeant on the rifle range, for example, and you'll serve hard time in a virtual Fort Leavenworth. 
In another departure from gaming norms, Operations is not very bloody.
"We don't want to use violence as an entertainment vehicle," Colonel Wardynski said. Bullet hits are registered by puffs of blood instead of the sprays of gore typical of some first-person shooters. The game is rated appropriate for teenage players (most graphic first-person shooters are rated for mature players). 
The enemy is designed to look as generic as possible. "We've got blond guys who are bad guys, black guys who are bad guys," Colonel Wardynski said. "Usually, they're not well shaven." 
In the second part of the game, Soldiers, players progress through a virtual career in the Army, serving in a variety of units and improving their ratings in categories like loyalty, honor and personal courage as they go. 
A preliminary version of the Operations game released on July 4 includes two training missions and four combat operations, including an assault on a terrorist camp that Colonel Wardynski said was modeled after a raid conducted in the early days of the Afghanistan campaign. 
Maj. Chris Chambers, the project's deputy director, said that more than 500,000 copies of the game had been downloaded by Wednesday morning -- prompting a frantic rush for additional servers and an accelerated plan to release "community software" allowing groups to play without tapping into a server.
The full version of America's Army is scheduled for release in late August or early September. It will be available free as a two-CD set or by downloading from the Internet at americasarmy.com. 
The Army is hoping the game will help cut down on one of its biggest expenses -- filling its ranks. Doug Smith, a spokesman for the Army Recruiting Command in Fort Knox, Ky., said the Army spends about $15,000 to recruit every soldier. 
Colonel Wardynski said the government will have spent about $7.6 million to develop the game by September; he said he expected the cost of creating new missions and other updates to be about $2.5 million a year and the cost of maintaining the multiplayer infrastructure to be about $1.5 million.
If the game draws 300 to 400 recruits in the next year, he said, it will have been worth the cost -- especially since the game is considered likely to attract people attending or considering college, who tend to be more expensive to recruit. 
He also hopes that by providing more information to prospective soldiers, the game will help cut down on the number of recruits who wash out during the nine weeks of basic training and subsequent specialized training, which can last up to a year. (All told, the Army loses 13.7 percent of recruits during training, according to a spokesman for the Training and Doctrine Command in Fort Monroe, Va.) 
Recruits who signed up but then quickly changed their mind "had an information problem," Colonel Wardynski said. 
"That's $15,000 down the drain," he added. 
Initial reaction among gamers has been positive. The Army's display booth at the Electronics Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in May was packed -- despite, or perhaps because of, the presence of uniformed soldiers and military vehicles instead of the typical scantily clad women. Army officials said they had received more than 150,000 advance orders for the game before the preliminary version became available for download on July 4. 
"It's a blast," said Amer Ajami, an editor at Gamespot.com who spent last weekend playing the game online. "It's pretty realistic -- you take one or two shots and you go limp, you take one more and you're done." 
From a marketing standpoint, Mr. Ajami said, its prospects are excellent. "You see all these commercials on TV with catchy phrases, but nothing beats going in and seeing what the Army really does," he said. "Without actually having to do it."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Bush is talking tough on corporate ethics, but where is the regulatory bite?

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick, who teaches at Cooper Union, is the editor of Challenge Magazine and of a new journal of social health, Indicators. His new book, "Why Economies Grow," will be published by Basic Books in October. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
AT bottom, President Bush's speech on Tuesday reflects the belief that the current corporate scandals are merely the handiwork of a few bad apples. If we enforce existing laws more strongly, he essentially told us, the mess will be cleaned up. He called for longer prison sentences and a federal SWAT team to combat fraud.
 Is such law enforcement talk what he thinks Americans understand? Any new rules or regulations will be left to self-regulators, like stock exchanges. There is no need for direct government oversight of accounting. 
 But something more systemic than a few clever swindlers is staining America. It is hard to believe that Mr. Bush's economic advisers don't know that. The Enron deceptions alone involved some of the nation's most prestigious accountants, lawyers, Wall Street brokers and commercial bankers, along with some of Enron's own highly respected directors. About 1,000 corporations have had to restate earnings the last five years.
A good economist's first instinct would be to determine whether there are incentives built into the financial system that encourage deception and fraud. A president who wanted to make business trustworthy again and renew the nation's confidence would address these incentives directly.
It's helpful to return, for perspective, to the corporate scandals of the 1980's and 1990's. The best piece of economic analysis on the subject was done by George A. Akerlof, of the University of California at Berkeley -- later a Nobel Prize winner -- and Paul M. Romer, now of the Stanford Business School, in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.
The two developed a model that showed fairly convincingly that it was rational for executives to "loot" their companies when accounting standards were lax. Their most compelling examples were the savings and loan bankruptcies of the 1980's.
Accounting rules were changed and existing standards relaxed to aid the S.& L.'s after high interest rates devastated them in the late 1970's. But permissive accounting, coupled with federal guarantees of deposits, ultimately enabled executives to make highly risky investments to inflate short-term profits. They could pay themselves enormous compensation because the accounting methods did not properly reflect the risks or costs until years later. The incentives encouraged them to make investments that, Mr. Akerlof and Mr. Romer wrote, could have had "no reasonable payoff in any future state of the world."
This is sadly familiar. Enron inflated profits through highly devious accounting; it made many bad investments whose long-run risks could be hidden but that could produce rapid if temporary profits. WorldCom and other telecommunications companies made similarly risky investments, building capacity aggressively even when there was no sign of demand. But the executives were still able to enrich themselves.
The widespread granting of stock options created similar incentives with damaging consequences. The prevailing worry, famously raised by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means in the 1930's, had been that managers would run companies to preserve their jobs rather than to maximize profits. Now, the problem had purportedly been solved. Options allowed them to buy large quantities of their companies' shares at low prices. Managers who received options, it was argued, would act entrepreneurially because they would be compensated as owners would be.
But options, it turned out, encouraged managers to take unduly big risks, as long as they showed handsome short-term profits. They became rich if investments paid off, but they did not lose money if they failed. And they could usually bail out long before the investments went bad.
They also managed earnings to appeal to Wall Street's short-term orientation. Nothing was quite so ludicrous as when investors clobbered a stock because earnings per share were a penny or two below expectations. Now we know that billions of dollars of profits were simply fabricated.
True reform must correct such distorting incentives, and if we are honest, it should involve new regulation. The stakes are high. It is not just a matter of a few executives stealing a hundred million here or there. Perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars of national savings were misallocated to businesses that did not last rather than invested in businesses that might have created long-term profits and permanent jobs. The holdings of pension funds, endowments and individuals have collapsed. 
Here is a start:
*First, every effort must be made to make sure accounting rules are tough and are adhered to. Industry on its own has not been up to this task. Accounting rules have been consistently watered down the last 10 years. Government should be involved in setting the rules. A bill working through the Senate, sponsored by Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, is worth consideration.
*Second, the ultimate authority over the annual audit of accounting practices should be held by special committees of corporate boards, completely separate from chief executives and their staff.
*Third, options should be deducted from current earnings, so shareholders know what they are paying. Now, there is no required deduction. Mr. Bush has said nothing about expensing options, but even the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, supports such a reform.
More jail time for fraud, as the president recommends, may help. But it will hardly be enough. Finding executives guilty, SWAT team or not, will continue to be difficult. Enron and WorldCom executives will cite in their defense the opinions of accountants and lawyers who assured them, usually in writing, that what they were doing was not deceptive or illegal.
Mr. Bush apparently cannot or will not see that these deceptive and greedy executives operated in an environment that not merely tolerated their actions but encouraged them. It is not just the bad apples that need to be expunged; distorting incentives must be changed. Until that is acknowledged, confidence will not be restored.

HEADLINE: Colon Cancer Screening Bill Advances in Senate Panel 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
A Senate committee voted today to require all private health insurance plans in the United States to pay for screening tests to detect colon cancer in people who are 50 or older or have a high risk of developing the disease.
 In addition, the committee moved toward approval of a bill that would expand access to low-cost generic versions of prescription drugs. Democrats appeared to have the votes needed to approve the bill, which was also endorsed by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. 
 Ms. Collins described the drug bill as a necessary response to abuses by some drug companies, which she said had exploited the existing law "to maximize their profits at the expense of consumers." 
The cancer screening bill was approved by a vote of 16 to 5 in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Five Republicans and 1 independent joined 10 Democrats in voting for the bill, while 5 Republicans opposed it.
Supporters of the bill said it could save tens of thousands of lives by requiring insurers to provide coverage for colonoscopies and other tests to detect colon cancer. "Overwhelming scientific evidence indicates that with early detection, we can save lives, and millions and millions of dollars," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who introduced the bill with Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina.
But opponents said the bill would impose a new, potentially costly federal mandate at a time when health costs and insurance premiums were rising rapidly.
"Every time we increase the cost of health insurance, we throw people into the ranks of the uninsured," said Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas.
Mr. Helms is eager to see the bill become law before he retires in January, and supporters of the measure said they had a better-than-even chance of achieving that objective.
More than 56,000 Americans died last year from colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths, after lung cancer. On June 28, the day before he had a colonoscopy at Camp David, President Bush said, "I do recommend and urge that people get these precautionary tests and take a look." But the administration has not taken a public position on the Kennedy-Helms bill.
Manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs vehemently oppose the other bill, to give consumers swifter access to generic pharmaceuticals. These companies say the bill would reduce patent protections for new drugs, thus reducing the economic incentives for the discovery of cures and treatments.
But the measure has support from most Democrats and some Republicans. It has also been endorsed by a coalition of consumers, businesses, labor unions, insurers and others who pay the bills for prescription drugs.
Senator Kennedy said drug makers had exploited a 1984 law to secure "near-immortality for drug patents," thus delaying the sale of generic drugs that were just as safe and effective as the brand-name products.
In the absence of any abuses, Ms. Collins said, patents on brand-name drugs with annual sales of $20 billion will expire in the next four years. Consumers could save at least 50 percent of that amount by using generic versions, she said.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said, "We will be taking up prescription drug legislation next week." Democrats and Republicans have very different ideas of how to provide drug benefits under Medicare, and Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said neither party had the 60 votes needed to ensure victory.
But members of both parties say they want to make drugs more affordable, so the debate may focus initially on proposals to increase access to generic medications and drug products imported from Canada.
Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said he was "inclined to support" the generic drug bill. D. J. O'Brien, a spokesman for Mr. Hutchinson, said the Arkansas senator was leaning the same way. Both senators are up for re-election.
Under current law, a maker of brand-name drugs can get an automatic 30-month delay in federal approval of generic drugs by filing a lawsuit that alleges infringement of its patents.
The bill, drafted by Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, would remove barriers to the marketing of generic drugs by eliminating this automatic delay in most cases.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush Calls for End to Loans Of a Type He Once Received

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10 

 BODY:
President Bush received two low-interest loans to buy stock from an oil company where he served as a board member in the late 1980's. He then benefited from the company's relaxation of the terms of one loan in 1989 as he was engaged in the most important business deal of his career.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bush called for a halt to those types of insider transactions, challenging corporate directors to "put an end to all company loans to corporate officers." 
 The loans from Harken Energy allowed Mr. Bush to acquire 105,000 shares in the company -- 80,000 in late 1986 and 25,000 in 1988 -- through a stock option program that was available to top corporate officials. Harken did not require repayment of the principal for eight years and charged 5 percent annual interest. The prime rate in December 1986, when Mr. Bush received the initial loan, was 7.5 percent. 
He ultimately returned the stock he acquired this way, canceling the loans. Such loans were not uncommon among companies seeking to promote long-term shareholding among executives and directors. 
Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, said Mr. Bush was not being hypocritical in calling for an end to loans of a kind he once got. He said that while such loans had been properly used by many companies to encourage long-term share ownership, they had in some cases recently been abused.
To finance the stock purchase in 1986, Mr. Bush originally had to assume personal liability for repayment. He pledged as collateral not only the 80,000 shares he got through the options program but also other Harken shares he had gotten for selling his struggling energy company to Harken earlier that year.
In 1989, Harken relaxed the terms of the 1986 loan to remove any "personal liability to yourself," the company's lawyer wrote to Mr. Bush on Oct. 5 of that year. The change had the effect of freeing Mr. Bush's original 212,000-share block of Harken stock, which he sold the next year.
That sale, in June 1990, brought him $848,000, which he used to pay off a $500,000 loan he had taken out to help him buy into the Texas Rangers baseball team, a deal that helped secure his own personal fortune and propel him into Texas politics.
Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush never profited from the Harken loans because after Harken changed its stock option program, Mr. Bush returned the shares in exchange for new options that he never exercised.
In view of the recent abuses, Mr. Bartlett said, "President Bush looked at these loans, and the president felt the best way to do it was to draw a bright line; the best way to handle these loans going forward is through a bank." 
The June 1990 Harken stock sale led to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- during his father's administration -- of whether Mr. Bush had knowingly sold the stock in advance of worse-than-expected financial results that temporarily drove down Harken's share price.
The S.E.C. took no action against Mr. Bush. But the issue has dogged him politically for almost a decade and has again come up in recent weeks as accounting and insider trading accusations have dominated the headlines. Democrats have seized on it again in an attempt to draw a contrast in the president's business record and his call for more ethical corporate behavior. 
His demand in a speech to Wall Street on Tuesday for companies to stop making loans to insiders has raised the question of how his toughened standards today would have applied to his own corporate experience.
Harken publicly disclosed the $180,000 in loans to Mr. Bush, to exercise stock options, in its financial statements at the time, but did not publicly disclose the change in the terms of Mr. Bush's 1986 loan.
One issue that has come up again is why Mr. Bush was tardy in filing one of the S.E.C. forms disclosing his 1990 stock sale. The White House has said that it was Harken's responsibility to file the form. At a news conference on Monday, President Bush said, "I still haven't figured it out completely," after saying years ago that the S.E.C. had lost the form.
According to company documents, however, Harken's lawyers sent Mr. Bush two memos in the months before the 1990 stock sale setting out in detail new procedures for filing paperwork with the S.E.C. But one of the two required forms regarding Mr. Bush's sale of the 212,000 shares reached the S.E.C. 34 weeks late -- and while Mr. Bush had signed it, he left the date blank.
Mr. Bartlett said the main point of the memos was to urge Mr. Bush to consult the company's lawyers about any sale of the stock. Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush did just that. In deciding not to take any action against Mr. Bush, the S.E.C.'s staff later cited Mr. Bush's consultations with the company's lawyers as an indication that he did not intend to profit from inside information.
Mr. Bartlett said he could not explain why the late form -- known as a Form 4 -- was left undated.
In the case of the sale of his Harken stock, Mr. Bush benefited from the action of an investor who remains unknown even today. The transaction began with a cold call from a broker in early June 1990. Mr. Bush, oldest son of the president of the United States, was then managing general partner of the Rangers.
The broker, Ralph D. Smith of Sutro & Company in Los Angeles, said he was offering to take off Mr. Bush's hands the now unencumbered 212,000 shares of Harken Energy, which had experienced a series of financial setbacks in previous months.
On the face of it, Harken did not seem to be a particularly attractive investment in mid-1990. The company's annual report for 1989, issued in April 1990, showed a loss of $3.3 million, mostly from trading losses. The reported loss for the first quarter of 1990 was $2.18 million, and the company was having trouble with its lenders. In the beginning of May, the stock was near $5. But in the weeks after May 22, when the first-quarter results were announced, the stock traded at $4.12 to $4.62.
Harken's internal analysis of its plight, which company documents show went to Mr. Bush in early June, reported that companies doing business with it were "nervous" about its annual report and cutting back their trade credits. Harken officials tried to soften the bad news by not distributing its disappointing first-quarter report filed with the S.E.C. in May "unless specifically requested," the analysis noted.
But out of the public eye, there was some good news developing. The company was completing an agreement with the wealthy Bass family of Fort Worth to back a venture to drill for oil off the coast of Bahrain, a big opportunity to break into international exploration. Mr. Bush had been briefed on the pending financing agreement, which had not yet been disclosed to investors.
At the time, Mr. Bush wanted to pay off the loan he had taken to finance his stake in the Rangers, and the Harken stock was his biggest asset. But Harken stock was thinly traded; its average daily volume on the New York Stock Exchange was only about 10,000 shares. Until he contacted Mr. Bush on behalf of an anonymous buyer, Mr. Smith said in an interview this week, he could not find anyone willing to sell, either.
So it was in many ways a perfect match of buyer and seller, and two weeks later, after checking with lawyers at Harken, where he was a consultant as well as a director, Mr. Bush completed the deal. 
A dozen years later, it is still not known who bought Mr. Bush's shares, or why the buyer made the offer at that time. Mr. Smith said he would not disclose the buyer's identity except to say that it was an institutional investor. Mr. Smith also said that he was unaware of the pending Bass deal.
The White House said today that Mr. Bush never knew the identity of the buyer. Mr. Bartlett said it was "very far fetched" to assume that the buyer was knowingly helping Mr. Bush at a financially convenient moment for him.
Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush's awareness of the progress in securing a deal with the Basses was one reason he sought advice from Harken's lawyers about whether it was permissible for him to sell the stock at that time. Harken stock rose slightly after the announcement of the Bass brothers' investment, and then slid again.
Over the years, Mr. Bush's representatives have cited the likelihood that Harken would soon announce good news about the Bass deal to rebut the implication that Mr. Bush was selling ahead of bad news about the company's earnings. Harken announced the Bass deal on July 23, 1990, a month after Mr. Bush completed the stock sale. The Bahrain exploration venture ultimately ended up drilling nothing but dry holes.
Mr. Bush's involvement in Harken traces back to 1986, when it acquired an oil company he controlled, Spectrum 7 Energy. In return, Mr. Bush got more than 200,000 Harken shares and a seat on the board.
Soon after, Mr. Bush was given a chance to participate in a stock option program that the company's filings describe as being available to its "executive officers," even though Mr. Bush was technically a director and consultant rather than a member of management.
Mr. Bush, like some of the other Harken executives who received shares at the time, chose to pay for them through a promissory note.
According to a letter on April 27, 1987, from Harken's general counsel to Mr. Bush, the note was collateralized by the 80,000 shares he was buying plus the "shares due to you from Harken's acquisition of Spectrum 7 Energy Corporation."
But two years later, the arrangement was changed. No longer was Mr. Bush personally liable for repaying the loan. The only shares he had to pledge as collateral were the 80,000 the loan was allowing him to buy. In effect, Mr. Bush's risk was limited to not profiting on the deal, since he could simply return the shares should they decline in value to less than the loan amount.
In 1993, Harken changed the option plan. In exchange for returning the 105,000 shares he had received under the program, his loans were canceled and he received new options for 42,503 shares. But Mr. Bush left the company at the end of 1993 and never exercised the options.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Signs Budget Bills, Including New Taxes on Phones 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed several bills into law yesterday to help the city balance its budget by raising fees on cellphones and regular telephones, changing the way the city calculates its business tax, and offering early retirement to some city workers. 
 All the measures were part of the $42.3 billion budget agreement that the mayor and the City Council entered into last month. 
 The new laws made having a telephone in New York City more expensive. The city's monthly surcharge (levied to pay for 911 service) on regular telephones will rise to $1 a month from 35 cents a month, generating an additional $35 million a year. 
The city will also add a 911 surcharge of 30 cents a month to cellphone service, which is expected to bring in an additional $8 million a year. The cellphone surcharge comes on top of a state surcharge, recently raised to $1.20 a month from 70 cents a month, to pay for the New York State Police and their 911 system.
Another law will change the way the city calculates its business taxes, so that the federal stimulus bill that President Bush signed into law in March will not end up unintentionally hurting the city's finances. The stimulus law cuts federal business taxes, but since the city's tax has long been calculated based on the federal government's, the law could have ended up cutting the city's business taxes as well.
The law signed yesterday will disconnect the city tax from the federal tax in most of the city, allowing the city to collect an estimated $108 million in additional tax revenues this year. Businesses south of Houston Street, though, will still calculate their taxes the old way, so they will have an additional tax break.

 BODY:
Bush Used Insider Benefits That He Now Wants to Ban
President Bush has called for an end to some of the very insider transactions that he used as a director of Harken Energy in the late 1980's. Mr. Bush received two low-interest loans and then benefited from the company's relaxation of the terms of one loan. On Tuesday, he challenged directors to "put an end to all company loans to corporate officers."
 Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, discounted suggestions that Mr. Bush was being hypocritical in calling for an end to loans of a kind he once received. Mr. Bartlett said that while such loans had been properly used in the past, they had recently been abused. Page A1. 

The Senate has endorsed broad penalties for corporate officers who cheat investors or harm employee pensions that include prison terms for officers who allow their company to publish misleading financial results. A1.

AT&T Investors Approve Breakup

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "THE AGE OF IMPRESSIONISM: EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE ORDRUPGAARD COLLECTION, COPENHAGEN," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 8). Said to be the most important holding of 19th-century French paintings in northern Europe, the Ordrupgaard Collection was assembled in the early 20th century by Wilhelm Hansen (1868-1936), a Danish insurance magnate. With works in depth by Gauguin, Degas, Pissarro, Monet, Renoir and Sisley and treasures by Manet, Matisse, Cezanne and others, the collection, now owned by the state, is ensconced at Hansen's former country home outside of Copenhagen, along with a fine group of paintings by Danish artists of Hansen's day and earlier. At the Met, the Danish and French collections are shown in separate galleries. The larger French section has true delights, among them a lively fauve still life by Matisse from 1909, a rare Polynesian-flavored Gauguin portrait of 1896 and a great Pissarro representation, including a powerful evocation of springtime painted at his home in Eragny, France, in 1894. The most interesting of the Danish artists is Vilhelm Hammershoi, the last of the great 19th-century Danish painters, whose spare, somber interiors and portraits -- untouched by modernism -- have recently returned to critical consciousness. Altogether, the 84 paintings on view make a real banquet. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

"THE ARTIST'S EYE: JANE FREILICHER AS CURATOR," National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sept. 22). The academy's sixth artist-selected show has been chosen by Jane Freilicher, whose reserved yet opulently colored landscapes and still lifes might be said to mediate the shrinking gap between the academic and the progressive. To some extent this show explores that gap: its 50 paintings are weighted toward portraits and landscapes and juxtaposed with unusual subtleness and intelligence. They form an engrossing meditation on subject matter, the painter's craft and the history of the academy. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50 for students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

* "CHANGING HANDS: ART WITHOUT RESERVATION," American Craft Museum, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 (through Sept. 20). In this feast of a show, about 90 American Indian artists -- established and emerging -- from the Southwest exhibit weavings, pottery, jewelry, glass, sculpture, paintings and tableware. Chosen for their venturesome challenges to the traditional and the tribal, the artists advance the show's goal: to help redefine contemporary Indian work as art rather than artifacts. An outstanding contribution is made by the jewelers, like L. Eugene Nelson of Albuquerque, whose intricate, finely engineered brooch uses traditional Indian silver and stones but is modeled on a computer chip. In pottery, another stellar category, two big earthenware vessels by Jacquie Stevens evoke the baskets of her Winnebago ancestry, yet have an elegant modern look that has been influenced by the shapes and colors of contemporary art. This is the first of three shows that will explore the current state of the arts in pre-European American societies; with this one, the series is off to a promising start. Hours: daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission, $7.50; $4, students and 65+ (Glueck).

* "THOMAS EAKINS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 15). It remains nearly impossible to see America, or at least to look back on the country in the 19th century, without some refraction through Eakins's art. He painted, hands down, the finest 19th-century American painting, "The Gross Clinic," which by itself justifies leaving your home right now and visiting the Met. His sentiments always ran deep below the surface, but they bubbled up in ways even he didn't necessarily seem to realize, or didn't want to acknowledge. The strong current of homoeroticism throughout his work is the obvious example. The show comes with two discoveries: that Eakins occasionally projected photographs with the aid of a magic lantern and traced the projections; and that he often began paintings by putting down bright colors, but then added subtle glazes of brown or black to give the pictures evenness and sobriety, a process overlooked or misunderstood by restorers in the past. Both discoveries help us see afresh this classic figure, who seems as interesting for being uneven and unpredictable as he is for his familiar commitment to unvarnished reality. His most American quality, in the end, may not be his scientific sensibility or pioneering choice of subjects or any other cliche of nationalism, but this combination of dogged, plain-spoken, almost puritanical realism with a simmering, unconventional character. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).

* "GAUGUIN IN NEW YORK COLLECTIONS: THE LURE OF THE EXOTIC," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 20). The first major New York exhibition devoted to Gauguin in four decades isn't major-major by Met blockbuster standards: more than half of the 120 pieces are drawings and prints. But these are pretty spectacular, and they are joined by some two dozen paintings, including coral-and-mango-colored visions of a mythical South Pacific that are among the most beautiful images created by any modern artist. Only the Met has the resources to put this kind of material together, though if you want to get a real sense of the not-so-nice artist himself, check out the new critical biography by Nancy Mowll Mathews, "Paul Gauguin: An Erotic Life." Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).

* "MEXICO CITY: AN EXHIBITION ABOUT THE EXCHANGE RATES OF BODIES AND VALUES," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through September). Mexico City has an extremely happening art scene. This exhibition of largely conceptual pieces by 17 young artists either born or based there looks sparse and uneven as it has been installed, but it is full of interesting -- in one case deeply disturbing and ethically challenging -- work. Anyone expecting an upbeat, fiesta atmosphere will be disappointed: the predominant subjects here are poverty, decay and human predation, with moments of tenderness and humor glinting through. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+ (Cotter).

* THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, QUEENS, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400. People in Queens are now finally free to complain the way obnoxious Manhattanites have always done about the bridge and tunnel crowd bringing their Prada sandals for a walk on weekends and spoiling the neighborhood. The Modern's new temporary home (until 2005) has finally opened in the former Swingline staple factory with part of its permanent collection of paintings and sculpture on view along with a few summer shows, including a contemporary survey called "Tempo." The galleries approximate the classic industrial loft aesthetic, efficient and airless, like the inside of a storage center, which is exactly what this building is, but touching for Cezannes, Seurats and Braques, which suddenly look fresh and by contrast seem to pop off the movable bare white walls. The shows include "Autobodies," five gorgeous automobiles from the museum's collection, and a display of Rudy Burckhardt's little-known photographs of Queens in the late 1930's and early 1940's, a perfect tribute to the museum's new locale. "Tempo," a wide-ranging, global-minded, erratically engaging and fuzzily conceived effort, is supposed to have something to do with movement, change, impermanence, the museum's migration and modernism's condition, I suppose. It's all vague, but approached modestly it's fine, with good art and bad. The trip to the museum couldn't be easier on the No. 7 subway. Now you can tell everyone you're chic. You've been to Queens. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; to 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+; free for members and children under 12 with an adult (Kimmelman).

"CLAES OLDENBURG DRAWINGS, 1959-77" AND "CLAES OLDENBURG WITH COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN DRAWINGS, 1992-98," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Sept. 15). One of the most original draftsmen around is Claes Oldenburg, whose early sculptures of everyday objects in the 1960's helped to define the Pop art movement. His startling ability to perceive subtle visual relationships among objects and to morph them from one incarnation or state to another is on view in 92 drawings now owned by the Whitney, including 18 done in collaboration with his wife, Coosje van Bruggen. The show is said to be the largest ever mounted of Mr. Oldenberg's works on paper. The drawings, anthropomorphic, often erotic and always full of life, are brilliantly rendered in the cheerfully loose yet energetic Oldenburg style that gives inanimate objects a kind of body language, or attitude, if you will. He is at the top of his form in the proposals for monuments he began in the 1960's, like the gigantic ironing board looming over the Lower East Side of Manhattan (1965) and the cathedral in the form of a colossal faucet for Lake Union, Seattle (1972). But altogether the show is a fine celebration of the Oldenburg wizardry in extracting the extraordinary from the everyday. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Glueck).

* "THE PAINTINGS OF JOAN MITCHELL," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. Through Sept. 29. The impact of Mitchell's works, especially the later ones (she died of lung cancer 10 years ago, at 66), is so immediately intoxicating that a natural reaction is to distrust the art. Abstract paintings this suave and sure-footed must be glib and manipulative, you may be excused for telling yourself. Distrust your distrust. Lush, opulent fields of colors, seemingly all paradisiacal, contain shades of melancholy that reveal themselves to you after your eyes adjust to their light. Mitchell absorbed the influences of Pollock, Gorky, Kline and de Kooning. There are ferocious paintings of clotted splatters in the 1950's. Then hovering shapes appear in muted green, gray and blue in the 60's. They give way by the early 70's to more vividly colored multipanel paintings in which increasing varieties of shapes and lines jostle. Mitchell, who had moved to France, denied the influence of Monet, which was undeniable. Her last works, from the 80's and early 90's, push Monet into the late 20th century, ecstatically. Hours and admissions: see above. Other Mitchell shows are at Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, through Aug. 16; Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, Suite 308, SoHo, (212) 941-0012, through Aug. 16; Edward Tyler Nahem Fine Art, at 56 East 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-2453, through Aug. 9; and Tibor de Nagy, at 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, 12th floor, (212) 262-5050, through July 26. (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

* JOHN GRAHAM, Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through July 31). Graham's mystic grandiosity came to fruition in the faux-antique portraits of cock-eyed women in the 40's and 50's, for which he is justly famous today. Four of these strange and loony works -- two on canvas, two on paper -- eclipse all the examples of Graham's earlier, more conventionally Modernist work in this intriguing four-decade survey (Ken Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

"LINGER," Artemis, Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444 (through July 26). This cheerfully diverse summer show includes a serenely reflective painting by Roy Lichtenstein, a transparent flag on a clear pole by Sze Lin Pang, super-real weeds by Tony Matelli, a bursting postcard by Jim Hodges, an assemblage of Matissean cut-metal shapes by George Sugarman, a tree made of sticks and pebbles by Gedi Sibony, cosmic diamond-shaped paintings by Dorothea Rockburne and more (Johnson).

CARLOS MERIDA, Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through Aug. 2). Merida, the Modernist painter, was born in Guatemala in 1891, studied in Paris and lived most of his life in Mexico City. This small retrospective follows his evolution across eight decades from a Picasso-influenced 1915 portrait of a woman to playful, mid-century grid compositions to a Cubist quartet devoted to the four seasons made three years before the artist's death at 93 (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

* OLAF BREUNING, "Hello Darkness," Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 925-2035 (through Aug. 3). Though considerably racier, the tableau that Mr. Breuning has produced here is a lot like what you see in the front yards of creative suburbanites on Halloween. After passing through a ruined library, you come upon the primal scene, illuminated by spinning and strobing colored lights: a skeleton conversing with an extraordinarily realistic sex doll lounging in a deluxe coffin. It's ludicrous but briefly gripping (Johnson).

"WHERE IS ELVIS? THE MAN AND HIS REFLECTIONS," Howard Greenberg Gallery, 120 Wooster Street, (212) 334-0010 (through Aug. 16). This year is the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death in 1977 at 42, a cause for this far-flung and upbeat roundup of nearly 75 photos shot at various times by different photographers. Elvis kissing Mom, Elvis in the Army, Elvis and his Cadillac, Elvis on his Harley, Elvis and his fans, Elvis and his dates, Elvis doing "Blue Suede Shoes" with the Dorsey brothers, Elvis's gold piano, Elvis imitators (including Jerry Seinfeld), Elvis with the blues guitarist B. B. King and a lineup of Elvis dolls all figure in these photographs by such lenspersons as Norma Bergsma, David Byrne, William Eggleston, Marvin Israel and Alfred Wertheimer. Perhaps the most poignant is a 1956 action shot by Roger Marshutz taken in Tupelo, Miss., that shows the powerful communion between the icon and his fans as he straddles the microphone to belt out a song, touching their outstretched hands with his own. Take heart, Elvis seekers. As long as photography lives, old superstars will never fade away (Glueck).

Galleries: Chelsea

"THE ACCELERATED GRIMACE," Daniel Silverstein, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 929-4300 (through July 20). This busy, happily pluralistic exhibition organized by David Hunt generates a gratifying delirium. Bill Walker draws celebrities; Richard Stipl presents 12 wonderful little grimacing wax heads; Adam Henry paints a coolly sardonic vision of a modern museum overflowing with information; Diana Shpungin and Nicole Englemann slap each other silly in a speeded-up video; and the sculptors Andrea Cohen and Elise Ferguson each explore zany possibilities of formal proliferation (Johnson).

"GROUP SHOW," Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183 (through Aug. 30). This well-selected and installed exhibition includes Julian Opie's Neo-Pop landscapes, which look like children's book illustrations; Craig Kauffman's sensuous, baby blue plastic doughnut; Richard Deacon's metal sculptures, resembling flattened pillows; a large Minimalist panel of thin mirror strips by John Armleder; and the image of an inflatable flower converted into a flat, shiny stainless steel cutout by Jeff Koons (Johnson).

"I-BEAM," Cynthia Broan, 423 West 14th Street, (212) 633-6525 (through July 27). The grid as form and metaphor connects the diverse parts of this lively 10-artist show. Highlights include Diana Cooper's intense small doodles; a hallucinatory painting of logs and branches by Dan Kopp; a glossily futuristic abstraction by Jay Davis; playful collages with cut-out windows and rounded borders by Ruth Root; and Graham Parks's sleek, flattened paintings of modernist buildings (Johnson).

"INTERIOR/EXTERIOR," Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335 (through July 31). This understated selection of photographic approaches, mostly to indoor and outdoor architecture, includes a diptych from Dan Graham's essay on popular building styles; blurry pinhole camera shots of ancient Roman remains by Rodney Graham; gleaming corporate spaces by John Pilson; palatial interiors by Candida Hofer; and small, richly atmospheric studio pictures by Saul Fletcher (Johnson).

* KATHLEEN JOHNSON, "The Smallest Wonder," Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159 (through Aug. 9.) Shimmering, wavy lines of light cascade down blue, underwater swimming pool steps in Ms. Johnson's large-format, panoramic photograhs. The transformation of something so ordinary to something almost mystically radiant is exhilarating (Johnson).

* BRUCE NAUMAN. "Mapping the Studio I (Fat Chance John Cage)," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, through July 27: "Mapping the Studio II (Fat Chance John Cage)," Sperone Westwater Gallery, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, through July 27. Even some Bruce Nauman fans I've heard from find these videos stupefyingly dull, but they may turn out to be among his most important works. The original 5-hour, 45-minute version has occupied a vast Dia gallery all year: seven DVD's projected around the walls of the room, showing Mr. Nauman's studio from different angles. The work is shot with a cheap video camera at night, in darkness, by infrared light. What you see are real-time gray-green images edited down from months of shooting. Almost nothing happens. You hear on soundtracks the drone of an air-conditioner, the wind and a distant train whistle. The second version at Sperone has colors added (sickly reds, greens and blues, which slowly phase from one image to the next), with the images also flipping upside down, then right side up every several minutes. The grinding pace gradually sinks into your bones, as is the case with Mr. Nauman's early videos in which he neurotically paced around his studio, but here the desolation is grander because the place is empty. The work overwhelms you with the anxiety, and expectation, that an artist must feel in a studio, alone, desperately waiting for an idea (Kimmelman).

"PHOTO-TRANSCENDENT," Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074, (through July 20). Organized by Peter Nagy, this show focuses on artists who use international photographic conventions to explore and to transcend Indian experience. Rajeev Lochan makes big, lush, hand-colored cityscapes that have a painterly richness; Lewis Koch pairs conventional scenic photographs with photographs of pages from literary and academic books to poetic effect; and from the Casa Documentation Center, there's a selection of vernacular, commercial studio portraits that are at once strange and banal (Johnson).

CHUCK RAMIREZ; MEG LANGHORNE, Dee/Glasoe, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 924-7545 (through July 26). Mr. Ramirez makes big photographs of emptied chocolate box interiors, turning plastic gold Godiva and Whitmans containers into Pop icons of quasi-ecclesiastical splendor; Ms. Langhorne has created a wading pool in the rear gallery afloat with wax flowers -- a "retromantic oasis," in the words of the gallery news release (Johnson).

RICHARD SHARPE SHAVER, "Weird and Wonderful Art," Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212) 462-2668 (through Aug. 2). Less an artist than a man possessed by nutty ideas, Shaver (1907-1975) believed that images suggested by seemingly natural patterns on ordinary rocks proved the existence of titans who lived on earth before human beings. This exhibition presents a selection of Shaver's quasi-scientific rock photographs, examples of his writings and paintings teeming with blond, red-lipped figures shaded and textured so that they look as though carved from stone (Johnson).

* PHOEBE WASHBURN, LFL, 531 West 26th Street, (212) 631-7705 (through July 26). Ms. Washburn's impressive site-specific construction overwhelms the gallery like a small tidal wave of urban refuse. Made of thousands of lengths of cardboard and drywall screws, it slopes from an upper corner of the room, whirls around a hole in the center and engulfs the gallery desk. Besides the imposing physicality there is an evocative tension between uncontrolled growth and architectural containment (Johnson).

TENESH WEBBER, Yossi Milo, 552 West 24th Street, (212) 414-0370 (through July 26). Ms. Webber's large black-and-white photographs verge on Minimalist abstraction. She shoots simple suspended objects and manipulates negatives in the darkroom to produce photogram-like images of lights spiraling in nocturnal space or layered patterns of stretched string. They are elegant but would benefit from a more adventurous imagination (Johnson).

Galleries: Brooklyn

"FIT," Schroeder Romero, 173A North Third Street, Williamsburg, (718) 486-8992 (through July 28). It is hard to see how the six artists in this exhibition fit together, but it's a good show, anyway. It includes a coolly absurd fabric and metal construction, like a giant vacuum cleaner, by Jack Risley; David Henderson's sensuously smoothed fragments of laminated plywood; Lisa Hein's clever update of Duchamp's last work; Elana Herzog's optically surprising play with staples and fabric; Julia Kunin's little octopi, cast in colored glass; and Bob Seng's 1960's-style wall displacement (Johnson).

"TRACT: SYSTEMATIC SPRAWL," Plus Ultra, 235 South First Street, Williamsburg, (718) 387-3844 (through July 21). This tight little five-artist show is the opposite of sprawling. Each artist pursues the tension between expansion and containment. Rachel Urkowitz paints chromatically subtle shadows; Erick Johnson interweaves sharp bands and arcs of muted color; Tricia Keightley paints a Neo-Pop proliferation of old and new graphics; Guillermo Creus envisions surrealistic viscera; and a half-circle of mirrored tesserae by Louis Cameron bounces sparkly light onto the wall (Johnson).

Other Galleries

YOSHITAKA AMANO, Leo Koenig, 249 Centre Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 334-9255 (through Aug. 3). A superstar of Japanese anime, Mr. Amano is the creator of "Speed Racer," "G-Force" and "Final Fantasy." This show features glossy, cartoon portraits of androgynous young action heroes and a near mural-size painting crammed with every "Final Fantasy" character. Best is a series of brush and ink paintings on paper, each representing a different emotionally excited human eye (Johnson).

"MODEL CITIZENS," Roger Smith, 501 Lexington Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 832-8831 (through July 27). Four artists explore black femininity. Tony Gray's insouciantly seductive paintings depict giant forest-dwelling "Black Fairies" with butterfly wings. Wangechi Mutu's apocalyptic collages envision knife-wielding, wounded, bikini-clad female warriors. Lennon Jno Baptiste's graphically deft pictures meditate on the semiotics of black beauty, and Nicole Awai imbeds pop heroines in kaleidoscopic spaces (Johnson).

Last Chance

"EMPIRE/STATE: ARTISTS ENGAGING GLOBALIZATION," Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program at the Art Gallery of the Graduate Center, the City University of New York, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, (212) 431-1737 (through Sunday). This group show, spread over two galleries in the ground floor gallery of the Graduate Center, uses physically austere means to address the big, tangled-up issue of the unequal global distribution of political and economic power. Some of the artists have been creating trenchant political art for years (Peter Fend, Martha Rosler, Allan Sekula); others are welcome as relatively new faces, among them Francois Bucher, Emily Jacir, Josh On/Futurefarmers and Alex Rivera. (Cotter)

"RALPH FASANELLA'S AMERICA," New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sunday). A labor activist turned self-taught painter, Fasanella (1914-97) was perhaps the most celebrated American "outsider" artist after Grandma Moses. He packed everything into his paintings of city people, places and events: strikes, storefronts, skyscrapers, tenements, festivals, churches, religious rituals, political rallies and his own past. This large selection of his brightly colored, busy and often repetitive canvases -- persuasive illustration, not heavyweight art -- traces how Fasanella's working-class background and radical political beliefs affected his painting. One of his major efforts, toward the end of his life, was a series of seven paintings documenting the 1912 textile strike in Lawrence, Mass.; known as the Bread and Roses strike, it was the first big textile strike in America. At its best, Fasanella's work is a triumph of perseverance, faith and propaganda: unlike other populist portrayers of the American scene, he can never be accused of coating it with sugar. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 65+ (Glueck).

* "PRICELESS CHILDREN: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS 1890-1925/CHILD LABOR AND THE PICTORIALIST IDEAL," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through tomorrow). Around the turn of the century there was Lewis Hine, who photographed children toiling in mills and factories. And then there were the Pictorialists, led by Alfred Stieglitz, who took charming, romantic pictures of children in the toils of middle-class privilege. Which children were better off? The question is posed but not glibly answered in this insightful show, which juxtaposes for the first time Hine's sociological approach to photography with that of the aesthetically oriented Pictorialists, represented here by Gertrude Kasebier, Fred Holland Day, Clarence White, Edward Weston and Edward Steichen as well as Stieglitz. It makes the point that both Hine and the Pictorialists portrayed children in stereotypical ways. Some editing would help, but the show is absorbing (Glueck).

"STUDIES AND SKETCHES: HENRY DARGER," American Folk Art Museum's Eva and Morris Feld Gallery, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue near 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Sunday). This small, muted show is a supplement to the larger installation of Darger's collage-paintings at the museum's new home on 53rd Street and gives a good sense of how those paintings were created. Darger mainly composed by tracing directly from comic strips, coloring books, newspaper advertisements and magazine illustrations Hours: Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Cotter).

* "TESTIMONY: VERNACULAR ART OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN SOUTH," AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through tomorrow). Another blow to the division between insider and outsider art, this exhibition includes engaging works by artists like Thornton Dial Sr., Ronald Lockett, J. B. Murry, Howard Spelling and Jimmie Lee Sudduth. They slide between painting, collage, automatic drawing and found-object relief with the greatest of ease, paralleling and supplementing some of 20th-century modernism's main moves (Smith).

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
A Restored German Classic of Futuristic Angst

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
On Jan. 10, 1927, Fritz Lang's "Metropolis," a wildly ambitious, hugely expensive science fiction allegory of filial revolt, romantic love, alienated labor and dehumanizing technology opened at the Ufa Palast theater in Berlin. Lang's film, of course, went on to become one of the touchstones of 20th-century cinema, exhaustively studied and endlessly imitated, but apart from its brief theatrical run in Berlin and Nuremberg 75 years ago, the movie as Lang made it has never really been seen.
 What happened to "Metropolis" is, in some ways, a familiar movie-industry story of a studio's interference with an artist's work. (Or, if you prefer to side with the studios, of a filmmaker's profligate indifference to economic necessity and audience response.) A few weeks after the premiere, Ufa, the studio that had produced the film, pulled it from theaters and cut out 7 of the original 12 reels. 
 Paramount, the American distributor, went even further, engaging a playwright, Channing Pollock, to compose English title cards and to reshape the story to fit his own tastes. "I have given it my meaning," Pollock boasted. Lang was so appalled that he swore he would never go to the United States, a vow he broke a few years later, when Hitler proved to be a much graver threat to his art (to say nothing of his life) than Hollywood could ever be. 
Much of the grandeur and strangeness of "Metropolis" survived Paramount's butchery and the further desecration perpetrated in 1984 by Giorgio Moroder, who added color tints to Karl Freund's eerie Expressionist black-and-white cinematography and replaced Gottfried Huppertz's lush, Wagnerian score with the music of pop stars like Freddy Mercury and Bonnie Tyler.
Had Lang lived to see the age of the "director's cut" DVD, he might have responded to those transgressions and reconstructed a definitive "Metropolis." But now we have something nearly as good. Thanks to four years of painstaking work by Martin Koerber, a German film preservationist, and Alpha-Omega, a Munich company specializing in digital restoration, there is now, at long last, a "Metropolis" with a legitimate claim to being definitive.
Film Forum on Houston Street may lack the decadent Weimar glamour of the Ufa Palast, but it does serve the best movie house popcorn in Manhattan and, for the next two weeks, will be showing the latest version of "Metropolis" in a spotless 35-millimeter print with a new recording of Huppertz's score.
Much has been retrieved -- more than 1,300 feet of film have been added since the last rerelease, in 1987 -- and the English titles have been translated anew. There is also a second set of title cards, printed in a plainer font, without multiple exclamation points, to indicate scenes that are still missing. A subplot involving a character called the Thin Man, a mysterious monk and visions inspired by the Book of Revelation remains tantalizingly sketchy, but Lang's visual audacity and thematic ambition are breathtakingly apparent, as is his astonishing sense of scale, which enabled him to swoop from terrifying sublimity to piercing, quiet intimacy with a single cut.
Pollock complained that, in Lang's version, "symbolism ran such riot that people who saw it couldn't tell what the picture was all about." He was not altogether wrong: Christianity, German romanticism, modernism and Marxism stampede through the movie like the crowds of angry workers and bourgeois revelers in the apocalyptic climax, but the confusion that results ultimately resolves into hallucinatory, visionary clarity. Only by pushing himself to the very edge of coherence was Lang able to transcend the schematic moralizing that keeps so much science fiction tethered, ultimately, to the mundane.
This is not to slight either the emotional impact or the political resonance of Lang's fever-dream of the future. Quite the contrary: "Metropolis" retains its power to overwhelm, trouble and move because it is connected to the deep anxieties of modern life as if by a high-voltage cable. The story of the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), a modern Pygmalion designing a female robot to replace his lost love, stands between "Frankenstein" and "A.I." as an expression of the defining modern preoccupation with machines that blur the boundary between the human and the mechanical.
The early scene of workers trudging into the dark maw of their underground factory has been copied to death (most recently in "Road to Perdition"), but it remains unsurpassed as an image of how mechanized work for another's profit can strip people of their individuality. Later, as the mob of workers smashes the factory and unleashes a flood of anarchy on the city, we see an equally chilling image of the senseless destruction that revolt against exploitation can produce.
In 1927, "Metropolis" was attacked by the German left as implicitly fascistic, and by the right for its Communist tendencies. But one of the curiosities of the film is that its aesthetic extremity serves a mild and moderate ideology. The city, run by the suave industrialist Joh Fredersen, is a drastically polarized place, with lush gardens and soaring skyscrapers above ground and infernal slums below.
In the depths, a young woman, Maria (Brigitte Helm, the Kirsten Dunst of the Weimar Republic), prophesies the coming of a messianic figure called the Mediator, whose name sums up the temperate, reformist message buried in the movie's sweep and bombast. The Mediator turns out to be Freder Fredersen (Gustav Frohlich), the boss's sensitive son, whose infatuation with Maria leads him to a moral awakening.
His ultimate triumph is delayed by obstacles and digressions too numerous and wonderful for mere prose, and the audience is distracted from the film's moral by its elements of horror, mystery, burlesque and romance. Far from a historical curio, "Metropolis" arrives, three-quarters of a century late, like an artifact from the future. At last we have the movie every would-be cinematic visionary has been trying to make since 1927.
"Metropolis" opens today at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village. Tickets: $9.75; $5 for members and 65+ weekdays before 5 p.m. Box office: (212) 727-8110.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Edged Higher Last Month 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
Wholesale prices nudged up 0.1 percent in June, the Labor Department reported today, the first increase in three months, lifted by higher costs for gasoline, cars and trucks. Jobless claims climbed to a six-week high. 
 The advance in the Producer Price Index, which matched expectations, came after wholesale prices dropped 0.2 percent in April and 0.4 percent in May, the department reported. 
 Even with June's small increase, the report suggested that inflation remained under control.
But after being flat in May, the "core" rate of wholesale inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, rose 0.2 percent in June. That was double the forecast.
In June, energy prices were flat, after dropping 2.3 percent in May, the report said. Gasoline prices rose 1 percent, residential electricity prices increased 0.7 percent and natural gas prices rose 0.5 percent. Those higher costs were tempered by a 0.6 percent decline in the price of heating oil. 
Car prices increased 0.4 percent in June and prices for light trucks, like sport utility vehicles, rose 0.5 percent, the biggest increase since February. Food prices edged up 0.1 percent, after falling 0.2 percent in May. 
In another report, new claims for unemployment insurance increased last week by a bigger-than-expected 16,000, to a seasonally adjusted 403,000, the highest level since May 25, the Labor Department said. It was the first increase in three weeks.
Economists predicted claims would move higher in part because car plants temporarily shut down around this time each year to retool for new models. Some textile plants often temporarily close in July.
The more stable four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, edged up to 395,000 last week, suggesting that the job market continues to be sluggish.

HEADLINE: Bill Seeks Openness at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
Some members of Congress are seeking to force two government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to adhere to the same disclosure rules that bind most public companies. Though their proposal has obvious intellectual appeal, it may not accomplish all they are seeking, given the example of a similar entity that already complies with most of those rules, Farmer Mac.
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, charged by Congress with building the secondary market for home loans, are the sole focus of the proposed legislation. Their exemption from all Securities and Exchange Commission requirements strikes GE Capital and other competitors as unfair. A bill sponsored in March by Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, and Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, would revoke the exemption. 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contend that they already divulge much of what the S.E.C. expects, if not more, albeit on a voluntary basis.
A look at Farmer Mac's disclosure in recent years suggests that forcing these companies to file with the S.E.C. may not improve what investors are told. Of all the government-sponsored enterprises, only Farmer Mac, whose official name is the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, is now obliged to submit annual reports, quarterly filings and proxy statements to the S.E.C. -- all but registration statements.
Even so, Farmer Mac disclosed less in 2001 than it did in 2000 in at least three instances. In discussions with investors and a reporter in recent weeks, the company has argued that its public filings comply with all applicable securities regulations.
The most important area where less information is now available concerns disclosure of Farmer Mac's use of interest rate swaps, a type of derivative in which one party swaps fixed-rate payments and gets floating-rate payments in return. Farmer Mac relies heavily on them in its efforts to build a secondary market for farm loans. Yet, in 2001 Farmer Mac ceased publication of a table in its annual report about these instruments. What remains are two paragraphs that are long on definitions but short on numbers. As a result, the company no longer discloses the notional amount of its derivative position, which was $1.1 billion in 2000. That figure is only the starting point that analysts and regulators use to understand how much systemic risk is posed by a company or its financing or trading partners, known as counterparties.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in contrast, publish the notional amount of their derivative positions and disclose more information about their various counterparties. 
Asked in late April whether it would follow the example being set by the larger government-sponsored enterprises on derivatives, specifically Fannie Mae, Farmer Mac issued a statement saying: "Fannie Mae is not subject to S.E.C. disclosure requirements, whereas Farmer Mac is. Farmer Mac completely and accurately discloses all information required of it by the securities laws and regulations. As long as that distinction exists, we expect there will be differences between Fannie Mae's disclosures and our own." 
Asked last week why the company had dropped a table about interest rate swaps, a spokesman for Farmer Mac, Robert Siegfried of the public relations firm Kekst & Company, said accounting rules for derivatives changed in 2001 and that the current presentation complied with all accounting and S.E.C. requirements. 
A spokesman for the S.E.C., John Heine, said he could not "discuss specific filings." But he referred to Congressional testimony in which a commission official explained how the agency used a screening process to determine which filings to review.
The majority are not reviewed at all, said Peter Romeo, a securities lawyer with Hogan & Hartson who was a longtime S.E.C. official. He is pushing to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac file to the S.E.C., but acknowledged that there was no guarantee that the agency would make inspection of government-sponsored companies a priority amid so many cases of corporate corruption. "They are truly under siege right now and have been ever since Enron," he said of the S.E.C. "So it wouldn't surprise me that something with respect to Farmer Mac would get a lower priority."
Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., also has professional ties to Farmer Mac. While that relationship is not likely to affect the agency's decision on whether to review a specific filing, it could ultimately affect the commission's ability to pursue an enforcement action if needed.
Mr. Pitt was one of Farmer Mac's outside lawyers when he was in private practice at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson. The relationship goes back at least to 1994, around the time Farmer Mac brought him in to explain to its overseers at the Farm Credit Administration why it was restating some earnings figures.
Asked whether that history might affect S.E.C. decisions on Farmer Mac, Mr. Heine referred to a letter from Mr. Pitt pledging to recuse himself from any decisions concerning former clients until Aug. 4, the first anniversary of his appointment to the commission.
Farmer Mac has pared its disclosure in areas other than derivatives as well. For instance, the company ceased disclosing in 2001 how much of its guarantee fees came from securities retained in its portfolio. In 2000, 26 percent of the company's $11.7 million in guarantee income was money Farmer Mac paid itself.
A change in accounting rules as of April 1, 2001, forced companies to begin classifying all future income of this sort as interest income. But no information was given on how much of last year's $15.8 million of guarantee fees included in-house payments. "We are not currently disclosing that number as a separate line item," the company said in a statement some weeks ago. Last week, Mr. Siegfried of Kekst added that soon-to-be released second-quarter earnings would contain some information.
Farmer Mac has also skimped on some of the detail it once furnished about the kinds of farm loans it guarantees and their geographic concentration. In 1996, the breakdowns included 10 types of crops or livestock and 10 regions. These days, the company lumps the information into three commodity groups and six regions. Mr. Siegfried explained that because farmers sometimes switch crops, "it was better not to hang things on specific crops."
But he did not explain why geographic detail was consolidated -- after all, few farmers completely relocate. Andrea Calise, a colleague of Mr. Siegfried at Kekst, said Farmer Mac considered the new format easier for investors to analyze.
Lastly, in defending what it paid insiders last year, the company's April 2002 proxy statement cited the advice of a "nationally recognized independent" compensation consultant no fewer than seven times, without naming the firm. In past years, the company had identified the firm. The company said it had complied with securities laws, but when pressed said the consulting company was Hewitt Associates.
Robert McCarson, director of corporate communications for Fannie Mae, is not surprised that some S.E.C. registrants manage to be stingy with information. "This rush to force Fannie and Freddie to register with the S.E.C. is a flawed argument because it's not a panacea," he said. "Enron was an S.E.C. registrant, and so was Worldcom."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
New Pessimism On '02 Revival Is Pervading Silicon Valley

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 11 

 BODY:
Hopes that the second half of 2002 would see the end of technology's business decline seem to be retreating.
 Not so long ago, a range of Silicon Valley chief executives were holding out the prospect of a recovery led by purchases of personal computers and other electronic devices. As recently as the beginning of June, the semiconductor giant Intel was telling investors that it expected a "seasonally strong" second half of the year. 
 But recent days have instead seen new caution among some executives and analysts. Dell Computer said today that its second-quarter revenue and profit would be higher than expected, not because the market was growing but because it was "continuing to gain market share in the midst of weak overall demand." 
And last week, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chip competitor, cut its revenue projections for the second time in two weeks, citing weakness in its microprocessor line, which is heavily dependent on consumer purchases of personal computers. Its newest revenue expectations were $600 million, down from an original $900 million.
"The challenge for us is unlike our competitor, which has an enterprise business," an A.M.D. spokesman, Morris Denton, said. "It's early to make predictions, but we haven't started to see the early signs from back-to-school, which would indicate that we're coming out of the decline."
Some analysts are seeing weakness beyond the chip market. Merrill Lynch's personal computer analyst, Steven M. Fortuna, last week lowered his revenue expectations for Dell for the second half of 2002 by $800 million. He also changed his forecast to project a revenue decline in the personal computer industry of 6.7 percent for the year, with average unit prices down 9 percent compared with 2001.
National Semiconductor, another of the Valley's large chip companies, was downgraded last week by Jonathan Joseph of Salomon Smith Barney, who expressed worry in a note to investors that the cellphone market might be softening.
Eroding consumer confidence could be a particular blow to the semiconductor industry, which had been projecting a second-half turnaround as recently as last month. The Semiconductor Industry Association reported continued strength in non-PC chip markets like flash memory and digital signal processors, that are dependent on the consumer market.
To be sure, many longtime experts in the Valley said they still expected a turnaround by the end of the year, but they are becoming increasingly cautious.
"I think by the end of the year we're going to see rising employment," said Steven Levy, an economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, Calif., "but there is all of this wild card stuff." And Michael Murphy, who publishes The California Technology Stock Letter, argued last week that spending on PC's and cellphones would grow this year and more quickly next year as companies seek technology solutions to reduce expenses.
But the prolonged stagnation of the PC market -- which for more than two decades has provided almost assured double-digit growth -- suggests that Silicon Valley may be approaching a shift that goes beyond the collapse of dot-com stocks.
Increasingly, personal computers have become a replacement rather than a growth market, and Silicon Valley collectively is still waiting for the Next Big Thing.
"This has been the perfect storm," said David Readerman, a partner and director of growth equity strategy at Thomas Weisel Partners, the San Francisco-based investment firm. "We had Y2K, the Internet build-out and the biggest of all" -- overbuilding in telecommunications.
Growth, he said, is now seen from sectors of the economy that for more than a decade Silicon Valley has thought of as passe. Military contracting and domestic security are areas that might emerge as economic factors. 
To grasp the depth of the Valley's decline from its peak, it is only necessary to review the fortunes of the Fast 50, an annual list of the region's fastest-growing companies maintained by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley, a coalition of government, corporate and civic groups.
Of the top 10 companies on the list in 2001, only one, eBay, was profitable in the last quarter. Two companies, Excite@Home and Exodus Communications, filed for bankruptcy protection and have since been acquired. Seven others on the list had losses in each of the last four quarters, including Commerce One, which reported a staggering $220 million loss in the first quarter of this year. Finally, the stocks of four of the eight survivors in this group are now trading for less than $1.
At the same time, unemployment levels in Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, declined in May, the most recent month for which there is data. The rate was 7.1 percent, down from 7.6 percent in April but more than double the 3.4 percent a year earlier. From May 2001 to May 2002, the county lost 27,400 jobs, with the largest losses occurring in communications equipment and electronic components, according to the California Economic Development Department.
This somewhat positive job news may have been largely offset by the continued gloom nationwide in the telecommunications industry, which had been driving growth among the suppliers of data and voice infrastructure equipment in Silicon Valley.
"I am not as optimistic as I was a month ago," said Andrew Seybold, publisher of Outlook 4Mobility, an industry newsletter in Los Gatos, Calif., covering wireless data. The wireless industry has been edging toward its next generation of data and voice handsets, and a set of new products are planned beginning in August.
The world of wireless data is poised to create a proliferation of hand-held gadgets that could be a powerful driver for Silicon Valley. But the disarray in the telecommunications market has cast a pall over the idea that the rollout will happen quickly. 
This kind of pushing back of new markets that might have spurred a rebound seems to be quickly becoming the norm around the Valley.
"We've been saying that it's really not until the fourth quarter of '03 that you return to earlier levels, and maybe even that's suspect," Mr. Readerman said.

HEADLINE: Craft Project at Columbus Circle; 
Museum Plans $30 Million Makeover and Expansion

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Out of the crumbling marble cocoon of 2 Columbus Circle, Holly Hotchner sees a new American Craft Museum emerging.
 Ms. Hotchner, the director of the museum, sees artwork once again filling the gently curving, oddly angled, walnut-paneled, porthole-punctuated galleries designed 40 years ago for Huntington Hartford's personal collection. She sees diners in the penthouse restaurant once again diverted by the astonishing view of Central Park, whose treetops spread out like a lawn of emerald broccoli. She sees performances in the handsomely appointed auditorium and artists' studios in what is now an office warren. She even sees visitors checking their coats! 
 "We don't have a coat room now," Ms. Hotchner said on Wednesday, pausing at the cloakroom counter during an inspection tour of 2 Columbus Circle, which was awarded to the museum last month by the Bloomberg administration. "This is so exciting." 
By buying 2 Columbus Circle from the city and substantially renovating it, at a cost of at least $30 million, the museum would gain more than four times the gallery space it has at 40 West 53rd Street, which it plans to sell. It would have an auditorium for the first time in its 46 years and room enough for educational programs, a large store and its permanent collection of 1,700 objects -- jewelry, ceramics, glass, wood, textiles, basketry and design prototypes -- which now sit unseen in a Chelsea warehouse.
Much about the project remains uncertain. An architect has not yet been chosen. The museum may propose adding up to three floors atop the nine-story structure, Ms. Hotchner said.
The New York City Economic Development Corporation will submit the sale to public land-use review, though it could have averted the process through a technicality. That will put off groundbreaking for at least a year. Two years of construction will follow.
But Ms. Hotchner, who has been director of the museum since 1997, already envisions a cultural hub open seven days a week. "It's a quantum leap for us," she said.
It will be a quantum leap for the building, too, and not one that will please preservationists.
While Ms. Hotchner says she thinks some interiors can be reused -- especially the Mark Goodson Theater -- there is little question in her mind that the largely windowless marble facade designed by Edward Durell Stone will have to go. Some of it is going already: a few panels of Vermont marble are held in place by steel braces.
"If you were to try to save it, all the marble would have to be removed and reattached, which would be a tremendous undertaking," Ms. Hotchner said.
The concave north wall need not be straightened out, since the museum shows objects, not paintings hanging against flat surfaces. And Ms. Hotchner said it might be possible to keep some walnut paneling. "The wood is very beautiful," she said, "and obviously we're a museum about materials."
But she contends that the blank walls need openings. "There's a tremendous missed opportunity to refer to Central Park and where we're situated in New York," Ms. Hotchner said. "The whole building is hermetically sealed except in those corners where you're allowed to interact with the outside world."
That sense of hermetic isolation is not limited to portholes.
The building's original name is still incised over the entrance -- "Gallery of Modern Art Including the Huntington Hartford Collection" -- even though Mr. Hartford, heir to the A.& P. supermarket fortune, relinquished control in 1969, five years after the gallery opened.
The lobby is still paved with marble disks that resulted from cutting out the portholes. The 30-foot-high Gallery 3D, which once housed an Aeolian-Skinner organ, still has scarlet carpeting and a burnished bronze mezzanine balustrade, repeating the circular motif. Heavy bronze doors, incised with more circles, greet visitors to the theater.
In the basement, there is even an original wall-sized Honeywell building control console, looking like something out of "Goldfinger" with its buttons, plugs and dials. One panel regulates the "radiation hot water system." The central temperature gauge reads 200. ("Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.")
Life went on at 2 Columbus Circle after Mr. Hartford pulled out. The gallery, renamed the New York Cultural Center, was operated by Fairleigh Dickinson University from 1969 to 1975. A year later, Gulf & Western Industries, with headquarters across Columbus Circle, bought the building as a gift to the city, intending that it serve for 30 years as a visitors center and headquarters for the Cultural Affairs Department.
The agency moved out in 1998 and the space has since been empty, though used from time to time by film crews, who painted over some of the walnut paneling.
In 2000, the Giuliani administration issued a request for proposals to redevelop the site. The American Craft Museum, which had determined that it would not be able to expand on 53rd Street, replied after the deadline. It is not the policy of the Economic Development Corporation, however, to disqualify an otherwise viable proposal for lateness, a spokeswoman said.
The craft museum was in competition with two other plans.
The Dahesh Museum of Art, now at 601 Fifth Avenue, near 48th Street, proposed to restore the building as its home, working with Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates and Ann Beha Architects.
Now negotiating for new space in Midtown, Dahesh is "very disappointed" about not being awarded 2 Columbus Circle, said Steven Simkin, a museum trustee and chairman of the real estate department at the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. "It's ironic," he said, "because they were probably the single most dogged advocate of preserving the building and using it for a cultural purpose."
Donald J. Trump wanted to build a new hotel, originally working with the architect Alan Lapidus. "The craft museum is a terrible waste of a great site," Mr. Trump said. "A hotel will pay far more in taxes and would have generated a lot more business for the city. Museums have failed there many times. I predict this one will also."
Mr. Trump contends that he was told by Giuliani administration officials that he would be awarded the site. But Andrew M. Alper, the president of the Economic Development Corporation, said no designation had been made.
"We believe that a museum would do more to enhance the neighborhood than another hotel," Mr. Alper said. "And from an economic impact, this proposal was quite favorable." He declined to rank the proposals in order of financial return or specify the purchase price, though he said the museum would get a break for completing the renovation within two years of groundbreaking.
As for replacing the facade, which the Landmarks Preservation Commission has declined to consider, Mr. Alper said, "We liked the idea of making the building more transparent from the park and the park more transparent from the building."
Braced for a fight -- or at least a lively debate -- over the renovation, Ms. Hotchner finds a hopeful augury in the view from the restaurant toward the Columbus Monument.
"I like the fact that Columbus is facing our building," she said. "That's very critical to our sense of well-being."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Pharmaceutical makers and ad agencies fight to preserve campaigns for prescription drugs.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE, facing growing legislative threats to one of the advertising industry's most lucrative categories, is stepping up the fight to protect its freedom to pitch prescription drugs directly to consumers.
 Drug companies, agencies and their media allies who have benefited handsomely from the flood of ads beat back one recent measure in the House of Representatives. But advocacy organizations on the other side of the issue vow to continue battling to limit or even eliminate such campaigns, and one senator has introduced legislation that would limit the pharmaceutical industry's tax deduction for such advertising. 
 The category of direct-to-consumer ads did not even exist until five years ago. Before 1997, broad curbs prevented pharmaceutical makers from mounting any significant efforts, and they aimed most of their spending directly at health care professionals. 
But since the Food and Drug Administration loosened its strictures against those ads, primarily by making it much easier to promote drugs with commercials, the category has boomed. It has become an estimated $2.5-billion-a-year business for the media. That exceeds the amount spent annually to advertise many drugs sold over the counter like analgesics and vitamins, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending.
The spending for the direct-to-consumer drug campaigns, which come complete with the traditional trappings of brand advertising like celebrity endorsers, jingles, free samples and slogans, also exceeds the yearly outlays in mainstay marketing categories like insurance and real estate, apparel and alcoholic beverages.
Agencies are anxious to keep that revenue flowing as they struggle to recover from the worst advertising recession in decades. They and their clients, the drug companies, are also eager to keep open a channel that has significantly stimulated demand and sales. 
Indeed, in a survey last month by the Ipsos-NPD division of Ipsos, a marketing research company, 25 percent of respondents said they had been prompted by direct-to-consumer ads to call or visit a doctor to discuss the product being advertised. Moreover, 15 percent of respondents reported requesting the very drug that was the subject of the ad.
That is one reason opponents castigate direct-to-consumer ads, decrying them as unfairly influencing important health care decisions about powerful medicines that ought not to be sold with the same sophisticated marketing ploys used to peddle movies, soft drinks or fast food.
"The stuff done to promote drugs works, and because it works, it's doing a disservice to the patient," said Sidney Wolfe, director for the health research group of Public Citizen, an advocacy organization in Washington. "The doctors are frequently as misled as the patients are," he added.
One doctor, J. Edward Hill -- the new chairman of the American Medical Association in Chicago -- offered another complaint. "We have no policy that opposes direct-to-consumer advertising, mainly because of freedom-of-speech issues," Dr. Hill said. "However, we do have some big concerns about advertising getting in the middle of the patient-physician relationship.
"It's sometimes even creating an adversarial relationship," he added, "when the patient insists on an advertised medicine but the doctor believes it's not the best or most effective medicine."
Dr. Hill called on the Food and Drug Administration and the pharmaceutical industry to finance "research that would definitely tell us whether this improves the quality of care enough to make it worth the increased costs of the medicines being advertised."
A bill before the House of Representatives, to provide a Medicare prescription-drug benefit to the elderly, had included a provision directing the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to conduct such a study. But by the time the House passed the bill on June 28 and sent it to the Senate, the provision had been deleted.
"The bill is absolutely devoid of anything to do with advertising," said Dick O'Brien, executive vice president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies and director for the Washington office, who has led the Madison Avenue effort.
"It was serious, really serious," Mr. O'Brien said of the attempt by the critics to urge limits on direct-to-consumer campaigns. "We had to go into overdrive to explain that the role advertising plays is really a very beneficial one," centered on "empowering consumers to talk with their doctors as equals and opening discussions that otherwise would not have taken place."
The agencies are being joined by lobbyists for media that would lose ad revenue if Congress tightened rules for direct-to-consumer ads. At one time, some magazine and newspaper publishers perceived television and radio as rivals for ad revenue from makers of prescription drugs, but the media are now working together.
"This is certainly the one issue we're looking at right now," said Rita Cohen, senior vice president for legislative and regulatory policy of the Magazine Publishers of America.
"We have to be diligent about all potential Congressional action that might be negative," she added. "So we've been visiting the key people on Capitol Hill and showing them ads from magazines, letting the ads talk for themselves, so they can understand the benefits of advertising."
Another charge raised by opponents is that most of the prescription drugs promoted directly to consumers in magazines, on television and elsewhere are the newest, most expensive products and thus offer their makers the most profits.
"American taxpayers should not have to subsidize excessive advertising that only leads to higher prices at the pharmacy counter," said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan. She recently proposed that the tax deductions taken by drug makers for advertising -- which is currently a fully deductible business expense -- cannot exceed the tax deductions they take for research and development. Senator Stabenow is seeking to have her Fair Advertising and Increased Research Act become part of the Senate version of the bill the House passed last month.
"She is very well meaning, but this raises very serious issues," said Dan Jaffe, the executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers who runs the Washington office of the organization, which represents the nation's marketers. "It would create an enormous precedent way beyond prescription drugs, affecting research on energy conservation by oil companies, fuel efficiency by automakers, health benefits by food companies.
"The advertising community and the media community worked very hard on the House side" to assure there would be no advertising limits in the bill passed there, he said.
"We need to work very hard on the Senate side," he said. "This is an issue that will not go away."

HEADLINE: Car Rentals Are Unexpectedly Strong 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
Even as airlines struggle to make fare increases stick, and to attract customers skittish about security measures, rental car companies are doing just fine. Traffic is strong, rates are steady or even rising, and cars are even running short in some places, including the New York area. 
 Industry officials and analysts estimate that consumers are paying as much as 10 percent more on daily rental contracts than last summer, when rental companies competed feverishly in a tepid travel market. 
 Discounts remain routinely available on the Internet, but walk-in specials and discounts offered by reservations agents, where most rental car bookings are made, have dwindled; the companies simply do not need to offer them. 
"Rates are definitely higher," said Rich Broome, vice president for corporate affairs at the Hertz Corporation, a division of the Ford Motor Company. 
He defended the increases as necessary for an industry whose business has been suffering for several years. Indeed, the ANC Rental Corporation, the parent of National and Alamo, filed for bankruptcy last fall, and was in financial trouble even before Sept. 11. Lately, there has been speculation that Budget Rent a Car may soon follow suit if it does not find a buyer. The Cendant Corporation, which owns Avis Rent A Car, is the leading candidate to buy Budget.
"We're still playing catch up" after last year, Mr. Broome said.
Even so, the industry, whose fate has long been tied to that of the airlines, appears to have reduced that dependence this summer. Analysts are encouraged. 
"The rental car companies are being as rational and as intelligent as they can about pricing," said Henry H. Harteveldt, a senior analyst with Forrester Research Inc. of San Francisco. "They are sticking to their knitting, and they are avoiding the suicidal pricing strategies that their brethren elsewhere in the travel industry have embraced."
"Prices are not only holding up, they are improving, and that's something the airlines have not been able to do," added Betsy Snyder, transportation industry analyst with Standard & Poor's in New York.
Summer is the rental car industry's peak season, as millions of Americans head out for vacations. Normally, companies would prepare for this influx by vastly expanding inventories of cars and trucks, a reason spring is generally the strongest season for automobile sales.
But this year, the rental companies have been extremely careful not to let inventories swell. After September's terrorist attacks and the drop in air travel, the companies sliced inventories by an estimated 25 percent. At the time, nine-tenths of industry business resulted from air travelers.
Through the fall and winter, rental companies kept a tight rein on inventories, choosing to keep them lean even as air travel rebounded. Only in late spring did inventories begin to rise, to the relief of Detroit, whose sales of vehicles to rental companies had plunged. "We had half a year when it was very barren," said George C. Pipas, an industry sales analyst with Ford.
Even with the rebound, vehicle inventories remain down about 10 to 15 percent industrywide, compared with last year, according to estimates from the companies, analysts and auto makers. The situation points up the difference between airlines and the rental companies in reacting to shifts in travel patterns.
Though they can eliminate routes and lay off workers, airlines, in the end, can only park their aircraft in desert storage lots. Rental car companies, by contrast, "have a lot of flexibility to reduce the size of their fleet," Ms. Snyder said.
Along with keeping supplies in check, rental companies and analysts say they have noticed an increase in business from both leisure and business travelers, who are choosing to drive short distances, rather than fly. As yet, there are no accurate measurements of how much new business this trend has generated.
But contributing factors are clearly the extra time needed to clear security and lingering fears over the constant flow of terrorism alerts. "You can market cars to people who want to get away" from such inconveniences, Mr. Harteveldt said. And a number of travelers prefer not to use their own vehicles.
"They won't drive their own BMW, they'll go down to the airport, pick up a car from Hertz, and drive that to Charlotte," said Michael Schlott, owner of International Tours of Atlanta, whose travel agency has experienced a rise in rental car bookings.
Companies are willing to pay for employees' rentals, because it is cheaper than flying, particularly when corporate discounts are applied. Some companies are even requiring that employees not fly on short trips, like Detroit to Chicago or New York to Washington, and in many parts of the country that means they must drive.
Many of these customers do not go to airports to pick up vehicles. Officials at Avis and Enterprise Rent-a-Car said they had noticed an increase in rentals at offices and counters in city and suburban locations, what the industry calls off-airport rentals. "To us, that means people are going to their local rental car office, renting a car, and driving to the nearest city as opposed to flying," said Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman for Avis, based in Parsippany, N.J.
Ms. McGowan said Avis had noted that such rentals are lasting longer, suggesting that customers are arranging more meetings during their business trips, as opposed to the short rentals of a fly-in, fly-out schedule. "The more days, the better for us," she said. 
At Enterprise, which does 95 percent of its rentals from nonairport locations, business is up by double digits this summer, as it has been for several summers, said Sarah Bustamante, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis-based company. She declined to offer specifics, but added, "We really have been uniquely positioned to serve that market." Enterprise's fleet remains the same size as last year, and its rates are also the same, Ms. Bustamante said.
Enterprise has experienced no shortages, which have been the norm for other rental companies, particularly in places like Manhattan, Southern California, some Florida cities and Hawaii.

HEADLINE: Top Peruvian Ministers Forced Out in Cabinet Shakeup 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, July 11 

 BODY:
Two of Peru's most highly visible ministers, strong proponents of privatizations and fiscal austerity policies that many Peruvians reject, said today that they planned to resign as part of an impending cabinet reorganization intended to shore up the tottering, year-old government of President Alejandro Toledo.
 Mr. Toledo had sought the resignations of the economy minister, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, and the prime minister, Roberto Danino, whose policies have angered Peruvians. 
 Mr. Toledo's government has been battered by protests and low popularity ratings as it has struggled to control poverty and create jobs in this nation of 26 million people. 
News that the two ministers, both favorites of Wall Street, were on their way out caused the sol to close at a yearly low of 3.55 to the dollar. 
"Kuczynski especially was seen by the markets as the biggest guarantor of fiscal stability," said Rafael de la Fuente, chief Latin economist for BNP Paribas in New York. "His departure is negative in that respect, though not unexpected."
Mr. Toledo was expected to name replacements as early as Friday. Analysts here said that Mr. Kuczynski was likely to be replaced by Javier Silva Ruete, who was economy minister in the interim government that briefly ruled Peru after President Alberto K. Fujimori's administration collapsed in a corruption scandal in 2000. 
Luis Solari, a doctor and socially conservative former health minister, is expected to take Mr. Danino's place. 
Because Dr. Solari is a congressman and a top official in Mr. Toledo's Peru Possible Party, his appointment is seen as giving the party the political influence it craves in the cabinet. 
Mr. Silva Ruete is not a member of the party, but he is a pragmatist whose flexibility in managing the economy is an important consideration for a president deeply concerned about public opinion.
Mr. Toledo's popularity rating has dropped to 16 percent, and his party is likely to be swamped in regional elections in November.
"What President Toledo wants is a political cabinet," Mr. Kuczynski said in an interview on Wednesday night. 
Today, the minister of women and social promotion, Cecilia Blondet, said she, too, was leaving. Resignations were expected from Fernando Olivera, the justice minister; Nicolas Lynch, the education minister; and Luis Chang, the minister of transportation. 
On Monday, Diego Garcia-Sayan, the foreign minister, resigned, after the departure last month of Interior Minister Fernando Rospigliosi, who quit in the wake of antiprivatization protests in southern Peru.
In Lima, there was speculation that Alan Garcia, the former president and rival of Mr. Toledo, had pushed for the removal of ministers like Mr. Olivera, who has investigated Mr. Garcia for corruption. In return, Mr. Garcia's party, the American Popular Revolutionary Party, known by the Spanish acronym APRA, would probably tone down its attacks against the government.
"Toledo probably decided to cast his lot with the APRA," Mr. Kuczynski remarked.

Two Ball Clubs Had a Close Call on Payrolls

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
As baseball officials and owners paint an increasingly bleaker picture of baseball's economics, two teams have stepped forward as Exhibits A and B. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Detroit Tigers recently experienced payroll problems and needed bank loans to pay their players, people in baseball familiar with the problems said yesterday.
 Both teams said they have had no trouble meeting their payrolls, but the people who disclosed the developments provided specific details of how the Devil Rays and the Tigers resolved their problems and averted being plunged into uncharted financial territory. 
 Players are paid twice monthly, and it was the June 15 payment the Devil Rays and the Tigers were having trouble with, the people who told about it said. The Tigers, one of them said, also faced a problem with next Monday's payroll but worked out that one, too. 
Bob DuPuy, chief operating officer of Major League Baseball, declined to comment on the identity of the teams or their specific problems, but he said, "I believe any issues with regard to meeting expenses currently have been resolved and that there's no immediate problem for any team."
He added that any problems that might have existed were "a matter of cash flow and ongoing expenses."
These potential payroll problems are a reflection of the economic problems Major League Baseball says its lower-revenue clubs face. Commissioner Bud Selig reiterated this week his contention that some teams are in deep financial trouble, and baseball has hammered home that point in its negotiations with the players union for a new labor contract. The owners are seeking an agreement that would provide financial relief, while the union feels the owners' proposals would make too much of an inroad into players' salaries. 
One person who told of the problems said the Tigers secured a commercial loan backed by a guarantee from the team owner, Michael Ilitch, to make next week's payroll.
For the June 15 payrolls, the Tigers and the Devil Rays secured loans using distributions from baseball's central fund as collateral.
The central fund is the repository for revenue from such sources as the national television package and licensing. The commissioner's office periodically, though not on a regular schedule, distributes money from the fund to the 30 teams.
As an aid to the Devil Rays and the Tigers, the commissioner's office wrote a letter confirming that the central fund money would be distributed to all of the teams this month. The two teams presented the letter to their banks, and as a result the banks lent them money against that distribution to cover their payrolls.
The Devil Rays' experience was reminiscent of one they encountered last season. In May, when Vincent Naimoli, the team's managing partner, was involved in a nasty fight with his five partners, the club was facing difficulty in meeting the player payroll. But Naimoli added his own money to the team treasury and paid the players with some of that.
The Devils Rays' problems have apparently been so dire this season that, two people said, they have offered to sell players to other teams because they have needed the cash.
Naimoli declined to return a telephone call seeking comment. But a Devil Rays spokesman, Rick Vaughn, said it was not true that the club was having difficulty meeting its payroll.
Ilitch, the Tigers' owner, did not return a call seeking comment. Dave Dombrowski, the club president, said he was not involved in those matters but said, "We've met our payroll and don't feel there's any problem and we'll continue to meet our payrolls."
The financial health of the teams has been the dominant issue in the collective bargaining talks that resumed yesterday in Manhattan. On the day of the All-Star Game, Selig was asked at a news conference whether baseball, during its negotiations with the players, could have made its case more emphatically if it had let a team or two go bankrupt.
"I have said that and the clubs have said that to me," he replied. "They know I've helped two or three clubs out in the past year or two, and yes, I now understand in retrospect that maybe it would have been better to let them go."
"It certainly would have been another dynamic manifestation of the problems," he added.
Earlier this season, Selig said six to eight teams could wind up in bankruptcy if there were a work stoppage. At a recent bargaining session, DuPuy told union representatives that if there were a prolonged work stoppage caused by either side, once they reached an agreement on the major issues they would not be talking about back-service credit for players but about clubs not coming back. 
In the years since salaries began escalating, owners have handled their financial situations differently. When Ewing Kauffman owned the Kansas City Royals, he poured part of his personal fortune into the team to pay its best players and maintain its status as a perennial contender. He said he acted for the benefit of the community. H. Wayne Huizenga, on the other hand, treated the Florida Marlins as strictly business. When he felt his losses had become too great, he sold the team, though not until he had dismantled the 1997 World Series champions rather than incur greater losses while he still owned them.
In the continuing labor negotiations, the clubs want the players to agree to a system in which teams would share 50 percent of their local revenue as a means of improving the chances of low-revenue teams to compete with the wealthier clubs. Negotiators had been scheduled to meet during the day yesterday but instead turned the session into a dinner meeting at a restaurant. They planned to meet again today.
"We discussed all of the major issues and it was a constructive discussion," Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said of last night's gathering.
Baseball's claims of financial woe could have an adverse effect on the ability of its teams to secure low-interest loans. Sal Galatioto, head of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s sports finance unit, told Bloomberg News yesterday that "it makes people worry about the overall financial state of baseball, and they were already concerned because of the possibility of a strike."
Teams often borrow money during the season to cover expenses or new payroll additions.

HEADLINE: In a Switch, Utilities Say Power Is Low 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
The New York region, which appeared to escape an approaching electricity crisis when the economy slowed and the World Trade Center attack cut the demand, is unexpectedly facing the potential for serious power shortages over the next couple of months, utility executives and energy experts say.
 The turn of events is partly the result of the hot weather early in the summer, as well as increased use of air-conditioning units and computers, and low participation in energy conservation programs. In addition, matters have been made worse by aging equipment and by maintenance delayed by the need to complete repairs in the trade center area. 
 Consolidated Edison, which delivers electricity to the city and its northern suburbs, has revised its prediction of no growth in demand this summer. Three of Con Ed's 10 heaviest days of demand have occurred this year. 
The collapse of the twin towers and the subsequent departure of other companies removed the demand for 90 megawatts of power in Lower Manhattan. Nevertheless, the overall effect of the terror attack and the recession have proved minuscule, as many workers returned to buildings in Lower Manhattan and others moved, along with their energy demand, to Midtown and other locations within Con Ed's territory.
"As much as we think there has been a significant impact because of Sept. 11 and the downturn in the economy, we are just not seeing it," said Joseph Oates, Con Ed's vice president for energy management. "A lot of people had a false sense of security that we were O.K., and we are not."
The problems are acute in some places outside the city. The Long Island Power Authority barely averted a power crisis last weekend when demand set records and four transmission lines went out of service.
In eastern Connecticut, 12,000 homes and businesses lost power last week after a substation transformer overloaded. Connecticut officials also warned last week that a potentially shrinking supply created a high risk of blackouts this summer.
"I wish we had nothing to worry about," said Lindsey Audin, president of Energywiz, an energy consulting firm in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., that has clients like Merrill Lynch. "But we are cutting it close this summer, and all over we will be short of supply by the summer of 2003."
Con Ed says that it has enough supply -- about 13,847 megawatts -- but that it is having trouble getting it to the right places. Long Island and New York City are two of the most difficult areas to supply because of geographical isolation and because population shifts create shifts in demand. 
Development has increased demand in some neighborhoods, but power-generating companies have had a hard time obtaining the permits for new plants and substations in the affected areas. For example, in Chelsea, which has had some of the largest increases in use in the city, Con Ed has had to place nearly a dozen gas generators on the streets. Near Wall Street, Con Ed also found itself in a race against time this spring to replace a substation that was destroyed in the trade center collapse. 
Still, supply, just as much as transmission, could be a problem for Con Ed, officials acknowledge. Before the trade center attack, Con Ed had estimated that its peak load, or highest level of use -- based on past use, the economy, changes and growth -- would be 12,175 megawatts this summer. Most experts expected Con Ed to lower those estimates after the attack, in part because the trade center demand was gone and also because of the slowing economy.
To the surprise of many experts, Con Ed raised those projections this spring, saying it expected a peak load of 12,225 megawatts. "If the heat wave had not been during the July 4th holiday week, it would have blown through that 12,225 forecast as well," said Mr. Oates, the Con Ed vice president. 
If electrical demand exceeds supply, utilities are forced to shut down service in certain areas to prevent equipment overloads and systemwide blackouts. Con Ed officials say they believe brownouts are likely for the summer and that the area could be in for a major blackout if there is any significant equipment failure.
Carol Murphy, a spokeswoman for the New York Independent System Operator, which runs the state electrical grid, said the city and Long Island were among the most susceptible to equipment problems because so much of the transmission system is underground and therefore can easily overheat. 
Ms. Murphy said officials in New York and Long Island were setting up emergency generators for summer use and were asking companies to cooperate by sending workers home early on hot days. "We are skating on the edge," Ms. Murphy said.
This week, the Long Island Power Authority installed mobile gas-turbine generators in a parking lot at Robert Moses State Park to prevent blackouts on Fire Island this weekend. Last week, Fire Island, where demand has grown 20 percent in the last year alone, experienced brownouts and rolling blackouts after three transmission lines went out of service. 
Thousands of homes and businesses in Nassau and Suffolk Counties could have lost power in another incident last Friday, when a fire knocked out a transmission line in Yonkers that supplied a fifth of the power used on Long Island.
If the problem had happened two days earlier, when a heat wave sent use soaring, Long Island officials said, it almost certainly would have resulted in several major blackouts. 
Those officials say there is little margin for error. "You have to look at these numbers with real concern," Richard M. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, said yesterday at a news conference, at which he called for power conservation.
Power companies worry about any succession of three hot days, because experience shows that's when people lose patience and buy air-conditioners. The first wave of purchases, though, usually comes in August, not July, officials said.
Fred Zalcman, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, a research and advocacy organization based in White Plains, said that he was sure as recently as this February that the crisis reached well beyond the region, but that he didn't think so any longer.
He said several factors, including "the unusually hot period in early summer, coupled with increased air-conditioning use, the economy seeming to rebound sooner than we thought," have made matters tighter than expected. Mr. Zalcman added that Long Island problems have demonstrated that "if under extreme heat conditions equipment does not work, we might need a wider buffer."
In Connecticut, NRG Energy Corporation, a troubled company that took over power generation in parts of the state, is threatening to halve the output at its Devon Power Station unless regulators provide subsidies to keep it running. Officials at the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control say there is serious danger of blackouts in the areas served by the plant, including Fairfield County. 
Thousands of customers in Stamford, Greenwich, Westport and other nearby towns experienced brownouts and blackouts last week when the Connecticut Light and Power system was strained by the weather on July 3.
Power officials are equally concerned about the long-term future. President Bush has included New York and California among the states with the most severe energy supply problems. Unlike California, New York has not experienced utility bankruptcies, but some officials are concerned that there is not enough power generation for the long term, particularly downstate. 
The New York Independent System Operator estimates that the state will need 7,100 additional megawatts, a 22 percent increase in supply, by 2005. Statewide, only two new plants have been approved, neither of them in New York City or Long Island. 
Suburban New Jersey has not reached its peak levels yet, according to officials at several electrical utilities. In fact, several generators in New Jersey have proposed helping supply power to Manhattan. 
"Like everything involved with power in this area, you feel a lot better when there is a shovel in the ground," Mr. Oates said. "Well, there are no shovels in the ground, and not enough time, either."

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

"THE BOURNE IDENTITY," starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Directed by Doug Liman (PG-13, 113 minutes). Mr. Damon plays Jason Bourne, a C.I.A. superassassin with amnesia who is chased across Europe in the company of a charming German waif (Ms. Potente) by his employers. There are espionage writers who use the genre to explore the complexities of geopolitics, but Robert Ludlum, on whose novel this competent, enjoyable picture is based, was not one of them. At a time when thrillers are shadowed by real-world anxieties, the implausibility and irrelevance of this movie, which amusingly imagines the C.I.A. as a supercompetent, virtually omniscient operation, comes as something of a relief. Mr. Damon handles his character's existential crisis with fierce adroitness, and Mr. Liman's direction has an old-fashioned swiftness and efficiency (A. O. Scott).

"DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD," starring Sandra Bullock, Ellen Burstyn and Ashley Judd. Directed by Callie Khouri (PG-13, 110 minutes). The sudsy film adaptation of two best-selling novels by Rebecca Wells tells of mother-daughter strife, alcoholism and other ills besetting a Louisiana family over three generations. Ms. Bullock is a New York playwright dragged home by her mother's friends on a family peace-making mission. Ms. Burstyn is Mom, a dithery drama queen, and Ms. Judd the same Mom as a harried, embittered young mother with a drinking problem. Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight and Maggie Smith are the three childhood friends with whom Mom formed a pact of friendship more than half a century earlier. The connections between past and present feel tenuous, and the Oprah-ready mood of uplift is tainted with a strain of cuteness (Stephen Holden).

* "THE FAST RUNNER (ATANARJUAT)," starring Natar Ungalaaq and Sylvia Ivalu. Directed by Zacharias Kunuk (no rating, 172 minutes). This epic, the first feature film made in the Inuit language, is not merely an interesting document from a far-off place; it is a masterpiece. Mr. Kunuk's adaptation of an ancient folk tale, which won the Camera d'Or for best first feature at last year's Cannes International Film Festival, is much more than an ethnographic curiosity. It is, by any standard, an extraordinary film, a work of narrative sweep and visual beauty that honors the history of the art form even as it extends its perspective. The story, about a vendetta that threatens the happiness of the hero and the stability of his nomadic, seal-hunting clan, takes a while to establish itself, but it has the clarity and the power common to epics from the sagas of ancient Scandinavia to the westerns of the old Hollywood. Austere and violent, the movie is also touched by humor and sensuality and is full of unforgettable images of the blinding Arctic landscape. Mr. Kunuk and his cast have accomplished the remarkable feat of endowing his archetypal characters with complicated psychological motives and responses. The combination of dramatic realism and archaic grandeur is irresistibly powerful (Scott).

"HARVARD MAN," starring Adrian Grenier, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams. Written and directed by James Toback (R, 100 minutes). Another maddening, fascinating mess from Mr. Toback, one of the most undisciplined American filmmakers, and also one of the most intelligent. Ms. Gellar, taking a break from vampire slaying, plays a cyncial, sexually confident cheerleader whose father is a powerful mobster. Her boyfriend (Mr. Grenier), the title character, plays point-guard for the Crimson and dabbles in existential philosophy, student-teacher sex and LSD. These interests involve him in all kinds of trouble, and he ends up spinning through Cambridge in a hallucinogen-induced frenzy, pursued by wannabe-wiseguys, kinky F.B.I. agents and the comedian Al Franken. Coherence and plausibility are beside the point; the movie has an antic, feckless vivacity, and even its silliest moments hum with intellectual energy and artistic daring (Scott).

* "INSOMNIA," starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. Directed by Christopher Nolan (R, 116 minutes). In this noir thriller, Detective Will Dormer (Mr. Pacino) is tracking a murderer in a small Alaska town while pursued by his own guilt. Back in Los Angeles, Will is the object of an internal affairs investigation. His chase is preordained to end in tragedy, and he knows it. This intensely sharp-witted remake of a 1997 Norwegian film also stars Mr. Williams as the subject of the detective's chase, a canny murderer with no one to brag to except Will. The suspense in Mr. Nolan's film comes not in the standard whodunit plot turns but from another question: will having too much in the hero's head bring him down? (Elvis Mitchell).

"JUWANNA MANN," starring Miguel A. Nunez Jr. and Vivica A. Fox. Directed by Jesse Vaughan (PG-13, 90 minutes). There is very little new in this picture about an arrogant pro basketball player who becomes a better man by spending time as a woman. Its basically "Slamdunk Tootsie." While in disguise, the hero falls in love with a teammate (Ms. Fox) who regards him as a sisterly confidante and fends off the advances of a besotted hip-hop dandy, played with demented exuberance by Tommy Davidson, who in his scenes lifts the picture from moderately amusing to the intermittently hilarious (Scott).

"LIKE MIKE," starring Lil Bow Wow, Eugene Levy and Morris Chestnut. Directed by John Schultz (PG, 100 minutes). A 13-year-old orphan named Calvin (Lil Bow Wow) turns around the fictional Los Angeles Knights pro basketball team, courtesy of a pair of magic sneakers that he finds. Calvin's new powers are observed when he wins a chance to shoot against a spoiled N.B.A. star during a half-time stunt. Naturally, he's asked to join the team. The successful kid rapper Bow Wow is a talented actor whose boyish eagerness here is a marked contrast to his taciturn rappadocio. The director's breezy steadiness keeps the movie from hitting us over the head -- well, not too hard, anyway, no small feat since the steroid-juiced sentimentality of the ending may force some to flee before the outtakes unspool under the credits (Mitchell).

* "LILO AND STITCH," with the voices of Chris Sanders, Daveigh Chase, Tia Carrere and Ving Rhames. Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois (PG, 89 minutes). In this charming exercise in intergalactic multiculturalism, Stitch, the snaggle-toothed, ill-behaved result of an alien genetic experiment, crashes to Earth, where he is adopted by a young Hawaiian girl named Lilo. The pair must contend with extraterrestrial law enforcement and a nosy earth-bound social worker, and their triumph over these adversities involves the usual Disney blend of comic anarchy, musical numbers (this time with an Elvis theme) and heart-tugging sentimentality. The movie's family relationships are addressed with low-key realism, and the animation has a lovely, gentle precision, with plenty of room for visual comedy but less of the noise and chaos that have become the hallmarks of 3-D animation. This movie suggests that the old-fashioned, flat, painted kind of animation still has much to offer (Scott).

* "LOVELY AND AMAZING," starring Catherine Keener, Brenda Blethyn, Dermot Mulroney and Emily Mortimer. Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener (R, 91 minutes). This smart, acidic comedy by the director of "Walking and Talking" could be described as a West Coast answer to "Sex and the City," minus that series' high-gloss glamour and erotic joie de vivre. Ms. Keener and Ms. Mortimer are sisters, both attractive and in their 30's, who have major self-esteem problems and poor taste in men. Ms. Blethyn is their vain mother who develops complications after liposuction. The movie zeroes in on contemporary narcissism with a relentless, needling accuracy that illustrates exactly the way some people allow their insecurities to poison their intimate relationships. But once it has limned its characters (Ms. Keener's is by far the most vivid), it doesn't go anywhere in particular (Holden).

"MEN IN BLACK II," starring Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Lara Flynn Boyle, Rip Torn, Rosario Dawson and Tony Shalhoub. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG-13, 82 minutes). If your memory of the first one is a little hazy, don't worry: that was the point all along. And in any case this sequel provides the same pleasant, pointless mixture of whimsy and kineticism. Of course, like the "Ghostbusters" and "Austin Powers" sequels (to give only two out of several thousand possible examples), the fun has diminished because the novelty has worn off. Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones coast along, joined by Mr. Torn and Mr. Shalhoub (and a talking bulldog) from "Men in Black," and a host of creepy, scaly, funny aliens, including Ms. Boyle, her icy charms enhanced by hundreds of slimy tentacles and an extendable green tongue (Scott).

"MINORITY REPORT," starring Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 140 minutes). This atmospheric new thriller is a muscular and dense exercise of skill and verve. (Ironically, this exercise may be the most adult film that Mr. Spielberg has made in some time; it's about the bloody blurring of passion and violence -- a compassionate noir.) In 2054, a law enforcement unit called Pre-Crime exists to stop murders before they begin; three Pre-Cogs -- beings who float in a nutrient-rich fluid -- can predict when a crime will be committed and know the identity of the perpetrator. When the unit's chief, John Anderton, is accused of a crime he hasn't yet committed, he's soon on the run. Mr. Cruise does as much sprinting in this picture as he has in his entire filmography. The fluid bursts of quick-cut images seen on the monitors also show that Mr. Spielberg isn't about to be shown up by those quick-fingered, compulsively exhibitionistic upstarts like David Fincher. With "Minority Report" he toys with the idea that there's more -- and less -- to Mr. Cruise than meets the eye and says we shouldn't trust our eyes anyway. But doesn't he always? (Mitchell).

"MR. DEEDS," starring Adam Sandler and Winona Ryder. Directed by Steven Brill (PG-13, 91 minutes). It could be said that the remake of Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," starring Mr. Sandler in the title role, is redundant, since the actor has been remaking Capraesque movies for most of his career. As in Capra's original 1936 classic, Longfellow Deeds still lives in Mandrake Falls, is an aspiring greeting-card poet and has no patience for pretension. And once again, he is left a fortune by a distant relative: adjusted for inflation, the amount is $40 billion instead of $20 million. He's taken to New York, where he'll presumably be enticed by the city. Mr. Sandler's films are always about the arrogant getting a deserved comeuppance at the hands of humbler types, but this is the first time he seems a little smug himself. "Mr. Deeds" has him rehashing a role he has performed so many times before he could be doing this picture in his sleep. The result is likely to be that he'll put audiences to sleep (Mitchell).

"PUMPKIN," starring Christina Ricci, Hank Harris and Brenda Blethyn. Directed by Adam Larson Broder and Tony R. Abrams (R, 116 minutes). In his uneasy mixture of satire and sentiment, Ms. Ricci plays Carolyn McDuffie, a Southern California sorority sister who risks everything -- the respect of her peers, her tennis-star boyfriend, her very sanity -- to pursue a love affair with a young retarded man named Pumpkin (Mr. Harris). The movie is sometimes sweet and often incisive in its mockery of social ambition and phony compassion, but the filmmakers have not figured out how to balance earnestness and mockery, and they end up sneering at the charming, naive love story they have, perhaps in spite of themselves, created (Scott).

"SCOOBY DOO," starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Directed by Raja Gosnell (PG, 105 minutes). The old Hanna-Barbera cartoon was cheap, silly and occasionally charming in its blithe stupidity. This adaptation, combining live action with 3-D computer-generated animation, looks pretty expensive, and its stupidity is, for the most part, charmless. The human cast -- Mr. Prinze, especially -- does a good-humored job of sending up and paying homage to the old show, but its efforts are overwhelmed by a relentless pop music score, hideous special effects and a plot that violates all the rules of the old series for no good reason (Scott).

* "SUNSHINE STATE," starring Edie Falco, Angela Bassett, Mary Alice, Mary Steenburgen and Timothy Hutton. Written and directed by John Sayles (PG-13; 141 minutes). Mr. Sayles's panoramic exploration of life in Delrona Beach, a fictional Florida coastal town in the throes of development, is as rich and even-handed a mosaic of American life as any filmmaker has brought to the screen. The overlapping stories revolve around two families, one white, the other black, who are being pressured to sell their property to greedy developers. Among more than a dozen characters who cross paths in the course of the story, the most compelling are Marly Temple (Ms. Falco), a sardonic young woman who runs her family's motel, and Desiree Perry (Ms. Bassett), a former teenage rebel who returns after a 25-year absence to confront her straitlaced mother (Ms. Alice). More than a probing civics lesson, the movie takes the political and spiritual pulse of our restless national psyche (Holden).

HEADLINE: Real Reform: What Bush Might Have Said 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Following is a speech that might have gotten a better market reception than the one President Bush actually gave this week.
 I'VE come to the financial capital of the world to speak of a serious challenge to our financial markets, and to the confidence on which they rest. The misdeeds now being uncovered in some quarters of corporate America are threatening the financial well-being of many workers and many investors. 
 The lure of heady profits of the late 1990's spawned abuses and excesses. At first, when the current wave of scandals began to appear, I thought it was just a matter of a few bad apples -- a problem that needed little response from the federal government save for vigorous investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and prosecution by the Justice Department. 
But as Global Crossing followed Enron, and was followed by WorldCom, I concluded that we needed to do more -- more to assure that wrongdoers are punished, more to reduce the profits from such crimes and more to bolster confidence. I concluded that words without action might make investors even more fearful.
We have seen executives make hundreds of millions of dollars selling stock before their companies collapsed. They were not selling shares on which they had risked their own money. Most got shares from options, and some were given shares by their companies only weeks before they dumped them on public investors.
That is why I am today calling on Congress to give the S.E.C. authority to limit the shares an executive can sell until at least a year after leaving the company, or a year after buying the stock. The S.E.C. would allow some sales, to pay taxes and perhaps to cover emergency expenses, but executives should face risks like other investors. If a boss wants to fake the numbers, let him know that he risks detection before he can profit from the fraud.
At the same time, it would be better for companies to give executives shares, rather than options, so that the executives would face the downside as well as the upside of share ownership. But current accounting rules provide perverse incentives, by requiring companies to report an expense when they grant shares, but not when they give out options. That must be changed.
I know that most auditors try to do as good a job as they can. But when I hear the WorldCom auditor say he followed required auditing procedures and still missed that $3.8 billion fraud, it is clear we need new procedures. Congress should establish a new accounting regulator controlled by people representing investors, not accountants. That regulator should establish new auditing standards and should discipline -- quickly and publicly -- auditors who fail to live up to the responsibility we give them.
And because sometimes things aren't exactly black and white when it comes to accounting procedures, auditors must inform shareholders when companies use aggressive -- even if arguably legal -- accounting to make themselves look better.
Those who do break the law must be punished. I have set up a financial crimes SWAT team, armed with money and people -- F.B.I. agents and prosecutors -- whose sole focus will be such crimes. To make it easier to convict corrupt executives, I am asking Congress to establish a new crime, one that would make it illegal to use any scheme or artifice to defraud shareholders. Every former S.E.C. chairman I have consulted has called for hundreds of new enforcement officials, and I will make sure they are hired.
Corporate officials have helped create an economy that is the envy of the world. The overwhelming majority are honest and will welcome reforms to restore confidence. As Ronald Reagan said when confronting a different problem: Trust, but verify.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: POLITICS; 
Parties Trade Lobs Over Issue of Lax Oversight

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
While senators debated an accounting reform bill today in advance of an expected vote on Monday, Democrats and Republicans eagerly tried to blame each other for years of supposedly lax oversight of corporate behavior.
 Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, accused Republicans today of setting the stage for corporate wrongdoing through a gradual drive for deregulation, starting with the Contract With America in 1995. "We see daily evidence of what happens when the drive to deregulate succeeds," he said, "as it did over the last seven or eight years." 
 Mr. Gephardt distributed a 26-page pamphlet to support his point, with photographs of Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, and Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, on the cover, along with the logos of Enron, WorldCom and other embattled companies.
The pamphlet describes Republican-led campaigns to deregulate the derivatives markets in which Enron traded, to cut financing for the Securities and Exchange Commission and to limit a handful of environmental and consumer protections.
In a response sent via e-mail, the Republican National Committee pointed out that some Democrats had supported the bills that Mr. Gephardt's pamphlet called "overzealous efforts to roll back public protections."
In every case, however, a majority of Democrats had voted against the bills.
Senior Republican aides in the Senate countered with their own pamphlet, which tries to pin lax oversight on Bill Clinton. It points out that the most recent company restatements involve earnings dating from his administration. The pamphlet also summarizes reports of connections between officials of the Clinton administration and Enron and Global Crossing.
In the House, a Republican staff member passed out reprints of newspaper articles detailing unusual financing arranged for Mr. Gephardt's presidential campaign in 1988 by Terry McAuliffe, who is now chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Another article described Mr. McAuliffe's business connections and his rise as a Democratic fund-raiser. 
One of the House's two independent members, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, said both parties were to blame for the "incredible culture of corporate greed" that led to the scandals. "Certainly the Democrats have not been strong enough on this issue," Mr. Sanders said, "and the Republicans are much worse."
Experts on regulation dismissed the back-and-forth sniping as misguided.
"I don't see how you can lay the blame for this at the doorstep of the Democrats or the Republicans," said Robert W. Hahn, director of the American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies. For a long time, Mr. Hahn said, policy makers have known about the difficulties of ensuring truly independent corporate audits. Like the politicians, independent oversight agencies like the Financial Accounting Standards Board underestimated the problem.
"It's not as if politicians determine all the rules for these things anyway," Mr. Hahn said. "The notion that this is lax enforcement on the part of Clinton or his predecessor, Bush, or the Congressional committees is a laugh."
Robert A. Kagan, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Berkeley, asserted that economic factors bore as much responsibility for the corporate scandals as political rule-making. 
"The Clinton years were a time of huge economic development and change and new markets," Professor Kagan said. "That's going to develop the opportunities for new kinds of malfeasance."
He also suggested that Mr. Gephardt was exaggerating the deregulating success of Mr. Gingrich's time. "I don't think the Contract With America did very much with regulation," he said. "It was sort of a failure. The Republicans blew their opportunity."

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE MAVERICK; 
McCain Urges Corporate Change And Resignation of S.E.C. Chief

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
With a biting indictment of "morally challenged executives," Senator John McCain put himself at the leading edge of the drive against corporate wrongdoing today, laying out proposals for broad new regulation of business that are far more stringent than those of President Bush and leading Democrats.
Mr. McCain, the Arizona Republican who was Mr. Bush's most potent primary challenger in 2000 and is still a political wild card, set out his ideas in a midday speech at the National Press Club that harked back to the populist tones of his presidential campaign. 
 Sometimes quoting Theodore Roosevelt, the trust-busting Republican he considers a personal role model, Mr. McCain excoriated "unethical self-serving executives" who produced the string of scandals associated with corporations like Enron, Global Crossing and WorldCom. 
 "Trust was sacrificed in too many corporate boardrooms on the altar of quick and illusory profits intended to generate astonishingly inappropriate levels of executive compensation," Mr. McCain said, speaking sharply of "crony capitalism."
With his address, Mr. McCain put himself at the center of a debate over corporate misconduct that has the Bush administration on the defensive. The senator substantively set himself apart from Mr. Bush, who earlier this week recommended milder measures.
Among the main differences, Mr. McCain is calling for companies to treat stock options as a business expense on their financial statements and wants to prohibit top executives from selling shares in their companies while they work there.
The speech prompted a question from a reporter, during a session afterward, about whether he was considering an independent run for president in 2004. 
"I campaigned for president in 2000 on the whole broad issue of reform, reform of campaign financing, reform of the military, reform of Social Security, reform of the institutions of government," Mr. McCain said. "So this is another institution that cries out or an environment that cries out for reform." He then demurred "my only goal here is to try and move this process as quickly as possible to a successful conclusion, so that the United States economy can be restored."
Many of Mr. McCain's former presidential campaign aides were on hand, including his former political director, John Weaver, who has become a Democrat and is now helping both the House Democrats' campaign committee and New Hampshire Democrats court independent voters and moderate Republicans. 
Yet while some of his supporters still yearn for Mr. McCain to mount an independent run in 2004, much like Mr. Roosevelt once did, most of his advisers entertain only the remotest idea that he will run again. His Straight Talk political action committee has done minimal fund-raising recently, and he has also raised little money for a Senate re-election campaign. And he is no longer constantly on the stump for other candidates. Instead he has been appearing primarily for Republicans who helped him in his maverick run. 
Carla Eudy, Mr. McCain's chief fund-raiser, said his campaign bus was "in mothballs."
Indeed, Mr. McCain repeatedly passed up opportunities today to criticize Mr. Bush for his business dealings at Harken Energy more than a decade ago. "I am confident the president will give a full explanation of anything that happened," he said. "I am confident that the president is fully and completely and totally committed to bringing about reforms to this system because he's a patriotic and dedicated American."
Still, with his signature campaign finance bill enacted into law, Mr. McCain's speech gave him a new platform on an issue rapidly rising to the top of public concern. And he positioned himself just where he likes to be politically -- straddling the two parties and promoting ideas that, while eye-catching, face an uphill climb to become law.
His proposals to regulate business were far tougher than any that would be palatable to Republicans. At the same time, he restated his commitment to creating private investment accounts as part of Social Security -- an anathema to most Democrats.
Mr. McCain condemned "crony capitalism" and also excoriated United States companies for moving their addresses to offshore tax havens like Bermuda. "Although American tax policy encouraged them to do so, corporations that move their legal headquarters offshore to avoid taxes give the appearance of ingratitude to the country whose sons and daughters are risking their lives today to defend them."
One of Mr. McCain's proposals -- to require companies to include options as an expense on their income statements -- was debated in the Senate today but was effectively killed by a procedural maneuver by the Democratic leadership, which is pushing toward final passage of an accounting bill. The idea is being fought by businesses, most particularly technology companies.
The senator acknowledged that he would need time to build political support for some of the other proposals he made in his speech. His ideas included a call for top executives of a company to be prohibited from selling their holdings of company stock while serving in the company.
"Diversification of investments is a good idea for the investing public," he said. "But it's not a good idea to allow those responsible for the stock prices of publicly traded companies to reduce the financial exposure to the performance of their companies to the time of their choosing."
In pursuit of more checks and balances on corporate behavior, Mr. McCain also called for a "complete and permanent separation" of auditing and consulting services more far-reaching than one under consideration in the Senate. He proposed a new law to require that investment banking be kept separate from research and investment services provided to individuals. Such a law might ultimately require the breakup of some giant "full service" Wall Street firms. 
He also said members of corporate boards with the exception of the chief executive should be prohibited from having a material stake in the company. And he wanted corporate pension fund committees and the funds they mange to function independently from management.
In addition, Mr. McCain repeated his calls for Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to step down. "Fine man though he may be," Mr. McCain said, "the circumstances today require a new leader of the S.E.C. whose background and record will leave no question that he or she will proactively assert the independence and authority of the S.E.C. to protect the integrity of our markets."

HEADLINE: America Aloof 

 BODY:
These days America finds itself at once uniquely strong and vulnerable, the only superpower and a target of envy, hostility and suspicion around much of the globe. The Bush administration has clearly been tempted to go it alone in this new environment, dodging any international undertakings that the United States does not completely control. 
 President Bush has shown skill in working with Russia and other nations to put together a coalition to fight terrorism. But there are other critical problems in the world, some equally important to our own future and others of pressing concern to the people whose good will we need to fight terror abroad. They include global warming, proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons, fighting infectious diseases like AIDS and malaria and assuring the prosecution of war criminals. The United States does not rule the world, and the administration needs to think more creatively and strategically about how this country works with the rest of the planet. A dash of humility might be a help, too. 
 A vocal segment of Mr. Bush's core right-wing constituency constantly urges the administration to steer clear of international agreements that it sees as a threat to our sovereignty. Its targets range from a still-unratified 1980 agreement protecting women against political and economic discrimination and physical abuse to the brand-new International Criminal Court. Mr. Bush's willingness to listen to this group is likely to grow more pronounced as he positions himself and the Republican Party for the Congressional elections this fall and the presidential campaign in 2004. 
The president's concerns about international accords are understandable, if not necessarily justified. Some countries take delight in embarrassing America, and when the United States joins in a compact to combat a social malady like racism or sexism, other members may prefer looking for flaws in the superpower's own performance to recognizing egregious violations of human rights by others. The conference on racism last year in South Africa, which degenerated into a food fight over whether to equate Zionism with racism, was a good example of how counterproductive international efforts can be if they fall prey to regional political agendas.
But in all the years during which the United States has taken part in international accords, examples of anti-Americanism run amok are few and far between. The United States does need to protect itself and its citizens from the possibility that smaller nations will gang up on Americans just because they suddenly find they can. But there is a vast space between that kind of reasonable caution and the administration's current attitude.
Encouragingly, the White House now appears willing to draw back from its threat to veto further United Nations peacekeeping operations as part of its continuing campaign against the new International Criminal Court. But the administration showed a reckless willingness to jeopardize these valuable missions. Meanwhile, its misguided opposition to the international court continues. 
The White House's response to global warming has been thoroughly discouraging. It fears that an international effort to limit greenhouse gases would have an impact on the American economy, which is probably correct. The United States, with just 5 percent of the world's population, emits 25 percent of those gases. Reducing those levels cannot be done without some sacrifice. But the rest of the world is right in demanding that we accept the responsibility and make the effort nonetheless. If the United States wants to be the political and moral leader of the world, it has to comply. The administration has had plenty of time to offer serious alternative proposals for reducing those emissions. Instead, it has simply walked away from the global effort.
The administration takes the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons dangers extremely seriously, to the point of threatening pre-emptive military attacks. Yet military action can provide, at best, only a partial answer. Keeping these weapons out of the hands of Iran, Libya or Al Qaeda depends heavily on upholding the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and strengthening the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Biological Weapons Convention, efforts the Bush administration has opposed. The White House is right when it argues that some countries sign treaties and then break their word. The solution is better enforcement, not abstention. 
Washington has been inexplicably miserly in the global effort to combat H.I.V./AIDS and other infectious diseases. The U.N. is seeking an extra $7 billion to $10 billion annually, of which Washington's fair share would be about $2.5 billion. America's actual contribution is one-tenth that amount. 
Global leadership requires more than visionary statements and forceful American actions. Washington needs to be a leader, not a spoiler, in efforts to build international cooperation.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: WHITE HOUSE MEMO; 
How a Clear Strategy Got Muddy Results

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
When President Bush went to Wall Street on Tuesday to promise a crackdown on executives who cook the books, the White House had a clear strategy: The President would use the authoritative voice he honed after Sept. 11 to calm another sort of fear and keep Congress from overreacting.
 It did not work out that way, and the explanation says a lot about why presidents and financial markets have a hard time speaking the same language. 
 In the three days since Mr. Bush spoke, the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped 473 points, or 5 percent -- not exactly what Mr. Bush's political aides or economic team had in mind. The Senate immediately voted 97 to 0 for tougher legal penalties than Mr. Bush advocated for corporate officers' misdeeds, and the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert, sided today with the Senate rather than his president. 
Among the people whom a far-reaching Congressional bill could anger is Vice President Cheney, a former chief executive himself. Mr. Cheney, officials said, argued vociferously inside the White House that the administration should not join the call for scalps. Creating new felonies or making it easier for shareholders to sue chief executives, he has cautioned, would drain corporate America of its risk-taking spirit and take a toll on the economy's growth.
"Cheney kept saying we shouldn't allow a few bad actors like Enron or WorldCom to lead us to do stupid things," said one senior Republican with sympathy for the argument, who has sat in on several recent meetings at the White House. "He kept saying it would make corporate America look like the worst kind of bureaucracy."
Mr. Cheney's strongly held views that the headlong drive for reform could create unintended economic consequences, some insiders say, may explain why Mr. Bush's heated words on Tuesday were not matched by equally strong proposals -- including the adoption of Senate measures that are gaining speed even among Republicans. 
"In a moment of crisis, the rhetoric and the action must merge," said Nicolas Checa of Medley Global Advisers, an international investment group. "That didn't happen."
Several explanations are floating around Washington about why Mr. Bush's speech -- which the White House had advertised as the moment when the president would take command of the issue -- seemed tone deaf about the markets and the political mood.
Some people who watch the interaction of Wall Street and Washington say the White House overestimated the president's sway over markets -- even a president with sky-high approval ratings (though they are falling), even a president who describes himself as a wartime leader. 
Critics say it was another demonstration of the ham-handedness of Mr. Bush's economic team, which rarely seems to carry the power of Mr. Bush's more influential national security advisers. Some critics also say that Mr. Bush's political team spent too much time calculating how the speech would play across America -- down to the pale blue background they designed emblazoned with the words "corporate responsibility" repeated hundreds of times -- and too little time learning the lessons of recent and not-so-recent presidential interventions in the capital markets.
"It was probably an illusion that any president could convince the markets the problem would be solved soon," Jeffrey E. Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management, said today. "The markets are too big, too complex, they move to too many different rhythms." And the White House, he suggests, was responding to "political timing rather than market timing."
In fact, one lesson of government interventions in international currency markets is that one should never fight market sentiment, but wait to strike until a moment when buyers or sellers find their energy spent, making them more vulnerable to pressure to reverse course. 
A camp that includes many Republicans on Capitol Hill puts the problem at the feet of the man who is supposed to be the voice of Bush economic policy: Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. His quirky, candid, sometimes dead-on and sometimes off-the-wall public statements have often proved more amusing than confidence-inspiring. (Long before the current crisis, even Trent Lott, the Senate Republican leader, was openly questioning whether Mr. O'Neill was the man for the job.) 
Mr. O'Neill got out ahead of the White House a month ago, suggesting only half in jest that there should be public hangings of chief executives who knowingly mislead their shareholders and colleagues. Not for the first time he had to rein in his language, though he reportedly pressed for strong action. He accompanied Mr. Bush to Wall Street for the speech on Tuesday morning but stayed in the background once there. 
Such slights are noticed. "There's a vacuum at the center of economic policy-making in this administration," David Hale, the chief global economist at Zurich Financial Services, said today. "The markets don't know who to listen to, but it's clearly not Mr. O'Neill."
Mr. Bush might have also considered mixed lessons from past presidential jawboning of the markets -- where government action has usually been remembered far longer than presidential speechifying.
Franklin D. Roosevelt had plenty of problems with Wall Street, where he was derided as much as Mr. Bush has until now been cheered. But F.D.R. backed up his oratory with a bank holiday that got the market's attention and the creation of some of the regulatory institutions that Congress and the president are now seeking to bolster.
In 1998, Bill Clinton, in the midst of the Asian and Russian economic crises, went to New York to declare that the world was facing the greatest economic crisis in half a century. That overblown description was quickly dismissed. But the coordinated intervention in currency markets by the United States, Europe and Japan -- the muscle behind the speech -- did help stem the panic. 
Daniel Yergin, who tracked government involvement in the markets in his book "Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy," noted today that F.D.R. did not have to suffer the indignity of having the market's second-by-second movements broadcast as he spoke to the nation and that Mr. Clinton had the advantage that the "crony capitalists" he was denouncing were foreigners, not Americans.
Mr. Bush enjoys neither luxury.
"The political lesson," Mr. Yergin said, "is that the most dangerous crises for a president often involve the financial system, and they are never subject to a quick fix."

HEADLINE: White House Expected to Project A Deficit Topping $150 Billion 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is expected to disclose on Friday that the federal government will run a deficit of $150 billion to $160 billion for the current fiscal year, largely reflecting a downturn in tax receipts from capital gains because of the weak stock market, Republicans said today.
 Administration officials have signaled to Republicans on Capitol Hill that they expect a somewhat smaller deficit next year, Congressional budget analysts said. 
 Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told reporters this week that the administration expected the red ink to give way to surpluses starting in 2005.
The government ran a surplus in each of the last four years, including a $127 billion surplus last year. But the government's finances have been deteriorating because of the combined effects of last year's recession, the prolonged stock market slump, increased federal spending after Sept. 11 and early costs of President Bush's 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut.
As recently as the spring, the administration and the Congressional Budget Office projected much smaller deficits. But tax receipts, especially from nonwithheld payments like capital gains tax liabilities, have continued to come in lower than expected each month this year.
The Congressional Budget Office reported this week that overall tax receipts for the first nine months of the fiscal year, through June, were down by $181 billion, or 11.4 percent, compared with last year. Of that decline, $119 billion was from nonwithheld payments. The budget office attributed the downturn to lower payments of taxes on capital gains, less growth in the income of higher-income taxpayers and overall lower growth in earned incomes.
Through June, the budget office said, the government ran a deficit of $122 billion, compared with $169 billion in the same period last year. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 14, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in some copies on Friday about the Bush administration's new budget projections referred incorrectly to the government's financial condition last year. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, through June 2001, the government ran a surplus of $169 billion, not a deficit of that amount.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Global Planning to Halt H.I.V. 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 11 

 BODY:
Bill Clinton said at an international AIDS conference here tonight that he regretted not having done more about AIDS while he was president and that he had erred in not supporting needle exchange programs to prevent spread of the virus among drug users.
 In an interview with reporters after a session of the 14th International AIDS Conference, Mr. Clinton also urged leaders in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia, regions hit hard by AIDS, to speak out forcefully and develop plans to stop the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes the syndrome. 
 Mr. Clinton was attending the conference as part of a panel of current and former heads of state, the first such event at an AIDS conference. He said that although many political leaders had been afraid to take a strong stand on AIDS, "not a single one of them will be defeated for doing the right thing in this area." 
In the interview, he said that after keeping a low profile, for personal and policy reasons, in the 18 months since he had left office, he had decided the time was right to speak out on AIDS. "I had young friends who died in their 20's," Mr. Clinton said; "I don't want kids to die."
Also, he said, AIDS "is an issue that was not getting the requisite amount of effort, I thought the potential for destruction was breathtaking, America was a little slow on the uptake, and there it was exploding."
He called the epidemic an economic, security and humanitarian issue for which the United States should pay its fair share, adding, "That requires us to go from $800 million a year now to $2.5 billion, which is a couple of months of the Afghan war."
"If we don't do it," he said, "we will be spending far, far more than that to clean up the mess of this humanitarian tragedy."
He applauded Jesse Helms, the longtime North Carolina senator who is on the verge of retirement, for ending his opposition to AIDS expenditures and urging the United States to invest $500 million a year to fight the disease. "This is a much more fluid political situation than people assumed," Mr. Clinton said, "and if people are given the facts, they will do the right thing because they do not want to see their children die."
He stressed the need for each country to develop "a plan that says, 'Here is what we are doing and here is what we need from the rest of the world.' " Further spread of the disease, he added, could lead to more ethnic wars and destabilize democracies in Africa.
He foresaw a similar possibility in parts of the former Soviet Union, where a spreading epidemic could lead countries to "become even more dominated by narco-traffickers and organized criminals."
Asked about what he had done to fight AIDS as president, Mr. Clinton said: "Do I wish I could have done more? Yes, but I do not know that I could have done it."
In particular, he cited his stance on needle-exchange programs, saying, "I think I was wrong about that; I should have tried harder to do that." He was referring to his administration's refusal in 1988, after a bitter internal debate, to lift a longstanding ban on federal financing for programs to distribute clean needles to drug addicts, even as top government scientists said such programs did not encourage drug abuse and could save lives.
At the time, Mr. Clinton's advisers said they feared a political disaster for him if he lifted the ban. They also feared that Republicans might push through legislation stripping federal money from groups that provided free needles even if the groups could show that the money was being used for other purposes.
Mr. Clinton also took the occasion to applaud the 12 Caribbean countries for signing a program to buy AIDS drugs at a lower price than they could have individually.
If the Caribbean plan succeeds, he said, it should be tried in the former Soviet Union, where health systems are collapsing.

HEADLINE: Q&A; 
Welcome to the Working Class!

 BODY:
Michael Zweig is professor of economics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where in 1999 he founded the Group for the Study of Working Class Life, an interdisciplinary center that studies the impact of class. Professor Zweig is also the author of "The Working Class Majority: America's Best Kept Secret" (Cornell University Press, 2000). Felicia R. Lee spoke with him.

Q How are you defining "class," and how does it differ from popular conceptions?
 The common way that people talk in the popular culture and also in some sociology and other academic literature is to understand class as income. Or it's a matter of lifestyle: a person has class, they wear fancy clothes, they eat at good restaurants, they know which fork to use. I think those ways of looking at society are not very helpful. There are rich people, but to me, it's most helpful to understand class as power. 
 When I say middle class, what is it in the middle of? It's in the middle of labor and capital, not necessarily in the middle of income distribution.
Over the last 30 years, when the working class has been taking it in the neck, the middle class got divided. Those people in the middle class most closely associated in their lives and their work with the working class have done poorly. Those people in the middle class most closely associated with the capitalist class in their work have done very well. A Legal Aid attorney is much worse off now than 30 years ago. But the attorneys who are partners in white-shoe law firms, who are doing business with Wall Street, are doing very well.
You use the term working class; who exactly are you referring to?
Sixty-two percent of the labor force in the United States are working-class people, by which I mean people who do not have much control or authority over the pace or the content of the work and they're not a supervisor and they're not the boss. We're talking about white-collar workers, like bank clerks or cashiers; we're talking about blue-collar workers and construction and manufacturing.
How does income fit in?
If we're all in the middle class, then people think the poor will always be with us and there is something wrong with the poor. But if you look at the poor in any given year, it may be 12, 13 or 14 percent of the population but over a 10-year period, 40 percent of Americans experience poverty for at least one year.
The rich are really the top 1 percent. And they have more than half the wealth. The change in the distribution of income is widely known. I have some data from Business Week about the ratio of C.E.O. compensation to worker compensation. In 1981 it was 42 to 1; last year it was over 500 to 1, and it's gone up consistently.
Is there class mobility?
There is some, but not a great deal. The single most important predictor of a child's class position is the occupation of the child's parent. Not only for the working class but the middle class and the capitalists.
Do people confuse race and class?
The principal conflation of race and class comes from the idea that there's a broad middle class, and there's the rich and the poor. In that conception, this middle is really what Bill Clinton talked about, people who work hard and play by the rules. Who are these poor people? Well, they're black.
But two-thirds of all poor people in the United States are white, and three-quarters of all black people in the United States are not poor. We can't talk about the African-American community as one thing because it's divided by class.
You have people saying, "I don't want affirmative action for a black kid if their parents are professionals and their grandparents were professionals." White, working-class kids trying to get into college, trying to get a job are saying: "Why am I being disadvantaged for the child of black professionals? I want class-based affirmative action." Well, there's something to be said for that. But if you just do it on the economic status, you miss the continued existence of racism. It is complicated.
In your view, the increasing gap between the rich and the poor is not just a matter of real income but reflects the reduced power of workers.
The reduced power is in part the decline of union strength in the private sector and the weakness in organizational capacity of the labor movement, which now has less than 10 percent of the private sector in unions and about 13 percent of the total labor force, compared to the middle 1950's, when it was a third.
What is your take on this series of Wall Street scandals?
With the end of the cold war, the capitalist class is triumphant in that they just go to the limit. There is no organized opposition that is effective enough or strong enough to stop them. In the exercise of that power, it's extremely ugly. The mentality that cheats investors also cheats workers, like at Wal-Mart, where they don't pay workers for working off the clock.
What do you mean by organized opposition?
It would be a broad social movement that had different values, different ethics and different ways of understanding what is right and wrong and not a very narrow understanding of the bottom line.
How did Sept. 11 affect our notions of class?
There was a moment there when if you were your basic firefighter or emergency medical technician or ironworker, you were America's hero. I don't think the glow dissipated, but it's a question of how is that used, what are the lessons there. There is a double message: the workers are heroes but the workers didn't get help. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs in the airlines but the workers did not get extensions of their benefits -- but the airlines got $15 billion in aid.

It's Time For Iverson To Grow Up

BYLINE:  By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
THREE responses to the charges and arrest warrant issued Thursday by the district attorney in Philadelphia against Allen Iverson, the 6-foot-1 sensational scoring ace of the 76ers, the self-proclaimed "Answer" and the steadfast icon of hip-hop and counterculture, were particularly significant. 
 To the three felony charges -- criminal trespassing, carrying an unlicensed gun and criminal conspiracy -- and to the six misdemeanor counts, including assault and false imprisonment, Iverson's coach, Larry Brown, said, "I'm hopeful this thing gets resolved and this kid can move on with his life." 
 The Reebok company issued this statement after the charges: "It is Allen's celebrity status, not the facts, that continues to fuel these proceedings. We firmly believe that Allen will be vindicated and Reebok, along with his millions of fans, will be standing by him when he is." 
Oh, and millions of dollars. Reebok has a $50 million sneaker deal with Iverson.
Lynne Abraham, the Philadelphia district attorney, said, "I don't expect that Mr. Iverson is going to be treated any differently than anybody else charged with the same offenses, irrespective of their economic situations."
Regarding Brown's remark, the notion that Iverson, 27, who is the father of a 7-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son and is earning $12 million a year from the 76ers, is a kid is repellent. Brown may have used the word as an affectionate term for a member of, as he went on to say, the 76ers family. More likely, that is how Brown, among others, understandably perceives him.
Part of the problem with Iverson over the years is that he has indeed failed to grow up. There is, to be sure, no intention here to prejudge this most recent case, because in the eyes of the law, Iverson, the citizen, deserves to be considered innocent until proved guilty. 
But it is the accumulation of events that indicates a lack of maturity or growth. To name a few, there was a prison sentence when he was 17 for being in the forefront of a brawl in a bowling alley and hitting a woman over the head with a chair; a few years later, Iverson pleaded no contest to a concealed weapons charge; and there was his thug-rap album bashing women and gays last year. And, of course, there were the numerous fines by Brown over the last several years for coming late to practice or to shoot-arounds before games.
Now come these charges, which the police said involved Iverson's barging into his cousin's West Philadelphia apartment last week with a gun in his waistband and shouting threats to two men while looking for his wife, Tawanna, after a domestic dispute.
Reebok was swift to assert its support. It's not surprising that it would attempt to decide the case -- vindication is the key word -- before it went any further. After all, Iverson is a cash cow for the company. But it's another instance of commercial pandering. The kid, seemingly, can do no wrong. That's how brats are spoiled.
When Abraham said Iverson would be treated like anyone else, she was being disingenuous, of course. The reality is that he will be treated quite differently, and has already.
This acclaimed star athlete can uncommonly afford the best legal representation. And it is certain, based on other high-profile cases, that Iverson will be treated excessively in one of two ways: his celebrity will either make him a nice target to gain headlines for some ambitious prosecutors or politicians, or it will be helpful in getting him a kindlier consideration from authorities.
In fact, Abraham conceded that the Iverson situation is different. "This case for me as a prosecutor is, well, a little over the top," she said to a crowd of reporters. "I have people murdered in the streets of Philadelphia and I don't see all of you here."
Meanwhile, Iverson is home, his wife has returned, but he is not allowed to leave the premises until Tuesday, when he is scheduled to turn himself in to the police.
The tragedy, whether Iverson is culpable in this instance or not, is that he continues to act like "the kid." 
One is reminded of the weird news conference Iverson held after last season and the 76ers' playoff flop, when speculation came from the team about trading him. Delinquent practice habits were a point of contention. But Iverson could not understand that such missteps negatively affect a team.
Perhaps this current situation will make things clearer on many levels for Iverson. It is a terrible price to pay.

PERSON: Irina A. Petrushova 

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
Bruised, but Still Jabbing Kazakh Heavyweights

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan 

 BODY:
ALMOST 20 years ago, when she was a student at St. Petersburg State University, Irina A. Petrushova joined a journalism program that allowed her to work with her father, then a reporter for Pravda.
 "I traveled Kazakhstan with him, to the small villages," she said, explaining that she saw firsthand what a mention in the national press could do for the tiniest backwater. "And this made me positive that this is the thing I should do with my life." 
 Her father, Albert Petrushov, went on to build a career uncovering theft and cronyism in Soviet Kazakhstan. This helped spur Moscow to oust the Kazakh autocrat of the day, Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev, in 1986. 
Captivated in youth, Ms. Petrushova, now 36, has ended up retracing her father's steps, in this same mountain-shaded city, in the same ink-stained trade, at odds with a linear descendant of that same Soviet autocracy. Two years ago, she founded Respublika, a weekly business newspaper with the gloves-off style of independent journalism that ended up making trouble for her father.
In a nation where serious criticism of authorities is still taboo, Respublika has uncovered scandals: the disappearance of millions set aside for Almaty's airport; the awarding of oil rights to groups close to a presidential relative; a damning report that the police emptied a planeload of school-vacation tourists so that a daughter of Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan's current leader, could fly in solitude. 
Now Ms. Petrushova wonders whether she faces the same fate as her father, who was severely injured in murky circumstances after a lifetime of taking on the authorities.
The paper's readership, a new business elite tired of government shakedowns, only wants more of this sort of biting reportage, which in 25 months has generated a circulation of 18,000 and a fat list of advertisers.
But the reporting has angered the government of Mr. Nazarbayev, a former Soviet official who has amassed so much power that some say he could rule for life. Ms. Petrushova has felt the heat of that anger -- in criminal charges, in the court-ordered seizure of the paper, in the delivery of a funeral wreath and a decapitated dog (and later, its head), and in several firebombs.
The government denies involvement in the attacks, insisting that Ms. Petrushova is being attacked by "hooligans."
The United States and other governments have offered her verbal support, but Kazakh activists say that support is far overshadowed by Washington's fervent embrace of Mr. Nazarbayev as an ally against terrorism.
Only last month, the State Department announced that it was considering asking Congress to lift Soviet-era trade restrictions on Kazakhstan. At roughly the same time, the daughter of another rebellious Kazakh publisher was found murdered.
Last week, Ms. Petrushova received a suspended jail sentence, on charges of "business violations" that she asserts were conceived with but one purpose. "They want to silence me."
"We knew what we were doing when we got involved in this," she said recently during an interview in a temporary office, as workers rebuilt Respublika's firebombed newsroom. "We're journalists. If not us, then who?" 
MS. PETRUSHOVA was born in 1965 near Nizhny Novgorod, about 300 miles east of Moscow. Her family moved to Almaty in 1982 when Pravda sent her father there to cover Kazakhstan.
Few associate Pravda, the Communist Party house organ, with muckraking, but Mr. Petrushov was both a good Communist and a good journalist who, his daughter says, hated Communism's internal rot. "He was in opposition, not to the system, but to what was happening in the republics," she said.
She married in 1984 while still in school. She studied watercolor artistry. Her husband took up psychology.
Despite a hiatus for motherhood after college in St. Petersburg, journalism would not let go. She followed her husband back to Kazakhstan, where she was eventually offered a government license to run a struggling financial newspaper that evolved into Respublika "as a business project," she said. But the paper's goals soon expanded to include advocacy for human rights and transparency in government.
Life in Kazakhstan is anything but transparent. An oil boom has turned this sprawl of desert and steppe, big enough to swallow almost four Texases, into a sort of Saudi Arabia. The powerful have scant incentive to account for that wealth and great reason to discourage those who seek to.
Swiss prosecutors say they have frozen suspicious bank accounts in the names of Mr. Nazarbayev and relatives. The Kazakh government calls such accounts frame-ups by its enemies -- except for a $1 billion stash, accidentally disclosed, which it says was tapped to rescue the Kazakh economy in 1998.
Many of Mr. Nazarbayev's relatives hold important posts in Kazakhstan's government and economy. As for any political opposition, the leaders of Democratic Choice, a new movement endorsed by Respublika, have recently been jailed, and critical publications like Ms. Petrushova's have either fallen silent or suffered consequences. 
She says the paper will not surrender its voice. But keeping that pledge has been tough.
LAST November, a government intermediary tried and failed to buy a controlling stake in the paper. Then, in January, Respublika and a handful of other newspapers covered the first meeting of Democratic Choice -- and began to pay a serious price for their brashness.
The paper lost four printers in succession. The last one quit after he found a human skull on his doorstep. 
Ms. Petrushova bought a digital copier and started printing a half-size Respublika. 
In mid-February, prosecutors filed criminal charges against her, charging technical violations of Kazakh labor laws. She has spent much of her time since then fighting a losing court battle.
On March 8, International Women's Day, an elaborate funeral wreath was sent to her.
In mid-March, Respublika reported legislators' demands that the Nazarbayev clan disclose any offshore bank holdings. Days later, a court suspended publication of Respublika for three months. This time, Respublika struck back, publishing under other names like "All the Respublika," "Not That Respublika," and "Respublika on Fire." 
On May 19, reporters found a dog's headless body hung on a newsroom window grate. An attached note stated, "There will be no next time." The next morning, the dog's head appeared outside Ms. Petrushova's apartment door, another note affixed with a screwdriver. It read, "There will be no last time."
That night, Respublika's offices were firebombed. 
Since then, the courts have moved to seize her publishing license. She has secured a second one, for another paper, Business Review of the Republic, which is already on newsstands.
In the meantime, she and her now former husband have hired a guard for their boys, 8 and 12.
Amid the hardships, she finds strength in her father's words. "He always told me, 'If you think you're doing right, then keep doing it,' " Ms. Petrushova said.
But in 1992, Mr. Petrushov was mowed down by a car. As he lay unconscious, he was robbed of the just-completed manuscript of his book on Mr. Kunayev's ouster. He survived, but with a bruised brain that has left him an invalid, able to remember his distant past but nothing of the present. 
As for Respublika's exploits, his daughter said: "He knows. But he doesn't remember."

HEADLINE: Confidence In Economy Off Sharply This Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence has fallen the most since terrorists attacked New York and Washington, a report released today showed, as flagging trust in American companies hammered stocks and threatened the economic recovery.
 The University of Michigan said its preliminary index of consumer sentiment for July sank to 86.5, an eight-month low, from 92.4 in June. The index dropped almost 10 points in September. 
 Stocks continued their recent decline yesterday. "There is a heightened risk that the troubles in the stock market will bleed over into the real economy," said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn.
Consumer spending supports two-thirds of the economy, a reason for investors to be on the watch for any spillover from the stock decline. That has not happened so far. A separate report released today from the Commerce Department showed that retail sales rose 1.1 percent in June. Shoppers increased purchases of cars, clothing and appliances. Sales were down 1.1 percent in May.
Economists had expected a reading of 93 in the preliminary consumer confidence index, which is based on a phone survey that will ultimately include about 500 households. The University of Michigan will issue a final reading in two weeks.
The current-conditions index, which reflects Americans' perception of their financial situation and their willingness to spend on furniture and home appliances, fell to 99 from 99.4. The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, dropped to 78.5 from 87.9.
Before Sept. 11, the largest declines in consumer confidence occurred in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, and in 1991, when the unemployment rate climbed in the aftermath of a recession. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that unemployment rose in June and companies added fewer jobs than expected.
The risks to the economy increase the likelihood that Federal Reserve policy makers may put off any increase in interest rates until next year. Economists at Lehman Brothers said central bankers might even cut rates.
"While the Fed isn't in the business of managing the stock market, they do worry about the collateral damage that the decline in stocks could impose on the economy," said Ethan Harris, one of the two chief economists at the firm.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, delivers a semiannual report on monetary policy and the economy to the House Financial Services Committee next week.
Sales of automobiles and parts surged 3.4 percent last month, the biggest rise since October, when dealer incentives led to record purchases, the Commerce Department said. Excluding cars, sales rose 0.4 percent in June after falling 0.4 percent in May.
Sales at general merchandise stores, which include department stores, rose 1.1 percent after falling 0.8 percent. Sales at clothing and accessory stores increased 2 percent, the biggest gain this year, after a 2.1 percent decrease.

HEADLINE: South Ozone Park Journal; 
At Airport Hotel, Guests Are Now the Homeless

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
Along airport hotel row in Queens, hundreds of new guests are checking into the Best Western Carlton House, their clothes scrunched into plastic garbage bags and tattered suitcases, their mental travel logs filled with tales of eviction, domestic violence, debt.
 The homeless are sleeping in the suites and double rooms that were, until the hotel went bankrupt last spring, occupied by business-class travelers, conferencegoers and tourists. The building, which became a homeless shelter 10 days ago, is now simply called Carlton House. But it still looks exactly like a hotel, with shrubbery around the gates outside, and polished mahogany inside. 
 And the Best Western Carlton House Web site, not yet defunct, still touts three-star details, like plush seating, and mentions sightseeing, fine dining and theater tickets. But the only jaunts most guests take now are to a bus stop, a coin laundry eight blocks away or a pay phone down the street. 
So it is that the surging problem of homelessness in New York City and the travel industry's post-Sept. 11 economic troubles have collided at a 337-room hotel that is now a 337-bed homeless shelter in South Ozone Park, in the shadow of Kennedy International Airport. 
There is plenty of room for the homeless on hotel row, where a string of six major hotels line 135th Avenue, near the Belt Parkway, and where business has plummeted since the attack on the World Trade Center crippled the airline industry. Occupancy for most of the hotels has hovered around 60 percent since September, officials say, but things got so bad for the Best Western that it left South Ozone Park. 
City officials were thrilled to find such a large, idle space. They said that about 80 families had moved in so far, and that they expected Carlton House to be full by the end of this month. 
In terms of supply and demand, the setup in South Ozone Park makes perfect sense. But sheltering the homeless is never that simple. 
At a delicate time for the Queens economy, which is recovering from Sept. 11 at barely a snail's pace, the metamorphosis of a hotel into a shelter has touched off a nasty battle between City Hall and elected officials from Queens.
Some critics, among them politicians who are quick to sympathize with the homeless, are staking the very future of southeast Queens on the situation along hotel row. They see a serious threat to what until recently was the brisk economic development of the area, which is heavily dependent on airport-related business. 
"The city seems intent on dooming us," said City Councilman James Sanders Jr., who represents the district that includes hotel row, where the Radisson, the Holiday Inn, the Hampton Inn and the Courtyard Marriott are a quick taxi ride from Kennedy. "Why would you spend top dollar to go to the Radisson if you're going to stay right next to a homeless shelter? I think that we're in dire straits and I don't think the city has recognized it."
But with homelessness at record levels in New York, city officials might also use the term "dire straits" -- although they chose "unprecedented" -- to describe the situation. The homeless-shelter system, which houses 8,000 families per night, is being inundated with families in need as more apply for beds than leave them, officials said. 
Carlton House, operated by the Salvation Army under contract with the city, is the larger of two big temporary family shelters opening this summer. The Bloomberg administration unveiled a policy recently that envisioned more permanent low-income housing for the homeless, and the facilities -- few as luxurious as the Carlton House -- are intended to house the homeless temporarily. The average stay in such temporary shelters is about nine months, officials said. 
The other new temporary shelter, a 157-bed facility in an unused residential building on New Lots Avenue in Brooklyn, is to open later this month, officials said. 
Linda I. Gibbs, the city's commissioner of homeless services, said she had met with half a dozen Queens officials to discuss their concerns about the shelter, including their frustration that 12 of the borough's 14 homeless shelters are in southeast Queens. (City officials said Queens actually had far fewer shelters than the other boroughs -- 8 percent of the total.) 
"We have to respond to this immediate demand for shelter," Ms. Gibbs said, adding that she did not think the existence of a shelter on the row would make or break the hotel business. "It is really the airport traffic that is going to speak to the occupancy of these hotels."
The outcry over the shelter, which Mr. Sanders said he feared would spawn more hotel closings and a "homeless shelter row" on 135th Avenue, was not lost on some of Carlton House's new residents. 
On July 3, a day before the shelter opened, a group of 100 politicians and community advocates protested in front, shouting, "Hey, hey, ho, ho, this homeless shelter has got to go!" And one of the shelter's many opponents, State Senator Ada L. Smith, got into a spat with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his security detail at a recent town hall meeting after she slammed down a packet of information about homelessness in front of the mayor and startled him.
Several homeless people staying at Carlton House said they had overheard residents of South Ozone Park, who live on the tidy residential streets just north of hotel row, complaining loudly that their property values would tumble.
Susan Taylor, 30, arrived at Carlton House on Tuesday with her three young children after leaving her apartment and her job running a day care program in Brooklyn to escape a man who was abusing her, she said. 
On Wednesday, she tried to use a pay telephone at the Radisson next door because, she said, the shelter's phones were not working yet. She said a Radisson employee told her that the homeless could not use the phone, the fitness room or the spa. 
"In a way, they are right about certain things," she said of the shelter's critics. "Nobody should have to lose business. But people also need to take the time to understand what it's like to be homeless. They don't know, they live in homes."

HEADLINE: In Ecuador's Banana Fields, Child Labor Is Key to Profits 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: PUERTO INCA, Ecuador 

 BODY:
At Los Alamos plantation, it would appear that no expense was spared to produce the Bonita brand Cavendish bananas sold in the United States. 
 The modern 3,000-acre hacienda in this steamy corner of Ecuador, one of the most efficient in Latin America, employs some 1,300 workers to tend banana plants fed by a state-of-the-art irrigation system. 
 The owner is Alvaro Noboa, Ecuador's richest man and a worldly bon vivant. He has become the leading candidate for president with the help of a slick marketing campaign that has cast him as a populist friend of the poor. "I love the workers at Los Alamos," Mr. Noboa told local reporters in May, when he announced his candidacy. 
But in interviews, a dozen children and many adults spoke of child laborers at Los Alamos, among them a spindly-armed 10-year-old, Esteban Menendez. "I come here after school and I work here all day," Esteban said. "I have to work to help my father, to help him make money."
The presence of children on the plantation of a man who may win Ecuador's presidential election in October is one of the more glaring examples of how enduring the use of child labor remains in Latin America, where some 42 million children from ages 5 to 14 have been estimated to be working in recent years.
The problem has been made more durable still by the competition that comes with a consolidated global market. Pressures on businesses to be efficient and profitable are often passed on to the world's most vulnerable population, its poorest children.
Growers and exporters here, who supply 25 percent of the bananas eaten in the United States, say the product earns them about 30 percent less today than a decade ago, often prompting them to turn a blind eye to labor codes. Child labor is common on plantations, large and small. 
Meanwhile, grim economic realities leave families more than ready to send their boys, and sometimes girls, out to work, even if it means pulling them out of school and placing them in fields or factories where they are exposed to hazardous conditions for little or no pay.
For two years, Esteban and his family say, the boy has bounded up 15-foot banana plants, tying insecticide-laced cords between them to stabilize trunks that might otherwise collapse under the weight of the produce that is behind Mr. Noboa's fortune of over $1 billion. 
He works for nothing to help his father, who tends 98 acres, avoid having his pay docked.
"That is the life of my sons, working in the bananas at such a young age," said Esteban's mother, Benita Menendez, 36, who has had three sons working at Mr. Noboa's plantation, only one of them an adult. "I did not want them to work when they were little, but this is the reality."
Ecuador's problem is less severe than that of other countries in the region. Even so, the International Labor Organization estimated that 69,000 children ages 10 to 14, and an additional 325,000 young people ages 15 to 19, were working here in 1999.
Only a significant increase in wages, at best a distant prospect in a country where the average worker earns $5.74 a day, will keep families from sending their children out into the fields, labor advocates here and in the United States say.
But while rights activists regard such labor as unacceptable, many parents like Mr. and Mrs. Menendez see it as a necessity. 
When several plantations, fearing unwanted attention, dismissed their child workers after a damning 114-page report in April by Human Rights Watch, the action was taken as a disaster by families across the lush banana belt of southern Ecuador -- the world's largest banana exporter and an increasingly important source for American corporations like Dole and Del Monte, according to the report.
"They fired all the children, but the work they did helped us," complained Maria Narvaez, 31, whose two sons, Nestor and Luis Boa, 12 and 13, were dismissed from a big hacienda where they earned $3 a day. "The situation is such that we all have to pitch in."
At Los Alamos, which supplies the world's fourth-largest banana company, labor conditions have become increasingly contentious. Employees' efforts to organize for better wages and working conditions led to a violent standoff this year -- a dispute that simmers today in the form of an intermittent strike by some families, including Esteban's own.
The workers unionized in March. The company responded by dismissing more than 120 of them.
When the workers occupied part of the hacienda, guards armed with shotguns, some wearing hoods, arrived at 2 a.m. on May 16, according to workers, and fired on some who had refused to move from the entrance gate, wounding two. 
The guards, workers said, then entered the grounds and burst into barracks where other workers were sleeping and forced them out.
The next afternoon, workers again gathered at the gate, where they parked a bus across the road to block delivery trucks. The guards confronted them again, this time wounding seven more -- including Esteban's father, Bernabe Menendez -- and a policeman.
"It was an attack on innocent people," said Jan Nimmo, a Scottish labor advocate who was with the workers that day and videotaped the afternoon confrontation at the gate.
Mr. Noboa's lawyer, Rafael Pino, attributed the violence to the workers, saying the guards had been sent in to protect property that was being vandalized. "At no moment were there shots from our side," he said.
But the violence prompted the United States Embassy to ask the government to ensure the safety of the striking workers. An American delegation that included two members of Congressional staffs visited Los Alamos workers in June.
"This is sort of the underbelly of globalization," said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who sent an aide to Ecuador.
"We ask for labor protections and we ask for environmental protections," Mr. Miller said, "and we're told we can't have them, and when the citizens of that country try to get those protections, they're met with force from the company to keep that from happening."
After the confrontation at Los Alamos, a Chicago-based labor rights group, the U.S./Labor Education in the Americas Project, began pressing Costco, a distributor of Bonita bananas, to lean on Mr. Noboa to improve labor conditions.
Under pressure, his banana company has promised to improve medical services, provide masks, gloves and other equipment and settle complaints about unpaid overtime wages. But it has refused to recognize the workers' unions, Labor Ministry officials said.
Mr. Noboa, who divides much of his time between Guayaquil and New York, declined to be interviewed, and campaign aides did not return phone calls and e-mail messages seeking comment. But his lawyer, Mr. Pino, said children under 14, who are tightly restricted from working under Ecuador's labor laws, did not work at Los Alamos. "Impossible," he said in an interview. "To violate the law cannot be done, and it is not the company policy either."
Though no one knows exactly how many children work on the large plantations across Ecuador, Sergio Seminario, an analyst and former president of the Association of Banana Exporters, estimated 6,000, with thousands more working on small family farms.
The Labor Ministry has long been aware of the problem in the industry, which accounts for 20 percent of Ecuador's exports. But Alberto Montalvo, the highest-ranking ministry official in this region, said it was difficult to root out. "We all believe in human rights and labor rights," he said. "It is all very beautiful, but we also have to recognize that all the members of families have to work to pay for basic needs."
The existence of child labor on plantations is a product of simple arithmetic. Workers receive so little in part because the wholesalers and retailers abroad reap most of the profits, particularly with the recent consolidation of huge retail outlets like Wal-Mart, Costco and Carrefour.
Each 43-pound box of bananas purchased here by exporters for $2 or $3 goes for $25 in the United States or Europe. The Ecuadorean grower makes 12 cents on the dollar, according to the National Association of Banana Growers. "These big chains say, 'We will buy your bananas off the boat, but at our price,' " Mr. Seminario said.
If the growers are squeezed, the banana workers feel the pain. Their work force is almost entirely nonunion, and workers are often deliberately shifted from one payroll to another by growers who set up multiple companies on paper to avoid paying benefits and higher wages.
The workers and their children here said difficult conditions had long been the norm at Los Alamos. The families who live here in Puerto Inca cram themselves into crude cinder-block houses with tin roofs. Indoor plumbing is rare.
The main earners among several families said they received $6 to $7 a day -- within Ecuador's minimum wage of $128 a month -- but were often expected to work six or seven days a week, failing to earn the overtime pay set by law. 
The monthly minimum they earn falls far short of the $220 the government says a poor family of four needs to meet basic needs, so children go to work.
"With my husband's salary, we did not have enough for school, not enough for food," said Patricia Cespedes, explaining why she had pulled her nephew out of school at age 11 and sent him to work at Mr. Noboa's hacienda. The boy, Maximo Gomez, whom Ms. Cespedes has raised since his mother's death, is now 14 and a veteran field hand.
Esteban goes to school in addition to working. But many families say they earn so little that they must choose which of their children to educate and which to send into the factories and fields. Such economic necessity keeps 55 percent of Ecuadorean children from attending secondary school, the World Bank says.
Mr. Noboa remains a frequent visitor to New York, where, according to his spokesman, Pablo Martinez, he mingles with the Rockefellers and other luminaries. When his son was christened at St. Patrick's Cathedral last year, an event shown on Ecuadorean television, Robert Kennedy Jr. served as the godfather.
But Mr. Noboa's great hope is to reach the presidency, which he failed to win in 1998. Mr. Noboa, who runs a conglomerate that his late father founded, decades ago, has portrayed himself as an outsider whose policies will improve life for most Ecuadoreans.
He has made no extensive public remarks about the dispute with the workers at Los Alamos. In fact, the poor labor conditions and the existence of child workers have made barely a political ripple here. An investigation of the shootings at Los Alamos has not led to any arrests, nor has it shed light on what happened.
Mr. Noboa's aides say the troubles on his hacienda are politically motivated efforts to embarrass him in the midst of a presidential campaign.
"If he wasn't running for president and wasn't the richest man in Ecuador, this wouldn't be happening," Mr. Martinez said.

Signs Hint China's Leader May Be Reluctant to Leave
Jiang Zemin, who was expected to give up the presidency in March, is being lionized in a propaganda campaign that is provoking speculation about his ambitions to hold on to power. A1

China is modernizing its military with the goal of countering American power in the Pacific and pressing Taiwan to accept unification, a Pentagon study said. The new study is more hawkish than one made under the Clinton administration in its analysis of China's ambitions and potential threat to the United States. A4

Pakistan Leader's Plan
Gen. Pervez Musharraf outlined a vision for a return to democracy that would essentially grant a permanent place in government for the military, with a National Security Council. The general, who seized power three years ago, promised that he would make no final decisions on amending the Constitution without wide consultations. "I am not power hungry," he said in a televised address. "I want to give power, not take it away." A2

Wounded Arab Journalist Dies
Imad Aby Zahra, a Palestinian, died of a wound he sustained on Thursday while photographing Israeli tanks in Jenin. Two other Palestinians, including a 13-year-old boy, were killed in the Gaza Strip. The deaths brought to at least 36 the number of Palestinians killed since Israel began seizing West Bank cities. At least 17 were unarmed civilians, the Israeli human rights group B'tselem said. A6

U.N. Allows U.S. Exemption
The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution effectively giving American peacekeepers a year's exemption from prosecution by the new International Criminal Court. A3

Stocks' Retreat Pushing U.S. Budget Into the Red
The Bush administration said the federal government would run a deficit of $165 billion this year, after four years of surpluses, further evidence of how the stock market's long slide was rippling through the economy. Officials said the main reason was a steep falloff in tax revenue from capital gains and other receipts associated with the stock market. A1

Stocks ended a dismal week, though some institutional investors and Wall Street strategists said the market was about due for a strong rally. C1

Democratic leaders in Congress, seizing on the Wall Street scandals to press their agenda on Social Security, demanded that President Bush and the Republicans renounce efforts to shift part of Social Security into private investment accounts. A9

Three senior Republican lawmakers criticized the White House for not spending as much on the military and domestic defense as Congress wanted, saying the Bush administration was endangering national security by adhering to a rigid bottom line. A9

Rulings on Captured Americans
A federal judge ruled that John Walker Lindh's lawyers may call as a witness a reporter who interviewed Mr. Lindh, left, for CNN shortly after his capture in Afghanistan. Defense lawyers want the judge to bar from the trial the videotape, in which Mr. Lindh is heard to describe his movements and to say he wanted to get involved in a jihad, or holy war. A8

A federal appeals court ruled that Esam Hamdi, a 21-year-old man who was born in Louisiana and reared in Saudi Arabia, could be held for now without access to a lawyer and without being charged. Mr. Hamdi was captured in Afghanistan and is accused of fighting for the Taliban. A8

A federal grand jury is investigating a group of people affiliated with two defunct Seattle mosques for possible ties to Al Qaeda, a lawyer for a former mosque member said. A8

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Struggles to Repair Model Prescription Aid Program 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa. 

 BODY:
Pennsylvania's program to help low-income elderly people buy prescription drugs, the largest in the nation, provides invaluable assistance to tens of thousands of people and is immensely popular, but it also shows the problems that could become endemic if Congress adds drug benefits to Medicare.
 The program here costs patients only $6 a prescription and rarely denies coverage. It is financed with proceeds from the state lottery. Despite significant use of generic drugs, however, costs have soared and outstripped revenues. 
 State legislators know they need to adopt stricter cost-control measures, but, like some members of Congress, they have been virtually immobilized by lobbying on all sides. Neither beneficiaries nor pharmacists nor drug companies are willing to make significant sacrifices. 
So the state is desperately seeking new sources of revenue as it considers expanding the program to help more people in need.
Jo Ann H. McCleaf, 67, of Dover, Pa., near York, is just the sort of person whom many state officials want to help. She has no insurance to cover drug costs. With $11,316 in Social Security benefits and $3,000 of earnings last year, she had income just over the $14,000 limit for Pennsylvania's main pharmaceutical assistance program.
A two-time cancer survivor whose right foot was amputated several years ago, Ms. McCleaf said: "I use Lipitor for cholesterol. My legs ache constantly, and I should be taking pain medication every day, according to my doctors. I should also be taking an expensive drug for circulatory problems, but can't afford it."
For Mildred A. Irons, 83, of Linesville, near Erie, the state program has been a godsend. 
"If I didn't have it," Ms. Irons said, "I probably wouldn't have any income to live on." 
For arthritis, high blood pressure and bladder problems, Ms. Irons takes six drugs that cost a total of more than $300 a month. 
Pennsylvania's experience offers lessons for federal officials struggling to provide prescription drug benefits under Medicare.
On Monday, the United States Senate plans to begin a wide-ranging two-week debate on prescription drugs, their benefits and costs, for people of all ages, especially the elderly and disabled on Medicare.
Pennsylvania is deeply committed to its elderly, who make up 15.6 percent of its population, and the drug assistance program, established in 1984, has strong bipartisan support. The program is widely viewed as a model for other states.
"Everybody likes our program because it's a Lamborghini, a Maserati," said Thomas M. Snedden, the director since 1985.
But it has come to acquire a price tag as hefty as the ones on those elite sports cars. 
Since 1997, the cost of the Pennsylvania program has shot up an average of 13 percent a year, to $392.6 million in 2001, while revenues from the state lottery have been flat. Though enrollment has declined, the number of claims for each beneficiary and the amount paid on each claim have steadily increased.
The average number of prescriptions filled for each person in the program now exceeds 3.5 a month, up from 2.5 in 1997 and just 2 in 1987. The state pays an average of $42 for each prescription, up from $27 in 1997 and $14 in 1987.
"The big problem we have, which causes escalating costs, is utilization," Mr. Snedden said. "People are using more and more prescription drug products. If we could get utilization under control, drug prices would not be such a big problem."
Ray Landis, a lobbyist for AARP here, said the situation in Pennsylvania should teach federal officials to be cautious in making assumptions and projections. "In our program," Mr. Landis said, "both utilization and price increases have been much greater than anticipated."
Pennsylvania is second only to Florida in the proportion of its population that is 65 or older. More than 1.9 million of its 12.3 million residents are elderly. About 225,000 people, or nearly 12 percent of the elderly, are in the state's pharmaceutical assistance program.
While trying to hold down drug costs, Pennsylvania does not want to alienate drug companies, many of which have operations here. State officials say they appreciate the fact that Merck, Wyeth, GlaxoSmithKline and other drug makers provide many high-wage jobs in the state.
In its pharmaceutical assistance program, Pennsylvania requires use of low-cost generic drugs that have been approved as fully equivalent to brand-name products. Of the 10 million claims paid last year, 45 percent were for generic drugs.
But state officials have concluded that they must take more aggressive steps to control costs. Many of these steps would be required under a bill introduced by Senator Timothy F. Murphy, a Pittsburgh Republican.
Under his bill, which is supported by the Pennsylvania chapter of AARP, the state would establish a list of preferred drugs, charge higher co-payments for drugs not on the list and encourage patients to use mail-order pharmacies to obtain drugs for chronic conditions.
The bill would also set new limits on payments for generic drugs, and it tries to extract large discounts from makers of brand-name drugs by stipulating that Pennsylvania will not pay more than the "best price" charged to any other customer in the United States. Moreover, drug companies would have to pay rebates to the state to offset price increases that exceed the rate of inflation.
Many of the bills pending in Congress would allow private companies, known as pharmacy benefit managers, to use similar techniques in administering drug benefits under Medicare, the federal insurance program for 40 million people who are elderly or disabled. Such companies say they achieve the greatest savings when they are free to negotiate deep discounts with drug makers and require patients to use selected retail pharmacies.
But in Pennsylvania, the Legislature has specified the amount of drug discounts by law, has allowed virtually every pharmacy to participate and has been reluctant to deny coverage for any prescription drug.
"Politically," Mr. Snedden said, "state legislators just don't want to give up control of the program."
Congress is already facing similar pressures. Drugstores and pharmacists lobbied against the Medicare bill passed by the House of Representatives on June 28. They said it would cut their reimbursement, exclude some drugstores from the Medicare market or drive them out of business by forcing the elderly to use mail-order services. They hope the Senate will protect their interests, just as pharmacists have often persuaded state legislators to do in Pennsylvania.
People 65 and older can receive assistance under the Pennsylvania program if they have annual incomes less than $14,000 for an individual or $17,200 for a couple. Beyond the $6 co-payment for each prescription, there is no other cost to the beneficiary and no cap on annual reimbursements under this program, the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly, or PACE.
A smaller program, known as Pacenet, offers assistance to individuals with incomes up to $17,000 and couples with incomes up to $20,200. But before getting help under this program, a person must pay a $500 deductible, and that has discouraged enrollment.
In Pennsylvania, the governor, Mark Schweiker, is a Republican, and Republicans control both houses of the Legislature. State officials once hoped that Congress would bail them out by establishing drug benefits under Medicare, but that hope is fading. Officials have concluded that they cannot wait for Congress, but must shore up their state program.
An advisory committee created by the General Assembly said recently that the Pennsylvania program was "the largest, most generous and most widely admired state-administered senior pharmacy benefit program in the United States." It is "the standard to which other states aspire," the panel said.
The committee said, "There is great interest among older people and legislators in expanding eligibility" for the drug assistance program here. But, it said, the state must first control costs. "Any other strategy," it said, "runs a very high probability of bankrupting the program."

HEADLINE: FleetBoston Decides to Close Its Robertson Stephens Unit 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Add another victim of the plummeting economy to the list. FleetBoston Financial decided yesterday to shut its once-highflying investment bank, Robertson Stephens.
 FleetBoston had put the San Francisco-based investment bank up for sale in April but found no takers except for a proposal for an employee buyout. Top management of Robertson Stephens had been holding a series of marathon negotiations with Fleet executives up until the last moment yesterday in an effort to save the company, but the plan -- which would have effectively given the bank to its bankers free plus about $200 million in assumed liabilities -- was rejected. 
 "In recent weeks, Fleet and the Robertson Stephens management group were unable to structure an agreement for an employee buyout of the firm," said Eugene McQuade, Fleet's vice chairman and chief financial officer. "As a result, we have decided a wind-down is in the best interests of our shareholders."
Robertson Stephens was one of Silicon Valley's biggest players in the late 1990's. In many ways, Robertson Stephens helped build and finance the dot-com bubble, taking dozens of Internet companies public -- from eBay to eToys.com, which has since closed.
"It's another loss for San Francisco; they were an institution," said Amanda Duckworth, director for marketing at Thomas Weisel Partners, a rival investment bank that focuses on the technology sector. "As much as we might be the beneficiaries, it's another sad day."
For the last two years, FleetBoston, the product of the 1999 merger of Fleet and BankBoston, had aggressively cut jobs at Robertson Stephens as the technology markets and then the broader markets collapsed. Just this week, the bank cut 100 jobs and closed Robertson Stephens offices in London, Munich and Tel Aviv to try to cut costs ahead of an employee buyout. Indeed, even under the employee buyout plan, John Conlin, Robertson Stephens' chief executive, had told the firm's managing directors that half the staff, or 450 people, would have to be cut.
Now, the bankers, many of whom had remained optimistic that they would soon own the company, will have little to show for their patience. Indeed, many bankers had deferred their bonuses from 2001, expecting to be paid once the firm's fate was resolved. Some bankers indicated yesterday that they would consider starting their own firm.
Robertson Stephens, which was bought for $800 million in 1998 by BankBoston, lost $61 million in 2001 on revenue of $543 million. That compares with $1.56 billion in revenue in 2000, a drop of 71 percent.
When FleetBoston put the bank up for sale and hired Goldman, Sachs to help drum up business three months ago, it said that it hoped to raise $600 million for the sale of Robertson Stephens. Some Wall Street analysts laughed at FleetBoston's expectations. At the time, Judah S. Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch said, "It will be hard to find somebody to pay a respectable price."
Last week, the Boston-based FleetBoston, the parent company of Fleet Bank, said losses associated with good will stemming from Robertson Stephens would lower its earnings by $282 million for the quarter ended June 30. FleetBoston may now have to take a charge of up to $500 million, analysts estimate.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Bearson Prowl As Market Ends A Dreary Week

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Wall Street's seemingly relentless slide continued yesterday with stocks posting their worst weekly performance since September.
 The plunge appeared to result more from investors' frustration and fear after months of accounting scandals than from any single economic report or corporate announcement during the week. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 7.4 percent for the week, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 6.8 percent. 
 Many institutional investors and Wall Street strategists contend that the most recent sell-off has gone too far. With earnings beginning to improve, inflation low and the economy recovering, stocks are due for a strong rally, they say. 
"The market is flushing itself out," said Byron Wien, director of investment strategy at Morgan Stanley. "I think we're in a bottoming process."
But the process has not been quick. As accounting scandals spread, engulfing companies like Enron and WorldCom, investors are wondering how much of the earnings growth that propelled stocks in the 1990's was real.
Yesterday, stocks opened strongly after an upbeat profit report from General Electric, which said that it expected its earnings to rise by 25 percent in the current quarter, but they quickly gave back their gains. A report on consumer confidence that was weaker than expected and an estimate that the federal budget deficit could reach $165 billion this year added to Wall Street's gloom.
The Dow industrials ended the day down 117 points, or 1.3 percent, to 8,684.53, while the S.& P. 500 lost 5.98 points, or 0.6 percent, to 921.39, and the Nasdaq edged 0.93 point lower, to 1,373.50.
In headier times, G.E.'s announcement might have spurred a market-wide rally. But today, investors are looking for reasons to sell as hungrily as they sought excuses to buy two years ago, when prices were much higher.
Some are choosing to sell stocks and buy corporate and government bonds, which continue to rise. A preliminary survey of investor attitudes for July had its sharpest drop since September. 
Individual investors have also begun to pull money out of stock mutual funds, said Thomas McManus, chief investment strategist at Banc of America Securities. In the last six weeks, they have sold $18 billion in stock funds.
Of course, Mr. McManus and many other professional investors view bearishness by small investors as a contrary indicator. Individual investor optimism reached a record high in January 2000, two months before the market peaked, according to a monthly survey, the UBS/Gallup poll of investor attitudes.
Individual investors are "hopelessly out of step," Mr. McManus said. "They tend to be late."
A longtime bear, Mr. McManus said he was now telling his clients to move more of their portfolios into stocks, and he expects to continue offering that advice.
Many traders had strong hopes when this week began after a powerful rally last Friday that seemed to have brought a decisive end to the market's recent swoon.
But stocks began giving back those gains almost as soon as trading opened on Monday, and the losses accelerated on Tuesday after President Bush's speech about corporate conduct, which many investors thought was short on concrete steps to discourage accounting gimmicks. In addition, a study that suggested that taking estrogen might increase the risk of cancer in women caused Wyeth, a major drug company, to lose about one-quarter of its value and pushed other big drug makers lower.
By week's end, stocks had fallen four days out of five. For the week, the S.& P. 500 lost 67.64 points. The Dow fell 694.97 points, and the Nasdaq composite gave up 74.86 points, or 5.2 percent.
It was the seventh down week out of eight, and the 14th out of 17.
In that four-month stretch, the S.& P. 500, the most important gauge of the market's performance, has dropped about 21 percent, leaving investors $2 trillion poorer. The longer-term picture is far bleaker. From its peak in March 2000, the S.& P. 500 has fallen 40 percent, the worst drop since the bear market of 1973-74.
But the S.& P. 500's losses pale in comparison with the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The Nasdaq has now plunged 73 percent since March 2000, the worst drop in a major United States index since the Depression, as the technology and Internet bubble has decisively burst.
Charles Hill, research director for Thomson First Call, which compiles Wall Street analysts' forecasts of corporate profits, said he did not think stocks had reached bottom. Analysts are still too optimistic about profits for the second half of the year, and more accounting scandals are likely, he said.
For the third quarter, analysts are expecting S.& P. 500 profits to jump 16 percent compared with the period a year earlier. Companies will probably not meet that estimate because the economic recovery has slowed, Mr. Hill said.
"Earnings growth is going to be more gradual than anticipated going forward," Mr. Hill said. "The other thing is that the realization is setting in that this scandal stuff is bigger than had been anticipated."
In addition, although investors have become more pessimistic, they have not yet panicked. Stocks have fallen, but they have not plummeted 5 percent or more in a day on heavy volume, a sign that investors are overly nervous and that a new rally can begin, Mr. Hill said.
In a bear market, "the last phase is that capitulation, that panic, that throwing in the towel," Mr. Hill said. Until that plunge happens, it will be too early to buy, he said. --------------------

Treasury Prices Climb
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices surged yesterday, pushing most yields to lows for the year, as a late-day equity sell-off lighted a fire under government securities already in demand after a plunge in consumer sentiment.
Benchmark 10-year note yields, which move inversely to the price, had their biggest weekly fall since October 1998, a time when the Federal Reserve had to deliver emergency rate cuts after the near-collapse of a prominent hedge fund.
By late in the day, the price of a 10-year note rose 15/32 , to 102 10/32 . The note's yield fell to 4.57 percent from 4.63 percent on Thursday. The 30-year bond also climbed, up 22/32 , to 100 25/32 . Its yield dropped to 5.32 percent from 5.37 percent.

To the Editor:
Re "Press '1' if You're Steamed" (editorial, July 7):
The remedy for the frustrating phone-menu syndrome is not likely to come from measurement of consumer anger, as "mood analyzer" software described in a recent patent attempts to do, but from the current business recession. 
Our abhorrence of the circuitous automated menus is hardly a mystery in need of calibration. 
 But sales slumps are very real and measurable, and it is easy to predict that they will bring back the realization that customer care is what makes the cash register ring. 
 All it will take is for one provider in any given industry to realize that no matter what it is selling, the real product is the relationship. If that provider drops the automated menu, its competitors will follow like sheep. They'll all realize that the money saved by cutting receptionist salaries is more than offset by loss of customer good will.

Both Sides Say Talk About Baseball's Problems Is One

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
So much negative talk has engulfed Major League Baseball over the past week that it would seem Commissioner Bud Selig would be reeling from it and swimming desperately against the tide, trying to keep his head above the rising murky waters. But Selig himself has contributed to the talk, and he acknowledged yesterday the mixed feelings he has about that contribution.
 "You walk a very thin line," Selig said when he was asked if his comments and disclosures about clubs' problems had hurt baseball. "I worry about that a lot. One could make the case. On the other hand, there are many who feel that we haven't told our story, that we haven't been aggressive enough in telling our story." 
 Among those, many are club owners, Selig said. Asked if owners tell him not to talk about the game's problems so much, he said in a telephone interview: "No. In fact, I would tell you there's a significant number of owners who say we should talk about it more, that we should tell our story more."
The owners' story is primarily about their economic plight, the disparity in revenue between the wealthier teams and the poorer teams and the absence of competitive balance, where the Yankees and other high-payroll teams dominate the playoffs each year and if a low-payroll team advances, it is shown the door quickly. Those concerns are being raised in the negotiations with the players union for a new collective bargaining agreement.
This was supposed to be a showcase week, with the All-Star Game in Milwaukee and its attendant festivities enabling baseball to show off its best players and the attraction it has for eager fans.
But events in Milwaukee on Monday, the day before the game, were overshadowed by the union's executive board discussing a possible strike date at a meeting in Chicago. On the day of the game, Selig conducted an Internet town hall, and the first six questions and nine of the 17 he answered dealt with baseball's economic problems.
Then Wednesday, meeting with reporters in his office, Selig triggered two days of newspaper articles about teams in trouble, either encountering difficulty meeting payroll or wallowing in so much debt that the rest of the season could not be guaranteed. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Detroit Tigers recently experienced payroll problems and needed bank loans to pay their players, people in baseball familiar with the problems said.
"There is only one way to solve this," Selig said. "Get a system that works. Do I like this? No, not one bit. I hate it.
"But when you get into stadium debates and other things, this comes out. You can't stop it. Do people know the system isn't working? You bet they do."
Even trades prompt talk of economics, he noted. 
"Everything is tied into this," he said. "When a trade is made, for example, we talk more about the financial aspects of it than anything else. That's regrettable. The first question I was asked yesterday was what about the money in the deal. Years ago we'd talk about the players and who got the better of the deal. That seems to be secondary now."
He was referring to the trade that sent Cliff Floyd and his $6.5 million contract from the Florida Marlins to Montreal. Because the Expos, owned by Major League Baseball, cannot increase their payroll, the Marlins had to give the Expos about $1.5 million to balance the salaries of the players in the deal.
People in and close to the union have expressed skepticism about some of Selig's comments about baseball, especially his talk on Wednesday about troubled teams.
"It's amazing," one person close to the union said, speaking on condition of anonymity, "that when you're trying to sell the best product in the world, essentially you do it by doom and gloom. Normally that's not a good technique."
Some people on the labor side believe that the doom-and-gloom talk is deliberate, aimed at gaining leverage in the negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement.
Selig said there was no ulterior motive involved, only the belief among the owners that they had to impress on everyone -- players, fans, and members of the news media -- the serious nature of their problems.
"I am extremely sensitive about it," Selig said about the constant talk of problems. "I do have concerns. Anything that takes focus away from the field can't be good. That's unfortunate. But there are such strong feelings in so many places. It has so many manifestations it's hard not to talk about it. 
"There are times when it comes up when nobody has said a word. People just bring it up. But I do regard it as a negative. I hate talking about it."
Selig expressed hope that the talk would not have to last much longer.
"Hopefully," he said, "we can have a successful conclusion to the labor thing and we can quit talking about it."

VISX, A MAKER OF LASERS, EXPECTS PROFITS TO FALL SHORT

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Visx Inc. shares fell 18 percent after the company, the biggest maker of lasers used to correct vision, said profit for the rest of the year would not meet forecasts. The shares fell $1.70, to $7.60 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange, where Visx led the list of percentage losers. 
A slow economy has hurt demand for vision-correction surgery, and sales and profit are expected to decline the rest of this year, Visx said. The company forecast earnings of 15 cents to 18 cents a share in the second half, lower than the 27 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Visx, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it earned $5.92 million, or 11 cents a share, in the second quarter, reversing a year-earlier loss of $10.7 million, or 19 cents a share. Sales fell 24 percent, to $36.6 million from $48.3 million.

Federal Government to Post $165 Billion Deficit in 2002
The Bush administration said the federal government would run a deficit of $165 billion this year, a sharp turn for the worse after four years of surpluses and further evidence of how the stock market's long slide is rippling through the economy.
 Administration officials said the main reason for the swing from a $127 billion surplus in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30 to the projected red ink for the current fiscal year was a steep falloff in tax revenue from capital gains and other receipts associated with the stock market. Page A1. 

Another Brutal Week for Stocks
Wall Street's seemingly relentless slide continued with stocks posting their worst weekly performance since September. The Dow industrials dropped 7.4 percent and the S.& P. 500 6.8 percent. The plunge appeared to result more from investors' frustration and fear after months of accounting scandals than from a single economic report or corporate announcement in the week. A1.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored buyers of home mortgages, said they would begin making the same kind of quarterly and annual reports as other publicly traded companies. C3.

Burberry shares fell 2.2 percent in their first day of trading. C2.

FleetBoston to Sell Investment Arm
FleetBoston Financial decided to shut down its once highflying investment bank, Robertson Stephens. FleetBoston had put the bank up for sale in April but found no takers except for a proposal for an employee buyout. But top management rejected that plan. C4.

G.E. Posts 14% Increase in Profits
Despite steep losses on WorldCom bonds and in its insurance businesses, General Electric reported a 14 percent increase in earnings in the second quarter, in line with analysts' expectations. The company also promised a robust third quarter. C2.

Conseco's Prospects Dealt a Blow
The key insurance rating of Conseco, the insurance and finance company, was downgraded by A. M. Best, a decision that will make it harder for Conseco to compete and worsens the prospects for a turnaround. C4.

Plea Bargain Possible for Waksal
Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of ImClone Systems charged with insider trading, is discussing a plea bargain, federal prosecutors acknowledged. C3.

Deutsche Telekom's Chief Resists
The chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, Ron Sommer, left, stepped up his resistance to efforts to oust him, even as speculation grew about potential successors. His future is expected to be decided on Tuesday at a meeting of the company's 20-member supervisory board. The Ver.di services union said it would back an internal candidate to replace Mr. Sommer if he quit or was fired. C3.

Confidence Slumps as Sales Climb
The University of Michigan said its preliminary index of consumer sentiment for July sank to 86.5, an eight-month low, from 92.4 in June. The government reported that retail sales rose 1.1 percent in June. C5.

HEADLINE: A Rosy Forecast From G.E. As Its Profits Increase 14% 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Despite steep losses on WorldCom bonds and in its insurance businesses, the General Electric Company reported a 14 percent increase in earnings for the second quarter yesterday, in line with analysts' expectations. The company also promised a robust third quarter.
 "We see a very strong pipeline of new products and services across G.E.," Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chairman, said yesterday. 
 G.E. earned $4.4 billion, or 44 cents a diluted share, in the latest quarter, compared with earnings of $3.9 billion, or 39 cents a diluted share, in the quarter a year earlier. Mr. Immelt predicted that revenue would rise as much as 10 percent and profits at least 20 percent this quarter. He also said G.E. was on track to meet analysts' expectations of full-year per-share earnings of $1.65 to $1.67. 
But the numbers were not all so reassuring. Second-quarter revenue inched up only 4 percent, to $33.2 billion from $32 billion. Much of that came from GE Power Systems, which some analysts say has peaked in sales. Revenue at GE Capital, normally a growth engine, fell 4 percent, because of a write-down of $110 million on its WorldCom bonds and losses of $236 million at its insurance unit, the Employers Re Corporation.
Elsewhere, G.E. said that GE Medical was going strong and that its NBC television network, plastics, appliances and other "short cycle" businesses -- most sensitive to the economy -- were growing rapidly.
"If people accept that G.E. is on a path to credible operating numbers, the stock could really move," said Nicholas P. Heymann of Prudential Securities, who rates G.E. a buy.
G.E. shares closed at $28.60 yesterday, up $1.25. But that is closer to Thursday's 52-week low of $26.40 than to last year's high of $47.75.
Investors, analysts say, have had to pick through a tangled morass of numbers to assess G.E. earnings, one reason the stock price is low. 
Robert Friedman, an analyst with S.& P. Equity Research, who rates G.E. shares a hold, said he routinely stripped away gains from overfinanced pension plans and other items that did not reflect what he called core activities. "When we only look at core earnings, the numbers are a lot lower," he said. 
Other analysts worry that a rub-off effect of scandals at Enron and elsewhere will continue to depress G.E.'s stock, even if its accounting is faultless. And still others say the shares trade at too high a premium.
Timothy M. Ghriskey, who runs his own investment management firm in Greenwich, Conn., sold all his G.E. shares in May, when he heard rumors of problems with the company's accounting.
"I did not believe it for a second, but in this market you have to quickly get out of harm's way," he said.
Such reactions frustrate Mr. Immelt. In a letter to employees last week he decried the widespread belief that "companies making their commitments must be cheaters." And he staunchly defended G.E.'s integrity when an analyst raised the question yesterday.
But more than secondhand tarnish is holding down G.E. stock. G.E. relies heavily on GE Capital for growth, yet its stock sells at a premium to other financial services companies. "I'm not sure that will continue," Mr. Ghriskey said. 
Older businesses, like lighting and appliances, meanwhile, drag down growth. "They should get rid of them," Mr. Heymann said bluntly. 
Moreover, many analysts have grown cynical about G.E.'s timing on one-time gains and losses. This quarter, for example, a $358 million tax benefit will offset a $300 million loss from WorldCom and Employer Re. G.E. will probably use a $500 million gain from selling its electronic commerce business last week to offset coming revamping charges.
"They're offsetting genuine costs with gains that have nothing to do with underlying business operations," Mr. Friedman said. 
G.E. used to brush aside such criticisms. Now it is tackling them.
For only the second time, G.E. followed its earnings release with a conference call with analysts, and it was the first time that its chairman participated. G.E. issued its results at 6 a.m, giving analysts three hours to digest the numbers before the call commenced at 9 a.m. And, it offered a finer breakdown of numbers than it did last year. For example, it no longer lumps transportation systems and lighting under "industrial products and systems."
"Immelt has gone much further than Welch in making the numbers transparent," said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who has written extensively about John F. Welch Jr., Mr. Immelt's predecessor.
Maybe so, but analysts remain skeptical. "It's still hard to find salient numbers," Mr. Friedman said, "so they still have a ways to go."

HEADLINE: Trouble With Trash 

 BODY:
New York City's ubiquitous trash -- 11,000 tons of it daily from residences alone -- has traveled to Pennsylvania and Virginia, and there's even talk of sending it to a Caribbean island. It is seeing more of the world than some New Yorkers do, and it could threaten to overtake culture as the city's most notable export.
 Recognizing the scale of the problem, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has made the garbage crisis the focus of his second 100 days in office, promising to deliver something in the way of a solution by next Friday. It is an ambitious target, given the political, economic and environmental hazards surrounding the issue. And it has City Hall scrambling, entertaining some novel approaches, including using a semi-submersible garbage freighter that sounds like something out of Jules Verne or "Waterworld." 
 This spring the mayor toyed with the idea of building incinerators; but New Yorkers, fearing added air pollution and other problems, cried foul. Experts say the waste management industry is on the brink of a cleaner, safer incinerator that will produce energy without creating tons of toxic residue. That technology always seems to be right around the corner, but until it actually arrives, incinerators are best left on a back burner.
It was irresponsible of Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph Giuliani, to close the Fresh Kills landfill before finding an alternate trash disposal solution. Mr. Bloomberg should reopen it on a temporary basis, while continuing to send the rest of the trash to landfills elsewhere. Nevertheless, that's a horrifically expensive option -- becoming more so as private trash haulers and landfill owners realize they are in a sellers' market. Further, the trucks that currently haul the trash to Pennsylvania and Virginia are wearing down roads and fouling air quality along the route.
It would be better to use existing marine transfer stations in the city, where barges would be loaded and sent to Port Ivory or Howland Hook on Staten Island. From there, rail links can take the trash to landfills. The city should consider retrofitting the transfer stations so the garbage would travel in sealed containers. If it becomes available, a waterfront facility in Linden, N.J., could handle about half the city's residential trash. An investigation involving ownership of the proposed site has all but taken it off the table, although a resolution there could contribute to a diversified, practical and sustainable solution.
But finding trash depositories cannot be the only focus if the city is going to seriously address the mountains of garbage it produces. New York has been living large for too long, and like overly indulgent parents, its officials have done little or nothing to rein in the excess. The city needs to go on a trash diet. Here are a few ways to start:
Expand the recycling program. Mayor Bloomberg's suspension of glass and plastic recycling cannot be the end of the discussion. We need new strategies for separating glass and finding markets for plastics. The program may never actually break even, but reducing the size of our trash burden will be worth a lot. The State Legislature can help by widening the bottle bill to include redeemable deposits on noncarbonated beverages. Albany should also correct an outrageous injustice in which unclaimed refunds on drink containers -- tens of millions of dollars in New York City alone -- go back to the bottlers. That money should be directed to recycling and environmental projects.
Compost. The whole idea of composting in a city this large and crowded sounds ridiculous, but there are places where it can work. In neighborhoods with lawns, cuttings should be mulched and returned to the ground, an uncomplicated task that could save the city as much as $9 million a year. Composting table waste is being done successfully on Rikers Island, and it worked in a Park Slope experiment a decade ago. It should be explored for larger applications.
Cut down on packaging. Manufacturers who wrap their products in layer upon layer of packaging could be persuaded to pare down if the city used the muscle of its more than seven million consumers to demand more restraint.
The problem is big enough to require a trash czar -- a high-level mayoral appointee who can help usher in a new era of waste reduction. This project will require new and creative thinking that goes beyond just how to get rid of what the city's residents throw out. The time is right and the garbage crisis demands this kind of attention.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT EXPECTS DEFICIT TO HIT $165 BILLION 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that the federal government would run a deficit of $165 billion this year, a sharp turn for the worse after four years of surpluses and further evidence of how the stock market's long slide is rippling through the economy.
 Administration officials said the main reason for the swing from a $127 billion surplus in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30 to the projected red ink for the current fiscal year was a steep falloff in tax revenues from capital gains and other receipts associated with the stock market. 
 Wall Street closed out another dismal week with another down session. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 117 points today, closing at 8,684.53. Its loss for the week was 694.97 points, or 7.4 percent. The Nasdaq composite index edged down by less than a point to close at 1,373.50, bringing its loss for the week to 74.84 points, or 5.2 percent. 
Consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since right after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index for July that was released today. The index fell to 86.5, an eight-month low, from 92.4 in June. 
The cascade of bad news about corporate behavior is weighing increasingly heavily on both Wall Street and Washington, where Democrats sought today to use the tumble in stock prices to argue against President Bush's plan to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security taxes in stocks and bonds. Page A9. 
By further undermining investors' confidence, the corporate scandals are also increasing the fiscal pressure on the government. Its finances have deteriorated for a year because of the combined effects of the weak economy, increased spending on national security and the initial costs of the tax cut pushed through Congress last year by President Bush.
The fiscal squeeze has intensified during the last several months, in large part because tax revenues have dried up more than anticipated, private economists and government officials said.
The recent dropoff in tax receipts and the ensuing surge in the federal deficit is due "almost entirely to what I will call stock market related income -- capital gains, and to a lesser extent income from mutual fund distributions, options, perhaps bonuses tied to stock performance," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget. "This is a new and I think important phenomenon we are all going to have to understand much better."
Mr. Daniels said that the deficit for the next fiscal year, starting Oct. 1, should decline to $109 billion, and that the government could return to running surpluses two years later.
Democrats called the administration's projections overly optimistic. They said the long-term fiscal outlook remains bleak, and they renewed their argument that the root of the problem was Mr. Bush's insistence last year in pushing through a $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax cut on the basis of long-term surplus projections that were wildly optimistic.
"They have now wandered off to fantasyland and are seriously understating the deficits and the buildup of debt we are facing," said Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. 
Mr. Conrad said next year's deficit was likely to be more than $200 billion, nearly twice the administration's estimate. Senate Republicans are also projecting a deficit for next year of more than $190 billion.
Traditional economic theory holds that governments should run deficits during times of economic weakness because doing so effectively puts more money in the hands of businesses and individuals. Neither party advocates trying to close the budget gap this year or next, in part because of the economic implications.
But Democrats hope to make a case that the Bush administration has put the government on a path leading to deficits for years, perhaps decades, eventually limiting its ability to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits to the growing ranks of retirees and hurting the economy by driving up interest rates.
Running deficits also means that the government's debt will rise, further burdening future generations. Congress already raised the legal ceiling on the national debt this year, and this week a developer restarted the "debt clock" in midtown Manhattan that tracks the government's liabilities, setting it at $6.1 trillion, after turning it off for two years.
Mr. Conrad said the $5.6 trillion, 10-year surplus projection the White House relied on last year in pressing for the tax cut proved to be a mirage. While last year's recession and the costs of the war on terrorism played a role, he said, the bulk of the deteriorating fiscal outlook over the long run was attributable to the administration's emphasis on tax cuts.
"The markets are voting every day on the credibility of this economic team, and they're giving a thumbs-down to this economic plan," Mr. Conrad said.
But Democrats have not offered deficit-reductions plans of their own, and most have shied from advocating a repeal of Mr. Bush's tax cut or delaying the provisions that phase in over the rest of the decade.
The administration's presentation of the new budget numbers did not dwell on the long-term outlook, but focused instead on the short term. It pointed to the stock market as the immediate problem, and asserted that the key to maintaining fiscal responsibility was for Congress to hold down government spending.
Mr. Daniels said that the administration's projection of a return to surplus in 2005 makes room for increased spending on national security as well as for other issues like health care. "But it also contemplates real restraint in spending in the rest of the budget, and that's the biggest if," he said.
In the budget analysis it released today, the administration said it expected total revenue for the current fiscal year to decline by $124 billion, or 6 percent, from last year's level. 
Nearly all of the decline -- $121 billion, it said -- would come from individual income tax receipts. And, it said, most of that decline was within the "non-withheld payments" category, which is largely made up of capital gains taxes.
Through May, the administration said, non-withheld payments were down by $80 billion, or 28 percent, from the same period a year earlier.
Mr. Daniels said that the administration was not making any specific assumptions in its projections for next year about a recovery in the stock market. But he said its projections assume an overall increase in tax revenues of 5 to 6 percent.
Democrats said the assumption that the budget could be rebalanced by 2005 was built on unrealistic economic projections. Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, noted that the administration assumed, without any explanation, very large jumps in corporate profits in 2004 and 2005.
"It's a critical detail," he said, "and it shows you why we're skeptical, to say the least, about the numbers they've presented."

HEADLINE: Records of Two Utilities Are Subpoenaed 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 12 

 BODY:
The Duke Energy Corporation and the El Paso Corporation said today that they had received subpoenas for trading records from authorities looking into sham transactions in natural gas and electricity. 
 Duke said the requests for its documents came from the United States attorney's office in Houston, as part of a grand jury investigation, and from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. El Paso, the operator of the largest natural gas pipeline network in the United States, received its subpoena from the United States attorney in Houston. 
 Prosecutors have previously sought trading records from Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy Inc. and the CMS Energy Corporation. Energy producers and traders are under increased scrutiny since the collapse of Enron and disclosures of fake trades and accounting mistakes.
El Paso denied that it had used so-called round-trip trades, which have no economic benefit, to inflate volume or revenue and said that it had not used them to manipulate prices. The company said it would cooperate with the investigation.
Duke, like some rivals, has acknowledged engaging in round-trip trades. It included about $1.1 billion of such trades in financial statements over three years. 
The company has said that the trades were done at the request of a third party and accounted for less than 1 percent of its $107.4 billion of energy trading and marketing revenue from 1999 to 2001. The transactions were used to "validate real-time prices," not to increase revenue, it said.
Duke found three such gas transactions out of more than 30,000 in the West, the company said as part of its response to an inquiry of 150 companies by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
"We don't know" the scope of the grand jury inquiry or whom the investigation is focusing on, said Terry Francisco, a Duke spokesman. "We were just told to provide information on trading, and specifically the round-trip trades." The company is cooperating with the request, he said.
Shares of Duke declined $3.20, to close at $24.75, after falling as low as $24.05, their biggest drop in almost 15 years. El Paso disclosed its subpoena after stock markets had closed.
"Any day you receive a subpoena from a federal prosecutor is not going to be a good day for your stock," said Timothy O'Brien, who has been selling Duke shares since April from the $245 million he manages in the Evergreen Utility and Telecommunications Fund. "Duke is one of the largest and most successful energy traders in the country, and they've caught the gangrene of the trading scandal."

 THE MONK DOWNSTAIRS
By Tim Farrington.
276 pp. San Francisco:
HarperSanFrancisco. $22.95.
 WE modern folk are spiritually exhausted. We have lost faith in so many things -- love, work, raising our children in a manner that will keep them out of the federal penitentiary -- that our low-grade distress is an almost constant theme in the modern novel. But rarely in contemporary fiction do we come across a man or woman of God -- forget about devotees of the healing power of crystals; we're talking about old-fashioned nuns or monks, straight out of central casting -- who is also exhausted, who has lost faith not so much in God but in the point of devoting a life to him to the exclusion of everything else.
In Tim Farrington's tender, witty new novel, "The Monk Downstairs," Michael Christopher, formerly Brother Jerome of Our Lady of Bethany Monastery in Mendocino, Calif., has left his order after 20 years and landed in San Francisco, where he rents an in-law apartment in the Sunset district from Rebecca Martin, a lonely graphic designer and single mother of a 6-year-old daughter, Mary Martha. Rebecca is crawling out from under the wreckage of her marriage to Rory, a professional (read: fundamentally unemployable) surfer who "didn't quite have rock-star good looks, though he acted like he did and usually pulled it off." To say that she is disillusioned with life is only to say that she's entering early middle age in America.
When the story opens, Rebecca is being relentlessly pursued by a 40-ish suitor named Bob Schofield, one of those fulsome guys (with a shelf in his library devoted to "Relationships") who can lay claim to having a love life merely because it's against their religion to take a hint. Rebecca and Bob are a couple only because Rebecca hasn't the energy to be really cruel to him -- cruel enough to make him go away for good. But when Bob proposes on bended knee at a trendy North Beach restaurant, violinist at the ready, she finally decides it's simply too much.
In her refusal, Rebecca defines her life for him and for us: "I'm 38 years old, and I've got a daughter learning to read and a job I don't quite like. I've got a mortgage. I'm making my middle-aged peace with network television. Tomorrow is another day I've got to get through. If you could just behave yourself, we could have the occasional movie or meal together and I would feel that much less like a troll and a drudge.+But I don't need the violin music, Bob. I don't want it. I find it sort of pathetic, really."
Of course, she does want the violin music -- at least metaphorically -- which is the reason she can't settle for Bob.
Rebecca's romance with Michael Christopher begins haltingly. It turns out that they both smoke (Rebecca allows herself five Marlboro Lights a day, which she thinks of as "little suicides"), and she runs into him from time to time on the back steps, having a cigarette. She's surprised that he smokes. As an ex-monk, he's an oddity, but an oddity who intrigues her. She finds herself vaguely charmed by his disinclination to fill conversational gaps with small talk and his determination to plant a garden in her backyard, a weed-choked square of dirt that screams neglect. Still, she convinces herself that it's ridiculous to pursue her attraction. Wouldn't having an affair with a former monk be like getting involved with someone on the rebound from a relationship with God? Serious as the question is, it's a delectable conceit.
Perhaps unwisely, Rebecca tells her mother about her new tenant. And, sure enough, Phoebe (a vivacious widow who lives up the coast in a small artsy community, where she works in an art gallery and attracts the requisite eccentric pals) immediately decides that he'd be the perfect person to preside over the baptism of a baby born to a single mother she's taken under her wing: "Just a few words in the proper spirit is all we're looking for. A soupcon of ritual."+Rebecca won't ask him, but Phoebe will, and soon Mike and Rebecca and Mary Martha are headed up the coast for a beach party that doubles as a baptism. The reason he accepts? "I was told there would be hot dogs."
One of the many satisfactions of "The Monk Downstairs" is the way it captures Rebecca's slow acceptance of the risk she is taking with Mike. All too often these days, we're bombarded by stories about the love affairs of gorgeous young people who have nothing to lose but their self-imposed alienation. When you're a middle-aged single mother living on a shoestring, spending a week's grocery money on some fancy boxers for your new boyfriend, as Rebecca does once she spies Mike's dingy, old-man underwear, is risky indeed. And not just on a practical level.
Once, when Rebecca and Mike are arguing about their fears, he acknowledges that he's afraid he can't love her properly because "he's spoiled for real life." "We're all spoiled," she retorts. "Life does that. It's what you do with yourself after you realize you've been spoiled that matters. It's the life you make in the ruins."
Farrington has created a great cast of supporting characters: high-spirited Phoebe; Rebecca's best friend, Bonnie, a jovial cynic who lives with her German shepherd and has made peace, more or less, with being single; Rebecca's hapless ex-husband, Rory; willful Mary Martha; even the annoyingly earnest love machine, Bob.
The book's only peculiarity is its tone. It's as if Farrington himself had been in a monastery for the last 20 years. His is a San Francisco without one gay man or woman. AIDS, the real-estate boom and the rise and fall of dot-com mania never happened here. At Utopian Images, the graphic design firm where Rebecca works, the main concern of the staff seems to be selling out their hippie good intentions to The Man. Even surfing isn't as flaky as it once was. Since the rise of ESPN and extreme sports, a talented, telegenic surfer like Rory might actually be able to make decent white-collar money.
But this is a mere quibble. "The Monk Downstairs" manages to be both a wry page-turner and a thoughtful investigation of what Christ may have meant when he said, "Love one another."+Come to think of it, pulling off a story like this -- where the principals are embarked upon a love that genuinely appears to have a chance of lasting -- is something of a modern-day miracle all in itself.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
Hard Times for Cast Albums, to Broadway's Regret

BYLINE:  By BARRY SINGER 

 BODY:
IF a musical opens in New York and no record company records it, does it still make a sound?
 That is the question increasingly confronting the creators of musical theater. With the record business reeling from corporate consolidation and the general economic downturn, producing cast albums has become more of an extravagance than ever. The devotion of a niche audience is no longer enough to justify losses, and predictably the major labels are cutting back. 
 Last winter, the record company BMG downsized its RCA Victor cast album division to the point of oblivion, relegating its senior vice president for shows and soundtracks, Bill Rosenfield, to a consulting job. 
Talk to executives at most major labels and the refrain is the same: "Selectivity." Meaning simply: "We will be recording less."
"The nurturing of young composers and their shows by big recording companies is no longer going to happen," Mr. Rosenfield said in a recent interview. "What they're telling us is they only want hits."
Not that the major labels have ever been interested in anything else. The list of musicals not recorded since the dawn of original-cast albums is one of fascinating failures, including last season's critically dismissed Lincoln Center Theater production of "Thou Shalt Not," with a score by the pop-jazz crossover artist Harry Connick Jr. When Mr. Connick's record company, Sony, passed on preserving "Thou Shalt Not," the composer was so put out, he recorded the show at his own expense. His self-produced CD has gone on sale at Amazon.com.
Several people knowledgeable about the unsuccessful musical "Sweet Smell of Success" last season, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified, said that Sony had tried to extricate itself from a signed commitment to record the show after the reviews during a pre-Broadway run in Chicago were negative. In the end, Sony chose not to exercise its contractual escape clause and a cast album was released. Peter Gelb, the president of Sony Classical, declined a request for an interview, as did Marty Bell, one of the show's producers. 
Recording musicals has always been a labor of love. Though "Oklahoma!" and "My Fair Lady" sold staggeringly well at first and continue to earn handsomely today, the numbers for recording an average musical have never added up.
"It is very difficult to record a new Broadway show for under $300,000 and, quite frankly, it can be much more than that," said Denis McNamara, senior vice president for Decca/Decca Broadway, part of the Universal Classics group. "You really have to sell in excess of 150,000 units to see a profit. Our 'Mamma Mia!' -- Universal is also one of the show's producers -- is the most successful cast recording since 'Rent,' which tells you something about the reality of original-cast albums. 'Mamma Mia!' will be a gold record" -- selling 500,000 copies or more -- "by the end of the summer. And it's not just the cast album. 'Abba Gold' on our Polydor label has actually sold more during the same period."
"Mamma Mia!" is also another example of ledger sheets legislating against Broadway cast albums. The CD referred to by Mr. McNamara is the London cast recording. Despite the show's substantial Broadway box office, there are no immediate plans to record the Broadway cast because Decca does not want to dilute the public's Abba appetite with a competing disc.
Recent sales figures for original-cast albums say it all. "The Phantom of the Opera" is king, with more than 15 million units sold. (This is also the London cast recording; no Broadway cast album was recorded.) "Rent" follows far behind, at 2 million plus. After almost five years, "The Lion King" has sold in excess of 800,000, which seems impressive until that figure is compared with the movie's soundtrack sales of more than 16 million.
Surprisingly, "The Producers" has sold only 200,000 copies so far, after Sony paid a king's ransom to record it. (Sony executives would not comment on how much they paid, but estimates from other record company executives range as high as $500,000.) Though 200,000 copies sold is a respectable number, it pales by comparison with the 340,000 that "Mama Mia!" has sold. Abba's music transcends Broadway theater, while "The Producers" does not.
Mr. Rosenfield understands the math. "Record companies will continue to overpay for hit Broadway shows," he said, "even as they phase out the rest, because overpaying is what the real record business is all about."
Is there a better way?
Sh-K-Boom Records (pronounced Shikaboom) is a two-year-old independent label that recently released its first original-cast album, "The Last Five Years." The musical, with its cast of two, closed quickly Off Broadway this year, even though it possessed what many people in the theater business considered the most original score of the season -- by the young Tony Award-winning composer Jason Robert Brown.
"The Last Five Years" is the sort of worthy new musical that Mr. Rosenfield said he would have recorded at RCA. Instead, as a co-producer, he shared the project with Sh-K-Boom's 35-year-old founder, Kurt Deutsch, whose wife, Sherie Rene Scott, was a star of the show.
Mr. Deutsch, an actor who created Sh-K-Boom to produce and market his wife's first solo CD, soon realized that the label could satisfy a potentially lucrative demand. "There are a lot of Broadway stars who don't want to make show tune records," Mr. Deutsch said. "They want to bridge the gap between rock 'n' roll and theater without being pigeonholed. Major labels would never give these guys the time of day because they believe that you cannot be associated with Broadway if you're going to do a mainstream, crossover record. They think Broadway is corny, even cheesy, and appeals to older audiences. And you know what? They're right in a lot of ways. But there is this whole new generation of artists who are cool and are appealing to a much younger audience. I figured if I branched out, I could build a community of young fans, composers and stars."
The cost-management problems involved in recording a cast album, however, surprised Mr. Deutsch. "You have to pay to re-use everything," he said. "You have to re-license the orchestrations, you have to repay the music copyist, the press agent -- they're unionized too -- the company manager. The biggest obstacle, though, is Actors' Equity, which has this rule requiring each actor in a show, plus the stage manager, to be paid a week's salary for every eight hours in the studio. That's why all musicals are recorded in one desperate day."
Norbert Leo Butz delivered a Tony-nominated performance in Mr. Connick's "Thou Shalt Not" before starring opposite Ms. Scott in "The Last Five Years." "It's funny that I did two original musicals, one small and one enormous, and only the small one made it officially to CD," Mr. Butz said. "But it's an ephemeral process."
Other independent labels that continue to record new musicals include Original Cast Records, Jay Records, Fynsworth Alley -- a new enterprise for a familiar figure on the show music scene, Bruce Kimmel, formerly of Varese Sarabande Records -- and the 26-year veteran DRG Records, which released last season's most electrifying cast album, "Elaine Stritch at Liberty." 
Robert Hurwitz, the president of Nonesuch Records (part of the Warner Music Group, a division of AOL Time Warner), records original-cast albums with a selectivity that makes even the scaled back majors seem profligate. In addition to recording last September's concert revival of "Dreamgirls," Mr. Hurwitz has limited himself to cast album relationships with two composers: Stephen Sondheim (the latest Nonesuch album is "Into the Woods") and his heir apparent, the widely admired Adam Guettel. 
"Classical recordings and Broadway records are getting more expensive to make," Mr. Hurwitz said, "while the audiences that purchase these records are getting smaller. So it should not be surprising that companies are becoming more restrictive."
Mr. McNamara, at Decca, concurred ruefully: "There are easier ways to have a hit. Boy, for that million dollars spent recording and marketing one show, you could make an awful lot of pop records." 
Mr. Deutsch believes producers could make money if they retained the rights to their cast albums and simply hired a record company to produce them. "Most producers don't understand how record labels work," he said.
Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters and the lead producer of "The Producers," acknowledges this. "Of course we don't understand the record business," he said. "We're theater producers. Unfortunately, original-cast albums have never made producers any money. Their sole value is as P.R."
That's the point, said Mr. Deutsch. "They need that album to market their show, and they don't want to pay for making it. Well, they should. If you're going to raise $12 million for a Broadway musical, what's another $300,000 for the record? The reason Sony has an entertainment division to begin with is so they can sell their electronics. Why shouldn't Broadway producers do the same thing for their product?"
Mr. Landesman conceded that the question was a good one. "It's something we should look at," he said. But for the moment, all that is clear to those up and down the musical theater food chain -- producers, composers, performers and especially recording company executives -- is that a new age for original-cast albums must be dawning because the golden age is definitely gone.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/86th Street Between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues; 
A Regal West Side Block Regains a Bit of Its Glory

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
IN 1890, 86th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues was advertised as "that queen of all West Side streets," but by the middle of the 20th century its private-house legacy had unraveled. In the last two decades, however, incremental improvements have recaptured a fragmentary sense of what the block must have meant to its original planner, the architect and yacht designer John G. Prague. 
 Development on most Upper West Side streets proceeded in small chunks, but in the late 1880's Prague, working with the investors D. Willis James and T. E. D. Power, covered most of the north and south sides of 86th from Columbus to Amsterdam, as well as adjacent and nearby blocks, with 232 buildings. There are fewer than a dozen of these houses left on 86th Street, including a group of four at Nos. 123, 125, 127 and 129. 
 Prague, born in New Orleans, became active in New York in the 1870's, achieving enough success to enjoy himself offshore. In 1887 The Real Estate Record and Guide noted that as "the genial owner of the Anaconda," Prague "is as well known among yachtsmen as he is in his profession." 
"He is not only a good yachtsman," the periodical said, "but he is reported to be a good designer, the lines of his yacht having been drawn by his own pencil." 
In the same year The Record and Guide reported on the beginning of what it called "an important experiment in residential architecture," Prague's comprehensive development centered on West 86th. Prague emphasized architectural unity, with houses in the same generic Renaissance style but with slightly varying roof lines, windows and materials. The Record and Guide noted that they had all been built "from full-sized drawings in Mr. Prague's office," compared with the slapdash sketches prepared by some speculative builders. 
In 1890 Scientific American described the typical Prague house: 11-foot ceilings, an electric bell system supplemented by speaking tubes, and a ground floor with a kitchen in the rear and a billiard room and a fireplace in front. On the main floor were a hall and a foyer trimmed with oak (with a built-in hat tree), a mahogany parlor, and a dining room finished in "old English style" with a built-in buffet and a fireplace in Mexican onyx. On the second to fourth floors were a library and four bedrooms.
Bathrooms were paved and wainscoted with Italian marble. The houses were projected to sell for $36,000 each. 
An early advertisement in The New York Times for the house at 120 West 86th called the block "that queen of all West Side streets"; the house was available for rent at $2,400 a year.
The first occupants of the West 86th Street houses included William M. Ivins, at 123 West 86th, a lawyer active in civic affairs who ran for mayor in 1905; Leopold Peck, at No. 125, a member of the piano firm Hardman Peck; and Prague himself, at No. 103. 
They were temporarily disturbed in their idyll in 1894, when a streetcar company that operated lines on East 86th and far West 86th sought permission to connect them. Prague and others led a successful protest -- photographs from the 1920's and 30's show no tracks. 
The queenly character of West 86th Street began to decline after 1910. Growing traffic was a factor, as was the arrival of tall apartment houses, like the new 120 West 86th Street. Built in 1911, it was the first of the towering buildings that began to force many householders to retreat to the narrower side streets. But some private homes remained. Four doctors moved in to the four houses at 123-129 West 86th, and in 1921 Dr. Harry Finkelstein, who owned the old Ivins house at No. 123, had the architect M. Joseph Harrison alter the lower facade in the Norman style, with leaded glass windows. 
The next year Dr. Henry C. Falk had the architect Herbert Lippmann remove the old stoop of his house at No. 129 in a modern-style alteration. The 1925 census found the Falks at the house: the doctor, 36, born in Hungary but in the United States since age 2; his wife, Mildred; their 1-year-old daughter, Sally; and three servants: a Norwegian-born nurse and a German-born butler and cook, all of whom had been in the United States for one year.
Change continued. Prague died in 1915, and the 1925 census showed that his former home at No. 103 was a rooming house run by the Russian-born Esther Cedof, 40, who had 19 roomers. As apartment houses gobbled up the old row houses by the twos and threes, the survivors lost their stoops and received careless attention, gradually acquiring the indifferent sheen that often comes with absentee ownership. All were ultimately converted into apartments. 
A resident of 127 West 86th, who was living in that row house when it became a co-op in the mid-70's, recalled that her building was one of the first on the block to emerge from architectural obscurity. About 15 years ago, she said, the co-op redid the front, cleaning the orange, iron-spot brick and painting the stonework an adobe color.
ACROSS the street, the longtime West Side investor Marcus Retter is having the flaking brownstone chipped off the building he owns at 102 West 86th Street. Although 40 years ago people did not pay much attention to the exterior of an old building, "now you have to improve not just the inside but also the outside," said Mr. Retter, who also owns the Brockholst, an apartment building at 85th and Columbus designed by Prague in 1889.
In the 1990's, Mr. Retter did a complete exterior restoration of the small corner apartment house at 100 West 86th, at Columbus, also a Prague building. He said that market rents are now from $4,000 to $5,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.
Keith Eisenstark bought the old Peck house at 125 West 86th in 1995, retaining the eight-apartment division. "It would be lovely to bring it back to a single-family residence," he said, "but it's not economically practical." He said that the broad, apartment-lined 86th Street is far from a classic brownstone block. It's "a little too busy," he said, "but it is incredibly convenient." 
Residents say that the wide street and the doormen buildings contribute to a sense of safety. Mr. Eisenstark has one of the most intact of the Prague interiors, with unusual touches: flooring of end-grain wooden blocks, a bowed landing with a seat on the oak stairway, a dining room with an original buffet (with drawers, cupboards, glass cases and a beveled mirror) perhaps 20 feet long. The dining room fireplace has little bric-a-brac display cases that have their original tiny curtain rods.
Perhaps the most bedraggled building on the block is now 129 West 86th, whose owner asked not to be named. The door is scuffed and the facade is shabby, but it turns out to have been reconverted to a private house since its purchase in 1999. Modern lighting and nice shades are visible from the street.
But as for outside restoration, the owner said it would have to wait "until we can afford it."

HEADLINE: Down the Rabbit Hole Of the State's Gun Law 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER; Paul Zielbauer is the Hartford bureau chief for The New York Times.

 BODY:
"LET'S talk about the use of deadly force," Lenny Smittner Jr., the N.R.A.-certified instructor, said, leaning on a cinder-block wall pocked with 22-caliber bullet holes. "You're looking to maim or kill, there's no good way to say it."
 It was well before 9 a.m. on a groggy November morning, and Lenny suddenly had our full attention. Six of us -- strangers ranging in age from college undergraduate to gray-haired retiree -- had gathered in a musty backroom at the Blue Trail Range in Wallingford to learn how to safely handle a gun, not maim or kill. 
 But in a way I had no choice. If you wanted to own a gun in Connecticut, like I did, you had to start the process by passing a safety class certified by the National Rifle Association. 
Actually, I didn't want to own a gun as much as I wanted to figure out how ordinary, law-minding Nutmeggers went about getting one -- legally. Did you need to have a reason to own one? Is there a limit to how many you can own? Could you carry it on your belt? 
My curiosity peaked two years ago, after writing a few articles about gun control. I had listened to the pro- and anti-gun lobbies, each offering equally unconvincing arguments for why a handgun was either hideous or helpful, American or un-American, an evil machine or an inalienable right. 
The only way to have a truly informed opinion about guns, it seemed, was to get to know one, and the laws that govern its use, firsthand. 
My odyssey in search of a handgun permit played out in late 2000 and into the spring of 2001. I quickly learned that the state application process is often governed unfairly, and illegally, in the cities and towns where it begins.
Since my five-month ordeal, handguns have become vastly more popular in Connecticut, primarily in response to last year's terrorist attacks. 
The State Police issued 3,862 new handgun permits in the first six months of this year, for instance, more than double the amount in the first half of 2001. (Shotguns and rifles do not require permits to buy or carry.) More registered gun owners are also renewing their pistol permits since Sept. 11.
"9/11 definitely changed the way Americans live," said State Police Lt. Robert C. Kiehm, who administers Connecticut's handgun permit process. 
Connecticut law designates local police departments, or first selectmen's offices in towns without a police force, as the place where residents must first submit a gun-permit application before it is considered by the State Police. 
Because local police officials tend to favor fewer guns in the community rather than more, they often amend the state's two-page application with extra forms, rules and requirements of their own. The extra paperwork makes the process more intimidating and tends to weed out the unknowing or less persistent. And, according to the State Board of Firearms Permit Examiners, it is also against the spirit and letter of state law.
My application was rejected, in January 2000, in a letter signed by Chief Melvin H. Wearing of New Haven, because it did not contain three letters of reference that are not required by state law.
The green state application, in fact, succinctly asks only for an applicant's name, address, phone number, date and place of birth, weight and height, Social Security and driver's license numbers and employer's name and phone number. It also asks for proof of completion of a gun-safety course and six Yes/No questions about the applicant's medical and criminal history, to eliminate anyone with mental illness or a prison record from the process. And that's all.
In New Haven, however, the state form is stuffed with extra forms. When I applied in November 2000, these forms demanded a copy of a birth certificate or green card and "paperwork indicating your present address."
Another form asked for my notarized signature allowing the police department to look into my medical, psychiatric and employment records, credit history and school records, as well as any criminal, misdemeanor or traffic violations in my past.
I was never a gun person. Aside from the compressed-air variety, I had never fired one and did not believe I needed one to feel safe. But now that I had been rejected, I felt aggrieved. Darn it, I wanted, and deserved, a gun permit.
I submitted my application without signing the extra forms, and within weeks received a letter that the police had rejected it. Two weeks later I appealed the decision to the Board of Firearms Permit Examiners, which arbitrates disputes over the law.
Philip Dukes, the board's chairman, said changes the Legislature made to the permit process last year that gave State Police more control has cut down on the number of illegitimate rejections by local authorities. 
New Haven, however, is still well-known for larding applications with its own rules. In Middletown, the police demand three letters of reference from other Middletown residents only. And in Hamden, one former police chief was known to reject all applicants outright.
"There is no power that I have that prevents the cities and towns from doing these things," Mr. Dukes said in an interview last week. "They could ask you to do jumping jacks as a basis for granting your permit."
The board does overrule, and sometimes reprimand, local officials, he added, but "there are only so many times that we can go through the process and tell them that they can't do that."
In a country where state gun-permit laws vary enormously, Connecticut, despite problems at the local level, has a reputation for running one of the most organized, efficient and fair handgun-permit systems in the nation.
This is a "shall issue" state, meaning that state law recognizes citizens' inherent rights to a pistol permit, no reason necessary, provided they meet certain legal standards. In "may-issue" states, like New York and New Jersey, the law does not recognize an individual right to own handguns; residents must prove they deserve or need one. 
The state application procedure changed on Oct. 1, 2001, after my permit process was complete.
The process still begins with the local police chief or first selectman, who screen applications and submit the applicant's fingerprints to the FBI. If approved, the applicant is given a temporary 60-day state permit.. But whereas the old process left locally rejected applicants no alternative but to appeal to the state board, last year's changes require local officials to pass on an application, rejected or approved, to the State Police firearms unit in Middletown. There, it is run through national crime databases and reviewed by specialists who generally do not tolerate rejections from local police officials who added their own requirements to the process.
When the state review is complete, the applicant is either given a five-year permit or rejected, with the right to appeal to the Board of Firearms Permit Examiners and, thereafter, to State Superior Court. 
The total cost currently is $55, but can change slightly, depending on how much the Federal Bureau of Investigation charges for its services.
In the Blue Trail Range's bathroom, the man next to me removed his ear protectors and launched into how his new gun was "kicking like a mule." 
My gun-safety class had taken a short break, and now I found myself entering a conversation about firearms with a guy who looked as if he'd been born clutching an ammunition belt. 
"What are you shooting?" I asked ruggedly.
".340 Weatherby magnum," he exhaled. Uable to respond intelligently, I simply blurted, "Have fun with the Weatherby, sounds like a fun gun," and left. Months later, I discovered that a .340 Weatherby magnum is not a gun, but a three-inch-long Elk cartridge.
"If you don't know how to use your gun," said Lenny, back in the classroom, "you shouldn't have it."
Around 9:30 a.m., as the range outside begins to fill up with target shooters and their spectacularly loud guns, Lenny flipped on a gun-safety videotape from the mid-1970's. He then passed around a few handguns, open and empty, for the six of us to inspect. Handguns, I noted, were heavier than they looked.
"A lot of people look at the N.R.A. as a troublesome organization that wants to arm everyone in the country," said Lenny, a former Air Force aircraft instrument mechanic and retired SNET warehouse worker whose father was a Winchester factory worker. 
"Not so. If it wasn't for their lobbying," he went on, holding up a finger, "we wouldn't be here today."
Each of us in the class seemed to be there for a different reason. 
Krishan Soni, a friendly economics and biology major at Yale University at the time, said he already owned a rifle and intended to get a handgun permit. Besides Lenny, he was the only one in the room who allowed me to take his full name. Frank and Chris, two buddies in their mid-20's told me they signed up just to find out if firing a gun was as cool as it looked. Joe, a middle-aged guy in a red flannel shirt and work boots, and Edward, an older man in glasses and sports jacket, declined to talk to me.
By the end of the five-hour class, we had learned the do's and don'ts of handgun safety, the four fundamentals of aiming -- sight alignment, breath control, trigger position and follow through -- and gotten an instructive lecture on Connecticut gun laws from Arthur C. Carr, a former member of the All-Army pistol team who sits on the state firearms board to which I would later file my appeal.
It was Mr. Carr who warned the class that many police departments may improperly lard the state permit application with requests for things like letters of reference ("They're utterly foolish," he said) and permission to review medical and employment history ("a gross violation of your rights to privacy").
"Some issuing authorities," he concluded, as gun blasts outside made it hard to hear, "just don't like issuing permits."
The day ended out on the outdoor range, where each of us got to fire three revolvers -- a .44 magnum, the stainless steel hand cannon of Dirty Harry fame, as well as a used .357 and its weaker cousin, the .38 Special -- and two clip-loaded semiautomatic pistols -- a clunky .45 caliber that roared when fired, and a milder 9 millimeter, which is popular with many police departments. 
Afterward, I quizzed my classmates about which firearm they most liked.
Christian, the Yale student, liked the semiautomatics more than the revolvers. Joe, in the red flannel shirt, was smitten by the .45. "I liked how it feels in my hand," he said. Frank and Chris were hugely impressed by the .44 magnum's brute force -- its bullets were like Lincoln Logs -- but "the 9 millimeter is much more of a cool gun," Frank said. 
During target practice, Edward, seemed magnetically attached to the silvery .44, which he handled sloppily. The rest of us instinctively back away whenever he took aim. 
On April 12, 2001, in a small room on the second floor of State Police headquarters, the six-member Board of Firearms Permit Examiners took up case 092-01. My appeal of New Haven's rejection of my gun permit application was finally getting its day in court.
The board, which included a municipal police chief, a lawyer, a state trooper and Mr. Carr -- gave two New Haven Police detectives 20 minutes to present their reasons for rejecting me. Det. Frank Murphy did all the talking.
"Our reason for the refusal is strictly based on Mr. Zielbauer's adamant and -- I'm trying to think of the right adjective that I want to use -- refusal to provide letters of reference," he told the board.
Noting that I had lived in Connecticut for only 14 months, he added, "We conducted a quasi-background investigation as best we were able to and could not locate anybody that professed any sort of knowledge of Mr. Zielbauer."
He also lamented my unwillingness "to provide us with materials that helped us in assessing his background and his character and his suitability." But, perhaps sensing his own wobbly legal argument, he admitted, "Is he statutorily required to do so by you people? No."
The board seemed dubious. One member, John S. Karangekis, the Weathersfield police chief, asked Detective Murphy if he had bothered to call my employer, which is listed on the application, or look up my previous addresses in New York.
"No," the detective said.
Later, after I'd presented my side of the story, Peter Kuck, the board's secretary, grilled Detective Murphy. 
"What you're telling this board is that the sole reason you rejected this applicant is because he wouldn't furnish you with three letters of reference, is that correct?" Mr. Kuck asked. "That's the sole reason?" 
Yes, the detective said. "This has not been an issue before today," Detective Murphy said. "I imagine it will be an issue after today." 
He was right, sort of: Since my hearing, the department eliminated letters of reference from its list of extraordinary requirements (though its Web page instructions still ask for them), but still demands to review an applicant's medical, employment and credit history.
Detective Murphy referred calls about the police department's application process to a spokesman for Chief Wearing, who declined to comment. But Mr. Duke, the board chairman, said departments like New Haven's add extra rules because of concern "that somebody who causes trouble is going to walk away with a permit."
Fifteen days after my hearing, I received a copy of a letter Mr. Kuck sent to Chief Wearing in New Haven informing him that the board had voted unanimously to order him to issue me a permit. On May 1, 2001, I had a license to carry a handgun in Connecticut.
That summer, I bought a Sig Sauer .380 semiautomatic pistol from Hoffman's Gun Center ("Guns for the good guys") in Newington, a medium-sized handgun that won't kill a bear, but has enough power to punch through a cardboard target at 25 yards. 
I still don't know which side of the gun debate is right, though as a gun owner I have more respect for each side's arguments. Part of me agrees with the anti-gun people who say I will probably never need to use my gun and, therefore, why bother? But I also understand, firsthand, that the great majority of legal gun owners are responsible people who treat their weapons with respect and care, and why punish them for following the law? 
I suppose my Sig Sauer was not an answer I'd hoped for, but I guess I'm a little like Joe in the red flannel shirt: I like how it feels in my hand.

HEADLINE: Numbers Mess at the Nassau Police Dept. 

BYLINE:  By SHELLY FEUER DOMASH 

 BODY:
THIS much is certain: crimes do happen in Nassau County. But nobody can agree on how many crimes there are or whether the trend is up or down -- no small matter when the county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, and the police unions are in a bitter debate over whether public safety would be threatened by force reductions demanded by Mr. Suozzi.
 The tallies of crimes committed in the county in recent years vary widely depending on which agency is doing the reporting. The office of the Nassau County district attorney, the state Department of Criminal Justice and the Nassau County Police Department have all issued divergent statistics for major crimes in the county. The Police Department cannot even agree with itself, releasing three different reports showing three different sets of numbers for major crime categories. 
 In almost every case for 1999 and 2000, the last years for which complete statistics are available, the major crime totals that were officially reported to the state and federal agencies by the Police Department were lower than those tallied in the department's computer. The lower totals were then used by the outside agencies to compare Nassau's crime rate, arrests and other crime trends with those in other localities. 
Rick Hinshaw, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said his department got all its annual crime statistics from the Nassau Police Department. "What we have is what they gave us," he said. But the district attorney's figures do not match any of those released by the Police Department.
Statistics from the state Department of Criminal Justice, which also gets its figures from the Nassau police, come closer to the district attorney's numbers but also vary significantly from those released by the Police Department.
For example, the Police Department recorded 155 rapes in 1999 and only 136 in 2000, but the rape tallies it reported to the district attorney's office rose from 106 to 135 in the same period, while the number of rapes reported to the state Department of Criminal Justice Services fell from 116 in 1999 to 95 in 2000. According to the Police Department, assaults fell from 1,544 in 1999 to 1,514 in 2000, but the state statistics show a rise from 1,165 in 1999 to 1,171 in 2000, while the district attorney reports a decline of 1,175 in 1999 to 1,126 in 2000.
So, which numbers are correct, is crime up or down in the county, and how does it compare with crime in other municipalities in the state and nation?
No one seems to know. But, according to the police chief, Raymond Crawford, it really doesn't matter.
"The statistical part is of interest, but it is not crucial to policing," he said. Of the divergent numbers, he said, "That is a regrettable situation, but is one that to correct would have us chasing our tails for purposes of statistics that are often only a barometer or guide, not the primary function and purpose of policing.
"Everybody that gets victimized by a crime gets a police response, which is more important than statistical counting at the end of the year," Chief Crawford said.
Eli Silverman, a professor of police studies at John Jay College and author of a book on police statistics, disagreed.
"We had once assumed that police departments had little control over crime and that social and economic factors had a greater impact," Dr. Silverman said. "In the last few years there has been more recognition that police can control crime, so we are measuring police statistics more and more for their crime rates. To that extent they are more and more accountable for statistical analysis."
Gary DelaRaba, president of the police patrolmen's union, also challenged Chief Crawford's assessment. "It's absolutely ridiculous for someone in authority to say that statistics don't matter," Officer DelaRaba said.
The union president also accused "the police hierarchy" of altering numbers so political leaders could point to statistics showing a drop in crime. "We've known for years that they have skewed the numbers to make the politicians look good," Officer DelaRaba said.
For example, he said, if numerous crimes were committed at one scene, the police officer's on-the-scene report would be altered by higher-ups in the final report to reflect only one crime. "If a number of felonies were committed, they would report only one felony," Officer DelaRaba said. "If there were a burglary and an assault, they would report only the burglary."
Inspector Pete Matuza, a spokesman for the department, said the reports were not being manipulated, but that the reporting system was different. For example, if three major felonies, like a murder, a robbery and a rape, are committed at one scene, only the murder, which is the most serious charge, is reported to the state. Inspector Matuza said this reporting system had been used for more than 20 years.
Mr. Hinshaw of the district attorney's office said, "We have not seen anything here in Nassau County that caused us concern about any pattern or systemic altering of crime classifications designed to skew crime statistics."
The variations in statistics in Nassau County cover the major or index crimes, including homicide, robbery, rape, assault, burglary, larceny and car theft. To chart these numbers, the Police Department uses two computer programs; one, called Swift Justice, tracks crimes from the time they are reported, and the other compiles crime numbers that are then reported to state and federal agencies. A patrol division activity report, which is generated from the Swift Justice system, is also used for police supervisors, but yields different statistics.
In 1999, for example, the Swift Justice system reported 1,077 assaults within the county's jurisdiction -- excluding cities and villages that have their own police forces -- while the department's state reporting system computer totaled only 616. The following year, the Swift Justice system reported 1,076 assaults, while the state reporting computer reported 653. In 1999, the Swift Justice computer reported 111 rapes within the county's police jurisdiction while the state reporting computer totaled only 83.
"It is obviously a reporting error, which makes it a byproduct of a flawed system, but not a premeditated, intentional misrepresentation of crime," Chief Crawford said. "If someone had brought it to my attention I would probably have said, 'let's find out why that difference is.' "
But Inspector Matuza said the department had been aware of problems with the Swift Justice system since 1998. "We had a horrendous time," he said. "It was a learning process with this system. No system is foolproof. It has gone through a number of modifications and has been worked on since 1998 when we realized it was not as accurate as we wanted it to be."
But by all indications, the problems continued in the system and the statistics continued to vary between reports. 
Chief Crawford said one possible reason for the variation in numbers was that detectives were not reclassifying crimes in the computers after their investigations. "The real-time report can say an assault or robbery," he said, "but three weeks later it can be a different crime or maybe no crime, and we don't always go back and rectify the reports that are driven by that initial report."
But Detective Robert Howell, president of the detectives' union, said he was never advised of that problem, adding, "It has the appearance of a cop-out to me."
Detective Thomas Willdigg, who has worked as a detective for 22 years, said it was not up to the detectives to make a final determination as to how or if a case should be reclassified. He said after the report of a crime was taken it was forwarded to the desk officer at the precinct who puts it into the computer and assigns it to a detective.
"The detective then investigates, fixes any problems and checks the classification of the case," said Detective Willdigg, who asked that he be identified as speaking as a representative of the union to protect himself against reprisals. "He then must submit it to a detective supervisor who reviews it for completion, checks the classification and makes comments. If it is complete he signs off on it. If not he might send it back. It is a very simple process. That is why we have bosses."
Chief Crawford said the county had recently turned to another means of keeping statistics called Nass-Stat, which is similar to a system adopted in New York City in 1994.
The new Nassau police commissioner, James Lawrence, is a former New York City police official and a strong advocate of Nass-Stat. But he declined to comment on the new system and withdrew an invitation, extended by Chief Crawford, to allow a reporter to attend the monthly meeting where precinct commanders review the Nass-Stat figures and make decisions on how to allocate their officers. 
Chief Crawford said the new system would be more reliable and would produce "timely and accurate information that we put in ourselves in order to strategize, analyze and do policing that has results."
Several people familiar with the new system praised it but warned that it can be used to embarrass police supervisors in areas of high or increasing crime.
"There is an appropriate way to make people accountable and an inappropriate way to make people accountable," Dr. Silverman said. "But they do need to be made accountable."
He was especially concerned that crime reporting statistics could be abused in the contentious atmosphere surrounding the police unions in Nassau. "In situations like that there is a great potential for misuse," Dr. Silverman said.
Lt. Gary Learned, president of the superior officers association, which represents Nassau patrol officers with the rank of sergeant or above, said he is also concerned about the effect it might have on his officers. He also questioned the need for the system in Nassau County.
"My gut feeling is we don't need it because we are a smaller county and well organized at the precinct level," Lieutenant Learned said. "The residents give us the feedback as to where crime patterns are. They are very quick to report crimes in our county. I wonder if the effort we are putting into it could be better used someplace else."
Officer DeLaraba, the patrolmen's union president, said: "The person who really knows the issues is the guy in the patrol car. He drives the sector day in and day out and he knows it better than any politician or any computer or any chief sitting behind their desk pontificating on how we should do our job. A few years ago these people knocked CompStat as being nothing more than a high-tech computer designed to give the people an appearance of what is going on. It gives nothing but a high-anxiety, stressful position for a commander to be put in. It doesn't give them resources to solve the problem, but still expects the problem to be solved. It will kill careers, unless you are the fair-haired boy."
"If there is a demoralized upper echelon, it will flow down to my members," Officer DelaRaba said. "If they are demoralized, we will be demoralized."
"A computer can't tell us where to be to prevent crime," Officer DelaRaba said. 
Dr. Silverman disagreed, saying that with programs such as Nass-Stat, "we know much quicker whether a pattern shifts, and if we see the pattern shifting we can anticipate changes. You respond to the shifts and anticipate the shifts better. It reduces the margin of error."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
Influx of Drug and Biotech Firms Is Seen Continuing

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
THERE is a rule of thumb about marketing commercial real estate that goes something like this: attract one tenant and more will come, which will attract more.
 For New Jersey's pharmaceutical-biotechnology industry, the notion certainly seems to hold true. Although drug and biotech companies have been moving to New Jersey for more than a decade, the influx of the last several years has bolstered their presence to the point that the state can be promoted, in the words of a state development official, as "the nation's medicine chest." 
 That type of marketing will enhance the state's attractiveness even more with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, real estate experts say, because many companies want to be in the recognized center of the industry. 
Nineteen of the world's largest pharmaceutical and medical technology companies have national or worldwide headquarters in New Jersey, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Company, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia and Schering-Plough. 
In 2000, companies based in New Jersey generated 41 percent of pharmaceutical sales worldwide. Last year, 53 percent of the drugs receiving Food and Drug Administration approval were produced by New Jersey companies. 
In addition, 11 percent of all government research and development dollars on subjects of every sort were spent in New Jersey and 25 percent of all private funds, according to the New Jersey Technology Council, a public-private development association.
A few major drug companies have had poor earnings reports recently, noted Joseph R. Romano of Advance Realty Group. But, he said, "Even with that, deals continue to be made." 
"Pharmaceuticals are still in a period of expansion here," Mr. Romano said.
Another broker, John K. Cunningham of GVA Williams, agreed and predicted that the biotech industry would have the kind of rapid surge in growth that pharmaceutical companies did in the last few years.
"The Rutgers to Princeton corridor has historically provided a home for research and development," Mr. Cunningham said. "A large number of start-up companies are locating there. Do they all make it? No, but a very large number do." 
In past years much of the commercial real estate action in New Jersey revolved around the telecommunications business, Mr. Romano said, but that has changed. "As the telecom industry fell into disarray," he said, "the pharmaceutical industry has sort of taken over as the driving force for the economy."
Mr. Romano said he saw the sale of AT&T's headquarters in Basking Ridge to Pharmacia as symbolic of the shift. Perhaps, Mr. Romano suggested with a bit of whimsy, the statue officially known as the Spirit of Communication, but more familiarly as Golden Boy, showing Mercury clasping bolts of electricity that will be moving with AT&T to its new, and smaller, quarters in Bedminster should be replaced by Pharmacia with a statue of a double helix. 
Some pharmaceutical companies based in New Jersey have been expanding office and laboratory space. Right now, GlaxoSmithKline is redeveloping its property on Route 202 in Parsippany to double the size of its research and development facility there.
And companies continue to move in. 
Last month, Advance Realty signed a deal with Altana Pharma, a German drug maker that is opening its United States headquarters in Florham Park. Altana will move into 37,000 square feet of a 55,000-square-foot building at Park Place, a four-building campus, where a total of 350,000 square feet is available. Advance recently completed multimillion-dollar renovations at Park Place, which had previously been the headquarters of ExxonMobil International.
Altana's president, George Cole, said the company hoped to fill the entire building eventually.
W HEN we first met with Altana," said Jeffrey J. Garibaldi, president of the Garibaldi Group, Altana's broker for the deal, "they had already worked with a location consultant and decided that New Jersey was where they wanted to be.
"When you look at U.S. real estate," Mr. Garibaldi said, "and the various aspects of what pharmaceutical and biotech firms want, New Jersey keeps on rising to the top. It has the labor pool, especially northern New Jersey. It has the research facilities, the major university resources, the proximity to New York financial institutions, the central location at the heart of the one of the biggest consumer markets." 
Mr. Garibaldi said he thought the most important factor for Altana was that "they wanted to be with the big dogs."
Using a bit more formal phraseology, Mr. Cole confirmed the point. "We made the strategic decision to join the ranks of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies in New Jersey," he said. "We selected the Park Place campus based on its location in the heart of one of the largest concentrations of pharmaceutical companies in the world."
The Park Place campus is near downtown Morristown, in an area with numerous hotels, restaurants and other amenities. It is near Routes 24 and 287, which have access to three Interstate highways and is across from Morristown Airport, 15 miles from Newark International Airport, and 20 miles from the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels into Manhattan.
The headquarters of Automatic Data Processing, Atlantic Mutual, Honeywell International, Maersk, Novartis, Schering-Plough, Pfizer and Wyeth are within a few miles.
Mr. Cole said that Altana would be recruiting employees for its specialty pharmaceuticals division and for a a division that would be set up to market products emerging from research.
"We will need to hire a lot of experienced people," he said. "We began interviewing people a couple of years ago when considering whether to expand the office we have on Long Island. It turned out that most of the people we interviewed lived in New Jersey and did not want to relocate to Long Island."
Mr. Cole said his company also considered North Carolina, New England and the West Coast.
Altana will be the first tenants at the refurbished Park Place. Advance acquired the property two years ago, stripped all four buildings down to bare steel and renovated them to reposition the property as Class A space.
Earlier this year, before Advance had space to show, Novartis leased 160,000 square feet at a building owned by the Rockefeller Group less than a half-mile away in Florham Park. Novartis also leased two large offices in Parsippany.
Some brokers have begun focusing on biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies when they are marketing available space.
Stan Danzig, executive director of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey, who is marketing the former Carter Wallace consumer products division campus in Cranbury, said he is not ruling out any type of potential tenants, but he is actively reaching out to drug and biotech companies.
In a recent statement, Mr. Danzig touted the Carter Wallace property as "a rare mixed-use acquisition opportunity in the state's thriving Exit 8A market, ideally suited for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer products operations."
"It includes 750,000 square feet of facilities for laboratory, office, manufacturing or warehouse usage," the statement said.
Mr. Cunningham of GVA Williams, who is marketing Pharmacia's current offices in Peapack, Bedminster and Bridgewater, said he was not actively seeking to put another drug company into the offices, "but naturally, it would make sense." he added, "We can certainly speak to any pharmaceutical-biotech company about what might make it a natural fit." 
Mr. Romano said that in the wake of Altana's decision to move to Park Place, "we expect demand for the remaining space to increase significantly."
"You get one quality tenant," he said, "and that attracts more."

HEADLINE: Squaring Off Over Energy 

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

 BODY:
CLOSE down Indian Point, one side says, and we will be faced with a grim electric future of soaring energy prices and flickering lights, with brownouts and blackouts part of the fabric of daily life. Categorically false, says the other side, with claims of their own: that Indian Point is superfluous and could be shuttered with little effect on energy supply or cost.
 For years before Sept. 11, the debate over Indian Point, the nuclear power plant that sits on the bank of the Hudson in Buchanan, was waged mainly by environmentalists who argued over disposal of spent fuel and other issues that the general public took little interest in. 
 After the terrorist attacks, Indian Point became the subject of much wider concern, with discussion focusing on security. The nation has 103 commercial nuclear power plants in operation, but Indian Point, which is 30 miles upriver from the George Washington Bridge, is the one nearest the most people: more than 20 million people live within 50 miles of it. With diagrams of American nuclear power plants uncovered in Al Qaeda safe houses and caves, everyone from television pundits to the local P.T.A.'s now debate the safety issues: from the effectiveness of potassium iodide pills as a guard against thyroid cancer to whether, in the event of sabotage, Westchester residents would be trapped in a radioactive plume or are adequately prepared to escape. 
This spring the debate turned to other practicalities. Studies commissioned by each side, which contradict each other, address the question of whether the 2,000 megawatts produced by Indian Point -- enough to power approximately two million homes -- were needed. Was Indian Point a key contributor to the area's power grid or could it be rendered unnecessary by conservation measures and alternative energy sources? 
Indian Point's owner, Entergy Corporation, released a study in April that had been written by two independent research groups, General Electric Power Systems Energy Consulting and National Economic Research Associates. The study made the case -- not surprisingly -- that keeping Indian Point open was vital to the area's energy reliability, reserve margins and basic costs of what people would pay to light and cool their homes and toast bread. 
In May, Riverkeeper, which is best known as an environmental group advocating for cleanup of the Hudson River but which has recently taken an active role in calling for the shutdown of Indian Point, along with the Pace Law School Energy Project, released not one but two studies. Those studies said that decommissioning Indian Point would not dent energy supply or cost. 
Middle ground? There seems to be none. 
Whether Indian Point should remain in operation has been a heated populist debate, discussed loudly on a grassroots level, and the studies -- from each side -- were commissioned to keep grassroots momentum rolling. 
Alex Matthiessen, Riverkeeper's executive director, said that his group's studies were commissioned to persuade the public -- and politicians -- that "they needn't worry about life without Indian Point."
"The idea behind the reports -- the essential part of the campaign -- is to build that intellectual capital," Mr. Matthiessen said.
Together, the Riverkeeper studies cost $15,000 and several months to produce. Riverkeeper is trying to raise money to produce yet another report, this one focusing solely on the energy price implications of shutting down Indian Point and also to gather what the group says will be an independent panel of experts to provide a road map to deal with the tax, employment and energy effects of closing the plant. 
State Assemblywoman Sandra R. Galef, who represents the 90th Assembly District, which includes Buchanan, said the forum of studies, no matter how contradictory, was a good one for this issue. "You just can't have a public meeting on Indian Point," Mrs. Galef said. "Everyone just yells at each other." 
But Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, whose district sits to the south of Indian Point, disagrees. Mr. Brodsky, who opposed the plant for many years, said that the pro-Indian Point study so thoroughly failed to consider the government's cost of securing Indian Point and cleaning up in the event of a catastrophic leak that, rather than being productive, "the duel of competing studies is, in substance, a false duel." 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which gives Indian Point 2 its highest level of scrutiny, currently has a team inspecting the plant and is scheduled to release its findings in late August. 
"There were problems even before the February 2000 leak," said Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the commission, "but that brought to light other problems that were festering at the plant." Indian Point 3, which has a better safety record, receives less oversight by the commission. 
For its part, the Entergy study spells out in detail its take on the consequences of taking Indian Point offline. It says that if the two operating plants, Indian Point 2 and 3, were permanently shut down, consumers would be out $3 billion over the next three years. At the same time, the study said, energy reliability would decrease by a factor of five, with reserve margins cut almost in half. The number of days emergency operation procedures would be required would quintuple, it said, causing a severe impact on the reliability of the area's basic energy. 
The report also brings up the prospect that if opponents have their way and Indian Point is shut, next might be the closure of 23 other nuclear units, in which case energy costs would increase by $10 billion in the same three-year period. Under those circumstances, the study says, New York "would not be able to meet expected peak requirements." 
The studies released by Riverkeeper and the Pace Law School Energy Project accuse the Entergy study of pulling facts out of thin air to understate potential supply and inflate future demand. 
"The only argument Entergy thought it could use to fool the public into supporting the plant is the notion that we can not survive without Indian Point's power," Mr. Matthiessen said. 
One of the Riverkeeper/Pace Law School Energy Project reports was written by the Synapse Energy Economics, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. Synapse called the Entergy report incorrect and biased and largely dependent upon "unreasonable assumptions" that pay little mind to basic facts. 
Synapse refers to the New York Independent Systems Operator, a nonprofit organization established and regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That organization projected that in this summer there would be a 14.3 percent reserve margin, a figure calculated by dividing capacity by projected demand. Entergy's reserve margin forecast is 8.4 percent. 
Synapse's claim: "By inflating projected peak demands, the Entergy study artificially reduces the forecast system reserve margins." 
Entergy, Synapse said, exaggerates demand by ignoring the loss of the World Trade Center load, the impact of the recession on energy demand and the transfer of energy load from the New York control area to the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland system. 
All these "important developments," Synapse said, were ignored by the Entergy study. 
On the supply side, Synapse said that the Entergy study does not acknowledge all existing capacity and overlooks a new plant that New York State has approved to come online. The plant, the Bethlehem Energy Center Repowering Project, is scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2004. 
Synapse also dismisses a set of projections made by the Entergy report, which assume that two dozen additional nuclear plants would be decommissioned in the wake of an Indian Point closing. But any analysis centered upon wholesale closing of nuclear plants around the state because Indian Point is taken offline is wrongheaded, Synapse concluded, saying: "It is not realistic to assume that any other plants would be retired if Indian Point was closed." 
THE second report released by Riverkeeper and Pace Law School Entergy Project was prepared by Charles Komanoff, an independent energy consultant in Manhattan. Mr. Komanoff said that Indian Point could be closed without impairing the reliability or cost of the power supply. This can be done, he said, by replicating the legislation, policy and behaviors that helped California cut peak demand by 10 percent during its energy crisis last summer.
The Komanoff study indicates that "a California-type program of electricity conservation could permit the Indian Point nuclear station to be shut as early as this summer without impairing the reliability of power supply in New York City and the downstate New York region." 
In addition to public awareness of the need for conservation, Mr. Komanoff proposes that the loss of Indian Point energy could be recouped by charging large customers more in peak periods to keep them from using so much energy. He also contends consumer rebates for energy reduction and the purchase of energy efficient appliances could help make up the difference, as well as basic day-to-day conservation by consumers and businesses. In California, that meant turning off lights, turning down air-conditioners and limiting time in the hot tub. 
Based on California's results, Mr. Komanoff offers a range of power savings that he says can be achieved in New York this summer. Under the best-case scenario, enough energy can be conserved to overcompensate for Indian Point's shutdown. Not only would the energy that is produced by Indian Point not be missed, he says, but there would also be a 57 percent energy surplus. The worst-case scenario, however, is far less rosy: a 40 percent energy deficit. 
Still, the Komanoff report says, any potential shortfall in capacity could be made up with imports of power from New England and the Mid-Atlantic region, which, Mr. Komanoff said, have surplus capacity. 
Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said that all of the power for public buildings and uses in Westchester and New York City comes from Indian Point 3. This includes all schools, street lights, firehouses, town halls, municipal buildings, subways and Metro-North trains in both Westchester and New York City. Indian Point 2 supplies 10 to 15 percent of all the power to customers of Consolidated Edison in Westchester and New York. 
Mr. Steets said that the study was commissioned by Entergy to help the public better realize Indian Point's precise contribution. "It had become apparent," said Mr. Steets, "that people didn't understand the importance of Indian Point, its role in the availability and cost of electricity.
"We knew the study was going to be favorable," he said. "We didn't know what the numbers were going to be."
The study is for public consumption and will not be submitted to regulatory agencies. 
"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission," Mr. Steets said, "does not care if electricity costs a zillion dollars a kilowatt, as long as the plant is operated safely." Mr. Steets said the study took several months to complete, but would not reveal its cost.
"We were pretty aggressive about supplying the study to the Westchester County legislature and other policy and decision makers," Mr. Steets said. "But it's not something the average Joe on the street has been asking to read. We've gotten an occasional call." 
As for the battle of studies between Entergy and Riverkeeper, Mr. Steets said that it is not being fought on equal footing. Entergy, he said, "wouldn't pretend to tell Riverkeeper how to best protect the river from things we know nothing about."
"Chances are," he said, "we know a little more about electricity than they do." 
Westchester County Executive Andrew J. Spano, whose budget would be affected by a change in energy costs, said: "I prefer for this plant to be closed, period. If it closes, energy will be affected. To what extent, I don't know." STEPPING back from the claims of the dueling studies, Mrs. Galef, who represents Buchanan, where Entergy pays 95 percent of the village taxes, half the school taxes and employs 1,500 people, said that aiming for California-style savings in demand, while noble and needed, may not be entirely realistic. For one, she said, there is no evidence that conservation savings are anything other than short-lived and, besides, New York's climate tends to be muggier than California's, making summer savings more problematic. Also, Mrs. Galef added, saving energy realistically costs money: incentives have to be provided in the form of rebates for energy-efficient appliances and the area must be blanketed with public service announcements and other education. 
"I just don't know that it can make up for all of Indian Point," she said, "especially since our area is growing in terms of population and the number of things we have that we plug in." 
Another problem, she said, is that while people generally stay with conservation for short bursts, it's an open question whether they will continue over the long term. 
"We only do things when we have to do them," said Mrs. Galef. "And then we don't do it. Before we turn off the plant we need to make sure." 
But Mr. Brodsky, who is chairman of the State Assembly's committee on environmental conservation, said that California, in rebounding from its energy crisis of last summer in large part thanks to conservation, has provided the New York metropolitan area with an adequate map for taming demand to the point where Indian Point's production will be irrelevant. 
Mrs. Galef said that before Indian Point is ever closed, time is needed to see if energy demand can ever be reduced in the long term. 
"Homeowners can deal with brownouts," she said. "But hospitals can't. And businesses can't. In a brownout, I.B.M. can lose its programs. If they do, they'll eventually go out of state where the power is good." 
Any discussion of costs to businesses or to taxpayers must, Mr. Brodsky said, consider the many costs of Indian Point, both current and potential, which are absorbed not by Entergy but by the government. These sums are much greater anything it would cost to educate consumers about conservation or transmit energy from other sources, he said.
There is the cost of security: the Coast Guard, the National Guard, the local police. Then there is the cost of the county's evacuation plan and, the considerable cost of cleaning up after an accident or sabotage. 
Getting replacement power is not easy, Mrs. Galef said. The Millennium Pipeline, a proposed 425-mile natural gas conduit from Lake Erie to Westchester, has been the subject of fierce public opposition since it was proposed in 1997. 
"No one wants anything new in their community," said Mrs. Galef, but a real-world consequence of closing Indian Point -- one that even most of its opponents acknowledge -- is that energy would have to be brought in from elsewhere through means like the Millennium Pipeline. 
"The entire issue is difficult," Mrs. Galef said. "You hear so many different things. But I just haven't been convinced that turning off 2,000 megawatts will not have an effect. 
"And as much as some wish Indian Point would go away tomorrow," Mrs. Galef said, "I just don't think it's going to happen." 
Whether the reports are swaying the public in either direction remains to be seen. Mr. Matthiessen of Riverkeepers said that while there has been a great deal of interest in what the studies say about Indian Point, he allowed that not too many people have requested a copy of the actual hefty reports. "I wouldn't say there has been a public clamor for the documents," he said. 

11 Months Without the Power Plant
INDIAN POINT was closed once. On the day after Valentine's Day in 2000, pipes cracked in a steam generator of Indian Point 2, releasing a small amount of radioactive steam. The Nuclear Regulatory Committee assigned Indian Point 2 its worst performance rating and Con Edison, which owned Indian Point until Entergy bought it just before the Sept. 11 attacks, closed the entire plant for repairs. For 11 months, until January 2001, Indian Point was offline. During the shutdown, which took place around the time power markets were being deregulated, Con Edison bought replacement energy from out-of-state suppliers. 
At the time, demand was rising and, coupled with this decrease in supply from Indian Point, there was a regional power shortage. Electricity prices hit record highs, but those record highs, according to Con Edison, amounted to only $20 extra over the 11 months for the average residential resident and more for business, for a total of about $200 million ($250 million, according to the state). 
Though he is currently battling in court to bar Consolidated Edison from passing the costs onto consumers (earlier this month, a federal appeals court struck down a New York State law co-authored by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky that denied Con Edison the right to bill for the money), Mr. Brodsky pointed out that Indian Point's absence did not have a large effect on consumers.
Consolidated Edison officials said that during the time of Indian Point's closure, the average price per kilowatt hour was 20.25 cents for the average New York City residential customer. From the re-opening of Indian Point until now, that price has been 18.65 cents per kilowatt hour. Joseph Petta, a Consolidated Edison spokesman, cautioned that there are plenty of variables besides Indian Point's re-opening that account for the shift, including an agreement made by Consolidated Edison when they sold the plant to Entergy to buy back power at a lower price.

HEADLINE: MY JOB; 
This Time, a Layoff Hits Home

BYLINE:  By RACHEL ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
I KNEW something was wrong when the complimentary cans of soda stopped being replaced in the office fridge. Then the Wednesday free lunches disappeared. A week later, so did the C.E.O. It seemed pretty clear who would be next. 
 I thought people were laid off only when the General Motors plant closed in Flint, Mich. I vaguely associated the word "recession" with the other George Bush and assumed if I showed up 15 minutes early and left a half-hour late, my job was secure. Being laid off from my job, in public relations, was like being dumped by a boyfriend I never liked. 
 "Tomorrow is D-Day," remarked a co-worker that I never particularly cared for. "They're laying off 60 employees." I rode home with a mild chest pain.
I never really liked my job anyway. Harassing journalists who didn't want to speak to me on the phone made me feel like a stalker. My co-workers were the worst part. Most were blond females (of the bottled variety) who wore absurdly pointy shoes made by designers with unpronounceable names. They would invite me to parties one day and call me by the wrong name the next.
But the thought of losing my dental insurance and rewriting my resume was enough to make me stay put.
The next day I sat in my cubicle with cracker crumbs on the desk and a picture of David Bowie on the wall, as I did every morning. When my phone rang and it said "Purple Conference Room" on the Caller ID, I knew that David would be coming home with me that night.
Walking down the hallway, my ears were deaf to everything but the hollow clacking of my sandals against the hardwood. I never thought I would reach the end; time was suspended in a vacuum of fear and nausea.
Inside the room, a table held a box of tissues and a pitcher of water. At the head of it sat the human resources manager.
"We've been undergoing some financial difficulties," she said.
"So you're laying me off," I finished for her.
"Yes, but the correct term is downsizing," she continued matter-of-factly, as if semantics could pay my rent. She handed me a folder. "You'll find information about unemployment insurance, as well as your severance package in here. Oh, and your e-mail account and phone extension are being shut off as we speak," she added with a detached calmness that had been perfected from 59 similar speeches.
At that moment, an odd sound somewhere between a burp and a hiccup escaped from my throat. Suddenly, my cheeks felt wet. I had never cried in front of anyone in the office. This time, I somehow didn't have time to get to the ladies' room.
One of the last corporate graces they bestowed on us was a taxi voucher to move our belongings home. All I took was a lonely cardboard box filled with papers, Tupperware and office supplies. I clutched a wet Kleenex smudged with lipstick as I watched the buildings whirl by. I wondered what I would do next week, tomorrow, that afternoon. I could travel, write, anything really. If only I had savings and my tooth didn't hurt so much.
The taxi driver pulled up in front of my apartment. I took the voucher from my pocket, wrote in a tip for $20 and handed it to him.
He looked at it and grinned. "You have yourself a nice day," he said.

HEADLINE: Boot Camp for the Real Estate Wars 

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
TERRY EDLEFSEN, a ballet dancer, went back to school this week, intent on mastering a different kind of choreography: the give and take of selling residential real estate. 
 Mr. Edlefsen, a former soloist with the Pennsylvania and Stuttgart Ballets, was one of 100 new sales agents at Weichert Realty enrolled in "Fast Tracks," a one of several training courses at the company's 20-acre campus in Morris Plains, N.J. 
 A television commercial actor who also teaches at the New Jersey School of Ballet, Mr. Edlefsen contemplated his professional detour during a class break on Monday and said: "After 9/11 the commercial work slowed so much that I decided I needed to do something else. But I didn't want to do what actors do: temp work or wait on tables. I have a five-month-old baby boy now." 
He has plenty of company in the ranks of new recruits to residential real estate sales, both in the city and suburbs. Though the field has always attracted people seeking a new career, the pool of novices is becoming noticeably more diverse than it was, say, 10 years ago. 
At the moment, there is a particularly noticeable influx of refugees from Wall Street, dot-com companies and other corporations who have been downsized out of jobs or have seen their employers disappear altogether. But participants in a training course conducted by Insignia Douglas Elliman at its Park Avenue headquarters last month also included an early-childhood-education professor, a Malibu real estate broker, an opera singer, a restaurateur, a nutritionist, a songwriter, a recent Columbia graduate and an accountant from Arthur Andersen.
Whatever their backgrounds and whether dealing in co-ops in the city or houses in the suburbs, the newcomers need to be trained in the nuts and bolts of a complex, sophisticated industry, where top performers can earn $1 million or more a year.
Although they may impart the same basic principles, firms do so in markedly different ways as they seek to cloak their associates in the agency's brand image.
"Buying or selling a home is the single most important financial transaction most people will ever make in their life, so it is critical that an agent have proper training," said Kathy M. Braddock, executive managing director and general sales manager at Insignia Douglas Elliman. "You owe it to the consumer, be they purchaser or seller, to provide them with agents trained in the company's image, and we owe it to existing agents and shareholders as well as consumers to be sure that everyone whose license in held by our firm is trained in the same way."
By the time they join a given firm, most people have already taken the 45-hour course required for a New York State sales license. (An agent must work in the field for at least a year to qualify for a broker's license and must take 22 1/2 hours of classes every two years to renew the license.) In New Jersey, the licensing course is 75 hours, but no recertification is required. Connecticut requires a 30-hour course for the sales license and two years of an active practice plus two additional 30-hour courses for a broker's license. In addition, licenses must be renewed annually and every two years agents must take four three-hour courses. 
Licensing preparation focuses primarily on state, city and federal laws dealing with such matters as contracts, construction, environmental considerations and title closings. 
"The state course gives you an education in the law, but it doesn't teach you to market and sell real estate," said Angela Anderson, a vice president of the Daniel Gale agency, which has 12 offices on the North shore of Nassau and Suffolk Counties. "We do that ourselves." 
Among numerous topics covered in the companies' courses, which vary widely in format and duration, are strategies for attracting clients and obtaining listings, conducting open houses, reading financial statements, preparing board packages for co-ops and condos, negotiating prices and closing dates and assessing investment potential of properties. Agents also learn how to tread the fine line between persuasiveness and aggression and how to accommodate the panoply of personalities they will encounter.
As Paul F. Purcell, president of Insignia Douglas Elliman, told a class during a recent three-week program: "We have to become chameleons. We have to get along with a lot of different people."
Whatever their approach, brokerage executives are adamant that their new agents be thoroughly grounded in the particular methodology and culture of the agency, even if that sometimes means untraining people who have worked with other firms. 
Demonstrating the tenacity that firms expect of their associates, Mr. Purcell told his class: "There is no way I won't get a listing I go after. I just don't leave without an understanding."
Ms. Braddock concurred. "They are being prepared not just to be a broker or an agent, but an Insignia Douglas Elliman agent," she said. "We want everyone to talk the talk and walk the walk." 
At Weichert, Ali Lanfrank, an assistant trainer, put it this way: "We Weichertize them." 
At some companies, the training entails a few days of classes and a great deal of direct observation of a seasoned broker. At others, the approach is more academic, providing newcomers with lectures, seminars, workbooks and homework assignments before sending them into action.
At Bellmarc Realty, for example, "our class takes about two months, during which time the agents can take no phone calls and participate in no professional activities," said Neil J. Binder, a principal of the firm. 
By the time they have completed the Bellmarc course, students will have listened to 16 audiotapes, mastered a 600-page sales manual, memorized every clause in a standard contract and passed two four-hour exams. "Only when they finish all that are they ready to sell," he said. 
On the first day of the Corcoran Group's program, Mitchell Lawrence, the managing director of education, leads a workshop he calls "Meet a Rookie on the Move." 
"I introduce them to someone who joined us in the last year, was just like they are on the first day and who has really taken off," he said.
The Corcoran program lasts two weeks and consists mainly of classes taught by company managers, brokers and outside speakers like mortgage brokers. "I always get the top brokers to volunteer to do role playing of different scenarios, and I give homework asking the class members to pretend that I am their customer," Mr. Lawrence said. 
WEICHERT, which has a separate building devoted solely to education, has a particularly elaborate facility and comprehensive curriculum. All told, it has six training hubs on the East Coast, including the center at its 20-acre corporate headquarters in Morris Plains. New programs begin every month for about 300 agents, who will work out of 200 offices and whose training extends over six months.
Right from the start, they are encouraged to ply their trade. "Tonight the 100 people being trained here will begin by calling 50 friends each, and by this weekend they will be conducting open houses with a mentor," said Chris Giugliano, vice president for training and development.
In one room, there are 25 cubicles with telephones on which students can practice their communications skills. At the back of the room is a mirrored wall where, Mr. Giugliano explained, "people who don't smile are sent." He added, "We teach them to smile on the phone." 
Small agencies like McClellan Real Estate, which has 28 agents in two offices in Pelham and New Rochelle, N.Y., tend to offer less formal programs. 
"We don't add on more than one new agent a year because if we did, everyone would trip over everyone else," said Carol Brown, one of the firm's three owners. "We spend about a month having them learn the paperwork and computers, answer the phone, the nitty-gritty of real estate. We find they pick up so much just from being around and listening to a seasoned agent. 
"During this time they also go to open houses and see what new properties are coming on the market. Then we put them in a car and pretend they are the customer, giving them a tour of the town the way we would with a customer." 
Elizabeth Stribling, president of Stribling Associates in Manhattan, is a firm believer in the one-on-one method. "We take the tutorial approach," she said. "I read English literature at Cambridge, and there you work with a tutor. What we do here is take the new salesperson and have that person sit between Betsy Dean, the supervisor of brokerage at our uptown office, or her equivalent and me for about five or six weeks. They work literally in a brokerage bullpen and get the blitz of everything that comes across our desks."
That format seems to be working well for Joanne R. Wenig, who joined Stribling last month as an associate broker. (Because she is a lawyer, she was able to bypass the agent rank.) A former partner at the investment firm of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company and founder of her own venture capital fund, she was already schooled in negotiation.
"The way that Stribling trains new brokers is, in fact, one of the reasons I decided to join the firm," Ms. Wenig said. "My sense was that one-on-one training would better suit someone like me who has so much business experience in that it would allow me and the firm to customize my training, emphasizing the things I don't know from prior experience and spending less time on the things I already know." 
Then there are lessons that cannot be conveyed in the classroom. 
Mara Kurtz, for example, who joined Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy in January when her freelance graphics design business began to feel repercussions of the faltering economy, gave herself an assignment. "Since there was no business the first month, I decided to see an apartment in every building on Central Park West from 60th to 97th Street," she said. 
Though Ms. Kurtz is specializing in the West Side area on or abutting Central Park, her first sale was a co-op on East End Avenue, in the building where she was raised. "I just knew the client would be happier there," she said.
As soon as training begins, new agents are expected to start gathering clients and listings by mining what is known as their "sphere of influence." That means getting in touch with everyone with whom they have any contact whatsoever, from relatives and neighbors to names on Christmas card lists and in Rolodex files, to friends of friends.
In a class titled "How to Market Yourself as a Business" that she led on Monday in Morris Plains, Virginia Carpenter, manager of Weichert's West Milford office, advised her students to establish an income goal for the year. If they hoped to earn $100,000 a year working in an area where the average sales price is $400,000, she said, it is necessary to complete 20 transactions with an average commission of $5,000. 
To do that, she recommended that agents come in contact with 3,000 people a year. 
"Three thousand people sounds like a lot, but it's not really," she reassured her audience. "It comes out to 250 people a month. You meet them through open houses, answering the telephone in the office, self-promotion and farming, which is introducing yourself to everyone in the neighborhood and then continually sending them mail."
Although new agents are offered considerable counseling through mentoring arrangements and friendly advice from more experienced colleagues, in the end they are more or less told to swim or sink. 
"What we give brokers is 50 percent of what they need, a business card, 91 years of our history and our marketing and advertising departments," Ms. Braddock of Insignia Douglas Elliman said. "We truly believe this is an entrepreneurial career within a structured organization. We supply the desk, the phone, the support and the name -- but it is up to you to run with the ball."
Not everyone does, of course. Some people realize that they have neither the tenacity to be in what is essentially their own business under the umbrella of an agency nor the nerve to rely solely on commissions. 
Others are weeded out by their firms because their performances do not justify the so-called "cost of a desk." "Last year, we probably took in about 70 new people and asked about 8 to leave," Ms. Braddock said.
The attrition rate is even greater at the Corcoran Group. "Of the people joining us from 2000 to 2001, about 50 percent didn't make it," said Pamela Liebman, the president and chief executive. "Now we are finding that 25 percent don't make it. We have certain expectations and if they don't meet them, we let them go. If you think this is a good way to play golf and enjoy weekends in the Hamptons, you are in for a rude awakening."
Though it still tends to be a second career rather than the first, real estate brokerage is drawing more people in their late 20's and 30's than it once did. In addition, it is also attracting men. "Fifteen years ago, it was stigmatized as a career for men, but now we are seeing a lot more of them," said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates in Manhattan.
To what did he attribute the shift? "What gets anything to change in New York?" he said. "It's always money. Once people learned that it was possible to make $1 million or more, it became an attractive alternative." 
NOVICES, of course, cannot expect to reach those levels for some time. Because they draw no salary and work strictly on commission, they are advised to begin with a nest egg sufficient to ride out six months without any income.
"Even if you sell something on your first day, it won't close for three months," Mr. Lawrence of Corcoran said. Commissions are not fixed, but 6 percent is considered standard, though the rate can be negotiated up or down depending on the individual property, market conditions and unusual services required of the agent. "It's not like hanging a bracelet at Tiffany's," Ms. Braddock said. 
If the buyer has been brought in by an agent working with a brokerage other than the listing agency, the commission is split equally between the two firms. The agencies and the agents then divide their commissions. New salespeople generally receive 45 or 50 percent of the firm's commission, while star brokers command as much as 70 percent.
Most executives were reluctant to discuss actual income, but one after another emphasized that there is no ceiling and that top sales agents and brokers earn well into seven figures.
"If a new broker is successful in their first year, they should think in terms of $50,000 to $75,000 net," said Ms. Stribling. Later, "a good one will earn $200,000 to $300,000, and a lot take home $600,000. Top brokers net $1 million or more." 
A. J. Tesler means to be the exception to the six-month rule of thumb for nest eggs for those starting out. A theater major who graduated from Northwestern University two years ago, he is what is known in the industry as "a real estate brat." His mother is a former agent in Stamford, Conn. 
Mr. Tesler, who is 23, came to New York from Chicago in September and enrolled in a licensing course. On Oct. 1, he joined the downtown office of Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy, where, he said, "one of the more experienced agents decided he wanted me to succeed, so he took me under his wing."
"I was told I wouldn't see any money for six months," he continued, "but I had a closing today, and it is No. 6." His smallest sale so far was a $100,000 studio; his largest, a $650,000 two-bedroom co-op.
"I used to sell yellow page ads door to door," Mr. Tesler said, recalling his first job. "Now I'm selling doors."

HEADLINE: Painting by the Numbers: What and Where Is Home? 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER 

DATELINE: SHILOH 

 BODY:
AT the heart of this Salem County farm town, six country roads converge at the weathered Richardson's General Store, where a half-dozen locals meet every morning at 6 for coffee and to discuss the world's woes. A sign over the counter reads "God, Guns and Guts Made America, Let's Keep All Three."
 According to no less an authority than the federal Bureau of the Census, Shiloh is the most American town in New Jersey, with 15.3 percent of the residents reporting their ancestry as American or United States. In neighboring Lower Alloways Creek, 15.2 percent said they were of American blood. 
 "New Jersey, especially North Jersey, is a melting pot of the world," said Clarence Woolbert, who worked as a part-time census worker in Salem County and lives in Lower Alloways Creek. "But in Salem County not much has changed a great deal in the 76 years that I've been around." 
"Many of these people have been in this area for five generations or more," he said. "So in my opinion, you should be calling us American."
Every 10 years the census reveals a big picture of the country, pointing to changing patterns of wealth, racial makeup, education and family structure.
Along with all that comes little slivers of insight into obscure corners of New Jersey and the way people live their daily lives. At the census bureau these data are known as "social characteristics."
How many rooms are in the house? How long have you lived there? How many cars in the driveway? How is the house heated? How many bathrooms do you have?
"The census is important because we need to know the social and economic characteristics of our nation," said Sen Yuan Wu, senior research economist in the state's Department of Labor. "For the civil aspects of government we need to know our social characteristics in order to plan or improve."
Mr. Wu said decisions about new schools, roads and hospitals were all rooted in census data.
But must we know about coal-burning furnaces and plumbing?
Mr. Wu said the questionnaire was approved by Congress and is standard across the country. "Just because a question doesn't seem important in New Jersey doesn't mean it's not important in West Virginia," he said.
When searching among New Jersey's 566 municipalities for census distinction, small size carries statistical stature. In many categories tiny Teterboro, population 16, in Bergen County and Tavistock, population 23, in Camden County topped the rankings. Walpack Township in Somerset County, population 37, ranked tops in the percentage of Irish, German and Hungarian ancestry.
"It's because the base is so small, it's very easy to get a high concentration in a particular area," said Mr. Wu. "It's not very meaningful in my opinion."
Shiloh and Lower Alloways Creek remain much the way they have for decades. Small family farms stretch out along the country roads, men still trap and skin muskrats for coats and locals still crab the Delaware Bay.
When pressed, Mr. Woolbert acknowledges he is of German, Irish and Welsh stock, but he can trace his great-great-grandfather to America, where there are now two generations beyond himself.
Kevin Deardorff, chief of ethnic and Hispanic statistics at the census bureau in Washington, said there had been an increase in people reporting American ancestry.
"One suggestion is that the number of people who haven't had recent migration experiences don't have the close affiliation with a specific country," he said. "Several generations of family are in the United States, and they feel that's where their heritage lies.
"On the other hand," Mr. Deardorff continued, "there is another possibility, that people who are recent immigrants -- first generation -- feel a particular affinity with the United States. They moved to the United States. They are naturalized citizens. Therefore, that's how they feel they want to be identified."

Americans or . . .?
Only the 19 million households receiving the long form of the census were asked about ancestry. Respondents could list more than one nationality. In the United States, 7 percent listed American ancestry. In New Jersey, 3.14 percent reported American ancestry, up from 2.2 percent in 1990.
Perhaps the oddest fact about ancestry in New Jersey is that its most Arab municipality attained that title because of its large Jewish population. According to the census, Deal Borough, in Monmouth County, is 22.6 percent Arab. But that is primarily because of its population of Sephardic Jews from Syria and elsewhere in the Arab world.
Mr. Deardorff explained that when people filled in the name of a country of ancestry, such as Syria, where the official language is Arabic, they were counted as Arab.
If they filled in Jewish, the answer was discounted, he said: "That's a religion."
Other results were almost surprising in their predictability. After Walpack and Tavistock, Spring Lake, New Jersey's so-called Irish Riviera, is indeed New Jersey's most Irish municipality. Just over half of Spring Lake's population, 50.7 percent, said it had roots in the auld sod.
English blood has diluted to the point where the highest concentration is 26.5 percent, in Cape May Point.
Agricultural Hammonton was New Jersey's most Italian town with 54.3 percent. After Teterboro, Millburn Township and Fair Lawn tied for most Russians with 11.7 percent. Milford Borough was the most German with 35 percent, disregarding Walpack.
Wallington is the top Polish town with 51.5 percent.
Mayor Walter Wargacki said that originally Poles migrated to the Wallington area in the early 20th century to work in textile mills and the local rubber plant. But a new wave occurred after the fall of Communism.
At first, he said, it was mostly blue-collar workers with family or friends in the area who helped sponsor their moves. Lately, he said, the immigrants have been professionals.
"We have constant turnover of new immigrants coming in, and it's not the same ones," Mr. Wargacki said. "Now we're getting doctors, architects, engineers and computer people that have come."
He said that immediately after the fall of Communism, professionals felt an obligation to stay in Poland to see what would happen to the economy. Eventually, many decided to strike out for the United States.
"The new immigrants believe in owning land because under Communism they couldn't," Mr. Wargacki said. "Here they have the opportunity to take an old house that's run-down and fix it up. The neighborhoods have been regenerated by the immigrant population that believes in property."
Property was also a major area of census inquiry.
In a state known for its bedroom communities and transient sprawl, Millstone in Somerset County is the most established, with 35.3 percent of the residents of its 167 housing units living there since 1969.
Ray McAdam, 83, arrived in 1962 when he bought a home dating to the early 1700's. He worked as a purser for T.W.A., commuting to New York for international flights several times a month.
Many of the residents work in New York, but many more are retired, Mr. McAdam said.
The town has many historic homes along the Millstone River and a new section of ranch homes known as "the Village," which was developed in the late 1960's.
Mr. McAdam said that there was a park in town but that people mostly socialize at small dinner parties where the discussion can be volatile.
"We have a lot of dissension," said Mr. McAdam. "When you get a lot of old people, they give their opinion. Nobody's here to impress anybody. It's impressive that they all still live here."

Something Old, Something New
The state's heaviest concentrations of newcomers, after Teterboro and Tavistock, are in Plainsboro Township in Middlesex County and New Hanover Township with only 0.9 percent of their populations in residence before 1969.
"Plainsboro was really a sleepy little town until there was a massive development of condos in the late 1980's," said Bruce Busch, a local real estate salesman.
Soon after the condos were built, Mr. Busch said, their prices plummeted. When their owners wanted to move, they rented the properties with one-year leases. Now prices are up again and people are selling, he said, creating another wave of transience.
The leader in owner-occupied units valued at $1 million or more is Alpine with 57.8 percent of its 612 homes in that price range. Next are two other Bergen County municipalities, Saddle River and Rockleigh.
The state's oldest homes are in Loch Arbour Village, Monmouth County, where 83.5 percent of its 158 housing units were built before 1939. 
Jim Foley, a local historian, said the town's Victorian homes were built as summer residences for wealthy New Yorkers: "I don't think there's been a new home built in Loch Arbour in many a year."
Other towns with well-worn homes include Glen Ridge and Montclair in Essex County; Riverton and Bordentown in Burlington County; Lambertville, Bloomsbury and Frenchtown in Hunterdon County, and Princeton borough in Mercer County.
Surprisingly, when it comes to the number of units in a structure, Shrewsbury Township, Monmouth County, has the smallest percentage of single-family homes, topping Hoboken, West New York, Union City Weehawken and other urban municipalities.
There is but one single-family home in Shrewsbury Township, which has a total of 546 housing units, mostly in attached rows, all built to house military men and their families during World War II.
Jack Moran, a recently retired Amtrak employee who invests in properties in the area, bought the two-bedroom home two years ago and rents it to a father and son.
"It was unique," he said. "It was the only unattached one, so I bought it as an investment. I'm thinking of gutting the place eventually, maybe for my retirement."
But $1 million homes and single-family residences are not all the census found.
Englishtown reported that 9.6 percent of its 643 housing units had no kitchen, but town officials attribute that largely to the communal kitchen at Liberty Manor, an assisted-living center with 71 units.
In seven towns, more than 2 percent of the housing units did not have complete plumbing facilities, defined as hot and cold piped-in water, a flush toilet and a bathtub or a shower. In Camden, 14 percent of the city's 24,1778 housing units have no phone.
Arnold Cohen, policy coordinator for the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey in Trenton, said the municipal figures often masked pockets of poor housing in affluent towns.
"New Jersey is one of the most expensive housing markets," he said. "Whether it's elderly who can no longer afford to live in a community because of the high property taxes or the inability of children to live in a community where they grew up, or even people who work in professions, teachers, firefighters and police, we have segregated off the poor and not put the resources into revitalizing communities."
While the latest batch of census results was released in the heat of summer, it delves deep into how New Jersey residents heat their homes.
White Township in Warren County, near the anthracite coal country in Pennsylvania, has the highest percent of homes heated with coal in New Jersey, with 1.9 percent of the 1,668 housing units.
"There is a good chunk of people who have moved to this part of New Jersey who are from the coal areas around Scranton or Wilkes-Barre and were presold on that type of heating," said Nicholas Ritter, vice president of L. E. Ritter Lumber Company, which sells building materials and coal.
Mr. Ritter, who converted his own home to coal heat, said coal was efficient and sold for half the price of heating oil, although installation of a new coal-burning system cost about double that of a new gas system.
Mr. Ritter said his company delivered coal to about 200 customers in the area, which supports four or five coal dealers.
"We believe in coal," he said. "I've had coal heat all of my life, and the few times I've moved into places heated otherwise I was never happy."
If coal heat seems antiquated, consider Kathy Schoonfield who lives in Estell Manor, Atlantic County, the municipality with the highest percentage of homes heated by wood. Of the town's 529 homes, 9.6 percent are heated that way.
In Estell Manor, zoning requires homes be set on 5 to 25 acres, so most homeowners, like Mrs. Schoonfield, have woods on their property.
"It's free," said Mrs. Schoonfield of her primary heat source.
In the summer, Mrs. Schoonfield walks through the woods and marks the leafless dead trees and limbs with pink surveyor's tape so her husband, Drew, can identify them in the winter when all of the trees have lost their leaves.
She hacks the bigger logs with a small handsaw and stokes the wood-burning stove that keeps her three children warm all winter.
"It's just a little hard work," she said. "You've got to bring the wood in and you've got to watch it in the stove. But once it gets cold enough, you get into a rhythm."
Finally there are those who said they didn't live in a house at all.
Long Beach Township in Ocean County had the highest percent of people -- 1.18 percent -- who said they lived on a boat, or in a recreational vehicle or van.
Town residents pointed to the High Bar Harbor Yacht Club, a private club at the edge of town, for an explanation.
Oops! It is illegal to live on a boat in Long Beach Township.
Joe Egles, manager of the yacht club, said none of the boat owners, who pay about $40,000 to $60,000 for a slip, actually lived on their boats, no matter what they may have told the census.
"They might have written that down," he said, "but either they're just boasting or they only wish they lived on a boat."

HEADLINE: Executive Life; 
A Path Paved in Dreams, Not in Gold

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
EVER wonder what prompts a rising executive to jump off the corporate fast track and into the not-for-profit world? If so, read on, and decide whether Robert L. Waldron represents an anomaly, or a societal change.
 At 36, Rob Waldron had his career all mapped out. He had a degree from the Harvard Business School and experience as a Morgan Stanley analyst, and he ran the San Francisco region for Kaplan Educational Centers. In 1996, Kaplan bought Score, a $2 million tutoring company, and let Mr. Waldron run it. By May 2001, when Mr. Waldron took off to Boston to help a college friend start a software company, Score's yearly sales had ballooned to $50 million. 
 Mr. Waldron looked in the mirror and saw a budding corporate chief. So when Kristine Stotz Langdon, a director at the executive search firm of Spencer Stuart, tried to recruit him to Jumpstart, a program to help disadvantaged youngsters succeed in school, he brushed her away.
"I just wanted to run a big company and make a ton of money doing it," he said. "I felt it was the only way you proved you were smart, accomplished, a success."
Note the past tense, "felt." Try as he would, Mr. Waldron could not shut out the larger world. He would read about the drug problem, about the Arab-Israeli conflict, about poverty, and he would feel a mounting sense of helplessness. "It seemed like the problems in the world were increasing all the time," he said.
Then came Sept. 11.
For two horrible hours, he mistakenly thought that his wife's sister, who lived in Battery Park City, near the World Trade Center, had died. Then came anthrax scares and a mad dash to stock up on Cipro. Then came the rumors of poisoned reservoirs and the equally mad dash to stock up on bottled water.
Suddenly, money seemed a pathetic life's goal. "I had this terrible need to feel like I was fixing something," he said.
When the persistent Ms. Langdon called again, Mr. Waldron acquiesced. In March, at the age of 37, he became Jumpstart's chief executive.
He is earning a third what he made at Kaplan and a fraction of what he thinks he might have reaped from the start-up. He sometimes feels pangs about making his wife, Jennifer, and the child they are expecting in September live on a budget -- albeit, he acknowledges, not a terribly stringent one. When those feelings come up, his wife talks him down.
"I still want to win, and my whole life has been about solving problems," he said. "She reminds me that helping children read, that's solving a problem and winning, too."
So, that question again: Is chaos in the world -- and, lately, scandal in corporate America -- yielding more Rob Waldrons? Talks with recruiters turn up adamant yeses -- and equally adamant nos and maybes.
"A growing number of high-ranking executives are not even waiting to be called but are seeking us out to ask about moving to the nonprofit world," said Malcolm MacKay, the not-for-profit specialist at the search firm of Russell Reynolds Associates.
If so, they are not calling Michael Kirkman, who runs the not-for-profit practice at Korn/Ferry International. "There's no avalanche of people wanting to change the world," he said, "only a slightly greater inclination toward the public sector." 
Ms. Langdon, meanwhile, sees even that as an overstatement. "I'm not finding people to be more receptive at all," she said, noting how long it took her to woo Mr. Waldron.
THE difficulty of the searches -- and the low fees they often yield -- is still not discouraging recruiters from taking them on. With the economy sluggish and many companies doing more firing than hiring, they certainly have the time.
In the first quarter, not-for-profit clients were 22 percent of Korn/Ferry's search load, versus 7 percent in the corresponding period of 2001.
"Of course it's going to be a larger percentage of our circle of searches, since the total of searches is down," Mr. Kirkman acknowledged.
Of course, some people moved from the corporate world to the charitable one long before Sept. 11. Some of the switching dates back at least six years, when the baby boomers started turning 50. Many had become rich on stock options and Internet stocks during the 1990's bull market. Their children had finished college, and mortgages had been paid. They were too energetic to retire and young enough to embark on second careers.
At the same time, government, universities and philanthropies recognized that they needed people who were knowledgeable about business. A result was a steady trickle of managerial talent from the private to the public sector.
Most recruiters agree that the flow increased a bit over the last year. They say the terrorist attacks, coupled with the nonprofit world's growing respect for business expertise, probably did a lot to polish the image of the nonprofit world, just as corporate scandals were tarnishing the title of chief executive.
"The trend has less to do with Sept. 11 than with a real unhappiness and embarrassment over what's happening in the commercial world," said Mr. MacKay of Russell Reynolds.
But even that explanation is not so cut and dried. Just ask Charles F. Kalmbach Jr. Mr. Kalmbach, 55, was a global managing partner at Accenture when Mr. MacKay recruited him to become Princeton University's senior vice president for administration in February. He had plenty of money, Princeton was his alma mater, he liked its new president, and he felt that academia was going through exciting changes. He happily said yes.
He does not regret his choice, he said. But for the first time it seems to carry a hefty opportunity cost.
"There's all this turmoil in the corporate world," he said, just a wisp of longing in his voice. "It sure would have been great fun to be a consultant right now."

How Long Will the Shopping Spree Last?

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT 

 BODY:
 MAYBE it was just the warm weather, but consumers went on a shopping spree last month at America's malls and stores, giving major retailers a healthy sales gain after a soft spring. The big discount chains like Wal-Mart, Kohl's and Target all exceeded Wall Street estimates of June sales. Whether shoppers will continue to spend at a relatively robust rate is unclear. Many economic forecasters have said the plummeting stock market and the loss of investor confidence from the barrage of corporate scandals will inevitably catch up to the consumer, who will feel more insecure, less wealthy and less inclined to shop. 
 Mona Doyle, president of Consumer Network Inc., a market research firm in Philadelphia that surveys shoppers, says cynicism about the integrity of American business is seeping into how shoppers think, although it hasn't deterred them from shopping. Ms. Doyle spoke last Thursday after major retailers reported their sales gains for June. JENNIFER BAYOT

Q. How has the news of accounting and other corporate scandals affected the mood of shoppers? What's the connection?

A. All the talk about the marketplace -- how much corruption is there, corporate greed, the C.E.O. problems -- all of that has been presented by the media in terms of investors. But consumers are connecting what they're hearing in the news to the low levels of service they're seeing at clothing stores and the supermarket. We've heard consumers say things like: "Management is too busy doing their own thing and covering their own tracks and lining their own pockets to pay attention to consumers. The fact is we're not being taken care of, it's not the employees fault, it's managers' fault."

Q. Are retailers carrying a lot of inventory now? Are stores selling at a loss to reduce high levels of inventory? Are they stockpiling for a boom later?

A. I can't speak about retailers. The consumer perception is that there is a real glut in the stores, that shopping is really made much more difficult by the amount of excess merchandise. It's just too crowded. They can't navigate. The perception is there hasn't been any softening of inventory. Are stores slashing prices? If they are, they haven't gotten that message to consumers -- not right now. The consumers don't think there are huge bargains out there. For them, the low levels of service -- of store associates and employee information -- are concerns; that shopping is harder than it has to be, harder than it should be.

Q. Economists have repeatedly expressed concern about the high level of consumer credit card debt. Are shoppers spending more than they can afford?

A. I think a lot of people have really worked very hard to pull back on credit card spending, but for every 1,000 people who are getting in line, another 10,000 get trapped because they need things and they max out.

Q. The June sales results show shoppers spent at a greater rate than they had this spring, especially at the discount retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl's. What should we conclude? And how has Kmart's bankruptcy filing changed the landscape?

A. Besides getting things cheaper, people are getting nice treatment at Wal-Mart. In one of our surveys, 45 percent agreed that Wal-Mart has most of what they need. We also had 45 percent saying that Wal-Mart greeters are great. At Kohl's, people really like the shopping experience and the values. The perception is Kohl's is for stylish merchandise, cheaper.
The perception that you can get everything you need at Kmart has eroded. Kmart may have the stores looking full, but the variety is not there. I think a fair number of people tried to shop at Kmart to be helpful, and many of these people have felt burned. What I expect to happen is really going to depend on whether suppliers continue to support them. If Kmart goes under, Wal-Mart and Target are really going to have more control over the suppliers. Will Martha Stewart go to Sears, and will that make a difference? It's hard to say how that will play out.

Q. Do you see any trends in what shoppers are buying this summer?

A. I think the action is in products that are mobile. The "to go" market is increasingly huge. I saw that Black & Decker is now selling a coffee dripper where the coffee flows into a great big 20-ounce mug that you just take with you. Just this morning I saw the new baby strollers that have something like a car's dashboard: there's room for the mother's and father's and baby's water bottles. It's a new turtle society -- we carry everything with us, we expect it to be convenient. We're going to be more and more mobile, and we're going to have more and more with us.

New Reasons To Wonder If the Worst Is Over

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
HOW much worse could the worst bear market in a generation get? A lot.
 For some insight into just how bad things could still turn out on Wall Street, it is worth paying attention to Robert D. Arnott, managing partner at First Quadrant, a money management firm in Pasadena, Calif., and co-author of a provocative recent article in the Financial Analysts Journal. It has the seemingly innocuous title, "What Risk Premium is 'Normal'?" 
 "The market has come down quite a bit from the unprecedented levels it reached a couple of years ago," Mr. Arnott says. "It has now reached the same valuation level as at the market top in 1929." 
That's right, the market top: before the crash that heralded the start of the Depression, not afterward.
Mr. Arnott, whose view of market history extends a bit further than that of most people on Wall Street (his research examines the performance of stocks back to 1802) doesn't really expect the kind of stock market collapse that occurred from 1929 to 1933. And he certainly doesn't expect the economy to fall apart; indeed, he is counting on economic growth to average the same rate of the last three decades.
But his study is a powerful reminder of just how over the top the stock market became in the 1990's and how much more downward adjustment may still be needed before prices reflect a fair valuation of the earnings and dividends that support them.
To reach that point, Mr. Arnott predicts, Wall Street may have to endure a long spell -- a decade or longer -- in which the stock market, while providing plenty of ups and downs, repeatedly disappoints investors. "I would be very surprised," Mr. Arnott said, "if bonds don't outperform stocks over the next decade or so." Meanwhile, he added, "The economy is probably going to be fine; it will just take a decade or two to catch up with what the market had anticipated."
Even as everybody from President Bush on down struggles to restore confidence among investors who no longer trust corporate earnings reports, the bitter truth is that stocks may go up on a sustained basis only after they have fallen far enough that investors are persuaded that they can go no lower.
As James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, wrote recently: "If U.S. stocks were absolutely and unequivocally cheap, today's alleged crisis would be self-correcting. Having fled an overvalued market, people would be creeping back into an undervalued one."
The problem, to vastly simplify Mr. Arnott's complex analysis, stems from the fact that investors in recent years failed to resolve a fundamental contradiction.
On one hand, they seemingly forgot that stocks are inherently riskier than bonds and began bidding up prices in the market accordingly. That drove down the so-called risk premium for holding stocks until it essentially vanished. Yet at the same time, investors came to believe that stocks -- because they are supposed to reward investors for taking extra risk -- would continue to outperform bonds and inflation.
YOU can't have it both ways indefinitely. When stocks were priced at, say, 12 times earnings and offered dividend yields of 4 to 5 percent, it was very easy to beat the return from government bonds and inflation by 5 to 8 percentage points a year. But when the market, at its top in 2000, was selling at about 35 times earnings and dividends were yielding barely more than 1 percent, investors could no longer expect to maintain such premium returns.
David Bowers, Merrill Lynch's chief global investment strategist, said in a recent report that "this sell-off has not just been about the overvaluation of U.S. stocks." 
"Rather, it has turned into a full-scale reassessment of the attractiveness of stocks versus bonds," he added. "And stocks have so far been the losers."
For the bull market to return, Mr. Arnott reasons, either the stock market must fall even more or earnings and dividends must soar. But his research found, contrary to the conventional wisdom on Wall Street, that the growth in earnings and dividends over the longer run cannot even keep up with real economic growth per person, largely because new enterprises rather than established companies account for a significant share of the gains.
"Earnings growth will not keep pace with G.D.P. growth -- that's a really important insight," said David Levine, a former chief economist at Sanford C. Bernstein.
Like everyone who tries to understand the market, Mr. Arnott could turn out to be wrong about the future. But even though, as he wryly acknowledges, "it is hard to get rewarded for telling people what they don't want to hear," it pays these days to listen.

HEADLINE: ESSAY; 
An Affair to Remember

BYLINE:  By ANNIE COHEN-SOLAL; Annie Cohen-Solal is the author of "Sartre: A Life" and writes frequently about French intellectuals and cultural policy. She was recently named professor in American studies at the University of Caen in Normandy. She lives in Paris and the West Village.

 BODY:
IN April 1977, Janine, a Palestinian friend who worked for a travel agency in Paris, asked me whether I wanted a free charter-jet ticket to spend Easter weekend in New York. 
 At the time, nothing seemed farther away. I was spending whole days at the Bibliotheque Nationale on Rue de Richelieu, arriving at 8:45 a.m., before all the others, to get a peaceful corner seat, a row behind the philosopher Michel Foucault, working painstakingly on my Ph.D. "Well, are you interested in this free ticket?" Janine asked again on one of her many phone calls. "It would give you a break. And, anyway, the library is closed over Easter weekend." 
 That persuaded me. I already knew two people in New York: Eleonore Ament, a pianist trained at Juilliard, who had been my roommate on Kibbutz Beit Alfa, in Upper Galilee, and Laurent Jenny, a friend from the good old activist days of May 1968, who taught literary theory at Columbia. Both lived on the Upper West Side. 
Once I arrived in New York, I could not rest, could not sleep, could not even sit. For three days and three nights, I walked with Eleonore, walked with Laurent, bewitched, obsessed by the city. I recall the thrill of freedom at crossing Broadway in the middle of the night, the feeling of infinite possibilities when stepping into a grocery store at 4 a.m. to buy a toasted bagel. 
Then there was the desperate charm of those gloomy apartments on West 99th Street, decorated with East European Jewish furniture and infested with impossibly gymnastic cockroaches. I scrutinized the 20-floor buildings, trying to adapt to brand-new proportions. I remember my reckless decision to immerse myself in the city's chaotic layers of beauty. Was it the smells, the smoke, the noise, the sirens of the police cars, the juxtaposition of so many cultures that moved me? 
New York ferried me back to childhood memories of Algiers -- the bags of spices on the other side of my grandparents' apartment near the Casbah, the sirens of the harbor boats, the smell of burned coffee, the churning traffic of cultures near the open sea, the lingering sense of a nearby sprawling danger -- and I instantly became a New York addict.
I know that I am not alone in this addiction, especially among Parisians. And the attraction runs both ways. New York and Paris are two of the world's great cultural capitals. Just as Parisians ache for New York, so New Yorkers long for Paris. I've been lucky enough to be on both sides of that trans-Atlantic yearning.
I came to New York again in October 1989 as cultural counselor for the the French Embassy. The offices of the cultural services were located in the Fifth Avenue mansion, near 78th Street, designed by Stanford White for the Payne Whitney family. For the next four years, I experienced the city through the history of this house. Every morning, when the guard opened the wrought-iron gate, I stepped into turn-of-the-century New York: white marble floors, the Cupid balanced on the back of three turtle shells that I presented to guests as "attributed to Michelangelo," a grand staircase decorated with John LaFarge's stained-glass windows "The Seasons," and the magnificent arched bow windows in the sitting room overlooking Central Park.
With its 40 rooms and five stories, this Italian Renaissance-style palace that Oliver H. Payne commissioned as a wedding gift for his nephew was the most expensive mansion that Stanford White ever built in the city. I tried to learn as much as I could about the Whitneys, buried myself in books about them, and devoured biographies of Stanford White.
After reading E. L. Doctorow's "Ragtime," I dreamed of throwing a fancy ball where, as in Milos Forman's movie, Norman Mailer would arrive dressed as Stanford White. I had trouble, though, finding anyone who would agree to be Evelyn Nesbit, once one of White's lovers, let alone Harry Thaw, Nesbit's husband, who killed White. "No guns allowed," I planned to add on the invitation.
But, as much as I savored my New York life, I still missed Paris. After an exhausting week of work, on Saturday mornings an irrepressible nostalgia for Paris washed over me. I would have given anything to walk downstairs to a nearby market. For a long time, I thought that what I really missed was French food -- the strong coffee, the fresh baguette, the salted butter, the sophisticated brebis cheeses. 
It took months before I realized that what I could not live without was not so much the food, but the daily human contact of a Parisian public market or local street. These contacts, quilted of negotiations, of gossip, of jokes, of bets on soccer matches, almost build a village life. Monsieur Crouzat, my butcher on the Rue de Verneuil, once told me: "The local Parisian store owners do indeed practice a social link; they make the street life. When a customer has not showed up for a few days, my wife calls him up to know what's going on."
I was torn between my love affair for New York and the homely lure of Paris. But my New York life finally felt less forlorn once I moved downtown. "Welcome to the West Village," Bud and Alice Trillin said to me. "It's a little bit like going to Europe." 
I adored living in the Printing House on Hudson Street and St. Luke's Place. I shopped on Bleecker, the epitome of the New York Italian street -- with its Sicilian baker, its Neapolitan butcher and its Calabrian pastry shop. On Saturday mornings, I would go to the farmers' market at Union Square, where the quince jam, fresh bread and broken pretzels somehow became a pale version of the Parisian markets. 
Downtown, where I slowly started to find my bearings again, I still resented the absence of so many Parisian commodities like street furniture -- the shelter where you can sit and avoid the rain while waiting for the bus, or the sophisticated fleuristes who might spend 15 minutes assembling a bouquet for you, or the daily voitures-balai that clean each Parisian street with water and brush.
Paris is a city that carries its own wounds and marks of violence, and the catastrophe of Sept. 11 in New York was considered here at first with silent dismay, mute empathy and speechless panic. "New York, September 11, 2001" was the stark headline that the daily paper Liberation presented on two full pages, under the pictures of the emasculated city skyline. Indeed, those horrible events have led some Parisians to believe that, with the experience of a "mutilated city," they and New Yorkers now share not just a mutual attraction, but a common fate.
STILL, for all the two cities share, the differences are crucial. When I left New York, after seven and a half years, it took me five years to get used to Paris again. With many friends who have felt the same pain, we play with the idea of starting a support group. Some of them indeed started seeing a shrink, some tried drugs, some fell into depression, some gathered on Sunday night to watch "Sex and the City" on the Teva channel.
"I suffocate in Paris," my friend Frank, a young French lawyer trained at N.Y.U., tells me over and over. "I resent the mentality of this society. The fear of taking risks, the lack of trust for young professionals, the rigidities, the archaisms and, above all, the 35-hour-week law, which might well diminish the unemployment rate, but kills all personal initiatives." 
For Jerome Godefroy, a journalist who moved back to Paris last fall after 12 years in New York, the return was like "coming back to a peaceful, quiet and provincial town."
"Beautiful indeed, but so unbelievably drowsy!" he added. "I found people and things intact, exactly as they were 12 years ago; nothing had changed or evolved, and more and more I am struck by a feeling of absolute stagnation."
But what do we really miss? We miss the New York weather and its intensity. We miss the city's arterial beat, its constant nudgings to wake up again and go on. Sometimes we agree that we suffer from an obsession with the city that never sleeps. "The main problem of Paris is its last metro," the writer Jerome Charyn, a regular shuttler between the West Village and Montparnasse, once told me. "The last metro is like a mark-off point where the ordinary Parisian can travel. In New York, there is no last metro."
Recently, while weathering the pains of moving out of my beloved New York apartment, I bought the most sophisticated tri-band cellphone and an e-mail-equipped digital organizer that allows me to read The New York Times online.
And after surfing the Web for trans-Atlantic flights and learning frequent-flyer tricks, I have decided that the only way to live peacefully is to accept my fate -- and shuttle between the two cities.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
This Cable Story Offers a Lesson (And a Happy Ending)

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
HINDSIGHT, of course, brings great clarity. We look back at the technological advances of the late 18th and 19th centuries -- from the steam engine and the railroad to the telephone and the automobile -- and speak of the Industrial Revolution without hesitation. The economic and social legacy of the innovations of the industrial era is apparent, while the doubts, boom-bust cycles and investment schemes are mostly forgotten. History has long since sorted out the winners from the losers, the visionaries from the charlatans.
 Whether we will ever speak of a "digital revolution" in quite the same way is not clear. At the moment, it looks doubtful, given the depressed state of most technology companies, their battered stock prices, and attendant bankruptcies and scandals. But the issue has little to do with the fate of some dot-com start-ups, the trend of personal computer sales or the current travails of telecommunications companies. 
 No, the long-term question is whether the combination of exponential growth in computing power, global networks and clever software can transform one field after another -- medicine, communications, media, manufacturing and so on. Yes, computing is, in a sense, merely a tool. But unlike hammers or screwdrivers, computers are general purpose tools, which can be used, when properly programmed, for most everything from unraveling the mysteries of the human genome to outwitting the world's chess champion. This is what helps make the digital question interesting.
If the digital revolution is to rival the Industrial Revolution in significance, it will require a lot more than technology. It will require investment, patience and entrepreneurs who care more about building something of value than trying to make a quick buck.
Anyone in search of a historical antidote to the current gloom and an inspiring narrative of entrepreneurial triumph would do well to read "A Thread Across the Ocean" (Walker & Company, $26), John Steele Gordon's account of Cyrus Field and the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. Field persevered for 12 years and through four failed attempts to lay a working telegraph cable across the Atlantic before succeeding in 1866.
Over the years, Field was alternately an object of public adulation and scorn. His personal reputation and wealth were entirely committed to the submarine cable venture. 
He was prone to seasickness, but he made 50 trans-Atlantic crossings by ship to raise money, meet with engineers and oversee operations in Britain. About to set out on one cable-laying attempt, he recalled, "When I thought of all we had passed through, of the hopes thus far disappointed, of the friends saddened by our reverses, of the few that remained to sustain us, I felt a load at my heart almost too heavy to bear, though my confidence was firm and my determination fixed." 
That mission, like others, ended in failure, and it would be eight more years before he prevailed. Talk about the entrepreneurial right stuff.
For his book, Mr. Gordon relied heavily on previous biographies of Field and accounts of the trans-Atlantic cable. Based on his footnotes, four books in particular were sources. Two were published in the 19th century: "The Story of the Atlantic Cable," by Henry M. Field, the younger brother of Cyrus, and "Cyrus W. Field, His Life and Work," edited by Isabella Field Judson, a daughter of Cyrus Field. The others are Arthur C. Clarke's "Voice Across the Sea" (1958) and "Cyrus Field: Man of Two Worlds," by Samuel Carter III (1968).
Yet Mr. Gordon's book is a masterly retelling of the cable adventure, filled with illuminating detail about the times and the people who made it happen. Field was the son of a renowned New England preacher, and his more studious brothers became distinguished lawyers and ministers. But Cyrus Field was attracted to business -- its pace, pulse and risk-taking. He went to New York and made his early fortune turning around a failing wholesaler of paper and printing supplies.
Once he had revived the business, he had little interest in running it. After he and his friend Frederic Church, the landscape painter, took a long trip to South America -- Field collecting biological specimens, Church painting -- Field became intrigued by the possibility of a trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. By connecting the old and new worlds, he recognized, the cable would have enormous business potential, reducing the speed of trans-Atlantic transmission of information from weeks by ship to just minutes or seconds and thus greatly accelerating the 19th-century wave of globalization.
IN the 1850's, Mr. Gordon writes, science and capitalism combined to engender great optimism, almost of a sense of technological manifest destiny. The journalism and oratory of the day were filled with references to the "genius of man" and "the subjugation of nature." So in 1854, Field raised $1.5 million -- a huge amount at the time, but a fraction of the eventual cost -- from a small group of similarly enthusiastic investors. Field would later recall: "God knows that none of us were aware of what we had undertaken to accomplish."
Field was no technologist, but he did his homework and had a genuine intellectual interest in the technical aspects of the cable project. It was also a time when scientists and engineers tended to be generalists -- educated and informed in other disciplines. Over the years, Field engaged all kinds of inventors, oceanographers, physicists and engineers from Samuel Morse to Isambard Kingdom Brunel. 
And he would need them all, because the trans-Atlantic cable, like the Internet, was made possible by advances in a collection of technologies, all coming together.
Field's technical education came gradually and at some cost. He and the other original investors were so lacking in knowledge in the nascent field of electrical engineering, Mr. Gordon writes, that they vastly underestimated the challenge of their trans-Atlantic project. One management lesson from "the Victorian equivalent of the Apollo project" seems to be that business timetables can be mercilessly compressed to save money and meet deadlines, but that a promising technology often takes time to percolate, through trial, error and refinement, before it comes to fruition.
Field had to wait 12 years. When the cable was finally in place and working in 1866, and a cable that had been lost at sea 13 months earlier had been recovered, Field received a six-letter message: "Both O.K."
"I left the room," he later recalled, "I went to my cabin, I locked the door; I could no longer restrain my tears -- crying like a child."

Paper or Plastic? Currency Making Is in Flux

BYLINE:  By CAROLYN MARSHALL 

 BODY:
PAPER money first appeared in China more than 13 centuries ago, and the counterfeiting industry was born soon after. But now a growing number of countries, worried about inexpensive technology that enables a counterfeiter armed with little more than a computer inkjet printer to create real-looking fakes to the untrained eye, are switching to plastic.
 Australia, which converted entirely to plastic bank notes in 1996 because of chronic counterfeiting, has turned them into an entrepreneurial export business. It licenses plastic bank-note technology used by 15 governments including those of Taiwan, Brazil and Mexico. Some of the 12 European Union members that have adopted the single currency, the euro, have been researching polymer materials for possible future use. Canada may issue a plastic $50 or $100 bill next year. The United States Treasury has tested at least four polymer compounds, seeking a plastic that might someday replace the paper greenback. 
 While the change to plastic is hardly universal, it has enormous implications for how hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of everyday cash moves through the global financial system. 
"Any time there is a redesign of banknotes, we have to redesign the hardware and software in our machines," said Richard Baggot, vice president for electronic security and currency systems at Diebold Inc., based in North Canton, Ohio, and a leading maker of currency-counting machines for big banks.
A changeover to plastic is not necessarily smooth, even though plastic notes appear to be nearly counterfeit-proof, more durable than paper and even recyclable. Replacements or adjustments are needed not only for currency counting machines but also for A.T.M.'s and vending machines. Some machines have had difficulty recognizing plastic notes, which have the look, thinness and flexibility of paper but feel smoother.
Mr. Baggot said plastic presents a new kind of challenge because its physical properties are different than those of paper. "We have to keep all of the properties intact -- the machine has to count and sort the old and new at the same time," he said.
There have been problems. Kevin Newton, a vice president for global design at Diebold, said dog-eared or nicked plastic bills have jammed some A.T.M.'s, and plastic notes with even tiny rips have been torn in half. But Mr. Newton, whose company dominates the global market for currency machinery, said the glitches so far have been minor. 
Rob Evans, director for industry marketing at NCR, a big maker of A.T.M.'s that is based in Dayton, Ohio, said the plastic bill has benefits over paper. "It stays clean and lasts a long time," he said. "It really is a nice document to dispense."
IN fact, it is now widely acknowledged in the world of paper currency that plastic means more than just credit cards. The United States, which has more paper bills in circulation than any country, at $608 billion, began to incorporate a small plastic thread into new bills in 1996, to distinguish them from counterfeits. And Treasury officials are openly complimentary of Australia's plastic notes.
"It's a very interesting product, a good product," said Thomas A. Ferguson, director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing at the Treasury Department. "Some countries have decided the economic benefits merit making the switch."
For now, the United States will keep using paper as the basic material, Mr. Ferguson said. But, he added, "that does not mean polymer won't be a factor in the future."
The shift to plastic has its roots in the advances in computers, digital scanners and inkjet printers that have made the counterfeiting of paper money easier. Governments that use paper find themselves redesigning their currencies much more often to stay a step ahead of forgeries.
"You will never eliminate counterfeiting completely; the technology is moving too fast," said James Mackin, a spokesman for the Secret Service's Counterfeit Division. 
Counterfeiting of United States bills has jumped in the last few years, Secret Service data shows: in 2001, $47.5 million of fake bank notes passed into circulation domestically, up from $39.7 million in 2000. Mr. Mackin attributed much of the increase to what he called casual counterfeiters who previously might not have had the skills or printing presses to create fake money. In 2001, Mr. Mackin said, 39 percent of all counterfeits circulating domestically were created on computers, up from half a percent in 1995.
Les Coventry, who is in charge of note issue at the Reserve Bank of Australia, talks more like a salesman than a government banker when it comes to plastic bank notes. 
Mr. Coventry said Australia's plastic, a nonporous, thin polymer sheath, resists tearing, water, sweat, oil and bacteria. But the main selling point, he said, is a transparent window embedded in the bank note that makes it impossible to copy on an inkjet printer. The bank notes are produced by Securency Ltd., a joint venture of the Reserve Bank of Australia and UCB, a Belgian chemical firm. 
"The next generation of security features will raise the technology bar," Mr. Coventry said. "And we have not started to explore the possibilities yet."
The two dozen companies that make the specialty paper for currencies around the world have clearly taken notice of the trend toward plastic. Domtar Inc., a large paper producer based in Montreal, has developed its own plastic for bank notes.
DuPont, Exxon Mobil and Agfa-Gavaert are among companies that have patented technology for the manufacture of plastic bank notes.
Others are more skeptical of plastic, particularly Crane & Company of Dalton, Mass., the sole supplier of bank-note paper to the United States Treasury. Lansing E. Crane, the chief executive of the company, which is privately held, said it was premature to conclude that plastic is superior.
"The plastic people say the main benefit is the counterfeiting deterrence. It's nonsense," he said, contending that advances in anticounterfeit technology had made paper notes just as good. The selling point of plastic, Mr. Crane said, "is its durability, and the marketplace will determine whether plastic notes stand the test of time." 
Just how long plastic notes last is unclear, partly because they have been around for only a few years. Australia says its plastic $5 note has an average circulation life of 40 months, versus six months for Australia's previous, paper version. But in many cases, the life span of paper notes in other leading industrialized countries is not much different from Australia's plastic; the United State Treasury says its typical $5 bill lasts 24 months, and the $20 bill lasts 48 months.
The Bank of Canada has not yet decided whether to use a plastic note next year, said Joseph Basile, a consultant at the bank. But the possibility arises primarily from concerns about counterfeiting.
Canada has been plagued by an epidemic of fake $100 Canadian dollar bills. Last July the police said they shut down a counterfeiting ring that had used a computer scanner and inkjet printer to produce more than 40,000 of the bills. But a new crop of fake bills, from a different source, was discovered in Newfoundland last February. And many Canadian merchants have posted signs warning that they do not accept $100 bills, fearing that they are fakes.
Canada's prototype plastic note was invented by scientists at Domtar. Raman Nayar, vice president of Domtar's product development and marketing division, described it as a layer of plastic sandwiched between two outer layers of paper. The design gives consumers the familiar feel of paper money, coupled with the durability and strength of plastic, he said. 
Domtar has sold the mill that produces the plastic to Spexel Inc. of Beauharnois, Quebec, the central bank's paper supplier. But Domtar retains the patent. "We were so high on the technology that we kept it in-house," Mr. Nayor said. "We think it will take hold worldwide in the next few years." 
Mr. Crane, whose company has supplied the United States Treasury with bank-note paper since 1879 and clearly regards the United States as its most important client, hinted that advances in plastic could eventually force him to enter that business. Asked what he would do if the United States switched to plastic, Mr. Crane said: "We're in the bank-note business. We're here to serve our customers."

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with an article listing countries that have switched to plastic bank notes from paper included an incomplete reference to Romania. While the country indeed introduced a 2,000-lei plastic note in 1999, it switched completely to plastic last year, adding denominations of 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 and 500,000 lei.

Patent IssuesHurting Big Drug Companies

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
MANY investors who fled the collapse of technology stocks have sought refuge in shares of global drug makers, traditionally known for consistent earnings growth in all kinds of economic conditions.
 Since last fall, however, the stocks of big pharmaceutical companies have tumbled amid concerns about competition from generic drugs and a slowdown in the number of products in the approval pipeline. The sell-off has left the sector trading roughly in line with the broad market. 
 The market concerns are genuine, fund managers and analysts say. Although they see some possible bargains, mainly among European companies, they advise investors to tread carefully and to resist the temptation to buy just because prices have fallen sharply. 
"There are a few companies that have come down quite a long way and don't look very well," said Emil Doerig, a manager of global pharmaceutical and health care funds for Credit Suisse Asset Management in Zurich. "Investors are of the opinion that drug companies have insufficient new products in the pipeline to compensate for old ones" whose patents are expiring. "Many products have lost patents," he added, "and generic manufacturers are challenging existing patents."
The patent assault, based on an argument that the new drugs are substantially the same as the old ones with expiring patents, has been initiated by makers of less expensive generic drugs. The patent challenges came at a particularly bad time for the industry, said Paul Kavanagh, a partner at Killik & Company, a London broker.
"Until October, big pharmaceutical companies had displayed very good outperformance and had traded up to quite high valuations," Mr. Kavanagh said. "Then, suddenly, investors wanted to buy cyclical stocks. At the same time, something more worrying started to creep into the industry. You started to see court cases by smaller companies trying to get around patents."
In a notable defeat for the big companies, a federal judge in Norfolk, Va., ruled in May that the United States patents on Augmentin, an antibiotic marketed by the large British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline, were invalid because they did not contain new inventions. But there is a good chance that Glaxo will win on appeal, Mr. Kavanagh said.
The industry has also been criticized for the types of new products it has developed. A report by Salomon Smith Barney said that a number of these drugs are "me too" products that treat the same ills in much the same way as existing drugs.
The report also noted that the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the industry in the United States, had been critical of the manufacturing standards of several large American companies, including Schering-Plough, Abbott Laboratories and Eli Lilly. Salomon recommends holding fewer shares of American drug companies than the group's stock-market weight implies and relatively more shares of their European counterparts.
As a result of the regulatory scrutiny and the challenge from generics, industry profitability has been depressed. Mr. Doerig expects this year's earnings to be within 5 percent of last year's results. "Hopefully they will recover" in 2003, he said.
Drug makers are forever searching for the next blockbuster, typically defined as a product that generates at least $1 billion in annual sales. Mr. Doerig said the delay in finding a new F.D.A. director, to replace Dr. Jane E. Henney, who resigned in early 2001, had created a bottleneck in the approval process.
"The F.D.A. has been an organization without a C.E.O.," he said. "It's not really encouraging. There is an impression that nobody is ready to take responsibility for approving new drugs. That is probably the most critical issue" facing the industry.
Mr. Doerig recommends avoiding companies that "have less attractive product profiles" -- that is, more drug patents about to expire than others -- and investing in companies "with recognized patent protections."
As in other industries, the best companies have strong managements, he said. "Some companies are more successful than others because they have vision," he said, "a focused strategy in which they concentrate on core competence, getting rid of all nonstrategic business." 
One of his favorite companies, a success based on both of those criteria, is Novartis of Switzerland. It sold off its agrochemical subsidiary in late 2000 to focus on its pharmaceutical business, and has some strong products up for approval, including treatments for arthritis and irritable-bowel syndrome.
ANALYSTS at Lehman Brothers also like Novartis, citing the success of its existing products over those of rivals. In a report on the company, they said its Lotrel drug for hypertension had been gaining market share over a drug made by Pfizer. 
Glaxo, by contrast, is struggling to bring significant new products to market, while the other big British drug maker, AstraZeneca, is straining to defend patents on old ones, Mr. Kavanagh said.
AstraZeneca expected strong revenue from Crestor, its new anticholesterol drug, but has fallen victim to the F.D.A.'s approval logjam. The company is counting on Crestor to help compensate for reduced sales of its ulcer treatment, Losec.
Mr. Kavanagh finds AstraZeneca's stock prohibitively expensive, at roughly 25 times estimated 2003 earnings. Glaxo, at about 16 times earnings, in line with Britain's stock market, offers better value, he said, but he prefers to wait until the price, down about one-fourth from its high of the last year, falls an additional 10 percent or so. 
"You're buying a market rating and market yield for a company in what is still a growth industry," he said, "but you have to see very compelling value before you would consider buying these things."

HEADLINE: Boomers' Secret Smokes Up the Closet 

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND 

 BODY:
FOR Justin, a history teacher and the father of two teenagers, the moment of drug anxiety came when his children were in elementary school. They had just been to a DARE drug education class and informed him "that it's a totally bad thing to take drugs," he said. 
 Though he approved of the overall message, their zeal put him in a fix. Justin, 50, who declined to use his last name, smokes marijuana two or three times a week. What could he tell his children without appearing to condone drug use? "I said, 'But not all drugs are bad, are they?' " 
 For Daniel, a freelance writer in North Carolina, the moment came when his son, then 4, smelled marijuana on his clothing. Daniel, 42, did what he felt most people would under the circumstances: he lied, saying it was just smoke from candles. Though his son accepted his lie, the incident nagged at Daniel, who said he smokes marijuana about once a month. "It occurred to me, how much longer can I get away with this?" he said. "Am I going to be open and upfront about it, and is that going to cause some sort of conflict?" 
As anyone who came of age around the smell of marijuana knows, drug use was supposed to follow a passing narrative arc: you had your youthful experimentation, you learned your lesson, you grew up and out of it. But for many, like Justin and Daniel, things have not worked out that way. Years after the battles about drugs with their parents, they are facing another generational hurdle -- how to reconcile their marijuana use with the demands of raising their children. "The questions are, how much do you want to continue that lifestyle, and how much do you tell your kid?" said a mother in Westchester County, N.Y. "You don't want to be a hypocrite."
This is not a ballad of chronic drug abuse and family dysfunction, but in many cases one of moderate users who have managed careers, families and social lives while sneaking an occasional joint. Most say they smoke for the same reasons they always did: to relax, listen to music or socialize. After two or more decades, they see little harm. "We never study those people," said Dr. Roger Roffman, a professor of social work at the University of Washington, where since 1983 he has studied marijuana use. Speaking hypothetically, he likened this group to the majority of drinkers, who do not progress to alcoholism.
Though statistics involving drug use are notoriously slippery, as many as 1 in 10 American parents of children under 18, or about 6 million people, said they had smoked marijuana in the preceding 12 months, according to a poll conducted last year by RoperASW. One in 20 parents, or about 3 million people, said they had smoked in the preceding month. The poll, sponsored by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, included interviews with 1,219 parents. Many people will not tell a stranger about their illegal activity, so the marijuana estimate is probably low. Because the topic involves both ille 
gal marijuana smoking and children, most people interviewed for this article were highly circumspect, often unwilling to use even their first names. One father responded by e-mail:
"Will call, but I can't let my daughter know. So I will have to find a private moment to talk. Will also have to make sure my parents don't find out.
"Oh, the irony.
"The angst."
With decidedly mixed feelings, many are now repeating the ruses of their adolescence, sneaking out on ledges as they did years ago, wondering what they'll say if they get caught.
"It was much easier to hide it from my parents," said a Brooklyn professional woman with two preteenage children, who described leaning out over an unsteady window grating to smoke. "I go to great lengths," she said. "I put towels under the door, I use baby powder to hide the smell. If I say I'm going to Costco, my baby sitter knows." 
Another man said he stuck to the tried and true, hiding his weed in the same Rolling Stones album cover he used as a child. As he figures, his children are no more likely to stumble across it there than his parents were. 
Parents, of course, have many secrets from their children, including their finances and the details of their sex lives. And some who smoke tobacco are reluctant to do it in front of the children these days, not wanting to pass on the habit.
But marijuana use comes with a unique set of conflicted feelings. For many, it still resonates as a triumphal rite of passage and stirs reminders of their own parents' cluelessness.
Yet even parents who pride themselves on being open with their children on many matters often hide their marijuana use, fearing that they will lose their parental authority or set the wrong example.
Most say they have no trouble -- and see minimal risks -- buying marijuana, a misdemeanor. Police officers and courts often look the other way or impose mild penalties, said Dr. Alfred Blumstein, professor of criminal justice at Carnegie Mellon University. "Even if they get arrested, not much is going to come of it," he said. 
Joseph A. Califano, president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, criticized what he sees as a generation refusing to grow up and take responsibility, inflicting its habits on its children.
"There's a big disconnect in values today," Mr. Califano said. "Parents of the 70's by and large think marijuana is less dangerous than teenagers of the 2000's. Parents of the 70's have mostly grown out of it, while kids see what happens to potheads in their classes."
In the short term, marijuana can impair memory and judgment, research has shown; the smoke is also carcinogenic.
Mr. Califano advised that parents be honest about their past use. 
Sam, 49, a Vermont father of two, considers himself on the extreme end of hiding his drug use from his children. If they question him, he said, he doesn't lie, he just ducks the questions. "I talk to my friends all the time about disclosure and honesty," he said. "I have friends that are more forthcoming, but I don't get it: how does talking about their experiences have a positive bearing on what their children should do?" 
The problem for those parents is a sticky one. From their own experiences, many do not consider the occasional joint a great hazard. But they fear their children smoking too often or too early in the hothouse years, when every whim tends to be taken to excess. While they draw a line between moderate use and problem use, they cannot assume their children will do so. 
"I'm hoping I can keep it from them until they're 16, 17 -- until they're old enough to deal with it," another mother of two preteenagers said of her own marijuana use. Beyond those critical years, she worried more about her own marijuana future than that of her children. "Am I going to be out there buying nickel bags when I'm 80?" she asked. "My husband has outgrown it." 
Even moderate drug use can put parents in an awkward position with their children, inverting the family roles. "I have to stand up straight and not be goofy," said a New Jersey man named Frank, 50, who has two daughters, 21 and 16. "They say, 'Dad, what's up? You're acting stupid.' It's very similar to when I was busted by my parents."
Though he keeps his infrequent marijuana use a secret, Frank does not worry that his children will follow his example. "My kids are old enough to question my choices," he said. "They see the stoners in school as wastoids. If I told them, they'd say, 'That's why you were being weird.' " 
Drug counselors warn that parental use, even in secret, can influence the behavior of children. In a 1999 survey of nearly 600 teenagers in drug treatment, one in five said they had used drugs with a parent. 
Michael Gray, a Los Angeles 16-year-old, described smoking marijuana with his father, a cabinetmaker, at first occasionally, then several times a day. When Michael progressed to methamphetamine and stopped going to school, he resented his father's attempts to discipline him. "I thought he was a hypocrite," Michael said. Now the two are in family drug therapy. "I wish he had been more of a father and told me right off it was bad," Michael said. "We were way too much like friends." 
The question of parental influence is an elusive one. When adolescent drug use doubled during the mid-1990's, after more than a decade of steady decline, a group of researchers working for the government Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration set out to test a theory -- that the rise was due to an increase in the number of parents who had smoked marijuana. The researchers combed through surveys from 1979 to 1996 to see whether the children of parents who smoked marijuana, in the past or present, were more likely to try the drug as well.
The results, available on the agency Web site (www.samhsa.gov/OAS/NHSDA/BabyBoom/toc.htm) revealed a complex pattern of parental influence. Children whose parents had smoked marijuana were indeed more likely to indulge. But after that, things got tricky.
"Whether the parent smoked marijuana in the past or in the most recent year didn't make any difference," said Dr. Denise B. Kandel, a researcher at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University who lead the group.
Parental cigarette smoking, past or current, appeared to have a stronger correlation to children's drug use than parental marijuana smoking, Dr. Kandel said. The researchers concluded that parents influence their children not according to a simple dichotomy -- by smoking or not smoking -- but by a range of attitudes and behaviors, perhaps including their style of discipline and level of parental involvement. Their own drug use was just one component among many.
"Looking at single influences doesn't work," she said. "Very often when you control for other variables the influence disappears."
As the first wave of the counterculture ages -- watching Paul McCartney approach 64 -- some members are facing the next challenge: hiding their marijuana use from their grandchildren. Nearly 100,000 Americans over 60 smoke marijuana occasionally, according to the 2000 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, a government study based on interviews with 71,764 people. Again, this estimate may be low. 
One suburban publishing professional with adolescent grandchildren said that in his 60's, he found marijuana a particularly gentle pleasure. But when his grandchildren visit, he goes into deep cover. "I've even taken to rolling cigarettes in front of them, just in case they find a roach."
His age has led him to some discretion, he said. "I would never smoke in the street," he said. "I could just imagine getting stopped, and my grandchildren reading about it in the paper." 
Even with his grandchildren, though, the game was already more precarious than he figured, he said. When he rolled the cigarette, his grandson, 8, said, "Grandpa, that looks like a joint."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Win the Debate, Not Just the Case

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT took only a few days after the Supreme Court's decision in favor of vouchers for one starkly arresting characterization of the ruling to emerge from the cacophony of reactions and shape the national discourse.
 It was, in this depiction, the most important education decision since Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 abolished the official regime of separate but equal. By four days after the ruling, when President Bush praised the ruling as "just as historic" as Brown, the linkage had appeared in newspapers and talk shows across the nation. 
 Equating the voucher ruling to the watershed constitutional moment in the struggle for racial equality was political rhetoric at its most powerful. Supporters used the historic and emotional resonance of Brown to enhance their victory in a 5-to-4 decision, the real significance of which will depend on the willingness of politicians to authorize vouchers and voters to pay for them. 
Such strategic use of language rarely occurs by chance. The story of how Brown v. Board of Education and Zelman v. Simmons-Harris became linked in one evocative image is a reminder that in a major Supreme Court case, what happens in the courtroom is often just a piece of a larger effort to shape public opinion on issues that divide not only the justices, but all society.
The linkage was the result of careful preparation by one of the major pro-voucher organizations, a libertarian public interest law firm called the Institute for Justice that has long championed alternatives to the public schools as a competitive spur to educational improvement. To the institute's free-marketeers, invoking Brown v. Board of Education both rescued vouchers from the church-state morass and gave the issue a public appeal that economic theory alone could never provide. 
The Institute for Justice did not originate the Brown analogy. The theme was central to the work of a public policy professor at New York University, Joseph P. Viteritti, whose book, "Choosing Equality," is often cited by voucher supporters. Professor Viteritti declared in the book's opening that the "awesome mandate" of Brown was his starting point for a discussion of how to increase equal opportunity in education.
Clint Bolick, the Institute for Justice's vice president, saw the linkage for its value to both his legal and media game plan. "One of our strategies was to distill the message, not only for the court but in the court of public opinion," he said. "We wanted to make sure this was seen not as a case about religion but about education. If the court perceived it as a religion case, then we would be in serious trouble. If they saw it as an education case, then we would win."
Success in shaping public policy, Mr. Bolick said, often requires "translating complex issues into compelling themes."
The Institute for Justice represented Cleveland parents with children in the voucher program, appealing on their behalf a federal appeals court's ruling that it was unconstitutional to use public money for religious school tuition.
In his initial petition last spring, Mr. Bolick framed the issue as one of equality, only secondarily involving church and state. "Forty-seven years have passed since this court made a sacred promise of equal educational opportunities regardless of race," he wrote in the opening sentence. His brief on the merits of the case echoed the theme, asserting that private schools should be opened to poor children just as white schools were opened to black children.
When the day came for the Supreme Court to announce its decision, Mr. Bolick was outside on the plaza, armed with two sound bites. One was that the case was "the Super Bowl for school choice, and the kids won." The other was that it was the most important decision since Brown. 
The Brown analogy took off. The conservative columnist George F. Will wrote, "Happily, yesterday, socially disadvantaged children had their best day in court since Brown v. Board of Education in 1954." Others, including Rod Paige, the secretary of education, echoed the theme over the first weekend. President Bush's invocation of Brown on July 1 was widely interpreted as an effort to appeal to black voters.
But the black community is not unified in support of vouchers and, among voucher supporters, the Brown analogy could prove offensive. The Black Alliance for Educational Options, a leading pro-voucher group, steered clear of the linkage in the brief it filed at the court.
DR. HOWARD L. FULLER, the alliance's chairman and a former superintendent of schools in Milwaukee, said the omission was deliberate. "I'm not criticizing anyone, but I tend to be very careful about equating anything we do to the historic civil rights movement," he said. "I don't believe in connecting the new to the old just to give legitimacy to the new." While calling the voucher decision "revolutionary in its own way," he said "its value has to be based on its own merit."
Theodore M. Shaw, associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., was less circumspect. "The notion that this is comparable to Brown is just extraordinary," he said, noting that while valuing his Catholic school education, he opposed vouchers.
"It's not the answer for the vast majority of black students, who will remain in the public schools with no systemic reform and no systemic commitment of resources," Mr. Shaw said. "At a time when we're fighting an ideological march toward color-blindness, all of a sudden race is all over this issue." Other black leaders, including Julian Bond, chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., have denounced the linkage.
Though this may suggest that the Institute for Justice's strategy has been divisive, the fact is that the public debate is now taking place on the institute's terms: Brown v. Board and not church v. state.

HEADLINE: Boys to Men: Fashion Pack Turns Younger 

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA 

 BODY:
DANNY HACKETT steamed down a corridor at the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, N.Y., fueled by a mighty adrenaline rush. 
 Mr. Hackett, 25, who manages e-mail systems for Reuters America, the news agency, spent his day off scouring the Long Island mall. He prowls its shops three or four times a month, scouting for bargains and spending an average of $100 on clothes and accessories each visit. Last Wednesday afternoon, he bagged a black zip-front pullover at Armani AX, which he had plucked from the linen and cotton shirts piled pell-mell on the sales tables. "I've just gone through the whole $19.99 table," Mr. Hackett said, flushed with the thrill of the chase. "I was going crazy." 
 His shopping zeal used to be rare among men his age, but it is increasingly the norm. For a new breed of teenage boys and young men, clothes shopping, once a chore, is now a pleasurable pastime, a form of recreation, self-expression, even fulfillment, motivations rarely acknowledged in their fathers' day, but that young men now share with female contemporaries. 
"Young men are the new generation of consumers," said Candace Corlett, a partner in WSL Strategic Retail, a New York consulting firm. "They shop for clothing more like women than they do like older men, and are becoming pretty passionate shoppers." A study by WSL of American shopping patterns released in January found that the habits of men 18 to 34 closely mirrored those of women their age. Young men reported that they increasingly visited the kinds of places where women traditionally shop for clothes, particularly specialty retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Hot Topic and Structure. 
Another report, by the NPD Group, noted that overall retail sales of men's wear, an industry gravely troubled by the slow economy and the shift to casual styles, dropped $4 billion in 2001 from the previous year, but the youngest shoppers represent a bright spot. Men 18 to 24 actually increased their spending by 2.5 percent, to $9.2 billion, the only group that spent more, not less, on clothing.
"Over the last two years," said Terry J. Lundgren, president of Federated Department Stores, the owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, "the young women's market has been the hot category in apparel, but now young men's is what really is catching fire." This year Federated reported a growth of more than 10 percent in young men's apparel, "significant in an environment where sales have been flat or or even slightly negative," Mr. Lundgren said. 
The growth is coming especially from so-called urban brands like Sean Jean and Ecko, whose recent dressier styles like plush sweaters and calf-length coats are garnering a mainstream following. Other popular looks include weathered low-rider jeans and stretch fabric dress shirts in a variety of colors. 
Young men these days share with young women a heightened brand awareness, a tendency to buy on impulse and a predilection for clothes that are simpler, more close-fitting and sexier than in the past.
What is more, they tend to view shopping both as a means to an end -- dressing appropriately, and stylishly, for dates or the job -- and, increasingly, as an end in itself. And the taste for Gucci logo belts, Burberry shirts, Gap khakis and Mavi rinsed jeans is skewing ever younger. The NPD reports that boys 13 to 17 spent $7.9 billion on clothes in 2001, up $1.8 billion from 1999. It is not unusual these days to see teenage boys roaming the malls in packs, just as girls do, chattering animatedly among themselves and spending their weekly allowances, along with their own meager earnings, on jeans, designer sunglasses, roomy logo T-shirts and loose-fitting khaki-tone cargo shorts, sneakers and square-toed leather shoes.
"They want what's new and they want to fit in," said Marsha Drogin Dayan, the owner of Marsha D.D., an Upper East Side purveyor of jeans, khakis and casual tops for boys. "That's their fashion sense.They drop in two or three times a week to see what's new, and I don't see them as embarrassed at all."
Colleen Flynn, the mother of three teenage boys in Manhattan, said her sons shopped often and enthusiastically at a variety of stores, showing a marked taste for luxury labels like Burberry. She conceded that her sons' unconcealed consumer lust left her slightly nonplused. "I don't remember boys shopping this way when I was that age," Ms. Flynn said.
What, then, would she make of Mike Arana, who was shopping the other day at Express for Men at Roosevelt Field, his hair spiked, his eyebrows shaped and waxed, wearing a loose T-shirt and Express jeans. Mike, 14, had ventured inside to check out the the denims and dress shirts that are his club wear of choice. 
"I love shopping," he said almost boastfully before vanishing into a fitting room with an armful of bright-colored stretch cotton shirts. "It is my favorite thing to do." 
Not surprisingly, that sort of ardor has given rise to brisk marketing efforts aimed at teenage boys and young men through their early 30's. "The young men's area certainly has become more of a focus for us in the men's world," said Randy Heil, the fashion director of Macy's San Francisco. Mr. Heil, who was hired two years ago expressly to build the young men's category, added: "We do believe young men's is a large customer base and we're spending a lot of time, effort and money to attract that customer."
The store has broadened its selection of urban labels like Enyce and Ecko and surfwear labels like Hurley and Quicksilver, and dressier club wear, brands like CK Calvin Klein Jeans. 
Scoop, the popular New York-based chain of young women's boutiques, opened its first men's shop in Miami this year and plans to add a men's store on the Upper East Side of Manhattan next month. Uzi Ben-Avraham, a co-owner, plans to stock labels like Helmut Lang and Paul Smith alongside Pepe Jeans and Levis, aiming the selection at a fashion-conscious clientele. 
They are shoppers like Chris Colon, 29, who browsed the Fifth Avenue store of H&M, the cheap chic chain from Sweden, last Friday with no particular goal in mind. Mr. Colon, who works in the operations department at Salomon Smith Barney, and wore a salmon pink shirt from Banana Republic, finds clothes shopping both relaxing and gratifying. "I like to treat myself," he said. "You work hard so you want to enjoy what you have." 
A fan of Latin music and hip-hop, he also buys CD's, but finds himself shopping more often for clothes, at least once a week, usually during lunch hour. "It's a good way to get out of the office," he said.
Several yards away, Tod Michael, 20, an actor who recently moved to New York from Portland, Ore., considered a denim newsboy cap and sleeveless gray wool sweater. "For me shopping is recreation," said Mr. Michael, who was dressed in a pleat-front black linen shirt from Structure and boot-cut pants. "I like to buy fun things, not basic things I already have."
Young men are dressing these days with a new refinement and style-consciousness, retailers say. "For a while they were all caught up in the casualization of America trend -- T-shirts and khakis and five-pocket jeans," Mr. Lundgren said. "Today they are dressing up, responding to a great deal of fashion that has been injected into the business." 
Indeed, at stores like H&M youthful customers are gravitating toward the exotic or unusual. The store says its Moroccan-style denim men's tunics offered last May sold out within a month. 
Few younger men need to be prodded to shop, dressing and spending on their own steam. "Guys have always shared a pack look, like girls," said Ms. Corlett, the retail consultant. "The difference now is that the guys are dressing themselves and not sending mom out to 'buy me this or that.' " 
Their alacrity stems from having grown up in households where mothers work, Ms. Corlett said. "These moms tend to leave $50 on the counter and say, 'Get your own jeans for the dance Friday night.' " 
Many men no longer find clothes-shopping stigmatizing. The younger ones, especially, are "liberated from the fear that shopping will brand them as insufficiently masculine," said Michael Weiss, president of the Limited brand's new Express for Men stores. He added that starting at the age of 14, "boys are coming to the realization that it's O.K. to cry at a movie and maybe to buy a pink shirt."
Express for Men, formerly known as Structure, has seized on this shift in attitude as a business opportunity, balancing its inventory of casual styles with $90 jeans, $300 suits and $600 shearling maxicoats. 
"Young men are interested in looking cool and they are where the growth is," Mr. Weiss said. "A lot of guys have had enough of that sloppy, beat up collegiate look, the clothing equivalent of beer." 
He might have been thinking of Thomas McGlynn, 19, who strolled into the Roosevelt Field Mall's men's Express and made a beeline for a wall of gem-tone stretch cotton shirts. A devout reader of magazines like Maxim and Gourmet, Mr. McGlynn drops about $150 a month on clothes from stores like Kenneth Cole and Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan, and on grooming products like Aveda hair balms. 
Michael Gerbovnka, a 27-year-old finance manager for a cosmetics company, lives in Hoboken, N.J., but shops in Manhattan on his lunch hour. At H&M, he inspected a pair of $50 dark-washed, sand-caked jeans. "I've gotten into trendier clothes," Mr. Gerbovnka said. He was heading for the door, when a stack of T-shirts stopped him in his tracks. "When I find just the right dark one to wear with my jeans, then I'll be set to go."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Charles Sheedy and Fayez Sarofim; 
Dreyfus Premier Core Equity Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
CHARLES SHEEDY, co-manager of the $53.6 million Dreyfus Premier Core Equity fund, hews to what he calls the Darwinian theory of investing.
 "We believe that size begets size and financial and economic muscle rise to the top," Mr. Sheedy said from his office in Houston. 
 He seeks those qualities in American companies with strong global businesses. "Over the long term," he said, "economies with fast-growing incomes will participate in the consumptive patterns that the United States has been experiencing since World War II." 
Currently, one-third of the portfolio companies' earnings are generated abroad, but he expects that to change as domestic sales stay flat and global growth accelerates.
Mr. Sheedy projects general corporate earnings growth of 7.5 percent to 9 percent a year, on average, in the United States over the next five years, compared with earnings growth abroad in the high single digits, up from 5 percent or so.
The fund lost 7.2 percent a year, on average, adjusted for the maximum 5.75 percent load, for the three years through June, according to Morningstar Inc., compared with losses of 8.6 percent for its group of large-capitalization blend funds and 9.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The fund lost 18.2 percent for the 12 months through June, versus losses of 18.9 percent for its group and 18.0 percent for the S.& P. 500.
The other co-manager of the fund is Fayez Sarofim, 73, the chairman of Fayez Sarofim & Company, the fund's subadviser. Mr. Sheedy, 55, is senior vice president of that firm.
The managers pick the fund's 45 to 55 stocks from among about 450 multinational companies based in the United States. 
They prefer companies that dominate their market niches because of low-cost production or strong marketing or distribution systems. "We won't buy the No. 3 company in an industry, unless it is moving rapidly to supplant No. 1 or No. 2," Mr. Sheedy said.
Critics regard many such companies as mature businesses, but that doesn't faze Mr. Sheedy. "Our companies have plenty of free cash flow, which means more money for marketing programs, research and development, dividend increases and stock repurchases," he said. "And they often have rapidly growing foreign components."
The fund managers meet often with company executives. "We want to learn how well they have reinvested free cash flow over the last three to five years," Mr. Sheedy said, "and what returns we can expect now on their invested capital."
The managers aim to hold positions at least three to five years, creating an unusually low turnover rate. It was just 4 percen in 2001, compared with 90 percent for all large-cap blend funds, Morningstar said.
They sell shares when the companies' earnings prospects or balance sheets deteriorate, or when shares become overvalued, based on price-to-earnings multiples relative to their industry, their own history and the S.& P. 500.
MR. SHEEDY calls the American International Group, the insurer based in New York, the "most multinational of the companies we own." In April 2001, he and Mr. Sarofim bought shares of American General, anticipating its buyout by A.I.G. that August. They paid $73.60, on average, for the shares, which, as A.I.G., now trade at $63.50. Overseas revenue accounted for about 41 percent of the company's total last year and more than 50 percent of its 2001 operating profit, he said, adding that A.I.G. has a strong balance sheet and few competitors in its global insurance business.
Mr. Sheedy first bought shares of Kraft Foods in April. The fund paid $42.29, on average, for the shares, which now trade at $35.99. The company has predictable earnings growth, which is particularly attractive in today's economy, he said. "Kraft can knock out 10 to 12 percent earnings growth over the next three to five years," he said, "which it proved it could do over the last year in the depths of the recession." Kraft generates about 25 percent of its revenue overseas and that should increase, he said.
Mr. Sheedy says Eli Lilly, the pharmaceuticals maker, is "cheap relative to its prospects." Shares trade for just over 19 times estimated 2002 earnings, and he expects a resurgence of sales and earnings growth starting in the second quarter of 2003.
He believes that Lilly has one of the best late-stage new product pipelines in the industry and has no significant risks of major patent expiration for the next two to three years. The fund first bought shares in May 2001, paying $83.87, on average. They closed on Friday at $50.26.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Doctors Are Most Definitely In 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
ENRON. Global Crossing. Kmart. Soon, probably WorldCom.
 For investors, these spectacular corporate flameouts represent the perfect storm. But for a cadre of Wall Street bankers, they are opportunities. 
 When the markets were soaring in the late 1990's, this crowd of bankruptcy reorganization specialists was praying for rain. Lately, the rain has become a downpour. "This is boom time," said Henry S. Miller, a leading restructuring guru, unabashed by the paradox that his good fortune happens because of the misfortune of others. "It's just the way it is. This is our time." 
These days, when big corporate filings for bankruptcy protection seem to be made almost every week, there is a line forming outside the half-dozen corporate emergency rooms in Midtown Manhattan. And the nation's top doctors in that trauma field -- Mr. Miller, who recently turned the restructuring group he ran at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein into an independent firm, and Arthur B. Newman of the Blackstone Group, and the team at Lazard -- are actually turning away battered patients.
Business is so good, so lucrative, that Harvey R. Miller, a prominent bankruptcy lawyer, announced last week that he would soon leave his post as head of the bankruptcy practice at Weil, Gotshal & Manges to become a bankruptcy banker at Greenhill & Company, a small merchant bank that jumped into the business only two years ago.
Mr. Newman, whose restructuring staff numbers about 40, is now working on two of the largest reorganizations in history: those of Enron and Global Crossing, as well as that of the Williams Communications Group. He just finished repairing Chiquita Brands International and AMF Bowling Worldwide, not to mention helping to reorganize Xerox, which brushed with but avoided bankruptcy. Mr. Miller, whose full-time staff at the newly formed Miller Buckfire Lewis & Company is a bit smaller, is trying to turn around Kmart and Polaroid as well as Reliance Group Holdings.
Last week, Lazard's restructuring group, led by Barry Ridings and Terry Savage, landed what may become the biggest bankruptcy bounty of them all when WorldCom hired them as advisors. Adelphia Communications, AES and Reliant Energy also hired Lazard this summer. Its team numbers 35.
A handful of other boutique investment banks are also busy trying to mend tattered companies and advise upset creditors. Among them are Rothschild North America, which is working for PG&E, and Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, which is working for XO Communications. 
The firms can make money from any angle: in some cases, the advisers represent distressed companies and, in others, their creditors.
There is no question that the business of corporate restructuring, once a backwater, has grown into a big business in recent years. With that growth has come big fees, which vary from deal to deal but are typically based on a percentage of assets sold during the process as well as a bonus if the restructuring is consummated. 
Kmart, for example, will pay Henry Miller's firm 0.4 percent of the value of any asset sale, plus a monthly fee, and a $12.5 million bonus if the restructuring of the company is completed. If the entire company is sold, the bonus could reach $17.5 million.
Add up the fees, and the figure for each bankruptcy is huge. The reorganization of Enron is likely to generate as much as $400 million in fees for bankers, lawyers and consultants. Of that amount, Blackstone will get either $35 million or 0.25 percent of the restructured obligations on top of the $10 million it already received for selling Enron's trading business to UBS Warburg.
Fees from Global Crossing's reorganization are expected to top $300 million. All told, industry analysts estimate that cleaning up corporate messes will net more than $5 billion in fees this year for the firms like those of Mr. Newman and Mr. Miller.
Personally, they take home seven figures a year.
"For most of the time, us restructuring guys were on the fringe; we were niche players," Henry Miller said. "Now we're getting some respect."
ADVISERS like him and Mr. Newman are not exactly a beloved bunch, of course. "It's nice to be pretty busy, but it's not good for the country," Mr. Newman acknowledged. Outraged creditors sometimes compare them to ambulance chasers and often fight to prevent them from taking in big fees. The creditors argue that the money should be used to rescue the failing companies, not to line the pockets of Wall Street bankers. Bankruptcy court judges, too, often limit the size of the paydays.
But bankruptcy advisers respond that they earn the money, especially now.
Restructuring advisers spend their time adjusting troubled companies' business plans, cutting deals with creditors and courts, and planning and negotiating the sale of assets. Their jobs are arguably more complex, and probably more important, than the roles of the traditional investment banker, who advises a company on whether to buy another company and how much to pay.
Since the last big economic downturn, in the early 1990's, the bankruptcy business has changed fundamentally. It is no longer just a matter of working out new financing. "The cases have gotten so big, and all of these cases have many more problems than before," Harvey Miller said. "Ten years ago, all you had to do was deleverage the company and that was it."
More than ever, companies seeking bankruptcy reorganization suffer from a web of corporate problems, not only an overload of debt. Scandal, potential legal liabilities and complex accounting sometimes push companies over the line.
The latest crop of companies in reorganization is beholden to a much expanded array of constituencies with interests in the outcome, including banks -- with collateral and without -- bondholders, shareholders, suppliers, partners and vulture capitalists who buy debt from others at distressed prices.
As a result, the work is ever more complex. 
"The business of restructuring is now a professional business" with people whose careers are devoted exclusively to it, said Mr. Newman, who started in the business in 1966, while he was director of the corporate finance group at Ernst & Young. "It has professional lawyers, professional bankers, professional accountants and professional distressed players. It used to not be like this."
Mr. Newman and Henry Miller are the elder banking advisers of this small but growing restructuring circle, partly because they have specialized in it for so long. 
Mr. Newman, 58, became very active in reorganizations in 1976, while still at Ernst & Young. There, he would work on the bankruptcies of companies like Eastern Airlines and Texaco during the 1980's. He headed the reorganization group at Chemical Bank for two years before jumping to Blackstone in 1991. He has been adviser to debtors or creditors in bankruptcies including Caldor, Dow Corning, R. H. Macy, Loehmann's and Marvel Entertainment.
"Art is the dean of financial advisers," said Steven G. Warshaw, the former president and chief executive of Chiquita, which underwent a successful reorganization -- led by Blackstone -- and emerged from bankruptcy court in March. The company was hurt by a glut of bananas and a long battle over European banana import quotas. Blackstone helped form a settlement among five groups of creditors that reduced Chiquita's $950 million debt load by $700 million. Instead of the money owed them, holders of senior notes received 88 percent of the equity in the reorganized company.
Henry Miller, who is 57, made his name in the 1980's as the head of the private finance group at Lehman Brothers, mainly working for airlines. Their problems in the late 1980's propelled him into bankruptcy workouts. In the 1990's, he ran the restructuring groups at Salomon Smith Barney, Prudential Securities and, most recently, at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. He has worked on the reorganizations of Pathmark Stores, Montgomery Ward and Trans World Airlines, among others.
He said the new group of creditors -- all with different agendas -- has made his job that much more difficult. "They're more antagonistic," he said. "They are getting in the company's pockets much more quickly." 
In fact, some creditors now organize into committees and seek high-priced advisers like Mr. Miller and Mr. Newman even before the companies file for bankruptcy.
"The bondholders are now organizing themselves faster than the company," said Scott Bok, a partner at Greenhill. "They're more sophisticated."
One prominent bankruptcy lawyer who has represented several creditor committees against many of Mr. Miller's clients contends that the creditors' committees have to be more aggressive or risk not getting a fair settlement. "We're having to get in there earlier because these characters are always trying to squeeze us," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he said he could not afford to alienate the advisers.
At WorldCom, where management has hinted at a potential bankruptcy filing but has not gone to court, three sets of bondholders tapped separate law firms last week and have begun interviewing financial advisers.
Harvey Miller, who has been the main legal adviser on several of the biggest bankruptcy restructurings, including those of Texaco in the late 1980's and of R. H. Macy in the early 1990's, suggested that companies are also moving more quickly these days.
"The burn rates are so high," he said, referring to the speed at which distressed companies spend more than they take in, that those companies need to become organized early enough to protect themselves, especially "as the availability of refinancing quickly dwindles."
AES and Reliant Energy fall into that category.
With many major banks like Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase suffering from big exposure to bad loans, banks are significantly less lenient about refinancing than in the early 1990's, Henry Miller said.
"They are being more aggressive than they have ever been," he added, suggesting that there is too much "preliquidation planning" -- an unhealthy emphasis on preparing for insolvency rather than focusing on saving the company. "Unfortunately, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy," he said.
Mr. Newman, Henry Miller and, now, Harvey Miller have another thing going for them. The business of advising on restructurings has been left mainly to small boutiques like theirs because the large Wall Street investment banks have too many potential conflicts of interest. For them, the profit margin -- no matter the current size of fees -- is too small.
In a landmark case in 1993, a federal appeals court said Goldman, Sachs could not advise Eagle-Picher, a maker of automobile components and industrial products in Cincinnati, on its bankruptcy reorganization because it was not a "disinterested person." Goldman had been the lead underwriter of Eagle-Picher's $39.8 million initial public stock offering in 1986 and had been the company's investment adviser.
Goldman had argued that because of its experience with the company, it should be considered the most qualified to help in the reorganization. In fact, the court appeared to agree, at one point apologizing for its decision. "Although it may make little sense to the bankruptcy court and Eagle-Picher -- or for that matter, to this court -- that Goldman, Sachs is not permitted to serve as financial adviser, the statute requires that result," the appeals court said. "This court is bound to apply the plain meaning of the statute even when the application apparently results in an apparent anomaly."
IN a case in 1995 that eliminated virtually all big banks from advising on major reorganizations, Lehman Brothers was forced by a bankruptcy court to return $1 million in fees for advising Federated Department Stores on its bankruptcy reorganization. Lehman received $250,000 a month in those proceedings, according to court filings, but the court sided with trustees that argued that Lehman had a conflict of interest because it had "numerous holdings of Federated securities" and had been the lead manager in a $200 million offering of Federated bonds.
It was the potential for conflicts that influenced Henry Miller, no relation to Harvey Miller, to take his Dresdner group independent. He had been forced to turn away business because of Dresdner's relationships with potential reorganization clients. "The Chinese wall doesn't hold for the adviser," he explained.
Moreover, he said, the economics of running a restructuring department -- which is a cyclical business -- do not make sense for a big bank. "It's not a big-enough business if you're a Goldman, Sachs," he said. "The internal economics are hard to reconcile. A $70- or $80-million-a-year business would be a bad performer for a big investment bank."
Even so, those involved in bankruptcies always seem to be fighting over fees. In the last five years, experts estimate that total fees have ballooned nearly 25 percent, in part because so many advisers are being hired.
For example, Global Crossing, the troubled telecommunications company, has already racked up bills from 20 firms totaling more than $18 million. They cover everything from hourly legal charges and faxes to plane tickets, Internet searches and phone calls since late January, when Global filed for bankruptcy protection, people close to the company said. 
Mr. Newman's group alone is taking in $250,000 a month and stands to make millions more in so-called success fees if the company emerges from bankruptcy.
Lawyers and consultants are Global Crossing's biggest beneficiaries, at least so far. KPMG, the large international accounting firm, has billed about $4 million since February just for work related to operations in Bermuda, where Global is based. 
KPMG has charged more than twice as much for its services as had Arthur Andersen, Global Crossing's accountant in the United States, which billed more than $800,000 for a month of work after the filing. Deloitte & Touche, which is working directly for the creditors' committee, has not yet submitted its fee requests.
Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the lead bankruptcy counsel, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, which serves as litigation and tax counsel, have together billed Global Crossing more than $2.2 million so far.
"No one would dispute they get paid a fair amount of money," said Mr. Warshaw, formerly of Chiquita. "But there is a lot of value there to protect. And these firms basically get success fees, so if they fail they get basically nothing."
LATELY, some law firms have tried to charge extra fees, too -- the way that some do for the successful completion of a merger on which they advise, a charge beyond their usual hourly fee. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Weil, Gotshal are among them. 
"The bankers are getting an outrageous sum of money," said one bankruptcy lawyer, who did not want to be identified because he sometimes works with them. "Why shouldn't we get a cut? Half the time we're doing more of the work than them."
Henry Miller disagreed. "People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones," he said. "They are being paid by the hour. Their fees are rarely at risk."
Some judges apparently agree. Judge Mary F. Walrath of the Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., recently rejected $1 million in success fees in the case of the bankrupt United Companies Financial Corporation, a once-prosperous lender to borrowers who could not qualify for traditional loans, for both Wachtell, Lipton and Weil, Gotshal.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Waiting For the Green Light On Stocks

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
UNLESS something remarkable happens over the next six months, 2002 will be the third consecutive year of declines in major United States stock market averages. The last time that happened was 60 years ago. 
 Since the market peak in March 2000, roughly $7 trillion in stock wealth has evaporated, leaving about $10.5 trillion. 
 Christopher J. Wolfe, equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Private Bank, which supervises about $270 billion, took time last week to discuss market prospects. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Major market averages are now at levels not seen since 1997. Are we close to a bottom?

A. I can't pick the exact bottom. I can pick a range where things look unambiguously attractive.
If the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which closed on Friday at 921.39, were to fall into the high 800's, we would move to an overweight position in equities, assuming there is not a further deterioration in our macroeconomic outlook. A decline to that level would suggest a further correction in technology and that financials, the biggest sector of the index at around 20 percent, had also corrected.

Q. The economy appears to be doing better, and interest rates are low. Historically, that has been a prescription for higher stock prices. Why isn't that happening now?

A. The disconnect between the economy and companies lies on the revenue line, and on the willingness of companies to make investments.
It is our view that companies will not return to the heyday of healthy operating margins that we saw in the late 1990's for several more years. 
We would change that opinion dramatically if world economic growth is stronger than we expect. The world is geared for growth of 4 percent or more. If that happens, it would not be unrealistic to see the S.& P. index move back up to the 1,050-to-1,100 range, because it would have a great effect on earnings. But we think world growth will be more like 2.5 percent to 3 percent.

Q. Accounting issues are very much on the market's mind. Isn't that concern likely to continue?

A. The possibility exists that more companies will come out of the woodwork with mistakes. As a result, the risk of owning equities is higher.
A lot of companies have changed auditors, and friends of mine in the profession tell me it takes at least six months to nine months to get to know how a company operates. So we think accounting issues will be around until at least next year.

Q. The Nasdaq composite is down nearly 75 percent from its peak. But you see more weakness ahead for technology. Why?

A. We have seen revenue pressures in technology land. Overall demand for goods and services has been dropping, and pricing is still deflating. Capacity utilization in technology is at a 35-year low. That is important in that it affects pricing decisions. It is likely that the sustained growth rate for the group over the next few years will be in the single digits. That will be a big drag on the S.& P. 500.

Q. What other sectors are you avoiding?

A. Utilities, energy and health care.
Since Enron, utility revenue growth rates have fallen and are probably along the lines of 3 percent to 5 percent. As a group, the stocks trade at an average of 10 times earnings. They need to get to multiples of 7 to 8. 
A lot of health care companies have not misexecuted, but we have government regulation. This is another big sector of the S.& P. with limited or less-than-expected growth prospects. We need to see much lower multiples in big pharmaceutical stocks, for example. We aren't there yet. Collectively, technology, utilities, energy and health care account for about 40 percent of the S.& P. 500 index.

Q. So what appeals in the other 60 percent of the index?

A. We are talking to clients these days about companies in the materials products business, be it specialty chemicals or copper. Names in this area include Freeport- McMoRan Copper and Gold, Phelps Dodge and International Flavors and Fragrances. We also like equipment companies like Deere and Agco.
We are also looking at the consumer story, companies that are niche plays doing things with their assets, like Jones Apparel Group or Nike. They don't have the cheapest values, but they are attractive. 
The last group is financials. We like insurance companies, like MetLife, and some insurance brokers, like Marsh & McLennan. 
And regional banks like Hibernia, SouthTrust and Compass Bancshares have supercheap valuations. Loan quality is going up, nonperforming assets are going down and they are still adding to their reserves.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Seeing Business Through Hollywood's Lens

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:
EVEN as the Enron scandal was unfolding last October, there was already a movie in the nation's theaters about an evil energy company that increased its profits by creating a false scarcity for its products.
 That the film was a computer-animated fantasy for youngsters -- "Monsters, Inc.," which imagined a world where power was generated by harnessing children's screams -- makes its prescience seem even more striking. Hollywood may be more focused on entertainment than social realism, but it does have a way of seizing the spirit of the times, of instinctively translating reality into the terms of popular culture. 
 This transformative process is particularly evident when the subject is the vast and complex role of business in American society. If business is the font from which all of America's material blessings flow, it is also a power that sometimes seems to function without a heart or conscience. From the beginning of the movies in the late 19th century, the medium has grappled with this central ambivalence of American life. 
Big Business began its movie career as a largely invisible force. High finance was so remote from the lives of the immigrant audience that filled the nickelodeons that there was no real need to depict it. 
D. W. Griffith, the filmmaker most often credited with turning movies into an art form, created a striking exception to that rule in 1909 with "A Corner in Wheat," a one-reel adaptation of Frank Norris's novel "The Pit." In a running time of less than 12 minutes, Griffith's film not only personalizes business but offers punishment when profiteering outstrips concern for social good. A ruthless plutocrat decides to corner the world market in wheat; innovative cross-cutting depicts the disastrous effects his manipulations have on farmers and consumers. The climax finds the tycoon trapped in a grain elevator, where he drowns in a cascade of wheat.
The business boom of the 1920's accelerated the country's transition from a rural to an urban society. But a decade that began by celebrating the economic and social liberation embodied by the free-living flapper ended in disillusionment, with films like King Vidor's "The Crowd" and Paul Fejos's "Lonesome" (both 1928) depicting the human cost, in isolation and loss of identity, of the vast, impersonal business environment.
The crash of 1929 might have been expected to produce a flood of anti-business films, but Hollywood is not always so direct. Instead, while the nation suffered collectively, the movies spun fantasies of individual success and personal prosperity. Warner Brothers, the most fervently populist of the studios, began issuing a series of films glorifying the lives of young, energetic entrepreneurs operating outside of social rules, otherwise known as gangsters ("Little Cesar" and "Public Enemy," both 1930, set the pattern).
Gangsterish behavior bled over into the Warner films more directly concerned with business. Alfred E. Green's astoundingly blunt "Baby Face" (1933) concerns an ex-prostitute (Barbara Stanwyck) who sleeps her way to the top of a New York corporation; "The Match King" (1932), directed by Howard Bretherton, is a fictionalized account of the life of the entrepreneur Ivan Krueger, played by Warren William as a charming cad who rises from Chicago janitor to global monopolist.
The self-censorship required by the Production Code, put in effect in 1933, effectively ended Hollywood's romance with both the gangster-businessman and the businessman-gangster. And the new federal regulation of the stock market sapped the vision of the businessman's vigor. In the screwball comedies that through the rest of the Depression, businessmen appeared as benign, rotund figures, usually played by Eugene Pallette ("My Man Godfrey") or the slightly harder-edged Edward Arnold ("Easy Living"), grappling with the demands of ditzy society wives and spoiled offspring.
At the end of World War II, with foreign powers vanquished and the great evils of Nazism and fascism uprooted, filmmakers began to look at the evil within. The businessman emerged, centerscreen, as a sinister figure. The way was paved by Orson Welles's "Citizen Kane" (1942), about a newspaper tycoon who tries to buy and sell love, friendship and political influence. 
Soldiers returned home to find a transformed country, ruled by corporations grown huge on wartime contracts. Frank Capra, who had once used a banker as a hero (in his 1932 "American Madness," loosely based on the Bank of America's A. P. Giannini), made Mr. Potter, the miserly businessman played by Lionel Barrymore, the ultimate villain of his postwar "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946). Potter's mission was an explicitly corporatist one: to buy out all of the small businessmen and independent operators, and unite the world under the dark flag of Pottersville.
THE postwar film noir described the hopeless struggle of the individual against fate -- an abstract notion that with economic as well as metaphysical implications. Thrillers like John Farrow's "Big Clock" (1948) and John Huston's "Asphalt Jungle" (1950) found their heavies in apparently respectable businessmen who were actually fronts for crime and corruption -- a tradition revived in 1974 by Roman Polanski's "Chinatown," in which Huston, wearing his acting hat, played a Los Angeles real estate mogul with more than one dirty secret in his past.
But as the film noir faded away -- its implicit social protest squelched by the Red Scare and Technicolor -- the focus returned to individuals within the system. In social melodramas like "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit" (1956), junior executives struggled with the conflicting demands of work and family. The advertising industry proved to be a ripe field for comedy, providing the background for several of Doris Day's pre-feminist studies of women in the workplace ("Lover Come Back," 1961; "The Thrill of It All," 1963), as well as for Frank Tashlin's hilarious reworking of the Faust story in "Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?" (1957).
It was Oliver Stone, the son of a stockbroker, who brought the business world back to center stage with his 1987 "Wall Street," a portrait at once admiring and appalled of an unabashedly avaricious mergers and acquisitions specialist with the expressively amphibian name Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). "Greed is good!" Gekko famously proclaimed, Stone's way of parodying the gung-ho supply-side philosophy of the Reagan administration. The same cry was echoed without irony 14 years later by the unscrupulous young traders portrayed in Ben Younger's "The Boiler Room," for whom "Wall Street" was an inspiration.
The current wave of scandals engulfing Wall Street makes even Mr. Stone's fervid vision of avarice seem timid. Movie businessmen have successively been heroes, clowns, cosmic villains and cynical role models, their moral stock constantly going up and down, if not necessarily in sync with the market. It's possible that future films, inspired by the examples of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Arthur Andersen, Adelphia, Rite Aid and Dynegy, will portray businessmen as craven sneak thieves, with their hands in the pockets of millions of innocent Americans. 
But it's equally possible that the film industry will ignore the phenomenon. After all, most of the major studios are themselves part of conglomerates, and Hollywood is hardly a stranger to creative accounting practices, having pioneered so many of them itself.

HEADLINE: The World: AIDS and the West; 
Whistling Past the Global Graveyard

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
THE details may change each year, but when the 14th International AIDS Conference got underway last week in Barcelona, the flood of alarming statistics about the progression of the disease around the world was entirely familiar.
 Soon, average life expectancy will dip below 40 years in 10 African countries. Twenty-five million children will be orphaned worldwide by the disease by the end of the decade. In Russia, H.I.V. infection has increased 15-fold in three years. In China, 17 percent of the population has yet to hear of AIDS, even as the disease takes off there in earnest. 
 Sometime soon, AIDS will have killed more people than all the wars of the 20th century. Yet, in a paradoxical way, the most pessimistic data coming out of the conference may come from the few bright spots, including the United States and a few other rich countries.
People in the United States and Western Europe, where annual treatments may average $35,000 per patient, have begun to think of AIDS as a survivable condition. Each year, moreover, new data seem to feed a growing conviction in the wealthiest countries that the epidemic has been blunted in their own backyards. 
In Japan, the world's second-largest economy and a lavish spender on scientific research, there has never been an AIDS epidemic. Search as one might, it was nearly impossible last week to find more than a brief mention of the Barcelona conference in newspapers.
AIDS has always created a chasm between rich and poor. More than ever before, though, the pandemic is carving up the world into islands of affluence, medical prowess and good governance, and vast regions of poverty, imploding institutions and despair.
Perhaps the most glaring symbol of this divide is the tepid Western response to the United Nations' plea for $10 billion a year to fight AIDS. Many experts call this the minimum amount needed to blunt the epidemic and care for the sick and dying. But the world's rich nations, lacking the same sense of urgency that drove them to action in response to Al Qaeda, or in the gulf war, are now offering less than one-third of this sum.
Strong moral objections have long been raised to the West's seeming indifference to the plight of many African societies. And yet the growing magnitude of the AIDS crisis has tested the illusion of invulnerability, prompting a search for more pragmatic solutions.
"The world stood by when AIDS was spreading in Africa," said Peter Piot, executive director of the United Nations AIDS program. "We can't do the same thing now that it is spreading in Eastern Europe, at the doorsteps of the E.U."
Beyond the universe of AIDS experts, however, many people involved in international affairs say appeals to realism like this do not go far enough. For them, the central lesson of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks is that in today's globalized world there is no such thing as lasting insulation from other people's crises. When entire societies are allowed to collapse and human miseries are permitted to fester, sooner or later those who had the means to help do something about it but didn't will have a steep bill to pay.
T ODAY, some people will say, 'Why should we care?' " said Joseph S. Nye Jr., dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard University and author of "The Paradox of American Power" (Oxford University, 2002). "Well, in the mid-1990's, many people said pretty much the same thing about Afghanistan: 'It is in terrible shape, but what does it matter to us?' On Sept. 11 we found out what it matters to us."
If the challenge from AIDS was limited primarily to Africa, a continent perennially shunted to the periphery of the world's concerns, some might still maintain that wealthy nations need do little more than apply the kinds of Band-Aids and moral salves that are being employed there now. According to yet another statistic issued in Barcelona, although 28.5 million of the world's 40 million people infected with H.I.V. live in Africa, only about 30,000 Africans are receiving treatment with anti-retroviral drugs.
Year by year, however, it is becoming clearer that Africa is hardly alone. In Russia, the rate of infection is growing as fast as anywhere. China and India each acknowledge millions of recent cases, and yet both are thought to be vastly underreporting the crisis. In Indonesia, the disease has been spreading like wildfire.
In the future, the main hotspots highlighted in any new atlas of this epidemic will be major countries (albeit not Western ones) that are the anchors of entire regions. The doomsday scenarios that full-blown AIDS epidemics in all these places imply are almost too extreme to contemplate.
For self-interested Westerners, it is easy to conjure images of the devastation that could visit the more affluent parts of Europe if the former Soviet empire were to be sucked into the AIDS vortex: refugees streaming into Europe, economic collapse, even the outbreak of violence on such a scale that the rich nations might be forced to intervene. But the West is less accustomed to contemplating more distant catastrophes. 
In thinking about India and China, Africa may once again serve as the best cautionary model of how a disease can change the course of human history. Africa, with all its problems, had made great strides in terms of life expectancy, and in some countries, economic development as well. Like a century suddenly torn off a calendar, those gains are now being wiped out, and with one-third or more of adults infected with H.I.V., few institutions can remain intact. 
In living memory the world has seen mass death in places like China, with its great famine, and the damage has stayed contained. This is a vastly different era, though, one of huge trade and investment linking all parts of the world, not to mention the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And the wholesale collapse of institutions, like China's army -- the world's largest -- is something mankind has never seen.
Yet these are precisely the kinds of threats that the international conference-goers have been warning of.
Given such realities, it would seem the world is rapidly approaching a critical fork in the road. One way, perhaps, lies death on a scale unseen since the worst plagues of the past. The other way lies a Herculean common struggle against AIDS, of uncertain outcome. Either way, experts from a multitude of disciplines say everyone -- rich and poor -- will be involved.
"The message of Sept. 11 is that there are no more quarantines," said Ramesh Thakur, a political scientist and vice rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo, "and isolation is an illusion."

Sitting onTrillions of Frequent-Flier Miles

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Some 100 million people worldwide participate in frequent-flier programs, in which they earn "miles" toward free flights or upgrades. Last year, 1.6 trillion miles were awarded, but only 342 billion, or 21 percent, were redeemed. 
Over all, in the last two decades, about 8 trillion miles have not been used.
 While most miles last year were from flying, 11 percent were from credit card programs and 7 percent from telephone use. Fewer miles were earned from car rentals and other programs. A small but growing way to earn miles is from online shopping, thanks to programs like ClickRewards that give miles for buying from participating retailers. KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

WHY: "Feynman is a Nobel physicist who paused his studies to help build the atomic bomb, yet is a guy who is clearly someone with whom you want to go have a beer. He looks at the world around him as an opportunity to understand by working things out for himself, rather than listening to whatever happens to be the popular explanation. He is a super-smart, articulate, optimistic iconoclast."

BOOK: "The Clash of Civilizations and The Remaking of World Order" by Samuel P. Huntington (1996)

WHY: "I was struck by his explanation of the root causes of terrorism that go beyond the popular and politically correct explanations of poverty and ignorance. If we learn anything from the history of economic development, it is that culture makes all the difference. On the other hand, culture does not stand alone. History tells us that the most successful cures for poverty come from within. Foreign assistance can help but, like windfall wealth, it can also hurt.

HEADLINE: Killing of Girl, 10, and Increase in Homicides Challenge Boston's Crime-Fighting Model 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 12 

 BODY:
They called it the Boston miracle.
 Using innovative strategies, law enforcement agencies here helped reduce homicides 80 percent from 1990 to 1999, the sharpest drop in the nation. For two and a half years in the late 90's, not a single juvenile was killed with a handgun. 
 The police and prosecutors from around the country flocked here to study the "Boston model," and it has been incorporated as a crucial component of President Bush's main crime-fighting strategy. 
But in the last two years, the number of homicides has doubled, a trend accentuated by the death this month of a 10-year-old, Trina Persad, who was struck in the head with a shotgun blast in a park in Roxbury. The police say she was shot by gang members cruising in a car in search of rivals, the type of random killing the Boston model was supposed to prevent.
Trina's death and the sudden increase in homicides have raised an angry question: What went wrong with the vaunted approach to reducing crime?
Among law enforcement officials, politicians and experts on criminal justice, it is a risky issue, because the Boston model, emphasizing creative partnerships among agencies like the police force and probation agencies, offers a distinct contrast to the other most successful crime-fighting strategy of the 1990's, that of New York City. 
The New York strategy, fostered by Police Commissioner William J. Bratton and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, was more aggressive, going after small quality-of-life crimes like panhandling and subway-turnstile jumping and holding police commanders responsible for reducing crime in their precincts.
To explain the homicide increase here, Police Commissioner Paul F. Evans and Mayor Thomas M. Menino point to trends outside their control like the downturn in the economy, meaning fewer jobs for young people; an increase in the number of inmates leaving jail and prison; and the growth of the teenage population.
But those factors exist in many other parts of the nation, and other officials and experts involved in creating the Boston strategy say the city may have become complacent, a victim of its success.
In part, said Donald K. Stern, who as United States attorney in Boston in the Clinton administration helped develop the Boston plan, "the numbers were pushed down so low they eventually had to go up." 
Homicides fell, to 31 in 1999, from a high of 152 in 1990, at the height of the epidemic of crack cocaine, gangs and handguns.
Last year, the number of homicides jumped, to 66. This year, through July 10, the number is 29, identical to the total for the same period last year, according to the Boston police.
"We also have to be honest and admit that some of the missionary zeal of the original players was hard to sustain with the success we achieved," said Mr. Stern, now a lawyer with Bingham McCutchen here. "The people coming later may not feel the urgency in their bones as much." 
That is particularly true for a critical part of the plan known as Operation Cease-Fire, Mr. Stern said. Cease-Fire involved calling in young men with criminal records for meetings with unusual teams of law enforcement officers, including representatives from the police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as well as the United States attorney's office and the district attorney's office. 
The men, often gang members or suspected drug or gun dealers, were warned that they were being watched and were told they would face serious prison time if they committed violent crimes with guns. In one publicized incident, a gang member with a felony conviction who ignored his warning was given a 10-year federal prison sentence for possession of a single bullet. It is a federal crime for a convicted felon to possess a gun. 
"Part of the secret of Cease-Fire was that you have to follow up," Mr. Stern said. "You have to keep warning people, and if they commit more violence, you have to get them and give them long sentences to make an example of them."
One problem is that teenagers now have no memory of how tough Operation Cease-Fire was at its inception, Mr. Stern said, and they have no friends who were sent to prison as a result. 
There is also a question about how effective the warnings have become. One of the two men arrested in the shooting of Trina Persad, Marquis Nelson, 23, was released from the Suffolk County prison in April after six months in custody for the illegal possession of a firearm.
Before his release, Mr. Nelson was warned by a team of law enforcement officers working in the prison as an offshoot of Operation Cease-Fire. A Cease-Fire team warned Mr. Nelson again six weeks before the shooting, Commissioner Evans said.
Asked about Mr. Nelson's case, Mr. Evans said, "There is no 100 percent guarantee that the warnings will work." 
David Kennedy, a lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who helped formulate the Boston plan, said the answer was that the Cease-Fire program had lost its way. "As it existed in 1996 or 1997, Cease-Fire is entirely gone," Mr. Kennedy said. 
Instead of focusing on the most dangerous suspects, the warnings have been watered down and are being given indiscriminately to large groups like schools, Mr. Kennedy said, "like old-fashioned police work."
Mr. Evans strongly denied that.
Mr. Kennedy said he had been told that his participation was no longer welcome, as a result of envy by some law enforcement officers who wanted to claim credit for Boston's success.
Mr. Evans said the finger-pointing missed the larger point. Overall violent crime here is at its lowest level since 1971, and even the 66 homicides last year were fewer than in any year in the 70's or 80's.
"The Boston model still works," Mr. Evans said. "We just have to keep tweaking it."

HEADLINE: Mortgage Bargains May Not Provide Big Lift to Economy 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
With mortgage rates matching their lowest levels in more than 30 years, thousands of Americans are rushing to refinance the loans on their homes. But the lift to the economy that usually comes when homeowners negotiate a better mortgage deal is unlikely to be as great this time as in the past.
 The falling rates -- dropping to 6.54 percent on average last week for a 30-year mortgage -- are indeed a prop for the wavering economy. With loans so cheap, home sales and home construction are booming. Those who refinance to raise cash also strengthen an economy dependent on consumer spending, and in the new rush to refinance, the majority of households are doing just that. 
 But many homeowners who might have refinanced their mortgages now did so last fall when rates also fell just as low for a few weeks. The pool of people who missed that window is relatively small, mortgage lenders say. In addition, a growing number of households are using the lower rates to shrink 30-year mortgages to 15 or 20 years for about the same monthly payments. The economy gets no stimulus when a homeowner does this instead of using lower rates to decrease monthly payments and increase consumer spending.
The economy, as a result, is not likely to get the same kick from this round of refinancing as it did last fall, when interest rates fell in the aftermath of Sept. 11. Then, people with 7 percent mortgages rushed to refinance at 6.5 percent, and the tendency to shorten a mortgage's maturity, rather than to refinance, was not as common. 
"The people most sensitive to interest rate changes refinanced last fall," said Sterling Edmunds Jr., the president of SunTrust Mortgage, a nationwide lender headquartered in Richmond, Va., "and for them to do it again, the 30-year rate would have to fall another half-a-percentage point."
Not since the 1960's have rates on 30-year mortgages fallen that extra half-point, to 6 percent or less.
The increasing popularity of shorter mortgages is apparent in the 11 offices of MortgageAmerica, which operates in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. John B. Johnson, the chief executive, attributes the trend to a growing desire among cautious Americans to be debt-free by their late 50's. There is an absence today of more profitable investments than homeownership itself, he said, and people realize this.
"The strongest reason for refinancing is still to get lower monthly payments," Mr. Johnson said, "but we are seeing significant numbers of people refinancing to shorter maturities while leaving their payments unchanged. More than last fall."
For Mr. Edmunds's SunTrust, the flow of refinancing activity, while up sharply from early spring, is still running 25 percent below last fall's peak of $4 billion in new mortgages in October. Or as Dorothy Lubbes, the mortgage officer at Southern Commercial Bank in St. Louis, said: "I have lots of appointments and I am extremely busy through the day. But I am not putting in the extra hours that I put in last fall; it has not gotten to that point yet."
The window of opportunity last fall stayed open only a few weeks. Rates reached their low point in the second week of November, then bounced back to roughly 7 percent by year-end and stayed there until May, when the current fall began, accelerating last week. Through each episode, stock prices also plunged, displaying a grim relationship.
Falling stock prices, it turns out, have become a principal reason why, in this business cycle, long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, are also falling. In this respect, the two have become wrapped in a strange embrace that has made the flight from stocks an unexpected source of strength for consumer spending, mainly through mortgage refinancing.
In a recovery, stock prices and interest rates usually rise together, but this time they are falling together. 
"It suggests that if you get a rally in stocks, you will get a setback in mortgage rates," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist and consultant. "We are caught in a recovery that helps people and hurts them at the same time."
Fear seems to make this unusual mechanism work. Displaying more fear of stocks than at any time since the 1980's, investors are shifting their money to what they consider safe investments, mainly 10-year Treasury notes and mortgage-backed bonds. Treasuries are guaranteed by the federal government and mortgage-backed bonds have homes as collateral. As the demand rises for both these types of bonds, their rates fall, and so do the associated rates for household mortgages.
The stock market is not alone, of course, in pulling down long-term rates. A weak economy has convinced many investors that the recovery from last year's recession will take longer than originally anticipated and the Federal Reserve will not even consider raising rates until late this year, at the earliest. As recently as May, forecasters had expected the Fed to have raised rates by now to control inflation, but in the weak economy, inflation has been dormant.
"A bit of gloom and doom has developed about where the economy is going and that weighs on rates," said Lyle E. Gramley, a senior economic adviser to Schwab Capital Markets. 
Clearly it weighs on the 30-year mortgage rate, which edged down to 6.54 percent last week from 6.57 percent the week before, according to Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage agency. The 6.54 percent matched last November's low of 6.45 percent after including the additional points charged in the fall as a refinancing fee.
Freddie Mac bases its average rate on a weekly survey of mortgage lenders. Its average rate last week also matched another post-1960's low, in early October of 1998, when a surge in refinancing helped to lift the economy during a growing global financial crisis. Stock prices fell then, too, as investors shifted their money to what they considered safer investments.
Now, in the latest round of mortgage refinancing, many homeowners are reducing their payments by significant amounts. Some customers at Southern Commercial, for example, have cut up to $80 from each monthly installment on an $80,000 mortgage. The second most popular option has been to keep the monthly payments unchanged but borrow more, thus tapping the rising value of homes when prices are rising so quickly that some experts say a bubble has developed.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, rejects that concern. In Congressional testimony, he has argued that the housing market does not lend itself easily to bubbles because home prices vary by region and homeowners do not buy and sell quickly, as stockholders do. Fed policy makers argue that even before the latest refinancing boom, homeowners who sold diverted some of their windfall profits to consumer spending, and that dynamic continues to provide crucial support for the recovery. 
"The Fed is supporting every dimension of the housing market," said Albert M. Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist. "In principle, if stock prices keep dropping, there is no reason why the rate on 30-year mortgages should not go below 6 percent."

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
In New Jersey, Everybody's Badmouthing the Ex

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
NOT everyone knows that New Jersey's state bird is the goldfinch, but it suddenly seems that everyone has decided that the state goat is Christie Whitman.
 Pick a problem that needs a villain -- the state's budget crisis, an E-ZPass system mired in debt, festering toxic dumps -- and she's the go-to girl. 
 On Tuesday, a lineup of New Jersey politicians accused the Republican former governor and current administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency of forsaking her state by carrying out policies that would further foul the Garden State. Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said Mrs. Whitman "should be ashamed of herself." 
On Wednesday, a legislative committee in Trenton disgorged a mammoth report showing how E-ZPass tumbled into debt, calling for a criminal investigation and accusing the Whitman administration of "misleading the public."
The next day, Gov. James E. McGreevey jumped in. He has criticized Mrs. Whitman for her fiscal policy and accused her of dumbing down the state Supreme Court, but talking tolls in New Jersey is as serious as it gets.
Calling E-ZPass "a classic example of how the previous administration operated government," he said, "It was a poorly designed fiscal premise, entirely based upon false projections, that was incompetently administered to the public who was told of rosy and fantastical promises that at the end of the day generated a $400 million deficit." Then he imposed a $1 a month surcharge on E-ZPassers.
Through it all, hardly a word of defense of Mrs. Whitman has been heard, and no one has noticed that more than Mrs. Whitman herself. "What surprises me is how quiet the Republicans have been," she said. 
Perhaps none of it should be surprising.
Christie Whitman is a political Martha Stewart. Her can-do style won fans, but State House veterans found her aloof, even smug. Governing well enough was her best revenge. She appeared to have it all: tax cuts, a robust economy, few scandals, even a flirtation with national prominence.
She squeaked through two elections and landed a big job in Washington, but New Jersey political insiders could almost taste the moment she became vulnerable.
Now with the economy in a slide, her tax cuts and expanded state debt have come under attack by the new governor. Parts of the Bush environmental agenda are unfriendly even to causes she embraced as governor. And her well of support back home is now just a trickle.
"Christie was horrible at forging long-term relationships with people," laments one prominent state Republican.
In the current atmosphere, Mrs. Whitman needs one of those protective moon suits to shield her from the political particulate matter. "So much of it has gotten personal," she said in an interview. "My name is mentioned with malfeasance, with lying, with so many things. It's Whitman. It's Whitman. It's all Whitman."
SHE asks: what about the years of prosperity? The open-space initiative? The budget surpluses? Her Jersey Girl defense sounds like mock Springsteen lyrics. "The state is in my heart," she said. "It's part of me."
She dismisses the criticism as politics-as-usual, and some of it seems to be. In April, Mr. McGreevey called Mrs. Whitman's Supreme Court appointments "an avenue for patronage for those within the executive branch." Last week, Mr. McGreevey paved his own avenue, nominating to the court Barry T. Albin, an old friend and member of a law firm that generously backed him.
Some criticism, however, seems the result of Whitman-as-usual. She loyally plays her roles for the national Republicans -- darling of the deep tax cutters, appropriately measured advocate of abortion rights. She is doing the same at the environmental agency.
But New Jersey, which has labored to shed labels like "Landfill of Opportunity," also demands loyalty. News of possible federal cuts in the Superfund program alarm New Jersey, where toxic waste sites outnumber even minor league ball teams. And the Bush administration's clean-air proposals give leeway to utilities that were the subject of lawsuits by New Jersey and other states when Mrs. Whitman was governor. 
"She was on the right side of the issues before she went to Washington and was co-opted by the administration," said Jon Corzine, the Democratic United States senator.
Mrs. Whitman says she is true to both her president and her state. She wonders whether the criticism reflects concern she may run for office again. Have no fear, she says. Her current job is no way to build support. "All you do is make enemies," she said.
And on that point, no one disputes her.

HEADLINE: Air of Uncertainty Hangs Over Turkey as Government Erodes 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, July 13 

 BODY:
The government of Turkey is not so much careering out of control as it is stumbling, step by jolting step, down a path toward potentially dramatic upheaval in its political and economic landscape.
 Seven cabinet ministers and 39 members of Parliament have resigned from the governing Democratic Left Party in the past week, leaving its ailing leader, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, struggling to hold on to power and creating doubts about Turkey's ability to cope with economic and political problems. 
 While change seems inevitable and the prime minister's days in office appear numbered, the degree of transformation and direction of the next government remain irritatingly obscure.
"Anyone who claims to know where this is headed is fooling himself," said Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Bilgi University in Istanbul. 
The stakes are high for 65 million Turks, who are eager to shed bitter months of economic hardship, and for the United States, which needs a compliant and stable ally as a base for any military operation against Iraq.
At least as important in the long term, the outcome will determine whether Turkey presses forward on reforms necessary for membership in the European Union or retreats to the role of a disgruntled nationalist on the margins of the West.
"There are enormous uncertainties because so many players have so many different interests," said Zeyno Baran, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington. 
Divisions over how far to bend in exchange for joining the European Union, and particularly whether to abandon the death penalty, provided the catalyst for this week of government resignations and political gamesmanship. The results decimated Mr. Ecevit's party and threaten to cast him out of office.
Mr. Ecevit, 77, is a veteran of four decades in and out of power in Ankara, but his health has deteriorated markedly in the last two months. He was hospitalized numerous times and often slurred his speech in rare public appearances.
Propelled by Mr. Ecevit's weakness and bickering within the three-party governing coalition, elections before the scheduled date, April 2004, appear to be one certainty on an uncertain horizon.
Devlet Bahceli, the leader of the coalition's nationalist party, hastened the date when he called for elections in November in what many see as an attempt to bring down the coalition and stop a deal to get rid of the death penalty as a price for joining Europe.
Fearing Mr. Ecevit was too weak to lead the party into early elections, members of his left-leaning party began to abandon ship. By the end of the week, 44 members of Parliament, including the 7 cabinet ministers, had resigned, robbing the party of its slim majority.
The most prominent resignation was that of Ismail Cem, the popular foreign minister who was considered an Ecevit protege. On Friday, the day after he quit, Mr. Cem announced that he was forming a new party intended to usher Turkey into the European Union, a goal supported by a majority of the country in opinion polls.
"Turkey must not miss this chance," Mr. Cem said at a news conference. "We are determined to take the necessary measures."
Forming the leadership of the yet unnamed party with him will be Kemal Dervis, the economy minister, and Husamettin Ozkan, another longtime Ecevit ally who resigned as deputy prime minister.
Mr. Dervis tried to resign on Thursday, but he reconsidered after the country's president asked him to stay on for the sake of the economy. Mr. Dervis was brought into government from the World Bank 16 months ago to deal with the economic crisis, and he has generally been given good marks for engineering the beginnings of a turnaround.
Mr. Cem is a popular and untainted figure in Turkish politics, and Mr. Dervis is respected by the international financial community. Both will be embraced by Turkey's influential businesspeople, who favor joining the European Union.
But the party's success is far from assured in a country where new political groups come and go as regularly as prayers from the mosque, and only a few stalwarts endure.
Mr. Dervis also carries political baggage. He left Turkey in the 1970's and returned only last year, so many Turks see him as an outsider. The nationalists have played to that issue and tried to brand him as a proxy for the United States and international lenders.
In addition, the financial reforms he pushed through to keep international loans flowing caused considerable pain among working Turks, who have watched helplessly as living standards have dropped sharply. The country's large agriculture sector was hit particularly hard when the subsidies were slashed and sweetheart loans from state banks ended.
Any future political equation will have to contend with the popularity of the Justice and Development Party, which was created a year ago out of the ashes of the banned Islamic party. Opinion polls show that the party, led by Istanbul's former mayor, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, far outstrips the other existing parties with voters.
The political permutations being debated are as plentiful as minarets on the Istanbul skyline. 
One potential situation has Mr. Ecevit trying to hold on to power by forming an alliance with Mr. Bahceli's nationalist party and agreeing to keep the death penalty and block granting more rights to the minority Kurdish population.

Trying to Figure Who Benefits From the Rules

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J. 

 BODY:
For a moment last week, I wondered if Monique Harwell and her son, Reginald Harwell II, could be the people I've been searching for, the corrupters of big-time college sports. 
 Why else would those smooth, educated people from the National Collegiate Athletic Association have lectured the mother so sternly about accepting unauthorized phone calls from college coaches or warned the son against taking home the uniforms and shoes he had been lent for the Adidas ABCD basketball camp? The Harwells had already been warned not to talk to the coaches who had shown up here to watch Reginald and 230 other high school players audition for them over four days at Fairleigh Dickinson University. 
 "I can understand the coaches' not being allowed to speak with the children," Monique Harwell told me over Adidas hamburgers we were allowed to swallow. "But it would be very good for the coaches to be able to speak with the parents. Many of us can't pay to go on official visits with our children or to make phone calls to the schools. And it would be good to put faces on all those letters we get." 
She sounded reasonable, but her ambition for her child, 17, is naked. They had come from Richmond Heights, outside Cleveland, to be discovered. Reginald is 6 feet 5 inches, and if his game "picks up" during his coming senior year at Villa Angela-St. Joseph's High School, his mom said, she would allow him to go directly into the National Basketball Association.
No wonder the N.C.A.A. has to keep a rein on people like Monique Harwell, a 35-year-old single mother of three who lives in her ailing grandmother's house and who receives public assistance while she attends school to become a drug counselor. After she told me that she doesn't think all these N.C.A.A. rules are in her best interests, I began to doubt she was slick enough to be the corrupter I was searching for. Where did she ever get the idea that these rules were created with her needs in mind, much less Reginald's?
So who is the bad guy here? Sonny Vaccaro, who runs this camp, is always volunteering for the title, but that's how he keeps his name in the news. Vaccaro, 62, wants us to think he pioneered the corruption of higher education while he was at Nike, supplementing coaches' salaries with sneaker deals that have since become critical to university economics, along with the soft drinks they "pour."
Nike ran a rival camp in Las Vegas last week which was also "certified" by the N.C.A.A., which meant that convoluted rules had to be followed so that N.C.A.A. coaches could attend. It was part of the N.C.A.A. plan to "bring more accountability" to summer ball.
Accountable to whom? Its own whimsical and determinedly understaffed enforcement branch?
But Monique Harwell got the message. She says she has made unofficial college visits to Dayton and Toledo, and when she saw the Dayton coach here she just waved back, didn't even mouth a hello. She can stick to a game plan. She started Reginald in a Montessori school, moved him to a special science junior high, then on to Catholic high school. They are not Catholics.
The Dayton coach was sitting in the grandstand with several hundred other college coaches, most of whom were ostentatiously preening so the players and their parents saw them, or at least the university logos on their golf shirts. Coach Gary Williams of Maryland, wearing his N.C.A.A. championship ring, said that even he needed to show up.
"There's a lot of negative recruiting going on," he said. "If you're not here, other coaches will tell players that you weren't interested, that you were after someone else."
So maybe the Amateur Athletic Union coaches Sonny hired to run the camp are the bad guys? A once-powerful organization, the A.A.U. withered in the mid-20th century as the N.C.A.A. and the Olympic federations ate youth sports. Now, with sneaker money, the A.A.U. is coming back strong, especially in basketball and soccer, creating a national network of traveling teams that challenges the N.C.A.A.'s control over high school players. A.A.U. coaches here, who spoke freely but anonymously, hint of a future when American sports will be dominated by clubs rather than educational institutions. One reason there are so many foreign players in camps, colleges and now the N.B.A., they said, was that Europeans in particular were free to sign with agents at 14 and develop their games away from crippling regulations.
Monique Harwell said she related to that, especially after an edgy hour in a ballroom at a nearby hotel. N.C.A.A. staffers, with visual aids, tried not to sound like immigration officials at a crowded border crossing as they read the latest rules while the players, parents and club coaches clamored for explanation.
They asked questions like these: Wouldn't more phone calls mean a better chance to develop a relationship? Why are athletic scholarships given for only a year at a time, and subject to summary cancellation? Why are athletes bound to the college they sign up for, but the coach who recruits them can move on? Don't you think all these rules are racially motivated, since they seem to single out African-American basketball players? How come you N.C.A.A. people are so worried about our previously worn sneakers and not about your colleges' zero graduation rates?
The N.C.A.A. representatives, who were mostly young, attractive and black, admitted that the rules were complex but said that they were really in the players' best interests. Who wants to get all those phone calls from coaches all the time?
We do, roared the players, and Reginald's mom agreed. "You're going to give your child over to this man," she said. "Who is he? What does he think about academics? What kind of environment is my child going to live in? Maybe I'll get up a petition."

HEADLINE: Bangladeshis Sipping Arsenic As Plan for Safe Water Stalls 

BYLINE:  By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: CHOTOBINAR CHAP, Bangladesh 

 BODY:
The arsenic, a slow, sadistic killer, has just about finished its work on Fazila Khatun. She teeters now. The fatigue is constant. Pain pulses through her limbs. Warts and sores cover the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet, telltale of the long years of creeping poison.
 Mrs. Khatun is hardly alone in this suffering. Bangladesh is in the midst of what the World Health Organization calls the "largest mass poisoning of a population in history." Tens of thousands of Bangladeshis show the outward signs of the same decline. Some 35 million are drinking arsenic-contaminated water, the poison accumulating within them day by day, sip by sip. 
 This calamity is accompanied by paradox. For two decades, the government, along with Unicef and various aid groups, desperately worked to wean the nation from pond water, often an incubator for lethal disease. People were instead urged to install tube wells, tapping into the plentiful supply of underground aquifers. Regrettably, no one had tested these subterranean sources for arsenic. 
By the mid-1990's, Bangladeshi officials -- once reluctant to provoke alarm -- finally admitted that yet another tragedy was unfolding in their impoverished, disaster-plagued nation. In 1998, the World Bank sped the normal paperwork and lent the government $32.4 million to act on the emergency. Every tube well was to be tested. Safe sources of water were to be provided.
But the race against time has gone badly. In the four years since The New York Times first looked into the situation, the nation's "arsenic mitigation project" has been hobbled by the unforeseen problems of so unprecedented a crisis. It is yet another example of how the world's poor continue to die from unsafe water, a threat long ago surmounted by the wealthy.
Suspicious of each other, the World Bank and the government became stubbornly bound up in their mutual bureaucracies, many critics say. Most of the country's estimated 11 million wells have yet to be tested. Most stricken villages are absent solutions. Most people -- the trusting converts to the "safety" of tube wells -- are baffled when now told that within the water lie the malign beginnings of arsenic-induced cancer.
"It seems like nonsense to people, telling them the water is killing them when it looks so clean and nice," said Dr. Allan H. Smith, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert on arsenic.
Dr. Smith has called the situation in Bangladesh "the highest environmental cancer risk ever found," worse than Bhopal or Chernobyl.
"People need to stop drinking the contaminated water," he said. "But they don't seem to pay attention unless there are people around them showing signs of the disease, which is of course what we're trying to prevent."
Here in the village of Chotobinar Chap, with the cancer pulling her under, Mrs. Khatun seems to have surrendered. She has no strength for work. She has no appetite for meals. She lies in a spare room beneath a thatched roof.
"I feel myself fading away, and sometimes I ask God to take me," she muttered. "My husband has abandoned me. He doesn't even look at me anymore."
For nearly two decades, Mrs. Khatun, 39, pumped the iron handle of a tube well sunk in her front yard beside a palm tree. Her father-in-law, Abdul Hakim, his six sons and all their families used the same convenient apparatus.
Two years ago, the water was tested. The arsenic concentration measured .760 milligrams per liter, 15 times the amount considered safe by Bangladesh standards and 76 times the limit set by the World Health Organization.
Arsenic, a speedy killer in high doses, is a sluggish and fickle assailant in low ones. The poison requires 2 to 10 years or more to work its damage and it affects different people in different ways -- and some, seemingly, not at all.
While Mrs. Khatun is the most woefully stricken in her family, others have the same nodules on their palms and heels and dark spots on much of their skin. Still others, their thirst slaked from the same well, show no signs at all.
Informed of the danger, the family beseeched, "Where can we get safe water?" Here again the arsenic displayed its erratic hand, for some of the wells here are terribly tainted and others, just yards away, are harmless.
The nearest safe water for the family was beside a neighbor's home a quarter mile away. To get there required a walk on a narrow mud path, past several houses with shiny tin roofs, past ponds where animals bathed and algae bloomed.
"It was hard to fetch water from so far away," said Mr. Hakim, a weaver. Dark spots pocked his bare chest. "One of my daughters-in-law would go and carry back a full pitcher for drinking. But sometimes the path was too muddy. It was knee deep. She couldn't wade through it and she stopped going."
It is difficult to predict how many Bangladeshis will eventually die from causes related to the arsenic. Most researchers, including Dr. Smith, are shy with estimates. Richard Wilson, a Harvard physicist who is an expert in risk analysis, puts the number at one million. Dr. Sk. Ahktar Ahmad, a public health specialist with the government, predicts a total of three million to five million.
Any such arithmetic is highly speculative. The morbid work of the arsenic -- a persistent nudging toward cancers of the liver, lung, bladder or kidney -- can be halted in most cases by simply switching to safe water, doctors say.
So the question is: How many Bangladeshis will be persuaded to switch? And, if persuaded, how many can find water both safe and accessible?
Alternatives do exist. There are even ways to filter arsenic from water. But each solution requires effort, to educate villagers and to pay for the required equipment.
With 130 million people, Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous nation, its citizens packed into a territory slightly smaller than Wisconsin. The average per capita income is $370.
Arsenic has competition on the nation's mortality tables. Each year, pneumonia kills 91,000 children under age 5. Diarrhea claims 61,000 more. Tobacco surely rivals arsenic as a progenitor of fatal cancer.
Mother Nature, prone to furious mood swings, is often a mass murderer. In the wet summers, melting snow from the Himalayas joins with monsoon rains to overwhelm the rivers, flooding as much as two-thirds of the landscape. In dry months, the fierce sun can parch the soil enough to trigger a famine.
A few miles from here is Khandkar Kalagachia. As in most hamlets, there is water, water everywhere: wells, ponds, irrigated fields.
Though many of the villagers display signs of the poisoning, it is hard to know the extent of the contamination. Khandkar Kalagachia lies on the wrong side of the road, among the 77 percent of the nation's "hot spot" areas still untested.
Muhammad Ahsanullah, a rickshaw puller, endures an overwhelming itchiness, another of the symptoms. His hands are always in motion, scratching their way from his palms to his wrists to his biceps to his shoulders. In one dexterous maneuver, he crosses his arms to get at his sides, looking like a man confined to a straitjacket.
"I should drink from another well," Mr. Ahsanullah, 45, said.
His fingers have lesions the size of chickpeas. His soles are similarly affected, a hazardous problem for a rickshaw puller who goes barefoot. Infected wounds often lead to gangrene.
As Mr. Ahsanullah spoke, a small crowd gathered. Some of the men pulled up shirts to show their own dark speckling or lumpy palms.
Standing at the front door of a shack was a young woman, Khorsheda Begum, the rickshaw puller's wife. The couple wed three years ago. Their families had arranged the marriage. She had never seen him until the wedding day.
Now, sheepishly, she admitted she wished she could undo their union. A village quack has told her -- incorrectly -- that her husband's skin condition is contagious. Actually, the grave danger comes from the tube well in the yard.
"Yes, I drink from it," she said. "We all do."
Their well is the standard device, a small cylinder sunk into the earth with a hand pump above ground. Its location was familiar to Mostafa Kamal, an engineer who works for an aid agency called Proshika. He had once tested the well and found it contaminated. But for one reason or another, he had never gotten back to Khandkar Kalagachia to assay any other samples.
"Please test our wells now," one man pleaded.
But the engineer could not comply. He was apologetic. His agency had a contract to examine wells. "But I only have supplies to test 200 a month and I have run out," he said. "I can request more but I don't think I will get it."
From the start, the effort to correct the problem has run into problems. The primary mission was the testing of every well. If the water was safe, the top of the well was to be painted green. If not, it would be colored red.
This task required test kits that could accurately measure minuscule levels of arsenic, but nothing that precise was immediately available. While it was presumed that every family had a right to know if their well was tainted, little had been decided about how to help the unlucky.
"We started taking the measurements, but as we tested, painting the wells red or green, there was a great hue and cry from people with contaminated water," said a government official. "These people asked us, What do you expect us to do now?"
"It took us a while to come up with new technologies, such as pond sand filters or rainwater harvesting or, in some areas, deeper tube wells," the official said. "Different areas have different solutions. But once the best one is decided, to whom do you provide the money for installation? How do you prevent corruption?"
Programs were required, and each scheme seemed to call for round after round of design. The World Bank, after lending so much money, wanted the protection of exacting oversight. Some government officials, practiced in steering contracts to cronies, had supervisory interests of their own.
"It has been terrible frustration to watch," said Han A. Heijnen, the environmental health adviser for the World Health Organization in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. "So much remains to be done. Even now, the lack of knowledge among villagers about arsenic is a shame."
The arsenic itself may well have been in the area's alluvial sediments for 20,000 years or more. Exactly how it came to dissolve in the groundwater is a matter of debate, but the prevailing theory is that it was a natural process.
Whatever the cause, the arsenic's belated discovery is at the root of the calamity. Water-quality experts are divided about how much, if any, negligence was involved. Some victims are suing the British Geological Survey, which did not include a test for arsenic when it surveyed the groundwater in 1992.
But even after the poison was found, responses were tardy. Unicef is now a dedicated participant in the testing of wells, but it and the government were slow to admit that their "safe water program," the laudable effort to stop people from drinking from disease-laden ponds, had dire unintended consequences.
Now, with the disaster continuing, Bangladesh is of great interest to global experts, their laboratory for the study of arsenic.
Researchers have questions, among them: Has the poison breached the food chain? Why are some people more affected than others? Is the level of arsenic in each tube well stable? Will fatalistic villagers change their habits?
Mr. Ahsanullah, the rickshaw puller, incessantly scratching, had himself given thought to an alternate source of water. Recently, he began using a neighbor's well.
"But now I am told that, too, is bad," he said as he stood amid lush greenery and sprawling ponds. Within 20 feet, villagers were sloshing through the shallows that nourished a rice paddy. Still, the confused man, displaying his fear, asked gravely, "Where can I find water?"

HEADLINE: Defining Limit Of Generosity For 9/11 Fund 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Within the next two weeks, the man responsible for distributing billions of taxpayer dollars to thousands of families who lost relatives in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will decide two dozen test cases that will at last establish the rough boundaries for the sizes of the awards.
 For the last few months, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master in charge of the federal Victim Compensation Fund, has been conferring with family lawyers to identify the cases that will, each in their own way, answer many of the open questions concerning the generosity and scope of the fund. At least three cases, for example, will test Mr. Feinberg's willingness to make awards in excess of $4 million, something he said months ago he was loath to do. Others will help settle the question of just how far he will go in compensating families for mental anguish. 
 After months of speculation about the mechanics and fairness of the compensation process, these test cases represent the most critical moment to date for the fund. Where Mr. Feinberg draws the lines, and what his explanations are for doing so, will go a long way toward deciding if he prevails in his greatest ambition: convincing the roughly 3,000 families of victims that the fund is not just their only true option for relief, but an unassailably fair one. 
"We're going to test the waters, and we're going to get some decisions that will define how the fund works," said William L. Mauk, who, as the former director of litigation support for Trial Lawyers Care, a consortium of more than 1,100 lawyers offering free legal advice to Sept. 11 families, chose the bulk of the test cases.
"It will define Ken Feinberg's sense of fairness and justice," Mr. Mauk said. "It will send a message to those who are uncertain about the fund. And one way or another, it will launch the process."
When Congress created the fund in September as part of an airline bailout package, officials praised the idea as a novel one that offered a fast and straightforward alternative to litigation. To be eligible for the fund's average payment of about $1.5 million, however, families have to waive their right to sue, a condition that strikes some lawyers as unfair, and others as reasonable, given the prospect of protracted and risky lawsuits.
To outsiders, it may appear that the fund has produced precious little so far, other than perhaps an atmosphere of waiting and wariness. After all, perhaps only 605 families have filed even the partial applications since the government opened its checkbook in December, a pace that even Mr. Feinberg has said is much slower than anticipated. No awards have been made, either.
The reality, though, is that many determinative matters have been unfolding behind the scenes for months, as lawyers scramble to establish some unofficial case law for a fund without precedent.
Mr. Feinberg has already unveiled his rough calculations of a person's worth and lost income. So the relatives of a victim who was 45 and married with two children making $125,000 a year would be eligible for a payment of $2.04 million (minus any life insurance or pension payments), while the relatives of a victim who was 25 with no dependents and an annual salary of $90,000 would be eligible for a gross payment of $2.11 million.
But many family lawyers, as well as companies that lost a large number of employees, have taken issue with Mr. Feinberg's economic assumptions or want clarification on numerous knotty issues.
As a result, the test cases, selected because of their economic diversity and wider potential implications, will probe the value of civilian heroes and intangible, hard-to-replace services provided by loved ones, like handiwork, cooking or day care. They touch on the predicament of devastated families afflicted by lingering psychological consequences. They deal with controversial topics like long-term respiratory ailments and future earnings potential.
So far, the families' lawyers say that they have been encouraged by what they describe as an informal, give-and-take process. They have been heartened, too, by Mr. Feinberg's empathetic attitude, even as they inundate him with reams of supporting documents as thick as telephone books, not to mention an occasional CD-ROM or photo album.
Indeed, at his offices in Midtown Manhattan last Monday, Mr. Feinberg convened an all-day session of 30-minute meetings with more than a dozen families and their lawyers in which there was no shortage of evidence, experts or emotions. And afterward, many families said that Mr. Feinberg and his staff seemed genuinely moved by the anguish of people like Erma Bourdier, who, sobbing, recounted how her husband, Francisco Bourdier, a security guard, was a hero on Sept. 11, saving everyone but himself from the Bankers Trust building.
He has listened, too, to the heartbreaking tale of Florence Kneff; because of the deaths of her son, Matthew Diaz, a carpenter, on Sept. 11, and daughter-in-law, Karen, of cancer in January, she has to raise two orphaned grandsons alone.
And he has tried to absorb and calculate somehow the plight of Edwin Zambrana, who tearfully stated that his shy son, Edwin Jr., truly had two jobs, even if one was nonpaying: one at the World Trade Center as a maintenance worker and the other at home caring for a mother battling lupus.
"It was a very emotional day," Mr. Feinberg said. "Emotionally draining and tough. But it's very important and worthwhile."
In general, Mr. Feinberg said that he was inclined to be far more flexible in accounting for economic losses rather than emotional ones, and in relying on corroborated patterns of income rather than projected earnings. But one of the wild cards, as written in the rules, is that Mr. Feinberg also has an enormous amount of discretion.
In several cases discussed on Monday, Mr. Feinberg also gave the family lawyers a tentative range for possible awards, a range that some said seemed a bit low, but not exceedingly so. He also promised to furnish a firmer number within the next two weeks, then give families the option to accept that figure, or to press for a more formal hearing in the future to make their case one last time.
Spearheading these cases has been Trial Lawyers Care, a nonprofit organization created by the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. In all, Trial Lawyers Care has identified 16 cases that would result in combined payments of approximately $20 million according to Mr. Feinberg's original tables. But the figures that have been discussed by Mr. Feinberg have been significantly higher, in a range of $30 million to $40 million, according to lawyers.
For Mr. Zambrana and his lawyer, Daniel Kramer, the key themes being tested include the psychological trauma that the family has endured since Sept. 11 and the death of his 24-year-old son. But he is also trying to make a case that the care his son provided to his ill mother had a real value, and that, somehow, that should figure in Mr. Feinberg's determination of compensation.
The claim is also noteworthy because the elder Mr. Zambrana, who was a maintenance worker at the trade center, was badly injured during the towers' collapse, but did not seek medical treatment within the time limit of 72 hours set by the fund because he was too busy searching, in vain, for his son. How elastic Mr. Feinberg will be in honoring such injury claims could affect hundreds of claims.
"To this day, he's on inhalers, his vocal cords aren't right, and the doctors have said, 'This will never go away,' " Mr. Kramer said of Mr. Zambrana's injury.
For Richard King, life has not been the same since his wife, Lucille, a secretary at Aon, died on Sept. 11. They had been married for three decades, had no children, and lived in the same modest apartment in Queens for years. He is struggling with his new solitary existence in a complex for the elderly in the middle of New Jersey, close to relatives, and trying to learn how to drive.
According to E. Drew Britcher, a lawyer in Glen Rock, N.J., who is representing Mr. King, Mrs. King was not just the only breadwinner in the household. She also ran the household, did the finances, did everything. So what is being tested here is not her loss of future income -- which would be relatively modest, since she was 59 -- but the value of personal services at home, as well as the emotional impact of losing a soulmate.
"You're talking about someone whose entire life was this one person," said Mr. Britcher of Mr. King, who was too distraught to attend the meeting with Mr. Feinberg on Monday.
And in a case that has been handled not by Trial Lawyers Care, but by the aviation disaster specialists Kreindler & Kreindler, Jenna Jacobs, widow of Ariel Jacobs, anxiously waits for Mr. Feinberg's judgment, too.
Mr. Jacobs, 29, had climbed from a clerk at Radio Shack to chief of United States operations for Caplin Systems, a multinational company, in a decade. He was making an annual salary above the unofficial $231,000 cap that Mr. Feinberg has said he will use when calculating economic losses. He also had no insurance. So his case could be representative of the young, promising financial wizards who might eventually have earned a lot more money, said Justin T. Green, Mrs. Jacobs's lawyer.
"The question is, is Feinberg going to pay this person what he said this person should be paid according to his methodology?" Mr. Green said. "Or is he going to apply an arbitrary cap? Because if he does apply a cap, we'll be disappointed and lose confidence in the program."
For Mrs. Jacobs, the test case is important because she needs assistance sooner than most other families. She and her husband had recently moved into a comfortable suburban house in Westchester County. But she has had to abandon the fledgling human resources consulting business that she had just started to provide full-time care for her son, Gabriel, who was born on Sept. 17.
"I know Feinberg wants to do well by the families, but it's a little disconcerting to think that there's this one guy who has so much power," Mrs. Jacobs said. "I just want Feinberg to know that I'm putting my faith in him, my trust in him, my future in him. He seems like a sincere guy; I hope he follows through."

HEADLINE: Stocks' Slide Is Playing Havoc With Older Americans' Dreams 

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE 

 BODY:
As the owners of an Atlanta advertising agency that billed $40 million a year, Jim and Jan Pringle were featured in a cover article in Inc. magazine asking, "What's the best time to retire?"
 In January 2000, with the Dow well above 10,000, they were confident they had picked the right time. They took more than $2 million they had made from selling their company and bought stocks. Their broker encouraged them to take a month in Europe; instead they moved to South Carolina, where they began building a dream house on the beach. 
 The Pringles have since lost about 75 percent of their investment. Far from taking any trips to Europe, they have done what they vowed never to do: mortgaged their house and gone back to work. 
"I thought I would at least be able to take a break and think about what to do with the second half of my life," Mr. Pringle, 63, said. "But I didn't have a lot of options when the market went south."
To many Americans, the sustained slide in the stock market -- particularly last week's nose dive -- has been something to fret about, a darkening cloud. But to many people at or near retirement age, it has been a colossal jolt.
People in this age group -- 55 to 64 -- have had almost twice as much money invested in stocks over the last few years as the average American. But if that money took them higher during the boom years, raising their expectations for living easy and dying rich, they have since fallen farther.
Unlike younger investors, older ones do not have room to ride out their losses, particularly those who, while swimming in capital gains, ignored the basic principle of shifting from stocks to less volatile investments as retirement drew near. Perhaps as a result, federal statistics show, the same age group has been entering the work force at a higher rate than any other in the last two years -- or simply not leaving.
In interviews last week from Hawaii to New England, older investors told stories of losing the entire value of their portfolios, of canceling travel plans and scaling back expectations. They used to stand mesmerized outside storefront stock tickers, or glued to CNBC at home. 
Now, they are looking the other way.
For these investors, what they thought would be comfortable retirement years are now shrouded in anxiety, disappointment and, in some cases, shame.
One 68-year-old man pleaded for anonymity as he told how he and his wife had sold their home in Manhattan and their beach house in the mid-1990's, planning to retire on the income of about $1 million he invested in the market.
As tech stocks rose, so did his portfolio. He hung on despite losing $4.5 million over two years. But last year, with some of his stocks reduced to pennies, and fearing that he would be "sitting in the street," he and his wife took jobs at the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut.
"The market was going up so rapidly, it was easy to live off the appreciated value of your assets," he said. "It was to some extent delusional, thinking this thing would turn around and come back, but it takes a while to come to grips with it. It hadn't happened in my lifetime, that kind of demise. I was born during the Depression, but I wasn't old enough to understand it."
Jacobo Black, 67, a retired real estate agent in Miami, said that he and his wife, Sophie, had canceled plans for a trans-Atlantic cruise this year. He could have used the distraction from thinking about the market.
"I feel so vulnerable," Mr. Black said. "Here I was with thousands of dollars in savings and here I am losing it like water running through my fingers."
Gena Lovett, walking along Laguna Beach in California with a group of friends who, like her, are in their late 50's, said that she and her husband, John, 57, would not be able to contribute as much to their grandchildren's education. 
"Our retirement is one-half of what it was a year ago," she said. "And because John works for G.E., we have mostly G.E. stock. I suppose we should have diversified, but G.E. stock was supposed to be wonderful. John's simply not looking at retirement. We simply told our kids that we're spending their inheritance."
The oldest retirees, those over 70, tend to have pensions and so rely less on the stock market, economists say. Those approaching retirement are far more likely to have 401(k) plans, which became the primary retirement option offered by companies over the last two decades. As the stock market swelled in the 1990's, so did those plans, and many people looked at the big gains and thought they could retire early.
"Many retirees became complacent," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in Pennsylvania. "There was so much money being made, they didn't do the normal shifting most people do. Many of them were putting more in the market, thinking this was a quick way to fund their retirement. They got caught."
According to Labor Department numbers quoted by AARP, the nation's largest lobbying group for retirees, the number of people over the age of 55 in the work force rose by 8.4 percent, or 1.6 million people, between June 2001 and June 2002, compared with far smaller gains in previous years. Every other age group declined in that period.
"What do you do if you find yourself at retirement age without enough to retire on?" asked John Rother, AARP's policy director. "You keep working."
John H. Saxman, the chairman of the biobehavioral sciences department at Columbia University's Teachers College, said he had begun his career believing that if he set aside money each year, he could retire by 65.
"All I knew was that I didn't want to become one of those doddering old professors who can never afford to leave," Professor Saxman said. "Now I'm 63 and every time I try to think about a specific retirement date, I look at my quarterly reports and realize I can't pick a date yet."
He said he had grown accustomed to seeing his Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund grow 8 percent to 10 percent a year, until it began posting losses a year ago. His latest quarterly statement arrived a few days ago, but he left it unopened, not wanting to see how much money was gone.
"I get the feeling now it won't be next year," Professor Saxman said. "It may be another five years."
Many people said they felt cheated at having to postpone their retirement, particularly as every day seems to bring questions about fraud, executive compensation or accounting irregularities at yet another company.
"Obviously the stock market goes up and down, and the crap shoot is whether you're going to retire at the moment that it's up or down," said Gail Hovey, 62, who works for nonprofit groups in Hawaii. "But to have all the accounting irregularities and all the fraud on top of it, it makes you wonder who you can trust."
"I've worked hard all my life and been a responsible citizen." Ms. Hovey added. "And it's not supposed to be threatened at this point." 
But if the fraud has made people angry, the losses have made some more philosophical.
"I really enjoy controlling my own destiny, rather than depending on the stock market or corporate America," said Mr. Pringle, who started an advertising agency with his wife, as they had done 29 years earlier, at their retirement home in South Carolina.
Misfortune has also revealed pockets of pluck. Mrs. Pringle let off an exasperated laugh as she told how she "retired, supposedly" but then spoke enthusiastically about the new kind of pretzel, shaped like a golf tee, that she is marketing at professional tournaments. She and her husband have far fewer accounts than they did in Atlanta, she said, but now they work overlooking the beach.
"When we got here, I said: 'Lord, I am just going to come down here, do good by you and do your work. What would you have me do?' " she said. "I suppose this was what he had in mind."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: INSIDE BASEBALL; 
Bankruptcy Fallout Would Prove Thorny

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
While the Yankees and the Atlanta Braves are headed for the playoffs again, fans of some less economically blessed teams have to wonder if they are headed for bankruptcy.
 Such a financial fate has long been unthinkable, but Commissioner Bud Selig has raised the specter of one or more teams going out of business, saying Major League Baseball is no longer in a position to bail teams out of economic distress. 
 Some people on the players' side believe the talk from Selig and club owners about teams in danger is part of management's negotiating strategy. Selig firmly rejects that suggestion. He points to trouble two teams have had recently coming up with money to pay their players. He talks about $3.6 million in major league debt. 
It seems only reasonable, then, to ask if Chapter 11 is in anyone's future, and that's not a section of the Official Baseball Rules. The possibility hasn't escaped the attention of Major League Baseball.
"They have been diligently getting analysis from bankruptcy experts of the consequences of bankrupting individual teams," a baseball lawyer said.
A baseball official said that Bob DuPuy, the chief operating officer, has a 300-page notebook covering all of the issues that could arise in a club bankruptcy.
"Bankruptcy would be available as an option for a baseball team, and a Chapter 11 filing would not require a team to cease operating," said Kenneth Eckstein, head of the bankruptcy group at the New York law firm of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel. "They would be permitted to continue to operate, and if they wanted, they could try to reorganize and restructure their long-term obligations in a way that could make them more viable."
But Eckstein added, "Bankruptcy for a Major League Baseball team would certainly raise a wide variety of complicated and difficult problems that would have to be carefully worked through."
Player contracts, for example. If a team filed for Chapter 11 and couldn't pay its players, would they become free agents? Their contracts stipulate that if the club defaults in its payments to the player, it has 10 days in which to remedy the default. If it is not fixed in that time, the player has the right to become a free agent. That's how Jim (Catfish) Hunter became a free agent in 1974. But the bankruptcy laws supersede individual contracts and even collective bargaining agreements. There is, for example, an automatic stay that comes with bankruptcy and would prevent anyone from taking adverse action against the team. No one could sue the team to get any money he is owed.
How that concept would apply to the contract clause calling for free agency might have to be determined by the bankruptcy judge. Lawyers who were asked their view of the matter differed, a labor lawyer saying he believed the contract clause would stand up, a management lawyer saying he thought the players would have to petition the court for relief from the automatic stay before they could become free.
A few years ago the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League went into bankruptcy, and their players were paid to prevent them from leaving as free agents.
One lawyer suggested that a team could pick and choose with its contracts, letting players leave if they had big contracts and weren't producing but retaining their other players. A player in that situation could file a damage claim against the club, but the claim could be limited under bankruptcy law.
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays, one of the troubled teams, could pursue that course with Greg Vaughn, for example. Vaughn is in the third year of a four-year, $34 million contract, and he's hitting .163. The unproductive designated hitter could face another problem. About 40 percent of the contract, $14 million, is deferred. If the Devil Rays filed for bankruptcy, he would have to get in line with the rest of the team's unsecured creditors to try to collect any of that deferred money. "If I were a player owed deferred money, I'd be concerned," a bankruptcy lawyer said.
Some people think baseball wouldn't allow a team to go bankrupt because it wouldn't want a judge to control the destiny of the team. But when the Baltimore Orioles were sold at an auction in bankruptcy court in 1993 after their owner, Eli Jacobs, filed for personal bankruptcy, the judge gave baseball great leeway. He recognized that the transfer of the team to a new owner would be subject to baseball's rules and approval by the other owners. Before the auction was held, baseball screened the prospective bidders, Peter Angelos (whose winning bid was $173 million), Bill DeWitt and Jeffrey Loria. 
One lawyer said he didn't think an owner would file for bankruptcy because if he did, he would forfeit his equity in the team. 
DuPuy, baseball's No. 2 official, said if a team faced bankruptcy, baseball would not step in and rescue it. "It's not a would not, it's a cannot," he said. "We have no resources to prevent it. We'll do everything we can to help teams survive. It's why we're engaged in the collective bargaining process. We have no desire to see teams fold. But we do not have the ability to take extraordinary steps to help individual clubs. There's no capacity for it."
If a team like the Devil Rays were to go into bankruptcy, a labor lawyer suggested, it could pose potentially perilous problems for baseball. He said he believed that a bankruptcy trustee would file an antitrust lawsuit against baseball, alleging that the expansion fee was exorbitant and constituted an unlawful exercise of a monopoly. 
"The argument," the lawyer said, "would be that if Tampa Bay hadn't had to pay all that money, they wouldn't be in this situation. But because they had to pay it, they didn't have enough operating capital. I'm not saying it's a winning lawsuit, but it's not a frivolous suit."

Contraction Ruling Delayed
Given the owners' desire to eliminate two teams through contraction, would they rather eliminate them that way or through bankruptcy's Chapter 7, under which a company liquidates its assets and goes out of business?
The owners and the players had hoped to learn tomorrow what the arbitrator, Shyam Das, thought of the contraction plan, but he has delayed until Aug. 1 his ruling on the union's challenge to the plan. Das could rule in one of three ways.
He could find that contraction is a step that the owners have to bargain with the union, he could decide that the clubs can eliminate teams without the union's approval, negotiating only the effects of contraction, or, and this possibility is the most intriguing, he could conclude the case without a win/lose result. He could declare the case moot.
Das could opt for the third ruling based on the absence of a second volunteer for contraction. When Commissioner Bud Selig was prepared to act last winter, the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were willing victims. But legal challenges blocked Selig's path.
Now that Major League Baseball has settled the Minnesota lawsuit by agreeing not to eliminate the Twins for the 2003 season, it has no team volunteering to join the Expos in extinction. Since Selig has made it clear that he will not eliminate a team without its consent, Das could find that without two contraction candidates, no decision is necessary.
When and if the owners find a second volunteer and are prepared to act, circumstances could be different. The arbitrator could feel it would be more appropriate to decide the case then.

Tie Not Selig's Fault
Bud Selig is a natural lightning rod for criticism for just about every negative development in baseball, but he was an undeserving target for his decision to end the All-Star Game when it was tied.
In the immediate aftermath of the fiasco, the managers, Joe Torre and Bob Brenly, let the commissioner take the brunt of the criticism from fans and the news media when they were the ones who put him in position to make that decision.
By using all of their pitchers, Torre and Brenly left Selig with no alternative. He wasn't about to tell them to finish the game with position players pitching. That idea would have made the game a real farce. 
"They mismanaged themselves into a box and ran to Bud," one baseball person said of the managers. "When he made a decision the world didn't like, they didn't stand up and say 'we mismanaged.' "
Torre subsequently did acknowledge that he and Brenly put Selig in that position. "Nobody else did," the Yankees' manager said.

Using Two Lenses for Snapshot on Jobs

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton

 BODY:
WHO would have thought that arcane economic statistics would become a hot issue in the New York State governor's race? But they have, with Democrats and Republicans issuing dueling press releases and accusing each other of cooking the economic books.
 The dispute is over the upstate economy. Supporters of Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, insist that everything is hunky-dory, or at least better than in most other Rust Belt states. The State Democratic Party, which has two candidates vying to replace him, contends that Mr. Pataki "Has presided over massive job loss," as a recent press release put it. 
 Both sides trot out official government statistics to make their cases, but the statistics show opposite trends. In Buffalo, for example, the figures favored by the Republicans show a small job gain since the governor took office; the Democrats' data for the same period shows a hefty job loss. 
 Who's right? The upstate economy is obviously not fine and dandy, unless you are a fan of boarded-up storefronts.
 But the statistics that the Democrats are citing are, to put it kindly, flawed.
 You could almost call them "made up" - not by the Democrats, but by the New York State Department of Labor and federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nor is it the fault of these agencies. Congress orders them to come up with numbers, but won't give them the money to do it right. So they do the best they can.
 Let's start with the simple stuff. The job numbers that Republicans use and most economists rely on are based on a monthly survey of about 18,000 businesses. Then the State Labor Department fiddles with the numbers to try to make them reflect the economy.
 The cool thing about these numbers, from a data-nerd point of view, is that they are subject to an annual reality check. That's because practically every company in the state files tax returns for the unemployment insurance program, spelling out how many workers they have. So estimates can be revised to reflect reality.
 According to these numbers, New York State has gained 601,200 jobs since the end of 1994, an increase of 7.5 percent. About 288,000 of those jobs were in New York City, where employment increased 7.4 percent. Meanwhile, poor Buffalo's employment rose by just 8,500, or a measly 1.6 percent. 
 But there's another government statistic called employment, and it shows a statewide jobs increase of 5.1 percent, a rise in New York City of 9 percent, and a decline in Buffalo of 3.6 percent, or more than 19,000 jobs. What gives?
 These figures are calculated as part of the effort to determine unemployment rates, which the government uses to dole out its largess. They are based on a small survey of households - at most, 3,300 statewide, said Vincent S. DeSantis, state analyst for the Labor Department.
 People are asked questions about whether they are working or looking for work, and their answers are plugged into two statistical models, one for New York City and one for the rest of the state.
 Problem is, the models are based on the 1990 census, which, aside from being dated, may have undercounted the working-age population. The numbers these models produce have been lagging behind the payroll survey for years.
 Not until next year will the findings of the 2000 census start to be reflected in the models, said Ken LeVasseur, a senior economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At that point, he said, household employment levels should be revised substantially upward.
 Things get even muddier once you get to any areas less populous than New York City (or Los Angeles). The survey sample is too small to be accurate, so all the counties and urban areas get their employment level and unemployment rates by a mysterious method known as the handbook, or cookbook, technique. It uses data including the job numbers from the business survey, unemployment insurance claims, historical patterns and old census data to come up with employment and unemployment estimates.
 Economists tend to be dubious about all this. "You have the impression of cookbooks covered with dust, passed on from generation to generation and stored in a cave under the Brooklyn Bridge," said Mark Sandi, chief economoist for Economy.com, which specializes in regional analyses.
 The payroll survey "has its warts," he said, but "economists prefer it." It will be interesting to see if voters prefer it, too.

HEADLINE: The Tiger Files 

BYLINE:  By Michael Sokolove 

 BODY:
On Thursday, when play begins in Muirfield, Scotland, site of this year's British Open, Tiger Woods will resume his quest to capture golf's Grand Slam -- winning all four major tournaments in one year. It has never been done. By winning the Masters and United States Open this year, Woods became the first golfer since Jack Nicklaus, 30 years ago, to get even halfway there. Woods did win four consecutive majors, but over two years (2000 and 2001), in what has become known as the Tiger Slam. As a golfer, Woods has no peer. 
 But his dominance goes beyond sheer physical excellence. He has an inner calm and concentration, often ascribed to his Buddhist upbringing, that is perfectly suited to a game, 90 percent of which, as Yogi Berra might say, is half mental. It often seems as if his competitors, sensing his imperturbability, look for some way to self-destruct. As an icon, Tiger Woods also has no peer; not now, certainly, and maybe not ever. At 26, he is post-Jordan, postmodern, almost post-human. 

Becoming Tiger
His father, Earl, a talented golfer in his own right, measured the 6-month-old Tiger's attention span at two hours. At 10 months, Tiger climbed out of his highchair and mimicked his father's golf swing. At 2, he demonstrated his swing on the nationally televised "Mike Douglas Show" and putted against Bob Hope. At 3, he began media training. At 5, he was on "That's Incredible." At 7, he sank 80 four-foot putts in a row. At 13, he had a sports psychologist. His parents never once had to discipline him. He never had a baby sitter. Or a job -- before joining the PGA Tour.

Physical Tiger
The green jacket slipped on Tiger as Masters champion is a size 42 long. He has gained 20 pounds of muscle since he joined the PGA Tour in 1996, but his workout regime is a trade secret. "I have a routine, but I don't need to share it with the world," he says. His clubhead speed has been timed at 125 miles per hour; the average for pros is 105 to 110. Tiger combines strength with an effortless grace. The crease on each leg of his golf pants, over the course of five hours and 18 holes, remains razor sharp. He is splattered with more Nike swooshes than TV can reveal -- from his hat, to his belt, to the back pockets of his pants and all the way down to the tiny white swooshes on the soles and heels of his black golf shoes. Tiger's shoes are always black, because any other color distracts him while putting.

Tiger's swing is a near-perfect marriage of . . . strength, flexibility and timing. He fires his hips and whips the clubhead. At impact, his kinetic energy is transferred to the ball. Tiger's initial ball speed, at two feet off the tee, is . . . 180 miles per hour, 20 m.p.h. faster than the average tour pro.

Ace in the Hole
Tiger has one shot -- "the stinger" -- that no other golfer can replicate. It is a screaming, low-trajectory 2-iron that carries up to 260 yards in the air, nearly as far as many pros hit their drivers. He learned it in order to punch the ball through the wind but now sometimes uses it when he's hitting his driver erratically. The stinger was developed by the golf legend Ben Hogan, who taught it to Claude Harmon, the 1948 Masters champion, who taught it to his son, Butch Harmon -- who has been Tiger's coach since Tiger was a 17-year-old in Orange County, Calif. Steve Elkington, among the stronger players on tour, says he has a similar shot, "but mine goes about 190 yards."

Purring Tiger
His current girlfriend is Elin Nordegren, 22; she was a nanny for the golfer Jesper Parnevik's four children.

The Inner Frat Boy
In interviews, Tiger is guarded and noncommittal. He has never publicly expressed a political opinion. He prefers to speak through his TV commercials, his agent says, which show Tiger "outside the ropes, a real human side of him." One reason: the unscripted Tiger is smart-alecky, maybe a bit too much so for mass-market consumption. At the United States Open, fans caught a snippet of that when he received a raucous ovation after emerging from an on-course portable bathroom. "Are you guys clapping," Woods asked, "because I'm potty-trained?"

Corporate Tiger
Tiger said in 1997 that he would work with Nike and maybe a couple of other companies, but wouldn't be the "king of endorsement money." Today, as the king of endorsement money, he pitches for a dozen companies -- in addition to Nike and Buick, they include American Express, Rolex, Disney and Asahi -- and will earn an estimated $61.5 million this year. By 40, it is projected that he will have earned $1 billion. Even when he's sleeping, he earns $2 every time his heart beats. He's a dutiful corporate servant -- after each victory, Tiger slides on his Rolex before the television interview. He took on the PGA commissioner, Tim Finchem, two years ago over "implied endorsements" -- the tour using his likeness with its own advertisers, sometimes in competition with products he endorses. Now, says his agent, Mark Steinberg, Tiger sits down with Finchem "once a quarter" to make sure there are no outstanding issues and that Tiger's partners are "protected."

The Intimidator
It is a given on the PGA Tour that Tiger's dominance has damaged the competitive psyche of his closest rivals. "You can see that for yourself," Ernie Els says. "You don't have to be a golf expert to see it. Yeah, it's basically the truth." Els finished second to Tiger four times in 2000, twice in majors. He had already won two majors before Tiger became fully dominant. Phil Mickelson, ranked second in the world, is a basket case, taking absurd gambles as if he wants to end his misery. He has yet to win a major. Woods has won 7 of the last 11, and none of the players who prevailed when he didn't -- David Duval, David Toms, Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen -- have consistently challenged him in other majors. Says Fran Pirozzolo, a sports psychologist, of the tormented herd: "I tell them to keep in mind other stakes they are playing for. There's second-place money. Ryder Cup points. President's Cup points. And self-respect."

Earls of Wisdom
"Tiger will do more than any other man in history to change the course of humanity," his father, Earl, a retired Green Beret who served two tours in Vietnam, has said. Earl said Tiger would have a greater impact than Buddha, Gandhi and Mandela: "He has a larger forum than any of them, because he's playing a sport that's international, because he's qualified through his ethnicity to accomplish miracles. He's the bridge between East and West. There is no limit because he has the guidance. I don't know exactly what form this will take. But he is the Chosen One." When Tiger met Nelson Mandela, Earl said of the great South African freedom fighter, "He saw himself in Tiger."

Scuba Do
Tiger likes to scuba dive, he says, because "the fish don't know who I am." He is a neat freak who makes his own bed in hotel rooms. He spends hours watching the Discovery Channel and tunes in to ESPN's SportsCenter three times a day. He doesn't like to tip. "He's got all that money and he's still cheap," Butch Harmon has said. "He still doesn't know the meaning of the word 'tip."' He has been adopted by Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley, as well as by the sportscaster and former NFL player Ahmad Rashad. They all call one another "The Brothers." For his 25th birthday, they took him for a weeklong party to a luxury hotel in the Bahamas, where they gambled and smoked Cuban cigars. Tiger also brought some of his childhood buddies -- and dyed his hair blond.

Zen Tiger
In competition, he rests his mind by fixing on birds, flowers, water plants. His mother, Kultida, says that she raised her son a Buddhist and that he meditates. Every year on his birthday, they made gifts of rice, sugar and salt to monks who had foresworn material things. His father, Earl, who took charge of developing the Western side of Tiger's brain, tried every trick he could to disturb his son's calm. While Tiger was in midswing, he would push over a golf bag, jiggle keys, throw pebbles at his ball. Pressure corrodes the swings of even the best golfers, but not Tiger's. "Everything builds to a crescendo," Tiger has said. "Your senses are heightened, your awareness of where the club is and what the situation is, and that's when you execute the shot. It's also a time when you're at your calmest." Still, it's not all about karma and alpha waves. He prepares. Tiger flew in on his private jet this spring to check out Bethpage State Park's Black Course, site of his United States Open triumph. He didn't bring his caddie or take notes. He just downloaded the topography into his brain, as if he had a CD-ROM drawer in his head. He then flew home to Windermere, Fla., and spent hours a day over two weeks practicing the shots he would need.

Beyond Race
The golf tee was invented in 1899 by George F. Grant, a black, Harvard-educated dentist. There have long been black golfers, including good PGA Tour players like Charlie Sifford, who broke the color line in 1961; Lee Elder, the first black man to play the Masters; and Calvin Peete, who won 12 tournaments in the 1980's. There has never been a black player, or any player, to dominate like Tiger. But he has long refused to identify as solely black. Earl Woods is African-American, with some Chinese, American Indian and European ancestry mixed in. Kultida is Thai. Tiger made up a word to describe himself: Cablinasian. Ebony magazine once convened a panel that included a Yale professor, a congresswoman and the president of the N.A.A.C.P. to contemplate what Tiger is. Tiger declined to participate. His mother has called him, simply, the "universal child." Charles Barkley, among others, wants Tiger to declare himself black, telling his younger friend, "Thai people don't get hate mail; black people do."

Icy Tiger
Tiger can be as cold off the course as on. He dumped his caddie, Mike (Fluff) Cowen, who was making his own endorsements and had set up his own Web site. Tiger also switched agents. He may even, recently, have sidelined his father, who said on the eve of the United States Open, "My role now is the quarterback who has been sent to the bench." The most important current members of Team Tiger are his agent, Mark Steinberg; his caddie, Steve Williams; and Greg Nared, of Nike's golf division.

The Tiger Economy
Despite early optimistic predictions, Tiger's popularity has had no measurable effect on the overall golf economy. Total sales of golf clubs, balls, shoes and bags were $2.4 billion in the United States last year -- virtually the same as in 1997, Tiger's first full year on tour. The number of golfers has remained flat in recent years, at about 26 million. The one segment of the golf economy that's healthy is the Tiger Woods segment. Nike introduced a line of golf balls in 1998 and eked out a market share of 2 percent. After Tiger switched to Nike balls, that soared to 10 percent. The Nike Tour Accuracy TW, Tiger's ball, costs about $50 a dozen. Tiger, who signed a five-year, $100 million Nike endorsement contract in 2000, still uses Titleist irons but is testing new Nike irons and says he will switch as soon as they feel comfortable. Tiger has also lifted the PGA tour. In 1997, the total purse for tournaments -- prize money shared by the players -- came to $80.5million. The total this year, thanks to higher TV ratings, will rise to an estimated $198 million. In 1997, the 10th-leading money winner made $1.2 million and the 100th made $241,000. Those numbers last year were $2.8 million and $500,000. "He's putting my kids through college," Nick Price says. "There's more money out there than any of us ever dreamed of, and he's the reason." In 2000, Tiger's best on-course earnings year, he won $9.2 million in prize money, almost $5 million more than the runner-up, Phil Mickelson. Tiger averaged $459,000 per tournament and often earns $2 million just for showing up at foreign tournaments.

His Three Best ShotsU.S. Amateur Championship, 1996: Tiger's the reigning two-time champion, and he badly wants to capture the tourney a third time. But he plays poorly and falls behind Steve Scott in the 36-hole match-play final. (In match play, golfers win, lose or tie a hole.) On the 35th hole, still trailing by one, he leaves himself a nearly impossible 35-foot putt over an undulating green for the tying birdie. He measures the putt, stands over his ball, drains it and then runs across the green pumping his fist. "That's a feeling I'll remember for the rest of my life," he says. Tiger won the match on the 38th hole -- then announced that he would leave Stanford, and amateur golf, to join the PGA Tour.The Canadian Open, 2000: It's the 18th hole of the final round , the light is fading and an approaching storm has kicked up the wind. Protecting a one-shot lead, Tiger hits into a fairway bunker, 218 yards from the green. A lake nestled against the green guards the hole. The safe shot -- if there is one -- is to the middle of the green, but Tiger chooses what golfers call an "aggressive line." Five feet to the right or five feet short, it's in the water. He hits a 6-iron 18 feet from the hole, makes a birdie and wins the tournament.U.S. Open, 2002: On the back nine, Phil Mickelson, the last challenger still standing, birdies the par-5 13th hole to pull within two shots. Ten minutes later, Tiger drives the ball to the middle of the 13th fairway, then executes the sort of dagger-in-the-heart play that is his specialty -- a towering, 263-yard iron shot that lands in the center of the green and sets him up to match Mickelson's birdie. "It was a full-bore, all-out 2-iron, hit perfectly and at just the right moment," says Butch Harmon. Tiger gets the birdie; Mickelson disintegrates; Tiger captures his eighth major.

Beating Tiger
There has been talk about "Tiger-proofing" golf courses -- lengthening holes, narrowing fairways, deepening roughs. But making courses harder just makes Tiger more untouchable. There's only one sure way to Tiger-proof courses: make them so easy any slob could score well. Otherwise, Tiger is liable to dominate golf -- and the athletic universe -- for years to come.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 7-14-02: QUESTIONS FOR HOWARD DEAN; 
Is It 2004 Yet?

BYLINE:  By David Wallis 

 BODY:
Q: You are arguably the least-known candidate running for the Democratic presidential nomination, even though you've served longer than any standing Democratic governor -- 11 years -- and according to a longtime observer of Vermont politics, you've been "running for president since you were 15."
 That's abject nonsense. I realized that I could do this after my last election campaign for governor. I actually toyed with running before the 2000 campaign, but I realized at that time there was no way I was going to beat an incumbent vice president. 
 Going up against people like Al Gore in 2004, how hard is it for you to raise money?
It's hard. We're going to do most of ours in small donations. If you are not a household name, people are not interested in writing big checks or calling other people to get them to write big checks. The trick is gluing your fanny in the chair and dialing. You would be astonished to find out how many politicians will find any excuse not to do that.
Describe your worst day on the trail so far.
The worst one was when I got to Greek Day in Boston thinking I was giving a speech, but all the speeches were to be given in Greek.
Best day?
Having breakfast with the head of the United Auto Workers in Iowa, who invited me to speak at a convention. He's probably the leading labor leader in Iowa, and that's a huge invite for me because nobody knows who I am. The activists in Iowa are beginning to know who I am. 
In other states, people have never heard of me. 
You used to be a practicing physician. Do your skills as a doctor come in handy on the trail?
There are three skills, but only two of them come in handy. The first is that I base my positions on fact, not emotion or ideology. That's a good thing. It keeps me in the center of most issues because the solutions are in the center. Secondly, I have the ability to make a decision quickly. The third quality I don't think has served me so well. Doctors tend to be impatient. I like results. And the legislative game is a game of process, not results.
You know Bill Clinton well. Has he given you any advice on running for president?
He was very helpful in framing an issue that's become the most important one in the campaign -- economic security. People are not angry at business, but they don't trust it. What he helped me do is frame the issue without sounding like a foam-at-the-mouth populist. In my speeches, I talk about playing by the rules, which is a great way of talking about corporations without seeming antibusiness, which I don't want to do.
He governed a small state and went on to the White House. Is he your political role model? 
I don't have the kind of political skills he has. 
I will model my campaign more after Jimmy Carter's or Gary Hart's or even John McCain's. 
Pundits often compare you to McCain for your candor. As he gained in the polls, his foes spread rumors that he was a loose cannon. Already rumors are starting to pop up that you've got a bad temper. 
 Laughs I don't think I've yelled at people on my staff in 11 years. There have been 4 or 5 people I've yelled at, maybe 10 or 11. One person a year is not exactly a bad temper. 
Who would be your model as a vice president?
Dick Cheney. It sounds like an odd thing to say because I don't agree with almost anything he says, but he's incredibly competent. He knows how government works.
Rate President Bush.
He's doing a fine job on the war on terrorism. I think he gets an F on domestic policy. I think the tax cut is irresponsible. His welfare proposal takes power away from the states and centralizes it in the federal government, as does his education bill. And he's done nothing on health care. So I find no redeeming social value in the president's domestic agenda.
Debunk the theory that only Southern Democrats can win the White House.
I was born a Yankee, and there's nothing I can do about that. But I'm an odd duck. I signed the most far-reaching gay rights bill in the country, and I have an A grade from the National Rifle Association. So who knows where this will go? 
If you don't make it to the White House, what will you do for a living?
Something in public policy.
You won't go back to medicine?
If I were you, I would not be my first patient after 11 years. David Wallis

Tax Analysis Says the Rich Still Win

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
THERE are many ways to measure the impact of tax changes. Under the cuts that President Bush championed last year, for example, the affluent and the very rich come out way ahead in dollars, mainly because they pay the highest rates and get the biggest rate reductions.
 Now a new analysis shows that when measured another way, adjusting for differences in incomes, the rich still fare far better than the poor and much better than the merely affluent. The poor with children get almost nothing. 
 The new analysis examines in percentage terms how much more income people will have for spending after taxes in 2010, when the Bush tax cuts are fully in effect. The analysis was made by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, nonprofit research organizations in Washington.
It used the same economic modeling software that the Treasury Department relies on.
The center is staffed with liberal and centrist researchers, but the research has also attracted financial support from the Smith Richardson Foundation, one of the biggest long-term supporters of conservative advocacy organizations in Washington.
The analysis shows that the one in five taxpayers making up to $10,000 a year will receive an increase in after-tax income in 2010 of slightly more than one-half of 1 percent. In dollars, the additional money available for spending after taxes will average 98 cents a week for someone earning exactly $10,000.
The poor with children will have at most just 38 cents more a week to spend after taxes, while the poor without children will have as much as $1.32 more per week as a result of the Bush tax cuts, the analysis showed.
IN percentage terms, the affluent -- those making $100,000 to $200,000 that year -- will fare only slightly better than the poor. (About one taxpayer in eleven falls into this group.) 
The affluent will have just 0.85 percent more in their pockets after taxes because the Bush tax cuts are heavily offset by another levy, the alternative minimum tax, which takes away most of the Bush tax breaks for this group. 
In dollars, a person in the affluent group making a penny under $200,000 will get an additional $32 a week to spend after taxes.
Those making $200,000 or more will fare best, with 3.3 percent more to spend after taxes. At $200,000, that translates into an extra $127 a week to spend.
Looked at another way, in percentage terms the highest-income Americans will get an increase more than six times that of the poor and nearly four times that of the affluent group just below the very rich on the income ladder. In dollars, of course, these ratios are much larger.
The analysis found a category of taxpayers who, in percentage terms, will fare better than the rich: people who make $20,000 to $40,000 a year and have children. 
They will benefit from the child tax credit, which will rise to $1,000 a child in 2010 from $600 now, while few of them will be affected by the alternative minimum tax.
Taxpayers in the $20,000-to-$30,000 class who have children will have 4.6 percent more to spend after taxes (a maximum of $27 a week), while those making $30,000 to $40,000 will get a 3.7 percent increase (a maximum of $28 a week).

HEADLINE: The Hypocrisy of Wall Street Culture 

BYLINE:  By Kate Jennings; Kate Jennings is the author of "Moral Hazard," a novel.

 BODY:
In "The Devil's Dictionary," Ambrose Bierce famously defined a corporation as "an ingenious device for obtaining individual profit without individual responsibility." Bierce and his wicked definition came to mind when President Bush called for a "new ethic of personal responsibility in the business community" during his Wall Street speech. Bierce would've been delighted at the coincidence.
 To many of us, the president's rhetoric on Tuesday was all gaping gum, no teeth. If by chance, though, he was being sincere, Mr. Bush was knocking himself out for nothing because, as Bierce's definition implies, the structure of American corporations is inimical to the "new" ethic he was espousing. Despite the efforts of many fine people, American corporations are notorious for daddy-knows-best, brook-no-dissent cultures where personal responsibility more often dies than flourishes. They are also secretive, self-referential environments where transparency, Mr. Bush's other hobbyhorse, is unlikely to be embraced in any form, accounting or otherwise, except as window-dressing. 
 I make these observations as someone who worked for much of the 1990's as a speechwriter at two major Wall Street financial services corporations. Until then, I'd had no experience of closed societies and rigid hierarchies; perforce, to survive, I had to turn myself into something of an anthropologist.
One paradox was hard to miss: When I crossed the thresholds of those downtown skyscrapers, I went from a one-person, one-vote democracy -- messy, noisy, infuriating, but democratic -- to a netherworld where fear was the primary management tool and dossiers, censorship, misinformation and various forms of surveillance were standard practice. To me, corporations seemed not merely autocratic but totalitarian; the engines of America's fabled democratic society are anything but.
To heap paradox on paradox, because I worked with investment bankers I was surrounded by free-market fundamentalists who roamed the globe preaching a triumphant gospel of deregulation from which all freedoms would flow, yet returned to a bureaucratic roost perfectly Soviet in its rigidity.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, followed by the tech boom, had "turbo-charged" -- to use a favorite piece of business jargon -- their sense of superiority and rightness in all things, not just economic. Of course, free markets were allowed to be free only when it suited bankers; when Long-Term Capital Management faced collapse, instead of allowing it to fail, as the market was clearly dictating, they bailed it out to save themselves. In fact, derivatives-related debacles were piling up faster than car wrecks on a foggy highway. Cost of doing business, said the bankers. Harbingers of much worse to come, said prescient students of financial scandals.
One can argue that corporations, like the armed forces, have to be autocratic. But delivering goods and services in an efficient, competitive manner doesn't require the same unquestioning loyalty as fighting wars. Disciplined teamwork, yes, but not blind obedience. From my experience, corporate employees, while understanding the need for unity, are hungry for real debate, not scripted events. Without it, they know, there is no intellectual growth -- just executive mind-sets growing thick and wrinkly as elephant hide.
Every now and again, employees revolt against being treated as children. I remember a meeting where someone got the bright -- and career-undermining -- idea of polling the assembled managing directors on whether they thought the firm's strategy, as just outlined by the chief executive, would succeed; they were to punch in their responses on handheld devices, to be instantly flashed up on a screen in a way that would be hard to ignore.
Against all rules of corporate decorum, a majority voted no, the firm's strategy wouldn't succeed. Loud gasp. As stunning as this moment was, it was just as stunningly passed over; the meeting continued as if the vote had never happened. In any sane, responsive world, the C.E.O. would've stopped the proceedings and started a debate as to why the managing directors felt that way. The frustration in the hall was palpable.
Yet such high-handedness is accepted. Executives not only routinely ignore their employees, they appease the market whenever necessary by firing large quantities of them -- all done with impunity. It was not until the events of the last months, however, that many shareholders became aware of the extent to which they, too, are but pawns in management's game. They didn't have to lose their portfolios and pensions to learn this, because there has long been one dead giveaway of corporate disdain for shareholders: All over the United States, when the season arrives for annual shareholder meetings, corporations convene them in out-of-the-way places to dissuade shareholders from attending and asking pesky questions.
To return to Ambrose Bierce. Under the entry for "riches" in "The Devil's Dictionary," instead of a definition, you will find three quotes:

"A gift from Heaven signifying, 'This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.' "
John D. Rockefeller

"The reward of toil and virtue."
J. P. Morgan

"The savings of many in the hands of one."
Eugene Debs
On which Bierce -- prince of curmudgeons, king of cynics, long may he be read and emulated -- wisely refused to expand.

HEADLINE: Is True Reform Possible Here? 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH with CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IN late June, with the fresh indictments of two chief executives only the latest in a seemingly endless string of business scandals, President Bush invited the 140 corporate leaders who make up the Business Roundtable to a briefing in the Old Executive Office Building. The group meets with the president most summers, but this time there was something new at the top of his agenda: corporate accountability.
 "I expect you, as corporate leaders, to do everything within your power to bring back trust in corporate America," Mr. Bush told the assembled elite. 
 Soon thereafter, the Business Roundtable -- the only business group named by the president in his speech on Tuesday -- issued a statement saying that its members were "appalled, angered and, finally, alarmed" about the year's run of outrageous business news. They praised President Bush for taking a stand, acknowledged that their previous position on corporate ethics was "not enough" and sketched out some ideas for improvement. 
"We must and will be at the forefront of supporting these reforms," the statement said. 
For most of its 30 years, the Roundtable has remained a small, effective, somewhat mysterious fraternity, far less visible but far more influential than, say, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and tightly focused on a few important topics on which the government can affect business.
"Now, it is more focused on the process of governing the businesses themselves," said one Roundtable member, Robert S. Miller Jr., who is chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem Steel. "It is a sea change."
But is it? Institutional investors, academics, consumer watchdogs and others who monitor the goings-on in America's executive suites have their doubts. What reforms can emerge from a process in which the top executives themselves all play an instrumental role, they ask? True, the Business Roundtable is making all the right noises about broad principles of corporate governance, they say. But at the level where the specifics are sorted out -- in conference committees and accounting boards where the public never goes, for example -- the Roundtable in the past has used its considerable powers to block some of the very proposals now getting a second look in Washington.
"They preserve the kind of business-statesman attitude that was more typical of corporate America in the last generation," said Damon A. Silvers, associate general counsel for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and someone who has tangled often with the Roundtable. "It comes across as: 'We are not cowboys. We are not gamblers. We run large institutions and we are responsible stewards of those institutions.' That means that they can be a far more resourceful opponent of real reform than some of the cruder folks."
Even today, despite the rhetoric, the Roundtable opposes any changes in the accounting treatment of stock options, the seemingly obscure issue that many governance experts say is behind exorbitant executive pay and has fueled the worst abuses of many of the current scandals.
AT a time of intense debate about how to bring errant corporate chieftains into line, perhaps no group has as strong a self-interest in shaping the final package of reforms -- or the power to get the reforms it wants -- as the Business Roundtable. Founded by a handful of power brokers bent on building a pipeline between the nation's corporate leaders and its top government decision makers, its members today include Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric, Scott G. McNealy of Sun Microsystems, Sanford I. Weill of Citigroup, Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard, Philip M. Condit of Boeing and other chief executives chosen for their wattage and corporate heft. Together, their companies boast $3.5 trillion in revenue a year and employ about 10 million people.
As a lobbying group, the Roundtable itself regularly comes in second only to the Chamber of Commerce in spending by business groups -- but even that standing understates its influence. Individually, these corporations are among the biggest check writers to both political parties and to individual members of Congress. Those donations, along with the stature that members have in their headquarters cities, gives them open-door access at the highest levels of government and adds considerable weight to their viewpoints.
And what members do as part of the Roundtable overlaps and blurs with what they do as separate companies. Employees on their corporate payrolls, for example, are often detailed to do work for the organization.
"It's more than a little disingenuous to announce that they're terribly concerned," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research group in Washington that monitors money in politics. "They were out there lobbying against any reforms throughout the 1990's."
And earlier. More than two decades ago, the Business Roundtable published "Corporate Governance and American Competitiveness," which pronounced the status quo "excellent," with "proven self-correction mechanisms." During the spate of hostile takeovers in the 1980's, it promoted an ambitious program of "control over the processes of corporate governance" that institutional investors pooh-poohed as a mere effort to entrench embattled executives in their corner offices.
In 1988, the Roundtable tried to have a federal court strike down a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule enshrining the one-share, one-vote concept in law. Two years later, it went to war with the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the huge pension institution known as Calpers.
Calpers had tried to poll the 4,500 corporate directors whose companies make up the Standard & Poor's 500 index on their views about executive power. The chairman of the Roundtable's corporate governance task force, H. Bruce Atwater, chief executive of General Mills, said he was "very concerned" about just what Calpers was really up to, and wrote to all the Roundtable chief executives, urging them to tell their directors not to respond. Calpers withdrew the questionnaire.
But the most heated battle was fought over an accounting rule -- the important rule laying out how corporations should treat stock-option grants in their yearly financial statements.
Since 1985, specialists at the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a private organization that makes accounting rules, have wanted to improve the way companies report option grants; they proposed in 1993 that companies deduct the value of the options on their income statements, just as any other compensation expense is treated.
Timothy S. Lucas, who recently retired as the board's research director, said he had never seen anything like what followed. In other cases, the rule makers had tried in vain to have chief executives involved in their work, he said. But this time, John S. Reed, then chief executive of Citicorp and chairman of the Roundtable's accounting principles task force, summoned him and the board's voting members to a private meeting. John F. Welch Jr., then chief of General Electric, and Mr. Weill, then the head of Travelers Group, were also present, he recalled.
This all-star lineup praised stock options as an excellent employee-motivational tool and an engine of economic dynamism; the board's complicated rule would spoil everything by making companies unwilling to issue them, they said. Mr. Lucas had heard it all before and found it as unpersuasive as ever. 
But the Roundtable luminaries made clear the stakes as no one else could, he said. He left the encounter with the understanding that even if the board went ahead with its rule, the S.E.C. would never enforce it anyway. The business opposition was just too strong.
In the end, the board backed off and required only that companies disclose the value of their option grants in footnotes. That move, critics say, allows companies to overstate their earnings.
And it helps executives pad their pay. A Citicorp proxy statement shows that, in addition to his 1993 cash-and-stock compensation of $6.2 million, Mr. Reed received options that would be worth $21 million in 10 years, assuming appreciation of 10 percent a year, for example. In keeping with the accounting board's requirements, Citicorp's income statement -- like those of most companies -- did not say how much it cost to issue those or subsequent options awarded to employees. Options have since soared in popularity.
Executives say it would be unfair to judge the Business Roundtable's commitment to reform today by actions it took in earlier years. 
"This is a time for corporate responsibility, and that's what the Roundtable is supposed to be about," said Larry Johnston, chairman and chief executive of Albertson's Inc., a chain of 2,300 supermarkets and drugstores based in Boise, Idaho, who is not a Roundtable member. 
Previously, he might have expected the Roundtable to pounce on the corporate-governance legislation now being debated in Congress and "pick the bill apart into a million pieces," Mr. Johnston said. Now, he added, it makes sense for the business leaders to register approval of such legislation, as the group did last week. It voiced support for both the Democratic bill in the Senate and the Republican-sponsored House bill.
"They would have looked terrible not supporting it," he said. "We all learn and move forward every day. Every day, this thing about corporate responsibility is being more deeply imprinted on our psyche."
But William V. Hickey, chief executive of Sealed Air, a $3 billion packaging company best known for bubble wrap, who is not a member, has a slightly different take. 
"They haven't caved in on anything," he said. "When they felt that Enron was an isolated case, they didn't think we needed more regulation. But as more financial scandals have unfolded, they've gotten more concerned that these aren't a few bad apples -- it's a lot of bad apples. The C.E.O.'s of the Roundtable have simply recognized that this problem is a lot bigger than they'd thought, so I'm not surprised they came around."
The question outstanding, of course, is whether the Roundtable's stance is a temporary tactical move, possibly to stave off more fundamental change. Members remain opposed, for example, to treating option grants as expenses.
"If additional regulatory action is needed, so be it," said Mr. Miller, of Bethlehem Steel. He added that he has seen a radical change in the tone of Business Roundtable meetings in recent months. After Sept. 11, he said, the group's chairman, John T. Dillon of International Paper, pulled together an impromptu briefing at the request of Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, who wanted the chief executives' sense of the national mood and advice on how the government could bolster it.
NOW the tables have turned. The issue is not what Washington might do to regain the confidence of business; it is what Washington expects business to do to regain the confidence of the public.
"We know there must be additional steps taken in the way boards of directors are structured, the independence of those boards, the strengthening of the S.E.C.," Mr. Miller said. "Many C.E.O.'s feel the way I do, that all of us have had our integrity impugned by a few bad actors, and we also are very aware of the need to restore credibility in America's business institutions."
Already, one disgraced chief executive has disappeared from the Roundtable's membership rolls. L. Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco International, who made more than $100 million by selling his Tyco shares before the stock collapsed, has been indicted on charges of tax evasion and evidence-tampering. Mr. Kozlowski resigned as Tyco's chief executive last month and is no longer eligible to serve on the Roundtable. 
The group's president, John J. Castellani, said it is unclear whether Mr. Kozlowski's successor will be invited to join it if and when Tyco is revived. Only chief executives of selected companies can be members of the Roundtable, and Tyco is being run at the moment by a lead director, John F. Fort III. 
Mr. Castellani, who is an employee of the Roundtable, said it selects new members in part on the basis of where their corporations are, what they do, whether a prospective company seems to view participation in the public-policy process as important and whether the candidate "is an individual chief executive whose voice is important in the public-policy process." Of course, the Roundtable wants to include the whole spectrum of regions and sectors of the economy. Once it had 200 members, but mergers have shrunk the total. Mr. Castellani said it had no plans to expand.
From the beginning, the idea was to draw strength not from numbers but from exclusivity. When the Roundtable took shape in the early 1970's, post-Vietnam reforms and the Watergate scandal were breaking down party discipline and other traditional power alignments in Washington. Corporate America was being squeezed by a system of price controls but couldn't figure out whom to lobby in the fast-changing political landscape.
According to Robert A. G. Monks, a longtime shareholder activist, John B. Connally, who was then Treasury secretary in the Nixon administration, devised the Roundtable's model after the chief executives of Alcoa and General Electric told him about their predicament. The idea: to cut out the middleman and create a forum where the nation's top corporate chieftains could lobby government decision makers directly.
Today, the Business Roundtable meets five times a year in Washington; about 70 to 80 chief executives normally show up. More of them attend the presidential briefings the group tries to arrange each summer. 
Not every member is active, of course.
"I go to one meeting a year, because I think I have to," said one member who, for obvious reasons, would not speak for attribution. "I think the whole thing is a monumental waste of time."
Still, the meetings are supposed to involve senior officials whose portfolios affect member companies. In addition to seeing Mr. O'Neill after last September's attacks, Mr. Castellani said, the members talked with Tom Ridge, Mr. Bush's director of domestic security, about terrorism. That meeting led to the creation of "C.E.O. COM Link," a secure communication system between Roundtable members and the Office of Homeland Security to be used in emergencies.
The Roundtable creates task forces to carry out its agenda, each led by a chief executive who typically taps his own corporate staff for task-force work. There are nine such groups at the moment, including a corporate governance task force led by Franklin D. Raines, the chief executive of Fannie Mae.
That appointment in itself strikes some critics as out of step. Because it is a government-sponsored corporation, Fannie Mae's board is larded with political appointees -- which while not the fault of Mr. Raines makes him an odd choice to work toward exemplary boardrooms.
In February, after the Enron collapse, the corporate governance task force met and decided to update the Roundtable's governance guidelines, which hadn't been revised since 1997. Mr. Raines said in a news conference last spring that the task force pulled together its thoughts "in record time" because "the members were so outraged by what they saw at Enron."
The new statement of principles was unveiled in May, to mixed reviews from investor groups and corporate watchdogs. The Roundtable called for improved standards of independence on corporate boards -- particularly on boards' crucial audit committees -- going well beyond the requirements in place at the time for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market. On the other hand, the Roundtable refrained from taking aggressive positions on keeping auditors independent or accounting for stock options on income statements. 
And in May, as the New York Stock Exchange prepared to follow the Roundtable with its own list of corporate-governance reforms, the chairman of the group's fiscal policy task force, Stephen W. Sanger, chief executive of General Mills, moved swiftly against the exchange's plans to require listed companies to let shareholders vote on all stock option plans. Mr. Sanger wrote to his fellow Roundtable members on May 31 and urged them to voice their objections to the idea, which had not yet been publicly announced.
But much has happened since then, and the Roundtable has now come out in support of such shareholder voting rights.
"I don't know if you'd call it evolutionary or revolutionary," Mr. Miller said, "but the Roundtable recognizes that the credibility of business is at stake right now."
DOUBTERS say the acid test will be the impending battles -- again -- over how to account for stock option grants, a priority of shareholder activists, among others. Already, the International Accounting Standards Board is trying to come up with its own rule.
The Roundtable's position on this particular issue remains unchanged, Mr. Castellani said.
"We have gone around and around on trying to find a way to do it," he said. "We don't know any basis on which you would create a value for expensing them."
Ann Yerger, research director of the Council of Institutional Investors, disagrees. "That is always the response," she said, noting that the council once considered option accounting a hopeless task but had since reversed its position. 
Mr. Castellani added that the Roundtable believes that giving shareholders voting rights over option programs will do much to end the abusive stock option activity that has so angered investors this year.
"Stock options are compensation, and they have value," Ms. Yerger countered. "We know they have value because everybody wants them. And the fact is, that value can be reasonably estimated."

HEADLINE: Increasingly, It's the Economy That Scares Us 

BYLINE:  By Andrew Kohut; Andrew Kohut is director of the Pew Research Center.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the course of 24 hours last week President Bush gave a major speech calling for business reforms that will "usher in a new era of integrity in corporate America" and held a press conference that dealt more with Mr. Bush's conduct when he was a Harken Energy board member than with the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives was grilling former and current WorldCom executives about accounting irregularities, and senators were voting unanimously to support tough new corporate-reform legislation.
 Up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, both political parties are sensing the public disquiet over the expanding list of business scandals -- and sensing, too, that this fall's mid-term elections might not be only about how well Washington is dealing with terrorism. 
 They are right.
Stock market declines, fueled by the scandals, are deflating the public's hope about the economy. Many Americans are not so convinced that there is an economic recovery.
In the last week of June, for example, the Commerce Department and the Pew Research Center issued two very different reports. The government released figures showing that from January to March of this year the economy grew at an annual rate of 6.1 percent, the strongest showing in more than two years.
At the same time, Pew found that economic anxiety is on the increase. In a mid-June survey, only 30 percent of respondents said they expected the economy to improve, down from 44 percent six months ago. At about the same time, the Harris Poll found that the percentage of people naming the economy as the country's most important problem rose after falling in the early spring. And a Gallup survey found a diminished margin of economic optimism -- with 47 percent of respondents saying the economy is getting better and 40 percent saying it is worsening, compared with 52 percent and 39 percent respectively in early May. Tellingly, 67 percent of respondents in a subsequent Gallup survey said recent changes in the stock market have made them less confident about the nation's economy.
The recovery's apparent inability to generate jobs may well be another part of the election equation. Despite the end of the recession as economists see it, the unemployment rate rose slightly last month, to 5.9 percent. Some 150,000 jobs have been lost since the beginning of this year. And people have noticed. Just 31 percent of Americans said there are plenty of jobs available in their community, according to Pew's mid-June survey, down from 42 percent a year ago.
This is emerging as a central concern even for the upper middle class and suburbanites, who may be worrying about getting better jobs and raises. Among people with lower incomes, the anxiety is about losing a job or taking a pay cut.
As economic optimism has ebbed, the public's frustration with Washington is mounting. While President Bush's overall approval ratings remain quite strong, just one in three Americans says the president is doing all he can to improve the economy. And only one-quarter of Americans give Congress a good grade for its efforts on behalf of the economy.
Little wonder that when voters consider the subjects they want their local candidates to debate come the fall, about as many mention the economy as mention terrorism. One in five voters in Pew's latest survey say they want this fall's candidates to talk about terrorism and national security. But economic and education issues are cited just as often, and 13 percent mention health care.
Will public discontent with the economy eventually rise to a level that will cause voters to demand change in Washington? So far, that doesn't seem true. Pew polling continues to find that voter support is divided more or less equally between Republican and Democratic Congressional candidates.
A focus on the domestic agenda, and new revelations about corporate wrongdoing, would most likely help Democratic candidates. However, there's no guarantee that Democrats would be able to play the populist card effectively with voters, just as the Republicans have rarely been able to play the moralism card effectively.
Public anxiety about domestic economic issues is rising to the top, and neither party can skirt these issues in the coming campaign season.

Crisis, What Crisis?

BYLINE:  By ROB WALKER; Rob Walker is a contributing writer for Slate.com and Money Magazine.

 BODY:
LAST week, President Bush went to Wall Street to address what practically every market observer had labeled a "crisis" in the confidence of American investors. 
 "I'm calling for a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business community," Mr. Bush said, "an ethic that will increase investor confidence." 
 It's easy to understand why this is the White House line, as politicians in both parties look for ways to turn an investor-confidence crisis into electoral gains. It's equally easy to suggest reasons why investors might feel crisis-ridden, having watched as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average last week fell to their lowest levels since 1997. 
What's less easy to do is come up with any hard evidence that investors themselves actually believe the sky is falling.
For starters, no one seems to be stuffing money into mattresses. Despite predictions that consumers would to stop spending out of fear that the economy is about to collapse, they simply haven't. 
"I'm still spending," Amy Zarichnak, 30, said last week in Pittsburgh, after going shopping on her lunch break. "Even if Martha Stewart goes down, the U.S. economy won't. I'm not worried."
True, Henry Paulson, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in a speech last month that he had never seen such widespread skepticism of American business. And a Gallup poll in June found just 20 percent of respondents had "confidence" in "big business." 
But it turns out the last time this poll number dipped so low was way back in . . . 1995. Even at the height of the 1990's boom -- when few politicians had unkind words for business, and C.E.O.'s grinned like pop stars from the cover of every magazine -- the Gallup approval number never rose above 30 percent. 
Similarly, a recent column in The Wall Street Journal implied that employees were losing faith in their employers and admonished C.E.O.'s to work hard to "maintain faith" among the rank and file. But another Gallup poll found that 9 out of 10 workers trusted the executives who ran their firms, as well as those who handled its finances and accounting; that's about where the numbers were in April. (Although workers do have less trust in the leadership and bean-counters at other companies.) 
Perhaps most important, Americans continue to put money into stocks, largely by way of passive contributions to their 401(k) retirement accounts. Fund deposits have outstripped redemptions by a wide margin -- a net addition of more than $70 billion to equity funds in the first five months of the year, according to the Investment Company Institute, a fund industry trade group. 
Over the past two weeks there has been a small net removal of money from stock funds. Still, said Brian Portnoy, a fund analyst at Morningstar, a research firm, "The real story is that most investors aren't panicking." 
Moreover, a June poll by Ipsos Public Affairs, a New York market research company, found that investors' plans for investing over the next six months have hardly changed since the beginning of the year; indeed the percentage who planned to reduce their stock holdings was just barely higher than it was in late 1999. 
THIs leaves the major stock indexes themselves as the most conspicuous and up-to-the-minute site for proof of an investor confidence crisis. It's certainly true that those indexes are way off their historic highs. The S.&P. 500, for example, was down 40 percent last week from its peak in March 2000. But by historical standards share prices are still surprisingly healthy.
The most basic gauge of a stock's worth is the amount that investors are willing to pay for underlying earnings (the amount per share that the company is projected to earn over the year). Historically, stocks have traded, on average, at about 15 times earnings. Right now the stocks that make up the S.&P. 500 are trading at about 16.5 times expected earnings, according to Charles Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call. That number probably understates investor sentiment, because it's based on earnings estimates that will probably be revised down. 
In other words, by this measure, investors actually seem slightly more optimistic than the historical norm. Mr. Hill points out that figuring in the effects of today's low interest rates explains some of this, and concludes that the market is probably slightly undervalued. "We're borderline," he said.
Past crises in investor confidence, by contrast, have always left stocks clearly undervalued, but despite the great declines from the market's giddiest peaks, that hasn't happened yet. It's not that investors have no reason to worry. They have many. What's surprising is that, despite all the political posturing and all the ugliness that has turned the business pages into scandal sheets (as Mr. Bush put it), investors still aren't as pessimistic as they could be. 
It's possible that this is a triumph of rationality, since there's no law that stocks must dip below their past price-to-earnings patterns before things get better. On the other hand, it's also possible that investorsstill aren't worried enough.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
For T.R., Government Was the Solution

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN DALTON; Kathleen Dalton, an associate fellow at the Charles Warren Center at Harvard University, is author of "Theodore Roosevelt: A Strenuous Life," to be published by Alfred A. Knopf in October.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT Bush went to Wall Street on a mission last week. He wanted to reassure a skittish financial community worried that cascading stories of malfeasance by big business will further undermine public confidence. Mr. Bush recently talked of looking for inspiration in another president who led the nation in an era of corporate wrongdoing: Theodore Roosevelt. But Mr. Bush might not realize that Roosevelt was far more radical than any Republican of today. In fact, Roosevelt advocated a restructuring of government-business relations more radical than most Democrats now seek.
 While President Bush has proposed relatively minor reforms -- like hiring additional S.E.C. regulators -- these look tame when compared to Roosevelt's calls for a fundamental government intervention in the economy. He wanted national incorporation to make sure no corporation stayed in business if it violated the law repeatedly. He called for strict regulation of the stock market and a stronger Federal Trade Commission. He said he would like nothing better than to force companies to open their books to federal investigators and to make executives personally liable for jail when their corporations broke the law. The government should act like a referee, throwing cheaters out of the game to ensure fair play. 
 Roosevelt famously railed against the "malefactors of great wealth." He expressed moral outrage over the human consequences of business abuses and stirred empathy for the average person who lost a job. But Mr. Bush possesses the sensibilities of a free market age, when political leaders of left and right have worked to remove the regulatory shackles once placed on business. His mantras have been privatization, lower taxes and shrinking the scope of the federal government. Government was not a referee for all the people, but a problem in itself.
In contrast, Roosevelt was a rich man who cared little about money. He was disgusted by the effete sons of the Gilded Age elite. He disdained unbridled capitalism's way of abusing its workers. When Samuel L. Gompers and Jacob Riis took Roosevelt to see conditions in factories, coal mines and tenements, he came to believe that profits gained from exploitation were dirty money. He disliked the moral effect robber barons had on the country he loved.
Roosevelt also sought radical change because his was an era when the public lived in fear of the new businesses known as trusts. Trusts regularly used intimidation and violence to push competitors out of business or create monopolies. They held employees at gunpoint, sent children to work in unsafe factories, bought state legislators (sometimes for less than $50,000 each) and earned the title "robber barons" by behaving like arrogant feudal lords. For much of Roosevelt's presidency, he fought a Congress that thwarted most of his efforts to put "the hand of the government" on lawless corporations, but he never gave up hope that the government could solve the problem.
After he left office, Roosevelt moved to the left, holding views unthinkable for today's Republican Party and even for most Democrats. No major party candidate running for office today talks as powerfully about "distributive justice," as Roosevelt did in his 1912 presidential race. As the Bull Moose candidate, he talked about using government policies to discourage extremes of wealth and poverty.
ROOSEVELT wanted to use taxes to reduce "swollen fortunes" via a system of "heavily progressive" national inheritance, corporate and income tax. Tax justice, he insisted, would cut millionaires down to size and diminish their ability to use their wealth to buy off lawmakers. To protect the poorer half of the population from falling into poverty, Roosevelt defended the minimum wage, health and unemployment insurance, and the use of collective bargaining.
In 1918, soon before he died, Roosevelt said he wanted to find a way for workers to share in the profits and the stock of their employers. Economic equality would be hard to attain, but Roosevelt asserted that political democracy would have no meaning without government intervention to cushion the poor and tame the excesses of the rich.
For Roosevelt, the highest form of patriotism was "social justice," -- making the American system redistribute wealth in order for all its citizens to have a decent life. Perhaps President Bush should look more carefully at his choice of role model.

Is Today's New Investor Tomorrow's New Populist?

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
IMAGINE that the cryonics lab that took custody of the deceased baseball slugger Ted Williams last week had also managed to keep William Jennings Bryan on ice. The famous populist, who failed three times as a presidential candidate, might like his political chances if he could somehow wake up right now.
 The bane of big business and the moneyed class in 1896, Bryan would find much to shake his fist at in 2002: Accounting practices that seem to distort corporate earnings like a hall of mirrors. Thousands of people left jobless by scandals at Enron and WorldCom, even as top executives made fortunes. A sinking stock market that threatens the retirement accounts of millions of new investors who had been persuaded to place their faith in Wall Street rather than a savings account. And a sinking feeling that there is a new class of have-nots -- outsiders, cut off from the inside information that allowed top executives to cash in while ordinary shareholders lost their shirts. 
 The ingredients for an old-fashioned populist political appeal would seem at hand. Yet during a week in which President Bush and members of Congress competed to stake out political ground as business reformers, no one was certain whether the public had grown angry enough, and would stay angry enough, to vote their pocketbooks in November and, if so, who they would punish. 
"People are upset with the individual scandals," said Reggie Bashur, a Republican political consultant here in Texas, where Enron's bankruptcy filing last December cost 4,500 people their jobs and became the opening act in this season of corporate malfeasance. "How it plays politically is yet to be seen. If we end up in a double-dip recession, and the public believes there's a connection between a recession and these corporate shenanigans, then I think it is a powerful political issue."
Judging from activity in Washington, elected officials and political consultants are already preparing. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has a new Web site, investorsbillofrights.com, and has said all Republican candidates are vulnerable. Republicans point to ties between many Democrats and big business and say Democrats hardly hold the high ground. President Bush's speech on corporate governance last Tuesday failed to soothe the Dow, which lost 695 points last week. But it underscored the administration's efforts to blunt the issue, particularly as the president's own past business dealings -- and those of Vice President Dick Cheney -- are again under scrutiny.
One reason for the anxiety in the political class is the potential for the sort of populist anger and resentment that historically has made for a potent wedge, particularly when the masses (i.e., the little guy) feel wrongly abused by the elite (the big guy).
Populism has taken many different forms, some of them dark and demagogic , since Bryan's "Cross of Gold" speech in 1896, but in the last two decades politicians from Ronald Reagan to Ross Perot to Jesse Ventura have managed varying degrees of success by tapping the us-versus-them vein.
OFTEN, though, a populist appeal is built on the resentments of an aggrieved class, with the definitions of the "us" and the "them" shifting. Bryan and later Franklin D. Roosevelt campaigned against the bigness of business, a mantle often taken up by more contemporary Democrats to appeal to working people. Mr. Reagan campaigned against the bigness of the government, a theme still echoed by Mr. Bush, to galvanize taxpayers and small business owners.
"Most Americans are suspicious of big business and big government and don't trust anyone who's too close to either," said Bruce Reed, domestic policy adviser under President Bill Clinton and is now president of the Democratic Leadership Council
But the aggrieved class in the current corporate scandal is not a class at all but thousands of fired employees and millions of investors who cross ideological, racial and economic lines. And neither Republicans nor Democrats can claim total immunity from the issue, though Democrats believe they will be helped significantly. 
Roughly 60 percent of American households are now in some way invested in the stock market -- an economic shift encouraged in recent decades by both parties. If these people are unified by anything, it is the fact that their quarterly statements from retirement funds and investment accounts are likely to reflect large losses. Since the market's peak in March 2000, stocks have lost $6 trillion in value.
Kevin Phillips, the author of "Wealth and Democracy," (Broadway Books, 2002) has long predicted a populist political reaction to corporate excess. He said last week that the state of the economy during the next few months will determine the depth of dissatisfaction among voters in November. If the tepid recovery now underway sinks back into recession, he said, the public could come looking for retribution at the polls.
"Have your in-laws lost their nest egg so that they have to move in with you?" he asked, posing the sort of kitchen table concern that could inflame voters. "Has the money saved for your kid's college gone down the Wall Street drain?"
Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents 250 of the largest pension and retirement funds, is not convinced that people will get angry, even if she thinks they should. Her group has long lobbied for corporate reform but the public, she said, is often confused by complicated business reform issues and suspicious of changing an economic system that they hope can help them achieve the American dream. "We've tried," she said, describing efforts to focus attention on corporate reform. "America is too wealthy. There's a lot of fat in the system now, and people don't revolt until they're hungry. We are not hungry yet."
People were hungry in the 1890's, or at least the farmers and skilled craftsmen who felt threatened by the Eastern business elite were. The populist movement grew after the Civil War from those agrarian concerns about the wealth and political influence of business monopolies. It reached critical mass in the 1890's, as the Populist Party fielded presidential candidates and Bryan emerged among the Democrats.
"These people in the 19th century would have viewed the concentration of wealth as a threat to democracy," said Robert C. McMath, a history professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the author of "American Populism: A Social History." These days, the bigness of business is taken for granted in a culture where corporate mergers are commonplace and usually applauded. In the late 1800's, the populist movement coalesced through organizing bodies such as the Grangers and the Farmer's Alliance. Today, by contrast, few unifying structures exist for investors and others hurt by the business downturn; few people look to their pension administrators as political advocates.
Bryan became the unexpected Democratic presidential nominee in 1896 after he assumed many of the positions held by populists. Many business reforms that Bryan advocated would eventually be adopted, and he would be instrumental in helping Woodrow Wilson attain the presidency, but he would never win the office.
Today, few political figures seem capable of marshaling any public disgust into broad electoral support, as much as some wish they could. Jesse Jackson has tried with little success for years to forge a powerful populist coalition between labor unions and minority groups. The once fervent support for the billionaire Ross Perot has long since petered out, and the bloom also seems off Mr. Ventura, Minnesota's governor.
THE seeming wild card is Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona, who has called for business regulations beyond those sought by President Bush and Democratic leaders while calling business leaders "morally challenged." Earlier this year, the initial public outcry around the Enron scandal helped push into law the campaign finance reforms long advocated by Mr. McCain. 
It is that tone of populist moral outrage dating back to Bryan that could most resonate in 2002. Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University and author of "The Populist Persuasion: An American History", said the classic populist paradigm pitting those who produce things (farmers and craftsmen) against those who move money (the financial class) no longer exists because a majority of American play the stock market and want it to succeed.
But he and others note that while the public does not want to fundamentally restructure business, it wants executives to play by the rules. The growing impression of corporate executives abusing the trust of employees and investors could spark real outrage, particularly in a sinking economy.
In his Wall Street speech, Mr. Bush acknowledged the moral dimension of the scandals and sought to position himself on the high ground. There is a danger, however, that such a stance could backfire because of his own closeness to big business and his past dealings as a business executive.
And somewhere, some politician may already be working on a "Cross of Stock Options" speech for the fall campaign.

HEADLINE: Gale Warnings in Washington 

 BODY:
It is always risky to proclaim a shift in the political landscape, but lately the tremors have been too big to ignore. Congress, which spent the 90's worshiping at the altar of big business, is now grumbling about what Theodore Roosevelt called the "malefactors of great wealth." The debt clock, which was turned off in New York City when the nation started posting budget surpluses, is back on, ticking up each American family's share of the country's red ink. On Friday the federal deficit for this year was estimated at a new high of $165 billion. A president who so confidently responded to terrorist attacks is looking less sure-footed in coping with the loss of confidence in the stock market, preventing future corporate excesses and handling questions about his own business record. 
 It feels like a critical juncture, and the image that may define it best is that of President Bush on television, giving a speech to Wall Street executives while the bottom of the screen showed the Dow and the Nasdaq heading further and further south. The stock market's battering last week differed from the losses of the recent past. Since the mid-1990's, investors' gains had been so large that even the declines of the last several months often merely wiped out wealth accrued in the go-go years. Many people, with some justification, may have felt like Las Vegas gamblers, betting their winnings and consoling themselves when their luck turned sour with the idea that they had been playing only with "house money" after all. But the losses are now beginning to be real, threatening to eat up savings that Americans had before the boom years. While there is much that is favorable in the overall economic news, baby boomers who had been assuming that their investments would guarantee them a comfortable retirement are beginning to suffer new anxieties. 
 Mr. Bush recognized that he had to address the loss of confidence in the markets, and in theory, he went to the right place to do so. But the accounting, compensation and corporate governance reforms he proposed did not match the tough tone of his speech, reinforcing the impression that he and his administration are beholden to big business. 
He also forgot about the advice that former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin used to give to President Bill Clinton, who was always aching to go to the stock exchange and ring the opening bell. Don't do it, Mr. Rubin said -- if the market drops that day, you'll be blamed.
Now on Capitol Hill, election-bound lawmakers are completely spooked and desperate do something that looks tough on corporate criminals -- without irritating more big campaign donors than absolutely necessary. Still, some good reform bills that seemed to have as much life as cold toast a month ago have turned wildly popular, including a proposal by Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland for a new accounting regulatory board to impose strict standards. 
Senators like Phil Gramm of Texas, accustomed to killing off anything opposed by big business and the oil industry, seemed stunned, deploring a climate of panic in which "anything can pass" and "everybody is trying to outdo everybody else." The Republican fire wall of the House, where the work of the Democratic-controlled Senate has been blocked, was consumed in the flames as Speaker Dennis Hastert joined the stampede. 
We hope the panic on Capitol Hill will give way to sustained and careful consideration of other reform measures that can help restore investors' confidence by reining in corporate excesses. Congressional action for the sake of action could wind up making things worse.
Americans have had enough time to become nervous about their finances, but not nearly enough to digest what has been happening and decide who they are going to blame for it. With an election only four months away, they will have plenty of opportunity to punish somebody.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Palestinian Voices: A Deep Despair

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
EARLIER this month, President Bush tried to go over the heads of the Palestinian leadership to appeal to Palestinian people to turn away from Yasir Arafat, pledging American help in their quest for nationhood if they installed a more democratic leadership.
 Much has been written on Palestinian views about the use of children as suicide bombers, the targeting of civilians in Israel, and terrorism in general -- issues that lay behind President Bush's call for replacing Mr. Arafat. For this article, a few ordinary Palestinians were asked at random for their opinions on America's role in the Middle East and the need for reform within the Palestinian leadership. Their answers might surprise, even dismay, the Bush administration. 
 Yet it seems a moment to listen to such voices, from people who do not fit the common television image of suicide bombers, stone-throwing youngsters or downtrodden refugees. In fact, most of the Palestinians, especially in the West Bank, lead lives that might seem far more familiar to Americans -- working hard, living in modern apartments, shopping in supermarkets.
These are people who feel betrayed by all that has happened in recent years. They voted for Yasir Arafat in 1997 because he was their national symbol, and many, perhaps most, would vote for him now because their pride dictates that they not bow to Israeli pressures. But he is not the leader whom many would prefer if they were left to choose in peace.
Their remarks signal an underlying anger, anguish and despair, reflecting lives that, even for the middle class, are a daily agony of fear, humiliation, helplessness after two years of escalating violence between their society and Israel's. They no longer have the sense that they have control over their destiny, and most Palestinians have long concluded that only the United States can help them. Yet President Bush's exhortation to them to choose democracy, when they live under siege, has struck many Palestinians as a cruel joke. His overt support for Ariel Sharon struck many as betrayal.
It is easy to argue with these voices, to recite the litany of Mr. Arafat's failings and lost opportunities. Perhaps it is useful, though, to simply hear them. SERGE SCHMEMANN

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Lieberman's Pro-Business Views May Haunt Him

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13 

 BODY:
More than most other Democrats in Congress and far more than the others with presidential ambitions -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has been a champion of business interests in general and generous stock options in particular. Now those positions may come back to haunt him.
 The stance on the side of business has served him well in Connecticut, the state with the highest per capita income and the home of large insurance and pharmaceutical companies, military contractors and many corporate executives who commute to New York. 
 It has helped him raise large sums of money for his election campaigns, and his close relationship with business was probably a factor that led Al Gore to pick him as running mate in 2000. 
But now, with corporate scandals at the top of the news and Democrats hoping enough of the tarnish rubs off on Republicans to help Democrats in this fall's Congressional elections, Mr. Lieberman, who is seriously considering running for president in 2004, finds himself in an awkward and somewhat defensive position, and he is rethinking some long-held views. 
In an interview in his office, Mr. Lieberman repeated several times that he was "proud to consider myself a pro-business Democrat." He said he had no regrets about business-friendly positions he had taken over the years, such as his opposition to tighter accounting rules for stock options and support for restrictions on lawsuits against companies and their accountants.
But he went to great lengths to dispel any notion that he was an apologist for corporate misconduct. He expressed outrage at "greedy individuals" who "did things that were illegal and unethical." He emphasized his advocacy of legislation moving through the Senate that would impose stiffer criminal penalties for corporate wrongdoing. 
He also promised that in the fall, the Governmental Affairs Committee, of which he is chairman, would investigate the Enron collapse, an inquiry that has been sidetracked because the committee is dealing with President Bush's proposal for a Department of Homeland Security.
Without being asked, Mr. Lieberman denounced as "sloppy journalism" several recent reports that he was close to the accounting industry and had opposed the plan of Arthur D. Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to prohibit accounting firms from doing consulting work for companies whose books they audited. In fact, Mr. Lieberman said he supported the Levitt proposal, and Mr. Levitt confirmed that in a telephone interview.
Mr. Lieberman's reputation as a friend of accountants dates to 1993, when he mobilized the Senate to block a proposed rule by accounting regulators to require companies to list stock options as a business expense on their financial statements.
The issue arose again this year after top executives at Enron and other companies made hundreds of millions of dollars before their companies went under by selling stock they had bought with options. The options -- rights to buy stock at a fixed price after the market price has risen -- gave these executives an incentive to cook the books to keep the market price high.
Mr. Lieberman continues to oppose the change in accounting procedures. It is "intellectually irrational," he said, to put a value on stock options when no one knows what they are worth until the stock is sold. 
Most important, Mr. Lieberman said, changes in the accounting rules would lead companies to drop stock options they give to ordinary workers. "A lot of average people are getting a lot of stock options," he said, and this lets them "buy a house and send their kids to college." 
An increasing number of companies are indeed awarding stock options to rank-and-file workers. But a survey by the National Center for Employee Ownership, a research institute that favors stock options, found that 70 percent of all stock options in publicly traded companies are given to managers, and that about 50 percent are given to the most senior executives.
The average value of stock options to a senior executive, the survey showed, is $512,000. The average value to hourly workers is $8,000.
Corey Rosen, executive director of the California-based center, said: "The distribution is still wildly skewed toward top management. They are at such different scales they ought to be treated in a completely different way."
In light of the corporate scandals, Mr. Lieberman said he had modified his views on stock options. He said he could now support Senator John McCain's proposal to prohibit top executives from selling stock they bought with options as long as they worked for the company. He could even support requiring companies to record options given to top executives as operating expenses, if a way could be found to do that and protect options awarded to lower-level employees.
Does he worry about the grief such changes would cause constituents and donors who are top executives?
"You'd be surprised," Mr. Lieberman replied, "how little I hear from those people."

HEADLINE: With Labor Woes, Baseball Throws Fans a Brushback 

BYLINE:  By BUSTER OLNEY with STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Even in a time when sports are big business, baseball for many people is a game of catch in the backyard, bleacher seats and hot dogs, a favorite player, a memorable home run. But there is a great disparity between what draws fans to baseball and how the sport operates, abstractions as different as Peter Pan's never-never land and Disney's tax bracket.
 Rarely has the incongruity been more glaring than in the last week, as owners and players prepared for another battle in a labor war that has spanned more than three decades. Leaders for the players association met in Chicago on Monday and while they did not establish a strike date, they talked ominously about the possibility of walking out before the end of this season. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig again hinted that some teams would face bankruptcy unless there was significant change in the game's financial structure. 
 Meanwhile, tens of thousands of patrons paid millions of dollars in Milwaukee, first to watch a home run hitting contest on Monday, and then, on Tuesday, they lingered in their seats as the All-Star Game headed into extra innings. But in the bottom of the 11th, an announcement was made that the teams couldn't settle a 7-7 tie, because they had run out of pitchers. The boos of enraged fans -- many of whom occupied $175 seats -- were not heard by all the players, because some All-Stars had left the park in the middle of the game to catch outbound flights.
Fans are fascinated with baseball records, and now there are a growing number of questions about whether many stars are using steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. Casual fans rediscover the sport in October, and there is real concern that the playoffs and World Series will be canceled by a labor impasse, as they were in 1994. The disconnect is deepening, mirroring the relationship between the players and the owners.
In other industries, like steel or automobiles, a company that went through repeated labor battles would suffer competitively. But neither the owners nor the players speak much about what impact another labor-related shutdown would have on the fans' interest in the game.
"When you're dealing in an industry or a product that relies on the good will of the public, in that situation it's a risky approach to continually disappoint your audience or your customer base," said Richard W. Hurd, professor of labor relations at Cornell University. "You can't help but wonder whether it's going to catch up with them."
Dick Schwingel, a teacher in Northfield, Mass., and an ardent baseball fan and Red Sox follower, said: "There's plenty of us who are addicted, but all kinds of addictions get cured. I'd have a tough time quitting baseball, but if I can quit smoking, I can quit baseball."
Attendance is down about 6 percent in the last year, a difference of 2,274,527 fans through July 11, a decline that could be attributed to diminished interest in some of the newest ballparks, like those in Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Detroit. But attendance dropped about 20 percent after the last strike, in 1994-95, and although it gradually rebounded, with help from the interest generated by Cal Ripken Jr., Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, some clubs have never recovered -- Toronto and Montreal, in particular.
Paul Molitor, the former All-Star infielder who was once an officer in the players association, said last week that he was not hopeful for a settlement. "A lot of the rhetoric is the same," he said. "Players have always talked about free market and what our country is built on: supply and demand. Ownership is talking about ways to have some type of increase in competitive balance and find a way for any ballclub to have a chance to win.
"We all know as an industry of $3.5 billion, there should be a way to fix it, but it's gotten so far out of hand in terms of revenue streams. There is no easy solution."
The baseball players' association is arguably the nation's strongest union, and certainly none has thrived as it has. Bound by the principle that they should have the same rights as others in a capitalist system, the players have repeatedly defeated the owners, through negotiating threats, work interruptions, arbitration and lawsuits; the average player salary has increased from $34,000 in 1969 to nearly $2.4 million this year.
The owners' loose coalition has usually been torn apart by competing interests from their own ranks, and in each confrontation with the players, their claims of poverty are undercut by past deception. "This is going to kill us," the Twins' owner, Calvin Griffith, said in 1975, after losing $7,000 in an arbitration.
Each side seems conditioned by history. The owners demand change. The players entrench. Negotiations collapse. The owners' alliance eventually crumbles. A settlement is protracted.
Hurd believes the industry is unique because of the unusual bargaining power of each side. The business of baseball cannot exist without the players -- whereas truckers and auto workers have been replaced -- while the owners, on the other hand, have exploited their antitrust exemption. These factors allow the two sides to dig in during negotiations. "It's very unusual today to have either a strike or lockout for almost every contract," Hurd said. "It was not as unusual in the 1940's and 50's. It's quite some time since we've seen an industry where work stoppages occur on a regular basis every time a contract expires."
The owners have long doubted that the players could hold together as a union, says William B. Gould IV, the former chairman of the National Labor Relations Board and a professor of labor law at Stanford University Law School. But "the problem in getting the players to make concessions is they have been so successful," Gould said. 
"They have won at every step. It's hard to get people to compromise when you look at the past record."
Gould mentioned the $252 million contract of Alex Rodriguez as "the classic example of how they now believe there is going to be a golden egg that will be laid by the goose forever. It's hard to disabuse the players of this idea."
Major League Baseball executives say most teams are incurring enormous losses; union members say revenue streams and franchise values are growing. The owners want to increase revenue sharing, which would presumably serve to anchor salaries. The owners are also intent on restoring some level of payroll parity among teams; by improving competitive balance, they say, small-revenue teams would become more attractive to fans.
In 1991, 19 of 25 teams had payrolls that were 75 percent or more of what the Yankees spent. The Yankees' current payroll is around $135 million, and only 2 of the 29 other teams -- the Texas Rangers and the Boston Red Sox -- have spent 75 percent or more of that figure. The Yankees' payroll is more than double those of 17 teams.
Molitor said last week that Donald Fehr, the union chief whom Molitor worked closely with, must address the question of competitive balance, especially "when the majority of his players don't have a chance to win."
"I understand protecting players' rights and players' pay," Molitor said, "but where that balance is struck, I'm not sure."
Either way, "the public is getting tired of it," says Charles B. Craver, professor of labor law at George Washington University. "They feel the owners are too greedy and the players are too greedy.
"The average person whose real wages have remained relatively constant are feeling very tired of it. People are very angry, about what's happened with C.E.O. salaries and other things, and I think they're going to turn on professional athletes if they're not careful."
Baseball's tenuous labor situation also threatens to diminish its attractiveness to television executives and advertisers. "Fifteen years ago, baseball was the No. 1 sport for advertisers using athletes as endorsers," said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports and Celebrities in Evanston, Ill., a company that matches players with marketers for endorsement deals. "Now I'd have to rank it No. 6 or 7."
One problem for Major League Baseball is that the professional football and basketball leagues market themselves more effectively, Williams said, by focusing on individual players rather than "emphasizing the game."
"Baseball stuck with 'America's pastime' and stayed on the old path," he added, "and has paid a dear price."
Additionally, Williams said, baseball has itself to blame for its fading popularity because "it has been the leader in work stoppages, which have forced fans to find other avenues to entertain themselves."
"And they have not come back to baseball with the same passion and commitment," he added.
According to Nielsen Media Research, ratings for the 2002 season to date are mixed. For the games on Fox Broadcasting, owned by the News Corporation, about 1.4 million viewers are watching compared with 1.3 million at this point last season. For the games on ESPN, part of the Walt Disney Company, about 500,000 viewers are watching compared with about 600,000 last season.
The All-Star Game on Fox suffered its lowest ratings ever, according to Nielsen Media Research, watched by 14.7 million people compared with 16 million last year.
"A work stoppage would be a tragedy for all of us," said Jon Nesvig, president for sales at Fox in New York. "Every time baseball gets something good going, something bad happens.
"So far, advertisers are pretty much behind baseball" for this season and the postseason, Nesvig said, "but talk about teams not being able to make a payroll or a strike certainly doesn't help."
Baseball's popularity has suffered before and survived, its recovery often robust. Babe Ruth made everyone forget the Black Sox gambling scandal of 1919. A president encouraged the continuation of Major League Baseball during World War II. A generation that seemed uninterested in the 60's has fed the recovery over the last six seasons.
Fans have tightly gripped their emotional ties to baseball. Increasingly, for the players and owners, it's not personal. It's business.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE ABUSES GIVING DEMOCRATS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, July 13 

 BODY:
From scouring the voting records and business backgrounds of Republican opponents to preparing television advertisements promising to "hold corporate executives accountable," Democrats are moving to turn the battle over corporate governance to their advantage this fall. The focus on Wall Street has given a jolt of energy to a party that just a month ago was casting around for issues to emphasize in the midterm elections.
 At the same time, the White House is confronting what is apparently the end of the lock-step support it has enjoyed from Congressional Republicans for the last two years. Republicans are moving sharply to distance themselves from Wall Street and President Bush, embracing Democratic proposals concerning corporate abuse and offering tough words against corporate malfeasance. 
 "To corporate C.E.O.'s, and the accounting firms that audit their companies, let me be very clear," Representative Mike Ferguson, Republican of New Jersey, said this week, "if you violate the public trust, if you flush down the drain the retirement security of millions of Americans, you will -- and you deserve to -- go to jail." 
Mr. Ferguson, a freshman whose seat is being challenged by Democrats, and who voted against legislation proposing criminal penalties for corporate malfeasance, made the remarks at a Congressional hearing, then shared them in a newsletter he mailed to constituents.
Democrats, particularly, are rushing to seize the issue by staging forums, news conferences and town hall meetings intended to spotlight corporate abuses, and they are raising the topic as governors of both parties are gathered here this weekend for their annual meeting.
In Jackson, Miss., Representative Ronnie Shows, a Democrat, held an "accountability town hall" today at the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum -- not far from the Clinton headquarters of WorldCom, which has been under investigation since it disclosed that it improperly accounted for $3.8 billion in expenses.
In Minneapolis on Thursday, at the very moment that Mr. Bush was speaking on behalf of the Republican challenger to Senator Paul Wellstone, Mr. Wellstone was distributing a statement noting the "turmoil caused by the ongoing accounting scandals and concern over the president's ability to respond to them" and asking, "Who will Minnesotans trust to be a watchdog for investors and consumers?"
Democrats are inspecting the backgrounds of Republican candidates for links to discredited corporations and examining the records of incumbents for votes that can be portrayed as lax on corporate abuse. They are preparing scripts for television advertisements featuring Senate candidates promising to "protect jobs and pensions" and stand up for "people who work hard and play by the rules," an official who has reviewed the scripts said.
"I think it's going to be a very big deal," said Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster tracking the issue. " People are angry."
The issue of corporate abuse and its potential effect on the coming elections was a refrain among officials gathered here today at the National Governors Association.
Democratic governors said they were confident that it would help the party make significant gains in the Congressional elections this fall.
At least one Republican governor, Frank Keating of Oklahoma, acknowledged that this was possible. "If Republicans appear to be resisting legitimate reforms because big business doesn't wish them, or Republicans appear to be avoiding reforms because they were a part of that business excess, I think Republicans could be hurt very badly," Mr. Keating said in an interview. 
"I think Republicans are dealing with it fairly, but I don't think they are dealing with it with the sense of urgency that I would," he added.
A Democrat, Howard Dean of Vermont, today assailed Mr. Bush for naming Harvey L. Pitt the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying, "That was his single worst appointment that was made, because it signaled permissiveness."
The maneuvering by Republican candidates and their advisers underscores lingering concerns that the party is particularly vulnerable on this issue. As both parties noted, Republicans have long been associated with big business. The links have included positions the party has taken in Congress, the source of their biggest soft-money contributions and the number of former chief executives in the Bush White House.
Still, for all the signs of Democratic confidence, and corresponding anxiety on the Republican side, it remains far from certain that the Democratic Party can gain the advantage its leaders are hoping for again. Party officials acknowledged that there were serious risks and complications in trying to turn this issue to their advantage.
For one thing, this is a topic for which blame is difficult to assess, and party differences on related issues like fund-raising and the images each party has sought to project are not as sharp as they once were.
A report issued on Thursday by Democracy 21, a group advocating changes in campaign financing, found that corporations contributed $636 million in soft money to Republicans over the last decade while giving $449 million to Democrats.
The election is about four months off, and if recent history is any guide, this issue could disappear with the end of summer, particularly if the economy improves and the stock market rises. Democrats, in particular, given their history, need to be careful about making political moves that might be portrayed as undermining Wall Street.
"Half the American people are in the stock market," said Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant. 
The nation has come a long way from the days when a Republican president, Calvin Coolidge, declared that "the business of America is business," while Democrats held themselves out as the protectors of the working class. 
Bill Clinton moved the Democrats to the center in 1992 in large part by challenging the notion that his party was antibusiness, and a number of Democrats are now expressing concern that overheated populist rhetoric by candidates could strike voters as opportunistic and unravel what Mr. Clinton accomplished.
"This could play into the worst stereotypes of the Democratic Party: that we engage in class warfare, that we favor big government, that we engage in the politics of resentment," said Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana. "Most Americans would prefer a more positive approach."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said, "Having re-established ourselves in the 1990's as a party of economic growth, it's very important that, as we respond to this, we don't overreact so that we become an antibusiness party again."
While Democrats are moving to spotlight ties of Republican candidates to business, many have found themselves standing on the same corporate stage. In North Carolina, Erskine B. Bowles, who was Mr. Clinton's White House chief of staff and is now running for Senate, was attacked last week as a Wall Street insider -- by a fellow Democrat challenging him for the nomination -- because he is an investment banker.
Similarly, Republicans, in pushing back, were quick to note that Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, turned a $100,000 investment in Global Crossing, one of the companies that has emerged as a symbol of corporate wrongdoing, into an $18 million profit after the company went public.
"I suspect that even though people blame the Republicans more than the Democrats for this, there is the sense that everybody sort of swims in the same murky waters in Washington," said David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant based in Chicago. "I suppose there's a point where people will reject kind of excessive moralizing on this. But to me, that is a small danger for us. I think the real danger is on the other side."
Several Republicans argued that the issue would have little punch in the fall if the economy and the stock market are in good shape. 
"If consumer confidence stays high," said William McInturff, a Republican pollster, "and the economy rebounds and the stock market stays stable, the Democrats are going to lose anyway. That's where we were in late May and early June. They started this because they are losing the cycle. Everything else they tried didn't work."
But even Republicans acknowledged that the issue of corporate malfeasance could prove effective if, come October -- when most voters are first beginning to focus on Congressional and Senate races in their states -- the economy and the stock market are down, and Americans believe the nation is heading in the wrong direction. 
Democrats said they believed that if that were to happen, voter distress about corporate behavior would give new force to their plans to revive attacks on Republicans proposals to link Social Security and retirement plans to the stock market.
Should they indeed be a central topic this fall, corporate abuses could be an unusually effective issue for Democrats, because this is likely to be an election with a relatively low voter turnout. The voters who are most vulnerable to disruptions in the stock market are older Americans approaching retirement whose pension and retirement accounts are tied to stock performance. Not incidentally, older voters are the ones who tend to go to the polls in off-year races, even when there is no compelling issue driving the election. 
"Too many people have lost too much money to ignore all that has happened," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "When you have a third of people in their early 50's and their early 60's saying their retirement has now been delayed because of the market, you've got an angry segment of the election. And they are voting."

HEADLINE: Geographic's Film Vessel Ready to Sail 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 12 

 BODY:
Not so long ago, when the dot-com bubble was holding firm and the word synergy still had a fresh ring, hot magazines like Talk boasted about how they would seek out stories that virtually demanded to become feature films. And then, they would not merely allow the writer to sell off the rights to some Hollywood fast-talker, but become active partners in the project. Co-producers. Players! 
 Now, of course, the bubble is long burst. The word synergy sounds only slightly less anachronistic than 23 skidoo. Talk Magazine has been laid to rest in the graveyard of seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time. 
 And which magazine, does it turn out, has actually done it -- become active as developer and co-producer of major Hollywood films based on its own original work? 
Stuffy, tweedy, yellow-bordered National Geographic -- about as Old Media as you can get without going all the way back to illuminated manuscripts. 
"I think it's the nature of the thing that we cover," said Tim Kelly, president of National Geographic Television and Film. "We really are kind of the real deal when it comes to adventure. We were hiring Indiana Joneses before anybody knew who Indiana Jones was."
Audiences who go to the nation's multiplexes to watch Harrison Ford play the captain of a crippled Soviet nuclear submarine in "K-19: The Widowmaker," opening July 19, may be surprised to see on the screen, following the Paramount Pictures and Intermedia Films logos, yet another logo for National Geographic Films. "K-19" will mark the first time that it has appeared at the beginning of a mainstream feature film, but if National Geographic has its way it will become an increasingly familiar sight.
"K-19" is based on the true story of a Russian sub whose nuclear reactor malfunctioned in the North Atlantic in 1961. More specifically, the film was developed from a 1996 National Geographic documentary about the little-known incident. It was developed not by a Hollywood studio, but by National Geographic's fledgling motion-picture division in Hollywood, headed by Christine Whitaker, a former Imagine Entertainment executive. 
And if you want to talk about synergy: National Geographic's television unit also has a new documentary featuring the K-19 incident called "Lost Subs: Disasters at Sea," to be seen on MSNBC. A book from National Geographic's publishing division, "K-19: The Widowmaker -- The Secret Story of the Soviet Nuclear Submarine," recently hit bookstores, featuring a glowering picture of Mr. Ford as the sub's commander. And National Geographic's Web site has an extensive K-19 section -- www.nationalgeographic.com/k19 -- that includes a 3-D animated journey through the vessel, a clickable map of other submarine disasters, a timeline explaining the evolution of submarine design, and a link to sites where tickets to the movie can be purchased.
"This is one of the major things that we bring to the table: the extensive resources of National Geographic's research departments, which can provide a much deeper and more detailed exploration of the story behind the movie," said Rick Allen, president of National Geographic Ventures, a taxable subsidiary of the nonprofit National Geographic Society whose holdings include the National Geographic Channel, a maps division, retail products, catalog sales, consumer merchandising and the film unit.
Other projects that National Geographic Feature Films has in development include "Shackleton," an epic version of the explorer Ernest Shackleton's near-impossible struggle to save his icebound Antarctic crew, and "Undaunted Courage," based on the historian Stephen E. Ambrose's best seller about the Lewis and Clark expedition. "Shackleton," which the director Wolfgang Petersen hopes to make, is based on a National Geographic magazine article, among other sources. And "Undaunted Courage" became a project for the unit because Mr. Ambrose served as one of the society's eight explorers in residence. 
The director of "K-19," Kathryn Bigelow, was also involved from the outset in developing the film. When the first production company to which the script was attached, Working Title Films, decided to pass on the project, the ambitious and cash-rich Intermedia Films stepped in. 
Nigel Sinclair, Intermedia's co-founder, said he was gripped by the script and intrigued by the idea of a partnership with National Geographic Feature Films, which he saw as a guarantee of the science and history in the story. In the end, Intermedia financed the entire production and was responsible for bringing Mr. Ford into the film. Only much later did Paramount come aboard to handle the marketing and distribution in North America and a few European territories. 
Mr. Sinclair says he believes that the National Geographic formula is one that will work. "Adventures and the outdoors make for great stories and great stories make for great movies," he said. "National Geographic is sitting on what is, potentially, an almost bottomless fund of adventure stories. It's a specific area. It's finite. But it's definitely a significant part of the tradition of filmmaking."
National Geographic Feature Films -- the Los Angeles-based unit of National Geographic Television and Films -- had initially been set up in the mid-1990's by another executive, Hank Palmieri. Ms. Whitaker assumed control as executive vice president when Mr. Palmieri died two years ago.
But the release of "K-19" is also seen by the company as the moment to expand and to raise its flag more prominently in Hollywood. So the announcement is to be made on Monday that the veteran producer and financier Jake Eberts will join National Geographic Feature Films as chairman, at the same time that Ms. Whitaker is promoted to president of production. Mr. Eberts, who founded Goldcrest Films in 1977, was responsible for helping finance the production of such films as "Gandhi." Later, when he turned to production, he worked on such other Oscar-winning films as "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Dances With Wolves."
Mr. Eberts brings with him what will be the company's next project -- "Two Brothers," a film to be directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud about a pair of tiger siblings living in the ruins of Angkor Wat in the 1920's.
Production will begin in October for a 2004 release. Meanwhile, National Geographic Films will also begin work on a series of documentaries about tigers and about efforts to restore historical monuments like Angkor Wat. 
Although "K-19" is the first movie to bear the company's logo, it is not the first feature on which the unit worked. 
An earlier project was based on a story in one of the National Geographic magazines about a man who worked through a rough time in his life by developing an enthusiasm for sled-dog racing. The story was eventually transformed by Walt Disney Pictures into a wacky comedy called "Snow Dogs," full of pratfalls and a fantasy sequence in which the dogs sipped cocktails and traded wisecracks.
Although Ms. Whitaker served as executive producer on the film, the National Geographic logo did not appear on it.
"Our feeling is that when that logo appears, it should signal something to audiences, that the story has gone through the National Geographic research process and that the science and historical facts in it are as accurate as possible," said Mr. Allen, a former deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton for the federal Americorps project. 
The "Snow Dogs" experience with Disney was a positive one, Ms. Whitaker said. And in the future, the National Geographic film unit will probably also develop film projects that, like that film, spin off into areas that will no longer be appropriate for the National Geographic logo. The important thing, they said, is that when the logo does appear, it will signify to audiences something about the credibility of the scientific and historical details. 
But none of this will work, of course, unless the movie works, and that won't be known until July 19, when "K-19" is set to open in more than 3,000 North American theaters. 
"You have to have some dramatic license in order to make a story work as a movie," Ms. Whitaker said. "But we want to be as scrupulous as we can be about the scientific material that appears on screen."

HEADLINE: Congo Tires of War, but the End Is Not in Sight 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: KISANGANI, Congo 

 BODY:
Congolese are so tired of the war crippling this giant country that thousands of them rushed into the streets full of hope this spring when soldiers mutinied against the Rwandan-backed rebel army ruling this city.
 All were angry at the rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma, for refusing to sign a peace accord worked out in two months of multisided negotiations. 
 It was but the latest failure to end the four-year conflict, and the Rally for Democracy is now the main holdout to peace.
The rebellion illustrated how furious combatants and civilians alike are with Africa's most sprawling and intractable conflict. The mutinous soldiers took over the radio station here in mid-May and called on the people of Kisangani, Congo's third-largest city, to take to the streets. 
They did so, killing at least five people they believed to be Rwandan backers of the war.
"For a brief time we felt that Kisangani was ours again," said a man who joined the crowds and who refused to provide his name for fear of retribution.
It did not take long for the rebel leadership, which opposes the government of President Joseph Kabila, to reassert control. Residents, who have anxious looks on their faces as they recollect what happened, say the rebels sent armed men looting and rampaging through the city, killing as many as 150 people. 
Some United Nations officials have labeled the incident a massacre, the latest in a brutal struggle that has involved Congo and nearly all of its neighbors.
The war, which began in 1998 but has roots in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, has left more than two million dead, not just from the fighting but also from hunger and disease. 
A peace agreement signed by most parties to the fighting in 1999 gave hope, but the war has continued as a low-intensity conflict in recent years with no sign of an end. The ruin has left Congo, a resource-rich land about the size of Western Europe, a nation in name only.
The government controls a sizable chunk of the west, with the help of the armies of Angola and Zimbabwe. It also recently struck an alliance with a Ugandan-backed rebel group in the north to share power in a future government. Government-backed militia groups operate from other isolated pockets.
Their main opponent is the Congolese Rally for Democracy, which controls this city and much of the vast east with the support of least 6,000, and probably many more, Rwandan troops, to the growing resentment of many in the region.
Rwanda, which got $13 million in American development assistance last year, has become the main American ally in Central Africa. It first sent troops into Congo in pursuit of Hutu militias that carried out the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. The Rwandan troops have stayed on, and now they help control an area many times larger than their own country.
Experts say the region is being systematically looted of diamonds, gold, timber and other resources. The needs of everyday Congolese are not high on anybody's agenda. Navigation along the Congo River, the lifeline for commerce, has all but dried up, cutting the country in half.
The rebels have their hands full in their struggle to unseat the Kabila government in Kinshasa, 600 miles downriver. In some towns in the east, rebel soldiers have been defecting. At their headquarters in Goma, the rebels recently suspended their spokesman, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, for making public statements in support of peace negotiations.
The rebels have also clashed with an already overwhelmed United Nations operation here of some 5,000 troops, hardly enough to monitor the conflict, let alone to provide peace where there is none to keep. Secretary General Kofi Annan's representative in Congo, Namanga Ngongi, has been declared persona non grata in the east because of what the rebels say is his bias against their cause.
The rampant killings that followed the mutiny have added another layer of tension. The rebels maintain that they were controlling chaos, not creating it, and that accounts of mass deaths were overblown. All together, they say, 41 people died on May 14 and in the immediate aftermath.
But an expert called in by the United Nations put the death toll at more than three times that number.
"Some of the deaths reportedly occurred as a result of indiscriminate and random gunfire aimed at terrorizing the population," the expert, Asma Jahangir, said after spending two days interviewing witnesses here. She added, "Other victims lost their lives in what would appear to be targeted extrajudicial executions."
Ms. Jahangir said fishermen, residents of the area and United Nations officials had seen as many as 20 bodies floating in the Tshopo River. 
The rebels have never fully explained what occurred, and United Nations military observers have tried in vain to inspect the area around Bangoka Airport, where many bodies were reported to have been buried.
A security agent allowed a reporter and a photographer to see a bridge where rebels had been seen trying to scrub bloodstains, but it was a brief stop, interrupted when a rebel commander overruled the decision.
Congolese have suffered under previous governments, most notably the long dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko. But the dire economic conditions that now exist in rebel-held territories have left many speaking fondly of the old days.
Outside the United Nations headquarters in Goma, a group of men gathers every morning for jobs. They leave night after night with not one additional franc in their pockets.
The rebels came, and so did the joblessness, one man who has been waiting for a job for more than a month said. "We are tired of this war," he said. "All we want is work."
Another unemployed man offered his own condemnation of the rebels. "We're not political men, but we could run this country better than them," he said.
The same sentiment can be heard in Kisangani, which once was the country's breadbasket. It is home to the lucrative diamond and gold industries. Yet the city, surrounded by thick jungle, is crumbling and its population lives in desperate poverty from the stranglehold of the war.
Kisangani is a river city, and the effective end to trade along the Congo River means that its produce cannot get out. The many items it needs, from gasoline to construction supplies to pharmaceuticals, trickle in at inflated prices.
"Reopening the river system to commerce is the most important single step that can be taken to restore the economic and social life of much of the Democratic Republic of Congo," the United Nations said in a recent report. At times the adversaries have agreed to resume traffic, but they have not actually done so.
"If a boat comes here from Kinshasa, who knows if there's soldiers or spies aboard?" said Maurice Etukumalo, a rebel official in Kisangani.
Without river traffic most factories have closed, and the few that remain are struggling. "Our economy has collapsed," said Raymond Mokeni Ekopi Kane, president of the local chamber of commerce.
The Bralima-Kisangani brewery cannot get needed ingredients flown in, so it has cut production and raised the price of its Primus brand to more than $1 a bottle. That is too much for most local people, who have turned to home-grown palm wine instead.
Sotexki was one of Congo's largest manufacturing plants. It produces the distinctive fabrics the country is known for -- bold colorful cloth that is turned into shirts and dresses by roadside tailors. But the company has had to lay off thousands of employees as cheap imported cloth, some of which copies Sotexki's designs, has cut into business.
It has managed to avoid going under altogether only by producing new patterns promoting peace and unity and reconciliation.
"Solidarity," says one fabric, advocating a concept that Congo has not known in years. The same cloth features a map of a unified Congo, giving no indication of where the government's territory ends and the rebels' begins.
"We're trying to do what we can to awaken people," said Jean Leonard Ridja Djoza, the company's outspoken managing director. "People can't hold marches or speak out. That's too risky. They can wear our shirts."

Keeneland's Yearling Sale Always a Big-Money Event

BYLINE:  By BILL MOONEY

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky., July 14 

 BODY:
For those in the market for well-bred, well-conformed thoroughbred yearlings with millions of dollars to spend, Keeneland is the place to be on Monday and Tuesday. The 59th annual July Selected Yearling Sale is being held this week, a boutique event featuring the most expensive collection of young horses put up for auction anywhere on the globe.
 There is no admission charge to Keeneland's sale. It is a public event, and anyone can attend. Participation in the bidding, though, is pretty much limited to the wealthy. Last year, 164 yearlings were taken to Keeneland in July. The 89 that were sold fetched an average price of $710,247. 
 Big money is involved, as are big egos and hopes. "The July buyers at Keeneland are like N.B.A. franchise owners," said Duncan Taylor, president of Taylor Made Sales Agency, which has 29 yearlings in this year's sale. "They'll spend whatever's needed to reach the summit."
Two hundred horses were catalogued for this year's sale, but as of 1 p.m. today, 26 had been withdrawn. "That's a normal circumstance," said Bill Farish, president of Lane's End Farm. "We entered 13 horses in the sale. Four of them are now out. One's a colt who got tangled in a fence and needed stitches. We'll sell him in September. You don't want any bumps and bruises showing when you're auctioning horses to buyers this prominent and picky."
The July sale draws about 50 active bidders. Many fly in from Dubai, Saudi Arabia, England, Ireland or Japan, landing their private jets at Blue Grass Airport, across the road from Keeneland.
Of the $63.2 million in gross receipts generated at Keeneland's 2001 July sale, 57 percent was attributed to foreign buyers. Many of them own farms and race in the United States. But graduates from the July sale have also won the Epsom, Irish and French Derbies, and France's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
Keeneland's midsummer auction dates to 1943, when the Florida sportsman Fred Hooper bid $10,200 for a colt and named it Hoop Jr. Two years later, Hoop Jr. won the Kentucky Derby. Since then, 10 other yearlings sold at Keeneland in July have gone on to win the Derby, including Alysheba, Winning Colors, Sunday Silence, Thunder Gulch and Fusaichi Pegasus.
Bargains have been found. Sunday Silence was a $17,000 purchase at Keeneland in July 1987. Thunder Gulch brought $40,000 in July 1993. On the other hand, Fusaichi Pegasus brought a sale-topping $4 million at the 1998 Keeneland July sale.
In 1976, a son of the Triple Crown winner Secretariat became the first yearling to bring a seven-figure price. Since then, 288 other July sale yearlings have brought closing bids of $1 million or more. Seattle Dancer has the record, purchased for $13.1 million by a British group headed by Robert Sangster in 1985.
Seattle Dancer had exceptional bloodlines. His sire, Nijinsky II, was a champion racehorse in Europe, and his dam, My Charmer, also produced the Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew. Seattle Dancer raced in European stakes with modest success, but the biggest returns on his purchase price were gained in the breeding shed, which also influences buyers when they bid on yearlings.
And the state of the United States economy does not seem to affect the sale. "For July buyers, the Dow Jones Industrials are not an end-all," said Nick Nicholson, Keeneland's president. "Their wealth is secure. They want to take friends on tours of their stables and state, 'These are Keeneland July yearling purchases.' Hey, you can waste a lot of other words and not say nearly as much."
More than 90 percent of the yearlings at Keeneland were bred in central Kentucky, where thousands of foals and fetuses died in the last two years because of outbreaks of a still-unexplained syndrome. "But I don't feel that attaches premiums to yearlings we're selling in 2002," Farish said. "A great horse will always bring a great price."

HEADLINE: China Juggles the Conflicting Pressures of a Society in Transition 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH; An interactive feature, with audio commentary from Craig S. Smith, who just completed two-and-a-half years as Shanghai bureau chief of The New York Times, is available at nytimes.com/international.

 BODY:
With China now a member of the World Trade Organization, foreigners have focused on what is popularly called the one-billion-man market. The country is already the world's biggest market for televisions, refrigerators and mobile phones. Its huge population has the potential to become a consumption engine that could someday drive much of the world's economy in the way that the United States' does today. 
 The numbers are impressive. China's emerging middle class, people with a net income of at least $3,000 a year, numbers nearly 100 million and is growing about 20 percent a year. Because of state-subsidized housing, little of that money is spent on shelter, the biggest household expense in the West, and much of it is saved. 
 Georges Desvaux, a Beijing-based partner at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, estimates that five million or six million Chinese have personal assets of $100,000 or more. Perhaps 10,000 have assets exceeding $1 million.
But unemployment is surging, rural incomes are sliding, competition is rising and the government barely has its toe in the waters of political reform. China's leadership acknowledges that the country's internal stresses are building and is running a race against a potential collapse, patching weak spots while carrying out a major overhaul of society even before having decided what its final shape should be.
China's broader population is far less secure than the much-celebrated affluent urbanites in a handful of its cities. The number of people who can afford the wares peddled by the world's multinationals is but a slim slice of the billion-man pie.
Weighted against the country's nascent middle class are 800 million peasants, whose lot in life has worsened in recent years. About 150 million of those people have flocked to the cities or coastal industrial zones to find jobs, usually low-paying ones. As many as 20 million urbanites, meanwhile, are unemployed.
The rising standard of living experienced by many Chinese during the 1980's and early 1990's has stalled. Much of the generation that suffered in childhood through the disastrous Great Leap Forward of the late 1950's and whose education was cut short by the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution is now facing unemployment and a retirement of privation.
Add to the mix an increasing flow of information via radio, satellite television, telephones and, in the cities, the Internet and the future looks more uncertain than ever.
The Communist Party maintains a firm grip on most media and is quick to crush organizations -- like the Falun Gong spiritual movement -- that pose a potential challenge to its authority.
Yet most Chinese want a strong central government and, despite some cynicism about its anachronistic ideology, continue to support the party as a unifying force and a check against the "luan," or chaos, that all Chinese most deeply fear.

PERSON: Joaquin Balaguer 

HEADLINE: Joaquin Balaguer, 95, Dies; Dominated Dominican Life 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
Joaquin Balaguer, a former president of the Dominican Republic who was among the last of the classic Latin American strongmen and one of the longest-lasting political figures of the 20th century, died yesterday at a hospital in Santo Domingo. He was 95.
 Short, shrewd and indomitable, Mr. Balaguer ruled the Caribbean nation of eight million people with a sometimes ruthless manner for 22 years and six presidential terms. His years in power spanned the country's long path from dictatorship to democracy, and he adapted to the changing climate. 
 Critics often called him the "caudillo," or strongman, who would never disappear, who kept re-emerging as president no matter how many enemies he gathered along the way. He governed into his late 80's, when he was blind, practically deaf and stooped, but even then he managed to keep a tight rein on the government. In his signature dark suit and fedora, he traveled the country in a specially made car known as the Balaguermobile. 
Joining the Dominican government when Herbert Hoover was president of the United States and retaining a powerful role in public life and politics up until the hours before his death, Mr. Balaguer outlasted all of his Latin contemporaries except Fidel Castro.
A lifelong bachelor who was close to his six sisters, and lived in the servants' quarters of his family mansion, Mr. Balaguer was hated for governing his nation with an iron fist, particularly during his first 12 years in office. He was heavily criticized then for using repressive and even brutal tactics reminiscent of his predecessor and patron, Rafael Trujillo. 
But he was also beloved for his beguiling, parental embrace of the country's most destitute people, thousands of whom made their way yesterday to the capital, Santo Domingo, to mourn outside his home on Main Street, where his body is to lie in state for three days.
A lawyer, poet, university law professor, diplomat, Mr. Balaguer was also the author of numerous books, including one he wrote at the age of 14 and another in which he argued against interracial marriage and established him as a racist.
He entered politics in 1932, ultimately becoming a key government official and protege of General Trujillo, who effectively governed the country for 30 years as one of Latin America's most powerful dictators. When General Trujillo's brother, Hector, resigned as president in 1960, Mr. Balaguer, who was serving as vice president, succeeded him as the nominal chief of state, in a country that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. 
Mr. Balaguer distanced himself from General Trujillo and initially carved out a more moderate political stance. After General Trujillo was assassinated in 1961, he celebrated the end of the dictatorship by changing the name of the capital from Ciudad Trujillo back to Santo Domingo, the city's original name. 
But rioting and political turmoil erupted in 1962, and Mr. Balaguer was forced out of office and into exile, living briefly in New York City, where he formed his lasting right-wing political party. 
As the Dominican Republic was in the throes of civil war, he returned to the country in 1965, after President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in the Marines and supported Mr. Balaguer as the leader who could stave off the threat of communism and protect the country from becoming what Johnson called a "second Cuba." Mr. Balaguer was a longtime ally of the United States. 
In 1966, he was elected in one of the Dominican Republic's first freely contested elections. Blending a mixture of relative economic prosperity that gave rise to the country's first solid middle class and was fueled by a seemingly endless stream of public works projects, Mr. Balaguer was re-elected to two more four-year terms. However, the opposition political party boycotted both elections, accusing the Balaguer government of fraudulent practices, charges that would re-emerge when he was elected again. 
His first term, his critics said, was marked by repression and severe punishment of his enemies, including journalists and political opponents on the left. He had a firm grip on the judicial system and used to the country's military to rule the country.
"He prolonged dictatorship unnecessarily," Bernardo Vega, a former Dominican ambassador to the United States who is now the editor of El Caribe, a major Dominican daily newspaper, said in a telephone interview yesterday. "He's part of the tradition here, the concept that Dominicans need strong government."
After three terms, Mr. Balaguer was defeated in presidential elections 1978 by the party in power today, the Dominican Revolutionary Party, but he was far from politically washed up. 
He remained the leader of the political party he had founded in the 1960's, now called the Social Christian Reform Party, and won another bid for power in 1986, ultimately serving for another 10 years. His second period in power, experts said, was much less harsh and was more democratic than his first. 
Still, he was considered a classic strongman, whose style was a combination of paternalism and authoritarianism. In 1990, Mr. Balaguer was narrowly re-elected again, and then backed down from a promise to serve only two years. 
In 1992, he built what became his most visible legacy, a widely criticized multimillion-dollar lighthouse that casts beams of light in the shape of a cross into the sky and was erected at a time when the country was facing 25 percent unemployment and severe electricity shortages. Also during the 1990's, he clashed bitterly with Haiti, as it was gripped by political turmoil. 
In 1994, he won again, in elections that were perceived as rigged, and under American and international pressure agreed to serve only two of the four years and end his official leadership of the country.
In 2000, at 92, Mr. Balaguer ran for president again, but came in third. 
Eight hours before Mr. Balaguer died, the country's Congress amended the Constitution to remove term limits that had been imposed after Mr. Balaguer's rule and barred the re-election of presidents. Even on his death bed, Mr. Balaguer, who still headed the party that was supporting the amendment, was a major political player, with officials rushing to his bedside to garner his backing or ask him how to proceed, Mr. Vega said. 
Mr. Balaguer lived an austere life, shunning the largesse of General Trujillo and other dictators. In the later years of his life, after five sisters had died, he relied on his last sibling as a top aide who would do everything from reading him the morning newspapers to helping him run the government. 
To his death, he remained an enigma as a politician and a person. 
His life and personality inspired a 1995 novel, "They Forged the Signature of God," by Viriato Sencion, which drew on inside information and offended Mr. Balaguer. In a 1996 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Sencion described his visits to Mr. Balaguer's home, to see one of his sisters. "It was a most strange and curious household," he said. "There were two female dwarfs, kept as mascots but who to this day are part of his retinue, and a pair of aggressive collies that, when they bit you, you had no choice but to sit there and smile."

HEADLINE: Hence, Loathed Melancholy 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The poet John Milton had a message applicable to the "new economy" enthusiasts who stampeded world stock markets to unsustainable heights: "Hence, vain deluding Joys. . . ." (Hence is now "Gedowdaheah.")
 But Milton is the patron saint of contrarians. He has another, quite different message for the mindless herd now divesting in despair. To pessimaniacs dumping stocks in a rising economy, the contrarian suggests: "Hence, loathed Melancholy. . . ." 
 Europeans wish America would cheer up. Complaints about U.S. arrogance and unilateralism pale when our market locomotive stops chugging. The Melancholy gripping investors, which has knocked American industrials down by a third, has spooked investors on this side of le despond; English, French and German indexes have been clobbered harder. Hegemony talks: Rarely have Europeans antipathetic to America manifested such a sympathetic reaction.
If Communism were still in business, headlines would proclaim a "crisis in capitalism," with workers exploited by corrupt bosses and a class revolt inevitable.
But the capitalist system is not in crisis. In recent months, it has been doing what it is supposed to do in the wake of every speculative binge: correcting itself. After a bubble bursts, people who have been deliriously blowing bubbles demand to know: How could "they" have done this to us? But we, the investing people, have done it to ourselves -- as we do in almost every generation.
Because nobody likes to admit to self-delusion, we are scaping every goat in sight.
We wuz robbed, say investors and employees of the Enrons -- but outright crookedness, highly publicized, is a relatively minor cause of the current furor. Show trials of the fraudulent few will deter other executives from breaking existing law.
We wuz conned, say buyers of hot stocks of companies with inflated earnings -- and so we were in Andersengate. But the market is properly punishing a profession that followed Mel Brooks rules. By selling stock in miscreant client companies, investors are casting out top executives who conspired to rip off stockholders, lawyers who slashed corners and directors in conflicts of interest.
We wuz manipulated by analysts who were no more than touts, betraying their customers for a piece of the banking action. With their character in question, investment banks and brokerages are sheepishly trying to earn back their reputations "the hard way."
We wuz misinformed (from a tart Humphrey Bogart line in "Casablanca") by financial media that failed to dig into rosy press releases or challenge the celebrity culture that made dot-com demigods out of financial half-wits. The cautionary voices of Floyd Norris of The Times, Robert Samuelson of The Washington Post and Allan Sloan of Newsweek and relatively few others were unheeded in the cacophony. But yesterday's lapdogs have turned into a wolfpack, savaging reputations to satisfy popular demand for vengeance.
We wuz too loosely self-regulated. The lax good-ol'-boy stock exchanges and lazy credit agencies -- with much to answer for -- are scrambling to tighten standards to restore trust, which they belatedly realize is their stock in trade.
All this self-correction is well underway. And after every period of excess, government correction is added. Congress and the last few administrations left the S.E.C. understaffed and overconfident; it is now running scared. New accounting rules will be imposed; sweetheart loans to executives will be stopped and stock options treated by companies like other compensation. Perhaps, as long urged in this space, the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, the F.C.C. and F.T.C. will stop supinely okaying the megamergers that feed egos and starve competition while adding mountains of dangerous debt.
But in all these blame-casting we-wuzzes, we fail to realize that the fault, dear Brutus, lies within ourselves. Individual investors, even in an era of pension funds and expert money managers, have a responsibility to assess their risks and to resist the roar of the crowd. Let's face it: too many of us abandoned common sense and grabbed for that pie in the sky.
Now the crowd is swearing off even good pie on the table. Contrarians are therefore thinking: Is the time drawing nigh to begin a program of investment? Our adviser, who shouldst be living at this hour, would say:
Hence, loathed Melancholy . . .

HEADLINE: PFIZER SAID TO BUY LARGE DRUG RIVAL IN $60 BILLION DEAL 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
The drug giant Pfizer Inc. has agreed to acquire the Pharmacia Corporation for $60 billion in stock, making it by far the most dominant drug maker in the world, according to executives close to the deal.
 The transaction, which was approved yesterday by the boards of both companies and is expected to be announced today, these executives said, would be the largest of the many recent mergers in what remains a troubled and fragmented industry. 
 Drug companies, under intense pressure from politicians, employers and managed care companies to limit price increases, are having a hard time finding breakthrough products that would assure the robust earnings growth investors demand. Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia, resulting in a company that would still control only 11 percent of the global market, is likely to hasten the industry's continued consolidation. Page A13. 
The merger would create a behemoth with $48 billion in projected sales and many of the nation's most widely used drugs. Pfizer -- which already owns Zoloft, the antidepressant; Lipitor, the nation's most widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drug; and Viagra -- would also gain control of Pharmacia's Celebrex and Bextra, two high-selling arthritis drugs, and Detrol, a drug that treats bladder problems.
Pharmacia, formerly Pharmacia & Upjohn, is also the maker of the Nicorette gum smokers use to help them quit, the Rogaine baldness treatment and Luden's throat drops.
Executives close to the deal said that by creating economies of scale, the merger would help Pfizer to limit price increases. Pfizer is already being conservative about raising its prices, they say, noting that it has increased its price for Lipitor only modestly since acquiring it in the 2000 acquisition of Warner-Lambert. 
Pfizer's headquarters would remain in Midtown Manhattan. Pharmacia is based in Peapack, N.J. It is unclear how many of the combined company's 150,000 employees would be let go.
Pharmacia recently completed the purchase of AT&T's former headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J. It is unclear what would happen to its plans to relocate 2,500 employees there.
The Pharmacia acquisition would lengthen Pfizer's lead as the largest drug maker in the United States and would vault it to the top spot in Europe, Japan and Latin America.
Pfizer's proposed acquisition requires approval by regulators in both the United States and Europe. Pfizer currently has about 8 percent of the global market, while GlaxoSmithKline, the second-largest drug company, controls 7.3 percent.
Analysts and investors have long speculated that many pharmaceutical companies would be engulfed in a rash of mergers, leaving only a handful of gigantic survivors. But so far, the largest expected mergers have not materialized, analysts said, because the companies and investors have questioned the long-term benefits.
Pfizer's deal could pressure rivals like GlaxoSmithKline, which has been struggling to discover enough new drugs to make up for those now losing their patent protection, to make acquisitions simply to remain competitive.
GlaxoSmithKline's chief financial officer, John Coombe, said last month that his company had been eyeing Bristol-Myers Squibb, itself plagued by problems.
Pfizer's proposed acquisition of Pharmacia would help sustain its growth, the executives contend, because 11 of its 12 combined blockbuster drugs will be protected by patents through 2010. Its pipeline of drugs in late stages of development would be expanded with several promising Pharmacia drugs, including eplerenone, a new category of treatment for cardiovascular diseases; parecaxib, an injectable athritis treatment; and CDP-870, another drug that treats rheumatoid arthritis.
With an enlarged research and development budget, Pfizer hopes to discover and develop more new drugs faster than its competitors. The combination would have nearly 120 new chemical entities in development and 80 so-called drug enhancement projects.
The deal would also introduce Pfizer to two markets it has never been in before: cancer treatment and ophthalmology.
Analysts have questioned the value of the drugs Pharmacia has in development. "Although the company's pipeline contains a number of interesting new products," Peter Norman, a pharmaceutical consultant and analyst, wrote in a recent report, "none have clear blockbuster potential."
A swirl of controversy surrounds one and possibly two of Pharmacia's top selling arthritis drugs, Celebrex and Bextra. Last month, Express Scripts, one of the largest pharmacy benefit-management companies, said that Celebrex and a rival Merck drug, Vioxx, were being overly prescribed and have only a narrow benefit over older drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen, which are available in generic and over-the-counter versions for a fraction of the price.
Express Scripts said it was recommending that its clients, which include many employer health plans, require patients who are not at risk of ulcers to try generic pain relievers first, possibly denting sales of Celebrex and Bextra, which is similar.
Washington lawmakers have been vocal in recent months about rising drug prices and their cost to uninsured senior citizens and states that have to pay escalating Medicaid bills.
But the deal will probably be approved by regulators because the companies have few overlapping drugs. The only possible overlap may be between Pharmacia's Detrol and a competing drug that Pfizer is currently developing. Executives close to the transaction expect the deal to be completed by the end of the current year.
The executives said they expected the deal to create as much as $2.5 billion in annual savings by 2005. They expect savings of $1.4 billion in 2003 and $2.2 billion in 2004. The savings will come from cuts in administrative costs, purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and research and development.
Pfizer's absorption of Warner-Lambert was widely admired as a model of how to fully exploit an acquired portfolio of blockbuster drugs.
Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, Henry A. McKinnell, who conceived of the deal, would run the combined company. Fred Hassan, Pharmacia's chairman and chief executive, would become vice chairman of Pfizer and get a seat on the board.
Under the deal, Pfizer would trade 1.4 of its shares for each share of Pharmacia, according to the executives. That price of $45.08 a share, based on Friday's close, represents a 38 percent premium over Pharmacia's stock price of $32.59. Pfizer shareholders would own 77 percent of the combined company, the executive said, while Pharmacia's shareholders would own 23 percent.
Prior to the completion of the deal, Pharmacia plans to proceed with its previously announced spinoff to its shareholders of its remaining stake in Monsanto, the executives said. As a result of the spinoff, Pharmacia's shareholders would actually receive the equivalent of about a 44 percent premium, they said.
Pfizer also plans to announce today that it will expand its $10 billion stock repurchase to $16 billion, a measure that may help stabilize the value of its stock. After most merger announcements, the acquirer's stock at least temporarily declines. 
Pfizer was advised by Lazard and Bear, Stearns & Company and represented by the Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft law firm.
Pharmacia was advised by Goldman, Sachs and represented by the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm.

HEADLINE: Governors Share Concerns As Budget Shortfalls Spread 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, July 14 

 BODY:
The nation's governors gathered today in an atmosphere of deepening concern, confronting persistent revenue shortfalls, which many said would be aggravated by the turmoil on Wall Street, and the rising costs of providing health care for the poor and preventing terrorist attacks.
 Officials with the National Governors Association said that by their count 45 states reported revenue shortfalls over the last year, totaling $50 billion, caused by a drop in sales, capital gains and corporate and personal income taxes. 
 In interviews this weekend, governors from both political parties described the problem, which they attributed largely to the falloff on Wall Street, as more intense and more long-lasting than they had expected and particularly worrisome because it was occurring as the economy had seemed to be on the rebound.
"This thing has been deeper and longer than reasonable people would have expected it to be," Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, the Democrat who is taking over as chairman of the group, said in an interview here this morning. "This revenue has got to come back. It's a great concern." 
Gov. John Engler, the Michigan Republican who is the departing chairman of the association, said, "The fiscal concerns dominate."
Governors at the meeting here said they had nearly depleted the rainy day funds created in the flush years of the 1990's. (In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki turned to his rainy day fund to allow him to close an escalating revenue shortfall in an election year without raising taxes or making deep cuts in services.) 
Some governors said they were relying on what they acknowledged could prove to be overly optimistic revenue projections as they struggled to balance their budgets without raising taxes or cutting services. 
"We've reached deep into our reservoir of options," Mr. Engler said. "We set aside a lot of money in rainy day funds. Now we are drawing that reserve down. Well, in many cases, that was enough to get maybe a couple of fiscal years. The rainy day funds were never designed to go for five budget cycles."
To make matters worse, the governors acknowledged that it was unlikely that they could expect much help from Washington. While there was partisan disagreement about the reason -- Democratic governors blamed President Bush's tax cuts for Washington's fiscal problems, while Republicans said it was a reflection of the same problems they were facing at home -- there was agreement that the federal deficit meant that the governors would have to resolve many of these problems on their own.
Beyond the concerns of managing state budgets, there were political concerns as well. Several governors who are facing re-election this year said that the financial turmoil at home had become a campaign issue. 
"You sort of get credit for what happens to your watch on a certain extent -- good or bad," Mr. Patton said. "So I think incumbents, Democrats and Republicans, will face more difficult times getting re-elected than they did in the 1990's." 
Gov. Mike Huckabee, an Arkansas Republican who is facing re-election this year and who has had to deal with budget difficulties at home, said he believed that voters would not hold governors responsible for what he asserted was a problem confronting governments across the nation.
"If this were unique to one or even a handful of states, then it would be a legitimate political issue to say a governor was responsible," Mr. Huckabee said. "But a governor surely can't be held responsible for the collapse of the national, and in fact, the international economy."
The discussion of the fiscal situation came as the governors gathered in this hot Western city -- the temperature on Saturday afternoon was 105 degrees -- amid unusually heavy security that was a reminder of how times had changed since they met last summer in Providence, R.I. 
Governors invariably use the platform of these meetings to complain about two things: Mandates imposed on the states by the federal government, and the failure of the federal government to provide states with the money to finance these services. And to a certain extent, this session was no different.
"The real issues that are being addressed here are the impact on state budgets and the insensitivity of Congress to the real fiscal constraints that we have because of federal policies that demand services, but provide no finances to meet those," Gov. Donald Siegelman, Democrat of Alabama, said.
The governors repeatedly said they felt that they were headed into unfamiliar fiscal territory. They described being whipsawed between slacking revenues and rising costs, uncertain when either would halt. Several noted that this was happening when statehouses were about to go through an unusual upheaval: At least 21 of the nation's governors next year will be new because of term limits and retirements.
There was concern that things were not going to improve soon. "The last month has caused a great deal of concern on our part," Mr. Patton said. "We anticipated and built a budget based on a recovery beginning earlier this year, January or February, and blooming into a full-blown recovery. That obviously has not happened yet."
Governors said they believed that the main cause of the shortfalls was the problems on Wall Street. They said they were worried that the continued turmoil, driven by reports of corporate abuses, would make things even worse.
"We've had an enormous revenue drop that was worse than 1992, even though the economy was much worse in 1992 than today," said Gov. Howard Dean, Democrat of Vermont. 
Mr. Huckabee said a "a worst-case scenario would be to have a further hemorrhaging of revenues because of the crisis in confidence."
On the expense side, some governors said they were paying unexpected costs for security.
"We were promised some help," Mr. Siegelman said. "But we are having to foot the bill for extra expenses for the National Guard, for the Department of Public Safety. Sheriffs are looking for more vehicles, they want more vehicles for what they have to do."
Mr. Huckabee said Arkansas had spent more than $100,000 on testing white powder sent in by people fearful of anthrax combination.
But the main expression of fiscal concern was, again, Medicaid, the health program for the poor. Officials with the governors association said Medicaid costs made up 20 percent of the average state budget this year. They said the amount of money spent by states on Medicaid had increased by 13 percent in 2002, following an 11 percent increase in 2001. 
Governors said the most aggravating problem with the program was the increased number of people who had moved from Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly, to Medicaid, transferring the cost of the coverage to the states. "We have reached the point in Kentucky where we have got to cut back on the Medicaid program," Mr. Patton said. 
The governors asked Congress to pass pending legislation that would provide states with $8.9 billion in relief over the next 18 months, with half aimed at Medicaid.

HEADLINE: 4 IN PEARL MURDER ARE FOUND GUILTY IN PAKISTAN COURT 

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Monday, July 15 

 BODY:
A British-born Islamic militant was convicted and sentenced to death today for the kidnaping and murder of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter.
 Ahmed Omar Sheikh was convicted with three other men, Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem and Shaikh Adil, who were sentenced to life in prison, said Abdul Waheed Katpar, Mr. Sheikh's lawyer. The verdict was handed down this morning by Judge Ali Ashraf Shah. 
 Mr. Pearl, 38, disappeared Jan. 23 in Karachi while researching Pakistani's Islamic extremist movement. A videotape sent to American diplomats in February confirmed Mr. Pearl's murder, and the police later found remains of a body in Karachi believed to be those of Mr. Pearl. 
Mr. Katpar said he would file an appeal. Even if the appeal was unsuccessful, Mr. Katpar said, it would likely be months before Mr. Sheikh's death sentence would be carried out. In Pakistan, murder convicts are typically hanged. 
Mr. Katpar expressed frurstration with the prosecution's case, which he characterized as a weak. But he said his client was resigned to the conviction, convinced that American pressure on the court would never allow him to receive a fair trial. 
Security was extraordinary in Hyderabad, the southern Pakistani city where the case was tried. Snipers ringed the rooftops and the police sealed off the street leading to the courthouse. Truckloads of armed policemen, army soldiers and black-uniformed paramilitary commandos patrolled outside the walled jail compound.
The trial has fanned the anger of Islamic militants against Pakistan's government, which many militants feel betrayed them by abandoning the Afghan Taliban and supporting the United States after Sept. 11.
"The government will impose the decision at the behest of the United States," said Sheikh Aslam, Adil's brother, told reporters as he arrived to hear the verdict. "All executive decisions in Pakistan are being imposed by the United States."
Soon after the kidnapping, e-mails received by Pakistani and Western news organizations from the previously unknown National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty showed Mr. Pearl in captivity and demanded better treatment for Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners at the United States naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Pakistani officials believed that the group was likely a front for militants previously associated with other groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammed and possibly Al Qaeda.
The first e-mail called Mr. Pearl a C.I.A. agent; a second claimed he was working for the Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad. Mr. Pearl's family denied both allegations.
Mr. Sheikh and his co-defendants denied involvement in the kidnapping and accused the government of fabricating the case to appease American anger. 
Mr. Sheikh admitted a role the kidnapping during his initial court appearance Feb. 14, but later recanted.
The trial began April 22 in Karachi but was moved to Hyderabad, about 110 miles away, after prosecutors said they had received death threats.
Prosecutors said Mr. Sheikh, a former student at the London School of Economics, lured Mr. Pearl into a trap with a promise of a meeting with an Islamic cleric, who has been cleared of any involvement in the kidnapping.
The prosecution relied heavily on technical evidence provided by the F.B.I., which traced the e-mails to the co-defendant Fahad Naseem, who identified Mr. Sheikh and the others. 
Mr. Naseem said Mr. Sheikh had told him that he intended to grab someone who was "anti-Islam and a Jew," the police reported.
The key prosecution witness, a taxi driver named Nasir Abbas, testified that he saw Mr. Pearl get into a car with Mr. Saeed in front of a Karachi restaurant on the night the reporter disappeared. The defense claimed Mr. Abbas was pressured into making his statement.
The United States has asked for Mr. Sheikh's extradition to face charges in the Pearl case and in the 1994 kidnapping in India of an American who was freed unharmed.
On the highway between Karachi and Hyderabad, graffiti painted in black lettering on concrete barriers proclaimed: "America, your death is coming," and "The war will continue until America is finished."

HEADLINE: Notes From Yaak; 
The Thirty Years' War

BYLINE:  By Rick Bass; Rick Bass is the author, most recently, of "The Hermit's Story."

DATELINE: YAAK, Mont. 

 BODY:
Where I live, some people decide whether to wave at each other, or even speak a greeting of the day, based on whether the person across from them supports protection of the last roadless areas here. This despite the fact that the timber in these areas is a nonissue: roadless areas are the farthest, most rugged, least productive areas, which is why roads haven't been built there yet.
 It's estimated that the last remaining roadless areas in our national forests -- a total of about 58.5 million acres across 39 states -- contain less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the nation's timber. Yet the divisiveness over such an insignificant amount of timber casts a poisonous pall over entire communities. Some powerful elements in the timber and mining industries are trying wherever they can to scare local millworkers and businesses into believing we can't afford to protect these lands. Here in western Montana this can mean warnings of mill closings and labeling environmentalists as terrorists. 
 In my own valley, the Yaak -- a gnarly, rank, mosquito-ridden jungle that's been subject to countless clearcuts in the last half-century -- there's still not a single acre of roadless land protected as wilderness. Only 15 small roadless areas remain eligible for protection -- the largest is only about 35,000 acres, and the smallest, 1,000 acres -- little more than gardens, from the perspective of the Western landscape.
To date, it's a 30-year war, ever since the United States Forest Service inventoried these last roadless areas for wilderness designation in 1972. Must it be this way for another 30 years? Rural communities of 50 or 100 people fighting over philosophical scraps of land that really belong to every American?
When I began this fight, I was a young man, and went hiking almost every day in many of these public treasures, though almost always with a dull worry in my heart, knowing that these places were not protected for future generations. I'm middle-aged now, with a middle-aged man's responsibilities. Yet still my heart is heavy with that worry of my younger days: How can we defend the nation's last roadless areas?
We've been arguing for decades that building roads in our national forests, where the Forest Service sells public resources (often at a loss), leaves behind damaged land whose repair the taxpayers are left to finance. At last count, the projected cost for such repairs was $8.4 billion. We've been arguing about the necessity of genetic and ecologic diversity. Grizzlies and other rare and endangered species like bull trout depend on the sanctuary provided by roadless areas. We've been arguing that local economies adjacent to wilderness areas are often thriving.
But political recognition of the merits of these arguments has been long delayed. The Clinton administration began the process of establishing permanent protection for these lands in 1998. The Forest Service held hundreds of public meetings over the course of two years, and received an overwhelming public response in favor of protection. But the Bush administration requested further analysis, complaining that there hadn't been enough local input. Last fall over 80 percent of the residents in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana who responded during a second comment period asked -- again -- for the land to be protected. Recognizing this public will, Representatives Jay Inslee of Washington and Sherwood Boehler of New York have introduced an amendment to an appropriations bill for the Interior Department to protect roadless areas. Votes on this proposal are expected as early as this week.
I admit I've grown a bit tired of arguing for the beauty and the economic benefits of wilderness, of the need to protect the endangered species that rely on these lands. I am sick of the polls, which show again and again that we want these lands protected. But what I am not sick of is beseeching, on behalf of wilderness, and the future. If these last wildlands had been protected yesterday -- or last year, or the year before -- little if anything would have changed. That's the point. We choose to live, vacation and work in these lands, hoping they will remain as much the same and secure as possible. Is that so radical?
The Wilderness Act of 1964 passed the House by 373 to 1. I am still naive enough -- and patriotic enough -- to believe that a vote for protecting our last roadless areas can still pass beyond the brittle barriers of party lines: that conservatives can still know what it means to conserve, and liberals what it means to liberate. That we can have joy and logging, both; that we can survive, and then flourish, with our wilderness.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Silicon Valley, Without All the Trimmings

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF and MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Within walking distance of Stanford, where the economist who coined the term "conspicuous consumption" once taught, a dark reality is playing out. Having already gone from boom to bust, many dot-commers are coming to something worse. Unable to make payments, they are selling luxury cars, canceling home renovations and returning jewelry by the box.
 This region has grown accustomed to high-technology highs and lows over four decades, but the current dot-com collapse has lasted longer and cut deeper. And the recently affluent technology workers who had come to believe in the "long boom," the idea that prosperity would be permanent, are quietly giving up their flashy signs of success to make ends meet. 
 On a counter at Neiman Marcus here, an anchor of one of the nation's most exclusive shopping centers, sits a necklace of amethyst and labradorite. The opaque lavender piece goes for $470, which seems like a fair price for handcrafted jewelry. It is, however, preowned: bought two and a half years ago, at the peak of the Internet bubble, it was returned to the retailer six months ago. 
"When people have too much new money, the way to demonstrate their success is with a lot of frivolous expenditures," said Randy Komisar, a longtime high-technology executive and the author of "The Monk and the Riddle: The Education of a Silicon Valley Entrepreneur." 
Now he says the downturn has produced a painful return to reality: "There is a sense that people got ahead of themselves. People were trying to be more than they actually were, and they expected that the future would look like the past."
It was the economist Thorstein Veblen who first captured the foibles of the recently rich in devastating fashion more than a century ago in "Theory of the Leisure Class." He argued that there was an innate urge to consume as an end in itself and that an entire social class defined itself by what it could buy.
Now, in Silicon Valley, a part of the dot-com class is being defined by what it needs to return. "This is the reality of downward mobility," said a jewelry saleswoman who works at Neiman Marcus. "There is an underlying need to appear that this isn't happening in their lives."
Jewelry, perhaps the most frivolous of purchases, is returned first, she said, in an effort to keep up appearances of normalcy. 
Occasionally the personal financial crises descend into pathos. Not long ago, the saleswoman said, a woman came to her and tried to return the small ornament the store puts on gift-wrapped packages. "It's bizarre and funny," she said. "There are people who are not as wealthy as they once were, and then there are the people who are desperate." 
Indeed, a growing number of those who rode up with the boom are now doing what they can to hang on quietly during Silicon Valley's downturn.
"My fantasies have gone from Gulfstreams to Airstreams," said Matthew Naythons, who was once worth millions on paper as the editorial director of PlanetRX and who is now starting over with a new company, Epicom.
This downsizing of lifestyles is consistent with the rising unemployment, soaring commercial real estate vacancy rates and softened market for hotels and restaurants.
The one area where the economy remains hot -- although no longer so sizzling -- is the market for homes, which are still in short supply. Moreover, brokers say, homes here are increasingly viewed as a haven from the much riskier investments in the staggering stock market.
For others, housing is a mainstay, not one of the luxuries they are purging from their lives. Indeed, unable to make payments, some former dot-commers, and others whose income swelled with the bubble and shrank when it burst, are selling Porsches and BMW's on consignment. They are unloading second homes and canceling renovations.
"People are going through old jewelry boxes and pawning old jewelry," said one high-end jewelry designer, who insisted on anonymity. She said the return rate at Nordstrom was as high as 50 percent, double the traditional rate. 
Jewelry is coming back "worn, torn, filled with hair spray and broken," she said. "Some people are breaking it and then coming back saying, 'This is broken.' "
While the economy is by no means moribund here, there are signs of suffering at both the low end -- where people are unemployed -- and the high end, where the reserves have run thin.
"These dot-com guys can't handle the payments anymore," said Eddie Manio, a sales associate at Bay Area Lease in Redwood City, which sells cars on consignment, taking roughly a 5 percent cut. A picture behind Mr. Manio's desk shows Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Mr. Manio, with the legend: "Three people you can trust." 
A growing number of people are trusting Mr. Manio to help them sell cars like Porsche, BMW and Mercedes. In the showroom is a 1997 Red Lotus whose owner, who works in commercial real estate, put 15,000 miles on it and is asking $57,500.
Next to the Lotus sits a Porsche Boxster and a '99 Mercedes SL500 for $59,500. The company recently took in a BMW 740i, a luxury sedan, from someone in the software industry.
Mr. Manio said the seller was typical of the kind of client he was seeing more of -- "Silicon Valley and Internet people." But he said that while the numbers of people bringing in cars for sale was rising, he was having trouble finding any buyers.
Carmen Michaelian did not work for a dot-com, but she is feeling the pain, too. She works at the jewelry counter at Nordstrom, selling mostly costume pieces from $30 to several hundred dollars. She said that Nordstrom was liberal about letting people return things, even if they had not recently bought them and even if they were unable to prove that they had bought them at the store.
While this is perceived as good customer service, it is tough on the salespeople, who lose their commissions when there are returns. Ms. Michaelian, who during a very good two-week period will sell $15,000 of jewlery, is also regularly seeing the effect of returns of $3,000 to $4,000 on each two-week paycheck -- a figure she said was typical.
Late last year, she processed a return for a woman who brought in eight necklaces and some bracelets she had bought two years ago. "She didn't say why," Ms. Michaelian said. "Maybe she lost her job." 
According to Jan English-Lueck, a professor of anthroplogy at San Jose State University and author of "Cultures at Silicon Valley," the downturn appears to have eased for some people, but that is hardly universal. She said many people remained overextended -- stuck with big mortgages, for example -- and may be returning items not just to downsize their lifestyles, but to lift their bank accounts. "People are turning merchandise into money," she said.
More generally, the idea that people are returning big-ticket items is consistent with how they view acquiring those items in the first place. "People use disposable income as a cushion," she said, spending money on more extravagant items they know they can return if necessary.
"People buy things with the understanding that, 'if it doesn't work out, we'll sell it,' " she said. "It's like a buffer of wealth." More specifically, she said, Silicon Valley consumers are "sophisticated consumers who know how to return merchandise." 
Lately, Ms. English-Lueck has been researching the attitudes of teenagers and their families in Silicon Valley. She said that she was seeing a renewed emphasis on simplification. Young people are thinking more about the long-term future, even retirement, she said.
"There is a sense that money could go and jobs are not that stable," she said. "Those things are beginning to loom in people's consciousness."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Fuel-cell work is helping build research prowess for Detroit.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr 

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich. 

 BODY:
IN 1956, when General Motors opened its sprawling research center here, President Dwight D. Eisenhower praised it as a symbol of democratic capitalism's natural impulse to explore the frontiers of technology. G.M. executives declared their commitment to making the Warren research center "one of the nation's great resources." 
 Yet the research centers of Detroit -- Ford Motor opened one in 1953 -- never really rose to rival the labs of the information technology industry. A handful of computer and telecommunications companies, led by I.B.M.'s Watson Labs and AT&T's Bell Labs, were the places where the best and brightest minds gravitated to do pioneering work on everything from solid-state physics to software algorithms. 
 Detroit, however, seems to be making a comeback as an industry in which people are working on breakthrough technology. There is perhaps no better place to get a sense of that technological excitement than here in Warren. Today, it is a place of work spaces separated by shoulder-high partitions and informally dressed researchers carrying laptop computers. Except for the prototype automobiles, the place could be mistaken for an office in Silicon Valley. 
One of the more intriguing projects is led by Christopher Borroni-Bird, a young research director who holds a Ph.D. in physics from Cambridge University and did post-doctorate work at Tokyo University before joining the auto industry. He worked for DaimlerChrysler and then moved to G.M. two years ago to help it completely rethink the conventional automobile -- its design, technology and propulsion.
Mr. Borroni-Bird is the program director for a concept car called the Automony, a sculptured, aerodynamic vehicle that is intended to be powered by hydrogen-based fuel cells and controlled electronically using so-called drive-by-wire technology. About the only thing left of the traditional automobile would be the wheels and the driver.
Gone would be the internal combustion engine and, oh yes, the petroleum-based energy economy. The electronic controls would mean there would be no need for foot pedals or even a steering wheel. The car could be driven with a joystick or a device resembling a video-game controller. With no hump for a drive shaft down the middle of the interior, design would be liberated. And the driver could sit anywhere in the car, since the portable electronic controls could be taken to any seat.
A working prototype of the Autonomy is scheduled to be shown later this year. Most other car companies, including Toyota and BMW, also plan to have demonstration fuel-cell vehicles ready soon.
The sincerity of the auto industry in developing fuel-cell cars is difficult to determine. Detroit has an enormous stake in the internal combustion engine and the status quo. But there are incentives to pursue a long-term transition: oil reserves will not last forever, and fuel-cell technology does provide a way to sell cars to the 88 percent of the world's households who still do not own automobiles, without choking the globe in pollution.
The G.M. concept has some particularly interesting elements that Mr. Borroni-Bird, a small, slight native of Liverpool, explained with animated enthusiasm. The Autonomy idea is to separate the chassis from the body. All the fuel-cell propulsion equipment is in the chassis, a series of modular components, beneath a solid platform. Mr. Borroni-Bird refers to the chassis as the skateboard, fittingly, since it resembles a giant skateboard riding on four automobile wheels.
All kinds of car bodies could, in theory, rest on a single platform, secured by mechanical locks. There could be a sports-car style body for a drive in the country or a van-like body for a family vacation. The skateboard platform would use sensors and software to automatically adapt to whichever body happens to plopped on top -- plug and play, as they say in the computer industry.
Such an approach to car-making has the potential to overhaul the structure of the industry. For example, some companies might specialize in making skateboard platforms, while other companies might make bodies. There could be a proliferation of companies and innovation. Yet if one company became the leading producer of skateboards, it could own the crucial technology platform in the industry -- just as, for example, Microsoft's Windows operating system is the dominant technology platform in the personal computer business.
The hurdles to bringing a car like the Autonomy into the mainstream market are daunting as well. Mr. Borroni-Bird is a veteran of fuel-cell research, and he is well aware of the progress that still needs to be made in cost, size and storage if fuel-cell technology is going to become commercially practical. But the trends are going in the right direction. A decade ago, a fuel cell to power an automobile was the size of a van, while today a vehicle like the Autonomy is possible. But can there be enough on-board storage to give a fuel-cell car the 300-mile range before refueling of a conventional car? And what about the fuel-distribution infrastructure? After all, there are roughly 175,000 gas stations in the United States.
Mr. Borroni-Bird and other experts see an evolutionary path toward fuel cells in which first gasoline and ethanol are used in a reforming process to produce hydrogen, which is then used by the cell to produce electricity that powers the car. Still, Mr. Borroni-Bird says, even the gasoline-to-hydrogen conversion would mean 50 percent greater energy efficiency and 50 percent less pollution than internal combustion cars.
Many experts predict that fuel cells will first be used on portable electronic devices like cellphones and laptop computers. Start-ups, like Neah Power Systems of Bothell, Wash., are developing such systems; plug a fuel-cell device the size of a lighter onto the side of a laptop, and it could run for days or a week.
Mr. Borroni-Bird said he was hopeful that by 2010 there would be substantial numbers of fuel-cell vehicles on the road. 
Whatever the outcome, others have noticed the altered mood among the technologists of Detroit. "They are pursuing a radical change in the design and power plant of vehicles," observed Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a consulting firm in Emeryville, Calif. "It has some of the feel of the early days of the Internet and biotechnology, a sense of vision, enthusiasm and desire to help the world. Microchips and PC's felt that way 20 years ago."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Toyota turns to smaller agencies to set the stage for its new Scion line.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TOYOTA MOTOR SALES USA is snubbing its main agency, Saatchi & Saatchi, by awarding a group of smaller, creatively focused agencies an estimated $50 million assignment for its new Scion line of less-expensive vehicles. 
 In a departure from the centralized way Toyota typically handles its marketing campaigns, the assignment will be divided among outside agencies including Attik in London and Oasis in New York. Attik is to create a brand identity for Scion as well as concepts for television and print advertising that will present the brand to the intended audience, primarily consumers ages 18 to 24. Oasis is to concentrate on creating content for the Scion Web site, www.scion.com. 
 The initial two Scion models are to be priced under $18,000 and combine elements of cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles. They are expected to start appearing in Toyota showrooms in California in June 2003, then be expanded gradually across the country with a goal of national distribution a year after that.
The introduction of Scion is indicative of efforts by the giant auto makers like Toyota Motor Sales USA, part of the Toyota Motor Corporation, to develop products that will appeal not to the estimated 76 million baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964, but rather to their children and grandchildren. That market consists of the estimated 70 million potential drivers expected by 2010 among Americans born from 1977 to 1994.
From the start of the review for the Scion assignment in February, there had been widespread speculation that executives at Toyota Motor Sales wanted to spread the work. The goal is to help distinguish the Scion brand as much as possible from its older siblings, Toyota and Lexus.
"Everything needs to be perceived as distinct," said Brian Bolain, the national manager for Scion at Toyota Motor Sales in Torrance, Calif. "These buyers demand something especially for them, and it's important every aspect of this project meet that requirement."
The creative assignments for Toyota and Lexus are consolidated at Saatchi & Saatchi, much as the American Honda Motor Company division of the Honda Motor Company consolidated its Honda and Acura brands at Rubin Postaer & Associates in Santa Monica, Calif., and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler consolidated its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands at BBDO Detroit, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
Such consolidation would not be the right strategy for Scion, Mr. Bolain said. "A very traditional approach is not necessarily going to get us the results we need," he said. "We plan a mixture of traditional and nontraditional, with an emphasis on a grass-roots, under-the-radar approach."
The Los Angeles office of Saatchi & Saatchi produces campaigns for the flagship Toyota brand, which spent $568 million last year for ads in major consumer media like television and magazines, according to the CMR division of Taylor Nelson Sofres. A Saatchi & Saatchi division, Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., creates campaign for the Lexus luxury brand; CMR estimates Lexus spent $187 million last year for ads in major consumer media.
Saatchi & Saatchi took part in the first round of the review, Mr. Bolain said, "but that was where it stopped." He declined to identify the finalists in addition to Attik and Oasis.
Bypassing Saatchi & Saatchi on Scion "has absolutely no implication whatever" for the relationship of the agency and Toyota Motor Sales, Mr. Bolain said, adding that Saatchi & Saatchi would continue to create ads for the Toyota-brand models aimed at younger drivers, like the Celica.
Liv Eisaman, a spokeswoman for Saatchi & Saatchi, which is owned by the Publicis Groupe, referred questions to Toyota Motor Sales.
Attik and Oasis will join two companies already working on Scion. One is Rebel in Los Angeles, a division of Urb magazine that "has helped us with events and promotions related to the music industry," Mr. Bolain said. 
Those include compact discs given away in March and April at the Scion exhibit at the 2002 New York International Auto Show, where the vehicles displayed included the bbX, a tall, boxy four-door reminiscent of a Chrysler PT Cruiser crossed with a Mini Cooper.
The other company now working on Scion is Enterprise Communications in Torrance, a design and graphics agency.
Oasis, owned by the Japanese agency company Dentsu, also works for Toyota Motor Sales, creating corporate image campaigns, ads with environmental themes and ads that promote the Toyota Prius, a hybrid vehicle that runs on gasoline and electricity.
Although Attik has not worked with Toyota Motor Sales before, Mr. Bolain said, the company was attracted to its history of working with a number of youth-oriented clients, which include Adidas, Nike, Sony and Virgin. Attik also handled a project for the Ford Motor Company, involving a concept car aimed at younger consumers.
"Though we've had a taste of the automotive world, our real strength is our understanding of the target audience," said James Sommerville, the chief executive at Attik, which also has offices in New York, San Francisco and Sydney, Australia.
"With people in this age group, you need an alternative spin, an alternative way of thinking," he added. 
"It's less about product and more about feeling, less about 'You've got to buy this car because' and more about fitting into their world with something they love like music, entertainment, friends and family."

HEADLINE: Chief Executive Of Phone Giant In Germany May Be Ousted 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 14 

 BODY:
The troubled chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, Ron Sommer, is likely to lose his job this week, when the board is expected to replace him with one of his deputies, Gerd Tenzer, people close to the situation said today. 
 Mr. Sommer has fought an increasingly uphill battle to hold onto power since the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder began maneuvering last week to oust him before elections this September. The government holds a 43 percent stake in the company, which first issued stock six years ago. 
 On Friday, a four-person steering committee of Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board agreed to propose Mr. Tenzer, 59, as a replacement for Mr. Sommer, 53, whose plan to transform a stodgy state monopoly into a global communications empire foundered on an unforgiving stock market. 
Deutsche Telekom's 20-member board will meet on Tuesday to resolve the issue, executives at the company said.
The power struggle of the chancellor and the chief executive has riveted Germany, pitting a vote-hungry politician against an ambitious businessman. When Mr. Sommer, an ex-Sony executive who was born in Israel, became the chief salesman for the initial public offering of Deutsche Telekom shares in 1996, he persuaded millions of Germans to buy stock for the first time.
But Telekom has lost 90 percent of its value from its peak in March 2000.
In order to remove Mr. Sommer, two-thirds of the board members must vote against him. Given that half the members are drawn from unions and other employee groups, the government must win the support of the rank and file to make a change.
Union leaders have said they could support a new chief executive, as long as he came from within the company. Mr. Tenzer, a longtime Telekom official who oversees production technology and purchasing, would be a conservative choice who would very likely mollify the unions.
Executives at the company, however, said Mr. Sommer planned to appear at the meeting to defend himself.
He has mounted a spirited, well-orchestrated campaign to keep his job. Last week, 20,000 employees of Deutsche Telekom signed an open letter in support of the chief executive, while the company's union leaders unions urged the government not to interfere in its management.
Deutsche Telekom's American investment bankers are also stepping up behind Mr. Sommer. The chief executive of Goldman, Sachs, Henry Paulson, urged the supervisory board not to oust Mr. Sommer, in a letter sent last Friday to the board's chairman, Hans-Dietrich Winkhaus.
Mr. Paulson said the company was in the process of solving its problems, which stem largely from its $67 billion in debt after acquisitions like Voicestream, an American wireless provider. 
"The essential element of the successful execution of this plan is the continuity of Deutsche Telekom's management," Mr. Paulson said in the letter, excerpts of which were read to The New York Times by an executive close to the situation. 
As if to underscore that point, Telekom released first-half financial results last Friday, days earlier than usual. 
Telekom said its traditional phone business had stabilized, though it reported only cash-flow results. On a net basis, the company has said it expects to post a record loss this year of 6.7 billion euros, or $6.57 billion, stemming mostly from its more than $15 billion in annual interest payments. 
The company also said in Friday's report that Voicestream, the No. 6 cellular provider in the United States, had increased its number of subscribers by 525,000, to more than 8 million. Mr. Sommer has been harshly criticized for acquiring Voicestream last year for $24 billion in cash and stock. Telekom has said it would be open to a merger of Voicestream with another provider.
Goldman, Sachs played a central role in Mr. Sommer's acquisitive strategy -- advising him on several deals -- and executives close to the bank said it had taken a major risk in defending him so publicly. "There's a chance we might get fired if Sommer goes down," one executive said. 
That would be a blow for Goldman, which used its close relationship with Mr. Sommer and Telekom as a calling card to become a dominant player in European telecommunications mergers. 
Still, the executives said that Mr. Paulson felt so strongly about Mr. Sommer's keeping his job, that he was compelled to write the letter, after much internal debate at the bank. Mr. Sommer did not put Mr. Paulson up to writing the letter, the executives said, nor did Mr. Paulson mention Mr. Sommer by name. 
Analysts say Mr. Tenzer is a low-key contrast to Mr. Sommer, a charismatic, combative boss who carried on a tempestuous relationship with journalists and even shareholders who questioned his strategy. 
Mr. Tenzer's biggest recent project, people at the company said, was trying to sell Telekom's cable-television properties to Liberty Media, the company controlled by John C. Malone. 
German regulators blocked the $5 billion deal because Liberty refused to commit to upgrading the cable systems to provide high-speed Internet connections and telephone service in competition with Telekom. 
Some analysts said the regulators' decision was misguided -- depriving German customers of a vigorous new competitor in cable television while depriving Telekom of an easy way to whittle its debt. 
If the supervisory board removes Mr. Sommer on Tuesday, it will amount to a far more direct intervention in the company by the government. Analysts say Mr. Schroder was responding to pressure from his political rival, Edmund Stoiber, who has challenged the chancellor's economic stewardship. 
Though Mr. Schroder is personally popular, his Social Democratic coalition trails the Christian Democratic Union coalition, led by Mr. Stoiber, in polls. Elections are scheduled for Sept. 22. 
Last week, Mr. Stoiber, the conservative premier of Bavaria, said "politics should intervene" to revive confidence in Deutsche Telekom.
The political maneuvering has been exceedingly messy. Mr. Schroder apparently decided to cast Mr. Sommer overboard before he had lined up a replacement. That set off an embarrassing spectacle, as German officials offered the job, without success, to a long list of leading German industrialists. 
Critics say the government is also jeopardizing its reputation for market-oriented economic modernization. 
"Schroder set out to create the impression that Germany Inc. was changing," said Thomas Mayer, an economist at Goldman, Sachs. "But this just plays to the old cliche that there is a lot of political meddling in business." 
"It is certainly not something that is going to enhance Germany's reputation for overseas investors," Mr. Mayer said.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Distant From Wall Street, Bush Pays Necessary Visit

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
George W. Bush spent a good 20 minutes, a presidential eternity, slapping backs and signing autographs on Wall Street last week after his speech denouncing corporate sleaze. He looked at home, just as the nation's first M.B.A. president should. 
 But underneath all the public snuggling was a more interesting reality: Mr. Bush, for complex reasons both political and familial, has never been chummy with Wall Street. People on Wall Street now argue that his distance in part explains why the Dow fell nearly 700 points after the president's speech last week, and why many responded so badly to words meant to soothe them. 
 "With Wall Street, he never had close relationships historically," said John M. Hennessy, the former chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston, a friend of both President Bushes. "He is quite different from his father."
So the story of Mr. Bush and Wall Street begins, like so much else in the Bush II White House, with the complicated bonds of the 41st and 43rd presidents -- two men who personify the longtime divide in the Republican Party between the blue-blooded internationalists of Wall Street and the small-business isolationists of Main Street.
The first President Bush, whose ancestors made their fortune in railroads and steel in Ohio, was famously at ease in the Wall Street clubrooms of his father, Prescott S. Bush, the United States senator who ran Brown Brothers Harriman, the bluest of the blue-blood investment firms, which in its heyday was the nation's largest private bank. He named another Ivy League blue-blood, Nicholas F. Brady, as his treasury secretary.
The second President Bush, while he mightily enjoyed his family's Wall Street wealth and connections, needed his own identity. He sought to make his fortune in oil, and although he was not particularly successful, friends and advisers say that he has retained the pride and romanticism of the American businessman who tries to create something with his own hands.
"Those are the people who are the salt of the earth," said Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, who forged a bond with President Bush when both worked in the oil and gas business in Texas in the 1970's. "It's a community of independent thinkers." Back in Texas, "We were trying to find oil and gas," Mr. Evans said. "We were trying to build companies. We were trying to provide jobs to the local community." 
Talking to Wall Street financiers was little more than an unpleasant necessity. "The action was in the field," Mr. Evans said. "We found more enjoyment going out in talking to the workers in the oil fields than we had in going to New York and talking to the investment bankers." 
A Republican businessman who advises the White House said Mr. Bush came of age in Texas with a disdain for Wall Street bankers, who in the president's view were people who simply moved money around at the expense of those doing the real heavy lifting, America's businesses. "Wall Streeters were basically people who charged big fees to produce dubious results on deals," the adviser said.
These days, however, it is far less Wall Streeters than C.E.O.'s who are engaged in dubious deals.
But when it came time for Mr. Bush to name a treasury secretary, he gravitated toward the C.E.O.'s. Wall Street was scoured, but none of the frequently mentioned big shots -- Mr. Hennessy, or Donald B. Marron, chairman of UBS America -- even made it to the finals, the adviser to the White House said. 
"The president-elect never wanted a Wall Street investment banker as treasury secretary," the adviser said. "He wanted a corporate C.E.O. who had been involved in a company that was more oriented towards the buying and selling of actual products, one that had been involved in the tangible economy, not the intangible economy." 
Vice President Dick Cheney finally offered the job to Paul H. O'Neill, the chairman of Alcoa, who is seen on Wall Street as a bottom line-obsessed truth-teller whose habit for popping off -- Mr. O'Neill said a month ago that there should be public hangings of corrupt corporate executives -- has not been reassuring to the markets.
As a result, some financiers say that Mr. Bush's distance from Wall Street made him months late in forcefully responding to the corporate scandals, and that his administration has not fully understood that Wall Street wants more far-reaching reform than the tough talk of his speech.
"I think if he were closer to Wall Street, he would have a more nuanced view of this business," said Felix Rohatyn, the longtime Wall Street financier and former ambassador to France. Mr. Rohatyn has advocated putting institutional investors on corporate boards and reporting stock options granted to top executives on income statements, neither of which were mentioned in Mr. Bush's speech.
"There are a lot of people in cities other than New York, Los Angeles and Washington who think Wall Street is kind of a casino, that it's full of sharpees and people who did some of the things that happened," Mr. Rohatyn added. "Wall Street has become such a part of Main Street through the mutual funds that you can't say, 'I despise Wall Street,' because Wall Street and Main Street have come together."
Mr. Bush would be unlikely to disagree with that, but that hasn't stopped people like Mr. Evans from remembering how different things were back in their oil days in Texas. "The way you dealt with somebody," he said, "is that you shook their hand -- and you took their word."

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Chief Rejects Calls for His Resignation 

BYLINE:  By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said today that he would not resign despite calls for him to do so by lawmakers who say he has been lax in enforcing commission rules and shares responsibility for the nation's corporate accounting scandals.
 Mr. Pitt has become a focal point in a broadening barrage of criticism of Bush administration appointees over corporate responsibility, most of it by Democratic lawmakers. But he asserted today that he was especially well suited to help bring order to the situation because of his long experience as a lawyer for corporations and the accounting industry. 
 Speaking on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. Pitt formulated a new argument against critics who have said his background in representing the corporate and accounting world should disqualify him from leading the commission.
"I am the right person for the job," he said. "This guilt by occupation is really a needless diversion."
Mr. Pitt's assertion could be used by many other top administration officials, including President Bush.
Mr. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials have faced questions about their own corporate involvement in the period that is coming under intense scrutiny. More recently, Deputy Attorney General Larry D. Thompson, who is a member of the administration's new task force on corporate accountability, has faced questions about his role as a director of a credit card company that paid more than $300 million to settle complaints of consumer and securities fraud.
Mr. Thompson, whom Mr. Bush appointed to lead a new multiagency unit to combat corporate crime, was a member of the board of the company, Providian Financial Corporation, and chairman of its audit and compliance committee from June 1997 until May 2001, when he was confirmed as deputy attorney general.
Providian, based in San Francisco, settled complaints by state and federal regulators that it engaged in improper practices, including charging excessive fees to poor people struggling to maintain their credit accounts. The company later settled complaints by shareholders who said its officers did not properly disclose its financial weaknesses in 2001.
Barbara Comstock, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said today that the questions about Mr. Thompson's role in the Providian case were unfair and that he had been the leading force in getting the company to change its ways.
"His experience, his integrity and his professionalism is beyond reproach," Ms. Comstock said. "As an outside director of Providian, he only became aware of the problems when regulators began to make inquiries. As soon as he was aware of the issues, he personally took the lead to make sure the company did the right thing."
She said Mr. Thompson was the driving force in the company's decision to settle the complaints and in changing Providian's practices.
On "Meet the Press" today, Mr. Pitt said that the questions about President Bush's sale of stock in the Harken Energy Corporation in 1990 came from dredging up old material that had been investigated.
But Senators Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, both Democrats, called for Mr. Bush to disclose all records of those investigations.
Mr. Pitt said that the Bush administration had moved swiftly enough to increase the enforcement budget of his agency by $100 million, and that adding more money should wait until his staff completed a comprehensive study of how much it needed. He said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was more effective than ever in investigating and punishing companies, executives and accountants and that the agency was not "being light on anybody."
"We are setting records every day," he said, "and I'm proud of my staff."
Nonetheless, people like Mr. Lieberman, who was Vice President Al Gore's running mate in 2000, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who ran against Mr. Bush for the Republican nomination, repeated their calls for Mr. Pitt's resignation today.
Mr. Lieberman said on "This Week," the ABC News program, "His background is so infused with a law practice, and a practice that was involved with the very accounting firms that have been accused of the wrongdoing that has so hurt our economy and millions of average investors, that I think it would be better for everyone if Mr. Pitt stepped down as chairman of the S.E.C. and President Bush had the opportunity to appoint somebody totally independent."
Mr. Lieberman also called on President Bush to disclose the details of his sale of Harken stock.
"Because of the president's involvement in the Harken Energy case," he said, "there is a large cloud hanging over his head, which I'm afraid, if he doesn't eliminate it soon by giving full disclosure, will diminish his moral authority, his presidential authority to lead the critical effort to restore confidence in the market."

HEADLINE: Coke to Report Stock Options As an Expense 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS and SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company, breaking ranks with the vast majority of American companies, said yesterday that it would change its accounting so that its earnings reflect the value of the stock options it grants to executives and other employees.
 That move, which will lower Coke's reported profits, is permitted but not required by accounting rules, largely because of intense lobbying by corporations when the rules were adopted in 1994. 
 Companies have feared that reduced profits would hurt their stock prices. But with corporate abuses now a major political issue and some executives having made hundreds of millions of dollars from options before their companies collapsed, the debate seems to have shifted ground.
"I think you will see other companies doing this," said Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and a Coca-Cola director, speaking from Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was attending a meeting with many other corporate leaders. "There has been a lot of discussion out here about this." 
The Coke decision was announced by Douglas N. Daft, the chairman and chief executive, who said it was clear that "stock options are a form of employee compensation expense" and that the change in accounting "ensures that our earnings will more clearly reflect economic reality when all compensation costs are recorded in the financial statements."
Coke officials said Mr. Daft had been considering the move for several weeks, but decided to act after President Bush's speech about corporate abuses on Tuesday.
"Doug Daft took that very seriously," said Gary P. Fayard, the company's chief financial officer. "We know we're in a new environment and we need to take the lead on this issue and perhaps in a small way, try to help restore confidence in corporate America."
The Coke decision drew immediate praise from people who have been pushing to change the accounting. "God bless Coke," said Arthur Levitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. "This will become a litmus test," he said, both for corporations, who will have to decide whether to follow Coke's lead, and for politicians who have opposed requiring companies to report this expense.
At stake are billions in reported profits. At Coke alone last year, had the company treated its options as an expense, its profits would have been reduced by $202 million.
All other forms of compensation are reported as an expense. Mr. Buffett said he thought that as more companies report the value of options as an expense, some may turn to different forms of compensation that do a better job of rewarding successful management, such as options that pay off only if the stock outperforms its rivals'. Such options already must be reported as expenses, and as a result, few companies issue them.
Mr. Fayard said the change would permit the company to design better compensation plans, but said the damage to profits would not cause the company to reduce the number of options it grants. "I've always said that accounting should never drive a business decision," he said.
In 1994, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting standards in America, retreated from its proposed rule to require options to be expenses. It reacted to heavy political pressure directed by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who had pushed through the Senate a resolution opposing the plan on a vote of 88-9. He then proposed legislation to all but put the board out of business, but dropped that proposal after the board backed down.
The board surrendered on the private advice of Mr. Levitt, then the S.E.C. chairman. Yesterday, he said that was the worst mistake he made at the commission.
Denis Beresford, the accounting board's chairman in 1994 and now an accounting professor at the University of Georgia, praised the Coke move. "It's about time," he said. "My hope is others will follow."
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who led the opposition to Mr. Lieberman's resolution in 1994, will seek today to attach an amendment to the pending accounting bill that would call on the standards board to reconsider the decision to permit companies to avoid treating options as an expense. It is a measure of how corporate scandals changed the political landscape that Mr. Levin thinks he can win a vote today if one is held. But Senate rules permit any senator to block a vote.
President Bush has announced he opposes requiring the reporting of options as expenses, but Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has said they should be expenses.
Under the 1994 rule, the accounting board stated that reporting the value of options as an expense was preferable, but that companies could choose to disclose their value only in footnotes to their annual report. Virtually all companies chose that course, although Boeing and Winn-Dixie Stores chose to report them as expenses.
Last week, a real estate investment trust, the AMB Property Corporation, based in San Francisco, announced that it would begin reporting options as expenses.
Two factors have reopened the option debate in the past year. First, the International Accounting Standards Board, which is seeking to develop global rules, is expected to support reporting options as expenses.
But more important was the reaction to growing corporate scandals. If the old public image of options was of secretaries becoming millionaires through them, the new one is of Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's two top officers, making hundreds of millions by cashing in options when the company was filing false profit reports.
"When the Enron scandal first hit, I thought it was going to be an isolated incident," Mr. Fayard said, "and then every time you pick up the paper and you turn on the television news there's another restatement or another accounting scandal."
During the bull market, most investors and analysts were happy to ignore the cost of options. But this year, Standard & Poor's announced that in computing the profits of companies in its indexes, it would treat the value of options as an expense.
Analysts praised Coke's move yesterday. "Mr. Daft is taking a leadership position as a corporation that's well known and is attempting to be out in front and be as accurate as he can in the issue of corporate compensation," said Andrew Conway of Credit Suisse First Boston.
Stock options normally allow a recipient to buy stock at a fixed price, usually the market price when the option is granted, for up to 10 years. 
Advocates have long argued that options align the interests of recipients with those of the shareholders. But that is not completely true, since option holders do not lose money if the stock falls. In fact, a temporary fall in the stock price can be to their advantage, since some companies then reprice options, permitting them to be exercised at a lower price. That increases the profits for option holders if the stock recovers.
To many accountants, options are obviously part of employee compensation, just like salaries and bonuses, and therefore should be treated as a compensation expense. But there has not been as much agreement on when the expense should be recognized, or how it should be measured. Coke appears to have broken new ground on the valuation question.
Measuring the expense when options are granted makes sense because that is when employees performed the work for which they are being compensated. But that is also when the eventual value of the option is least clear. Some options will end up being very valuable, while others will expire worthless.
Opponents of treating options as expenses say that no cash changes hands when options are granted, and that the value of the options cannot be calculated with precision. But proponents say that the options are clearly valuable, and note that when a company grants stock to an executive, everyone agrees on the value of the stock, even though the executive may realize more or less money when the stock is eventually sold.
Coca-Cola said yesterday that it would set the value of the options by asking investment banks to submit firm bids to buy or sell options under the identical terms of the options being granted. It will then average those prices.
Mr. Buffett, who was given credit by Mr. Fayard for suggesting seeking those bids, said he was confident those values would be fair because any investment bank that submitted prices too high or too low would run the risk of Coke forcing the bank to buy or sell options at those unreasonable prices.
That method of valuation differs from the one used by Boeing and Winn-Dixie. They estimate the value using an options pricing model known as Black-Scholes. Critics of options as expenses have long said that model is not reliable. Mr. Buffett said he thought that by seeking bids, Coke would assure that its valuation was fair.
Mr. Beresford, the former chief of the accounting board, also praised this approach. "This is really going for a market-based price," he said.
The immediate earnings impact on Coke will be small, perhaps a penny a share this year, because it will not be reporting as expenses the options issued in previous years, and because it issues options late in the year. Options granted this year will be charged to expenses over the next several years, as the options become vested, meaning that employees may exercise them.
Mr. Fayard said that by 2006, when the new accounting is fully phased in, the impact should be about 9 cents to 10 cents per share. 
Previously, Coke estimated the value of options, for its footnote disclosure, based on the Black-Scholes model. In 2001, it said, its annual profit of $3.97 billion, or $1.60 a share, would have been cut to $3.77 billion, or $1.51 per share, had it reported the options as expenses.

HEADLINE: Michigan Senator Who Ran on Drug Issue Will Lead Democrats in Debate 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
When the Senate begins a two-week debate on prescription drugs on Monday, Senator Debbie Stabenow will be at the center of the action, leading Democratic efforts to provide Medicare drug benefits and rein in pharmaceutical costs.
 Ms. Stabenow, a lifelong resident of Michigan, personifies the political power of the issue. She rode it to victory in 2000, and many other Democrats hope to do so this fall. 
 More significant for consumers, and more ominous for the brand-name drug industry, is the fact that Ms. Stabenow also symbolizes a change in Congressional attitudes. Growing numbers of lawmakers say they are willing to use the power of the government to make drugs available at more affordable prices. 
Ms. Stabenow was named several months ago by the majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, to head the Democrats' prescription drug task force, a "message team" that would harp on the issue, giving voice to voters' frustration over drug prices, while assembling data to rebut arguments by drug manufacturers. 
"We have an industry that is the most profitable in the world," Ms. Stabenow said. "And I don't begrudge that in any way. But when an industry is allowed to make 18 to 20 percent a year, at the same time it's raising prices three times the rate of inflation, and people who need life-saving medicine cannot afford it, I think it's time to ask where the corporate responsibility is." 
The pharmaceutical industry topped the Fortune 500 list of the most profitable industries, providing investors with an 18.5 percent return on revenues last year. But many drug companies report sagging profits this year. 
The bill before the Senate would expand access to low-cost generic medicines, deemed by the government to be just as safe and effective as brand-name drugs. Senators plan to offer amendments to add drug benefits to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for 40 million people who are elderly or disabled. The Senate will also vote on proposals to allow commercial imports of prescription drugs from Canada, where government regulation often keeps prices lower than in the United States. 
Ms. Stabenow's populist crusade disturbs drug industry executives, who dispute her assertion that they spend more on marketing and advertising than on research. 
"We admire Senator Stabenow's energy, but believe she puts politics ahead of good public policy," said Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. "The proposals she promotes are shortsighted, misguided and potentially dangerous for American patients." 
Brand-name drug makers oppose the bill to speed the marketing of generic drugs. They say it would undermine patent protections, reducing incentives for the discovery of new treatments beneficial to patients. Generic competition often causes precipitous drops in sales of brand-name products. 
Drug companies also oppose efforts to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. Inevitably, they say, such imports will include products that are counterfeit, contaminated, adulterated or misbranded. 
The first bill introduced in the Senate by Ms. Stabenow, in January 2001, was a bill to permit imports of prescription drugs. "Keeping the Canadian border closed is an obstacle to competition and is serving to maintain artificially high prices for drugs in the United States," she said. 
Although Ms. Stabenow has spoken to Mr. Holmer and other drug company representatives, she said: "I've gotten more and more frustrated because they fight everything. I would love to find a way to work together on something meaningful. But they have the financial capacity, and a financial incentive, to fight everything, because so much money is at stake." 
Mr. Holmer said that the drug industry favored Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, "offered through competing private insurance plans that rely on marketplace competition to control costs." 
Ms. Stabenow said such coverage would be unreliable and unstable, like the coverage provided by health maintenance organizations. Many H.M.O.'s have found federal payments inadequate and pulled out of Medicare, dropping 2.2 million beneficiaries since 1998. 
Senator Stabenow (pronounced STAB-uh-now), 52, speaks with a quiet intensity.
"When you talk to her about something that is causing you pain, it almost seems to affect her breathing," said Richard T. Cole, senior vice president at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, who has known Ms. Stabenow for more than 25 years. 
In 1974, at the age of 24, Ms. Stabenow ran against a local official who was trying to close a county nursing home with many low-income residents near Lansing, Mich. "I ran against my county commissioner, who referred to me as 'that young broad,' and I beat him," Ms. Stabenow said. "That's really what got me into politics. I've been involved in health care and mental health care ever since." 
In 2000, she narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican senator, Spencer Abraham, even though he spent nearly 60 percent more than she did. 
"The drug companies did everything humanly possible to stop me from winning my election," Ms. Stabenow said. "They spent millions of dollars in my race. In the last three weeks, they gave money to the Chamber of Commerce to run ads against me. They threw everything at me, including the kitchen sink, but the public stood with me."

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
Minus One, Bush Inner Circle Is Now Open for Sharp Angling

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14 

 BODY:
President Bush lost one of his closest and most important advisers last Tuesday evening when Karen P. Hughes put her golden retriever and her most precious presidential mementos into her Mazda and headed back to the life she had missed in Texas.
 But by the time she made it to Tuscaloosa, Ala., early on Thursday, she had spoken twice on her cellphone from her car to the boss she was leaving behind, a president who was having one of his rockier weeks. 
 First they discussed the mixed reaction to his speech slamming corrupt corporate executives, which she reassured him had been well received in the Econo Lodges along America's highways. Then they moved on to longer-range planning.
"We talked about the fall, and a couple of issues he wanted me to think about," Ms. Hughes reported that evening, just after crossing the Texas state line. 
Yet for all her cheery insistence that she remains an important influence at the White House, she has chosen a bad moment to leave Mr. Bush's inner circle. He watched the markets tumble after giving a speech meant to soothe investors, then was bombarded by questions about his own stock dealings and company loans. The departure of Ms. Hughes, 45, who announced in the spring that she would move back to Austin with her homesick husband and teenage son, meant that a president who relies heavily on a powerful and close-knit staff instead had one in major transition at a tense time.
Republicans express concern about how effectively that circle of confidants will now serve Mr. Bush, even as Ms. Hughes continues to advise from a distance. Already there is talk that Karl Rove, the feared and canny political adviser who tends to the president's conservative base, will fill the void left by the more moderate Ms. Hughes and make the White House harder-edged and more politically aggressive.
Few of the advisers who remained behind are as trusted by the president as Ms. Hughes, who had a conversation with him barely 12 hours after she left Washington. Mr. Rove is the master of the political universe, Andrew H. Card Jr. is the organized and disciplined chief of staff, Ari Fleischer is the daily voice at press briefings, and Dan Bartlett is a fresh face in Ms. Hughes's old office whose advice is already influencing significant decisions. But not one is a stand-in for a woman who can hold the president's hand or tell him he is completely wrong. 
Even Mr. Card, in an interview in Esquire, called Mr. Rove a "formidable adversary" and fretted that with Ms. Hughes gone the delicate balance on the staff would be lost and there would be no one to stand up to Mr. Rove. Mr. Rove dismissed such talk last week and asserted that his influence had not grown. "I think my role has remained pretty much what it has been from the start," he said. He also denied any political differences with Ms. Hughes. "Karen and I are ideologically about two degrees apart, and it would be hard to tell who is left of the other," he said.
Republicans now say that Mr. Card himself toyed with leaving the White House this spring but that Vice President Dick Cheney was one of those who persuaded him to stay. As it is, many Republicans do not see Mr. Card as tough enough for Mr. Rove. Neither do they have faith that Ms. Hughes's successor, Mr. Bartlett, a savvy 31-year-old former president of the Future Farmers of America, will have the gravitas to balance out Mr. Rove, even though Mr. Bartlett is close to the president. Mr. Bartlett, the White House communications director, is a Texan who got his job in Mr. Bush's 1994 Texas governor's campaign from Mr. Rove. He remains a Rove loyalist.
But it may have been a sign of things to come that it was Mr. Bartlett who took a call early last Monday from Mr. Bush, who was at that point undecided about whether to have a news conference later that day to face reporters clamoring for answers about his stock dealings.
"What's the thinking down there?" Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush asked from his parents' summer home in Kennebunkport, Me., where the president had just come in from a dawn golf game with his father. 
"I think we ought to go ahead with it," Mr. Bartlett had replied. A week earlier, before accounts of Mr. Bush's 1990 sale of Harken Energy stock had resurfaced, Ms. Hughes and Mr. Fleischer had decided that Mr. Bush should have a news conference to urge Congress to move on his domestic agenda. By Monday, even though they knew that the press would focus on Harken, they decided that it was better for Mr. Bush to absorb one day of heat rather than a week of news reports about his refusal to answer questions.
"It gave us an opportunity for the press to take its best whack at it," Mr. Bartlett said. Although Mr. Bush's performance -- including his statement that accounting is not "black and white" -- may have ignited more questions than it extinguished, Mr. Bartlett asserted that he was pleased, as was the president.
"That was actually fun," Mr. Bartlett quoted the president as saying after the news conference. Mr. Bartlett asked Mr. Bush if he was being sarcastic, but Mr. Bush insisted not.
Mr. Bartlett could not say there was a lot of fun in the rest of his week, when he ran damage control for the stock sale and Mr. Bush's low-interest loans in the late 1980's from Harken, when Mr. Bush was on the Harken board of directors. 
While Ms. Hughes was making her way across the country with her dog, Breeze, in the passenger seat and her husband, Jerry, driving along in the couple's other car, Mr. Bartlett was telling reporters that Mr. Bush was not hypocritical when in his speech he called for an end to the type of insider loans he had received. Mr. Bartlett said that such loans had been properly used by many companies to encourage long-term share ownership but that in some recent cases they had been abused.
It was a job, Mr. Bartlett said, for which he was uniquely qualified, since he had so often defended the president when the same charges surfaced in previous campaigns. "Look, these issues come up ad nauseam," Mr. Bartlett said, adding that he and the president knew the lingo. "It's almost in code, the two of us have talked about it so much."
On Monday, he is to move from his cramped West Wing quarters into Ms. Hughes's large corner office, with its view of the Truman balcony. (He will not get her title, counselor to the president; that is being retired.)
Last week, as Mr. Bartlett talked to a reporter in Ms. Hughes's abandoned space, he said it had not sunk in that she was gone. "But every time I see the empty office, it does hit me," he said. On Monday, he will take her place on the Oval Office sofa that is closest to the president's chair for the 9:45 a.m. communications meeting. Mr. Bartlett, like 10 or so others on the senior staff, also has Oval Office walk-in rights. 
For now, the White House is putting the best face on the departure of Ms. Hughes, the president's alter ego. (In 1998, when he told Ms. Hughes of his ambitions for the White House, he said, "If you have any doubts about this, we need to talk about it right now, because I'm not doing this unless you're coming with me.") Staff members say that they will just have to dial 512, the Austin area code, more often, and that Ms. Hughes, who has a contract with the Republican National Committee, will remain a crucial Bush adviser. 
Mr. Rove, who spoke to Ms. Hughes by phone up to 20 times a day, said that the new era would be more like the presidential campaign, when he and Ms. Hughes communicated between the Bush campaign plane and headquarters. Others on the staff say that Mr. Bush will demand Ms. Hughes's input. "He will say in every case, 'What does Karen think?' " said Mary J. Matalin, a senior adviser to Mr. Cheney. "And someone will have to talk to Karen." 
Ms. Hughes said she would be at the president's side next month for his break at his ranch, and she was already planning his speech to mark the year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. She will have a major hand in all his big speeches, she said, and will travel regularly to Washington.
So when she last saw the president, on Monday night at the White House, there was no tearful parting. "I guess this is your last day," Ms. Hughes said the president told her. "But remember, you're not leaving."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The White House Memo column on Monday, about the workings of President Bush's inner circle after the resignation of his adviser Karen P. Hughes, reported that Andrew H. Card Jr., the president's chief of staff, had considered leaving the White House but that Vice President Dick Cheney helped persuade him to stay. The article should have carried a response from the White House. 
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Card and Mr. Cheney dispute the report. "Andy did not toy with leaving the White House," Mr. Fleischer said, "and he had no discussions with the vice president about it. So he was not persuaded to stay."

HEADLINE: They've Seen the Future and Intend to Live It 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE SCHECHTER 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Dr. Ralph C. Merkle is celebrated as an inventor of the encryption technology that allows secure transactions over the Internet. But that was a long time ago. These days, he is better known as a leading theorist of molecular nanotechnology, the still unperfected art of building machines that are little bigger than atoms.
 On a recent morning in a hotel auditorium in Palo Alto, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley, Dr. Merkle addressed a singular mixture of scientists and engineers, venture capitalists, economists, students of policy and even a poet or two. 
 All were members of the Foresight Institute, an organization founded on the belief that nanotechnology will transform almost every facet of human existence by giving people mastery over matter.
Nanofactories will churn out everything from rocking chairs to rocket ships, superior to any ever made, at "the cost of potatoes and wood," in Dr. Merkle's words. Nanocomputers will interface directly with the brain, vastly increasing human intelligence. And nanobots will cruise through bloodstreams, banishing disease and debility.
Many in the audience said they believed all that -- and believed that it would happen in their lifetimes. As a consequence, their lives would never end -- at least, not until the universe itself winds down or recollapses in a big crunch. So when Dr. Merkle asked, "How many of you take a personal interest in cosmology and the heat death of the universe?" many hands shot up.
Nanotechnology is a very active field, pursued by researchers around the world in government, corporate and academic laboratories.
The National Science Foundation's National Nanotechnology Initiative has spent more than $600 million in the last year, though most of that is not for research on the technologies envisioned by the Foresight group but for studying the basic science of matter at the atomic level and discovering how to trick simple molecules into assembling themselves into useful structures.
The first fruits of these efforts are emerging in products like pants woven from nanofibers that resist stains, tennis balls that keep their bounce and more efficient light-emitting diodes.
On the horizon are faster, smaller computers built from atomic-scaled carbon tubes, ultrastrong cables that could be used to build an elevator into space, better drug-delivery systems and much more.
The Foresighters applaud such work. But they have a far more expansive vision of the future, based on atomic-scaled machines called assemblers. The assemblers would have tiny arms that could pick up individual atoms and stick them together like Tinkertoys. In this way an assembler could build virtually anything, atom by atom, including a copy of itself. One microbe-sized assembler could become two, then four, then eight, and before long a vast colony. A signal would then turn them from cloning themselves to making, say, dining-room furniture or supercomputers.
If this sounds far-fetched, the proponents say, consider the lilies of the field. They toil not, nor do they spin, yet molecular machinery in their cells transforms air, water and soil into all their glorious garments.
The term nanotechnology was introduced in the early 1980's by K. Eric Drexler, then a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In his 1986 book, "Engines of Creation," Dr. Drexler popularized his ideas by presenting a vision of the future of material plenty and physical well-being made possible by armies of invisible machines. He also laid out the dangers inherent in this technology, envisioning a nightmare of self-reproducing nanobots run amok, a "gray goo" that would consume everything.
Dr. Drexler and many scientists and engineers who have read his work say they believe such technology is not only possible but more or less inevitable. And once it occurs, they say, it will spread with incredible rapidity. In 1989 Dr. Drexler founded the Foresight Institute to "help prepare society for anticipated advanced technologies."
Every year the institute's senior associates (as members call themselves) gather for a weekend of prognostication, planning and hand-wringing over the future. It is a diverse group of smart and articulate people, many of whom have made their fortunes in the computer industry and have the leisure to think about the future.
Transcending the human body -- fallible, feeble and finite -- seems to be most on their minds. Around the wrists of many of the hands that shot up when Dr. Merkle asked his cosmological question were silver bracelets with instructions on what to do if the wearer is found dead.
After they die (if they do), many senior associates plan to have their bodies or heads frozen in liquid nitrogen until the day they can be resurrected, either into flesh or silicon, by a herd of nanobots. (Dr. Merkle is a member of the board of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation of Scottsdale, Ariz., the organization that is freezing the body of the baseball slugger Ted Williams at the request of his son.)
For those who manage to avoid death for long enough, there is the hope of having nanobots circulate in their bloodstreams to fight disease.
Chris Phoenix, a software developer and would-be nanotechnologist, has drawn up intricate plans for a system of nanobots that would make blood circulation obsolete. Tiny robot tankers containing oxygen, nutrients and wastes would replace all the functions of the circulatory system. The heart, that great, clunky pump, would no longer beat. Mr. Phoenix would not miss it. "Personally, I'd rather not have a heartbeat," he said. "The noise in my ears keeps me up when I try to go to sleep."
Ray Kurzweil, the enormously successful inventor of reading machines for the blind, electronic pianos and many other useful gadgets, does not expect to die. A member of Foresight's board, Mr. Kurzweil presented the conference with graph after graph that he said demonstrated that the rate of technological progress was exploding.
"The 21st century will see 20,000 years of progress at today's rate," he said, adding that computers and humans will merge, producing a being of almost unlimited intelligence.
Dr. Gregory Stock, director of the Program on Medicine, Technology and Society at the University of California at Los Angeles, presented a very different vision of the future of humanity. Dr. Stock does not believe that the merging of humans and machines will be easy, and he doubts that most people will go for it.
"I'm the conservative, because I think we're going to remain largely biological," he said. "I'm not going to go through a brain operation to install the moral equivalent of a programmable toaster."
The world view of the Foresight Institute, Dr. Stock says, reflects an unexpected spiritual longing -- a "strange urge in us to transcend our biology."
"If you can't buy Christianity," he said, "there is a strong desire to create those same visions of heaven and transcendence through our technologies."

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; 
The Urgent Search for an AIDS Plan

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. 

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 14 

 BODY:
In theory, AIDS is preventable and treatable. But in reality, AIDS has spread so rapidly it rivals the worst epidemics in history.
 AIDS has killed more than 20 million people since 1981, when the first cases were discovered in the United States. Today, 40 million people live with H.I.V., the AIDS virus, and most are doomed to die for lack of the powerful combinations of drugs that can control the infection. And because these people lack access to the blood test that can tell if they are H.I.V. infected, they may unwittingly transmit the virus to another 45 million people by 2010. 
 The magnitude of the epidemic is a tragedy that speakers at the 14th International AIDS Conference held here last week attributed directly to the failure to make effective preventions and treatments available to vast populations in Africa and elsewhere. 
The preventions include relatively inexpensive and simple measures: disease information, sex education, safe sex, condoms, needle exchange programs and blood tests.
Treatments include drugs to counter H.I.V. and the unusual infections that accompany AIDS. Lack of anti-H.I.V. therapy has orphaned at least 11 million children.
"That is why treatment is so important in developing countries," said Dr. Peter Piot, the under secretary general of the United Nations in charge of its AIDS program.
A solution to better control the epidemic, AIDS experts and economists said, is to spend $10 billion a year, largely from donations from rich countries.
But what is the most effective way to spend it? Preventing more people from becoming infected? Or treating those who are infected?
Some AIDS experts had expected vested interest groups at the conference to bitterly debate the priorities. But if the rhetoric from the 17,000 participants from 124 countries at the largest AIDS conference ever held is a valid indicator, there was an overwhelming consensus for supporting prevention and treatment because one cannot work without the other.
"The issue has been widely discussed, and common sense and basic health principles say both need to go together," said Dr. Jordi Casabona, an infectious-disease expert in Barcelona and a co-president of the conference.
Without a vaccine, few epidemics can be controlled by treatment or prevention alone, Dr. Casabona said at the closing news conference.
"The conflict between prevention and treatment has been blown out of proportion," said Dr. Merle A. Sande, an AIDS expert at the University of Utah.
"Most everyone involved in treating AIDS believes that prevention is more important yet feels that the millions of infected people deserve therapy," said Dr. Sande, who resigned as chairman of medicine at the University of Utah to commute to Uganda from Salt Lake City to direct the Academic Alliance for AIDS Care and Prevention in Africa. Pfizer has given a large grant to the alliance, which teaches African doctors how to use the powerful combinations of anti-H.I.V. drugs.
However, Dr. Julio Frenk, the Mexican health minister, introduced a cautionary note by urging participants to do further research to determine what programs work or fail.
"Just as we don't have enough evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of prevention programs, we don't fully know how to allocate resources among interventions in the most efficient manner," Dr. Frenk said.
With action needed before definitive answers are in, the United Nations is set to issue a plan of attack for the October meeting of the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. With about $3 billion of its $10 billion goal in hand, it is unclear whether this will be sufficient to support a comprehensive prevention and treatment strategy. So supporters of each are likely to lobby and compete for the available money, just as scientists have long done in seeking grants from the government and private foundations.
The world lost valuable time in controlling AIDS when the epidemic was much smaller. It was a time when experts pinned their hopes on quick development of a vaccine instead of aggressive, large campaigns to stress other prevention measures like H.I.V. testing, safe sex and condom use.
Political leaders contributed to the delay. Bill Clinton said in an interview here that he regretted not having done more to control AIDS while he was president and that he was wrong not to push harder for needle-exchange programs to prevent transmission among injecting drug users and then to their sexual partners. Former presidents rarely make such admissions, particularly so soon after leaving office.
Drug users are fueling the initial stages of epidemics in many countries, including those of the former Soviet Union.
The delay in not responding more effectively and earlier to the AIDS epidemic now makes prevention and treatment even more challenging because of the magnitude of the epidemic.
"We have known what works" in preventing AIDS for several years but it did not get translated into enough action, said Dr. Helene Gayle, who headed the AIDS program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and now is on loan to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
In a report sponsored by her foundation and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, Dr. Gayle and more than 30 other experts wrote:
"Effective H.I.V. prevention is more than education, and more than a condom, a clean needle or any other single commodity. Effective H.I.V. prevention involves a thoughtful, planned combination of interventions and policies that work synergistically to reduce overall rates of transmission."
People at high risk for AIDS need to know what causes it and how to avoid it. But "it is staggering how much people still don't know" about AIDS in China, India and the former Soviet Union, where H.I.V. is being transmitted at alarming rates, Mr. Clinton said.
"One of the things that I have been a little concerned about is that they have put too much emphasis on getting the public health network pieces up, which is good, but relatively too little on just putting the stuff out there through the airways and watching the grass-roots people change their behavior," Mr. Clinton said.
In the former Soviet Union, where H.I.V. is being spread through heterosexual sex, Mr. Clinton said, "the extent to which young girls are still engaging in dangerous behavior either because they are constrained to it or think it is their only way out of abject poverty in that part of the world is chilling."
Still, experts say they have much to learn about what messages to send to those at the highest risk of infection.
In the epidemic's infancy, when 150,000 Americans were acquiring H.I.V. each year, most infected people were gay white men. The new face of AIDS in the United States now is largely female and black, as it is elsewhere.
The 40,000 Americans who have become infected in each of recent years is fewer than the 150,000 infected annually in the mid-1980's, but remains far too high and requires delivering new prevention messages in new ways, health officials said.
To make therapy more effective in the third world, C.D.C. researchers have developed less costly versions of two tests commonly used to determine when to start anti-H.I.V. drugs and to monitor their effectiveness. One is a new method to monitor, at one-fourth the cost of the standard tests, the number of the CD-4 immune cells in the blood that the AIDS virus destroys. The second is a new way to monitor the amount of H.I.V. in the blood at one-fifth the cost of standard tests.
The ideal prevention would be a vaccine that prevents nearly all recipients from becoming infected and unable to transmit the infectious agent to other people. But no such vaccine exists for AIDS and none is likely to be available for several years, if one is ever developed, experts said.
Dr. Lawrence Corey, a vaccine researcher at the University of Washington, said at the conference that there were hints from early studies that the newest experimental AIDS vaccines might lower the amount of H.I.V. in the blood to slow the progression of infection to illness and modify symptoms but not prevent transmission.
It will take years to do the trials to learn whether the experimental vaccines could prevent transmission of H.I.V. and how long they would work. "This is the deck we may be dealt," Dr. Corey said in urging policy makers to start thinking about how to put them in place in the event they are licensed.
Another reason for linking prevention and drug therapy is that studies have shown that lowering the amount of H.I.V. in the blood reduces the risk of its transmission to other people.
But the risk is not zero, a finding that tells health officials they need to bolster anti-H.I.V. treatment efforts with messages to prevent a mistaken belief among patients that they can abandon safe sex practices.
Studies have shown that anti-H.I.V. therapy needs to be taken for a lifetime because the drugs cannot rid the body of the virus. And because H.I.V. has increasingly developed resistance to the drugs, the International AIDS Society, a conference sponsor, and the World Health Organization announced that they were developing a program to monitor H.I.V. drug resistance throughout the world.
Experts say they are uncertain how often resistance makes therapy ineffective. Whatever the frequency, Dr. Stefano Vella, the outgoing president of the International AIDS Society, Dr. Scott M. Hammer, an AIDS expert at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, and other leaders cautioned against using resistance as an excuse for not offering treatment in the third world.
At a panel sponsored by the International AIDS Trust, a number of current and former heads of state pledged to encourage more political leaders to speak out on AIDS by fighting denial, discrimination and stigmas and to replace rhetoric with action.
Ali Hassan Mwinyi, a former president of Tanzania, recalled that when AIDS first appeared in his country "it caused panic, confusion and denial among all of us because we all were sexually active."
Leaders are now duty-bound to fight the confusion and educate their people, Mr. Mwinyi said, and "a leader who speaks about condoms will influence people to use condoms."
In underscoring the importance of accountability, Dr. Piot, the United Nations official, said voters should replace the world's political leaders who do not provide what is needed to combat AIDS.

HEADLINE: State of Emergency in Paraguay; 1 Dies in Unrest Over Economy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: ASUNCION, Paraguay, July 15 

 BODY:
Paraguay's president decreed a state of emergency today, suspending some civil rights after one man died and six people were seriously injured in nationwide protests against the government's economic policies.
 Police officers wielding riot sticks battled with hundreds of protesters who blockaded roads across the South American nation, which has been frequently rocked by political instability since democracy was restored in 1989 after 35 years of military dictatorship. Dozens of people were hurt in the demonstrations. 
 A protester was killed at a roadblock outside Ciudad del Este, about 200 miles east of Asuncion, the capital.. The police said that the protester opened fire on the police and that they shot back at him.
President Luis Gonzalez Macchi's government blamed followers of Gen. Lino Oviedo, a suspect in three failed coups, for the protests. General Oviedo, who is living in asylum in Brazil, denied he was involved.
The state of emergency allows the government to ban demonstrations, search homes and make arrests over the next five days. It also permits the armed forces to quell protests.
Buffeted by neighboring Argentina's economic crisis and Brazil's slumping currency, the California-sized nation devalued its currency this year, adding to the woes of an economy stagnant since 1995.
The riots were the latest in often-violent protests against the free-market policies of a government that has already been forced to backtrack on its privatization plans. 
Four people, including an 11-year-old, were treated for bullet wounds after one clash between 800 protesters and the police in Ciudad del Este. 
"We came here to say we're tired of so much corruption and poverty," said one protester outside Congress in Asuncion, where another 600 protesters demonstrated. "We want this useless president to resign."
Many of Paraguay's 5.7 million people live in poverty, as subsistence farmers without land of their own.

HEADLINE: Gator Loses a Round to Web Sites in Fight Over Pop-Up Ads 

BYLINE:  By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
The Gator Corporation appears to have lost the first round in its fight against 10 Web site publishers who sued the company last month, saying that its use of online pop-up advertisements violated copyright and trademark laws.
 Judge Claude M. Hilton of the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia said on Friday that he would issue a preliminary injunction against Gator. The judge did not offer specifics about the terms of the injunction, but both parties expect him to bar Gator from displaying ads on the plaintiffs' Web sites until the trial is finished. The publishers include The New York Times Company, the Gannett Company and the Washington Post Company. 
 Gator's software permits users to fill out password and shipping information in an online form and use it as a shortcut when they visit different e-commerce Web sites. But Gator also uses the information gathered from users to display pop-up ads over Web sites without the publishers' permission.
In court Friday, Judge Hilton said that he found enough evidence to support the plaintiffs' claim that Gator's advertisements violated trademark laws in particular, according to court transcripts. He did not elaborate on his decision, but during the hearing, he indicated that one issue was the proximity of Gator's pop-up ads to the publishers' trademarks.
"Maybe that's the problem," Judge Hilton told Gator's lawyers. He went on to suggest a possible solution, saying Gator could employ technology that would display a Web site, then an ad, then return to a Web site in sequence. "But you wouldn't have your message there under somebody else's mark," he said.
Gator's lawyers have asserted that their client's service is similar to instant-messaging software, which users download with the understanding that messages will pop up over whatever page they may be viewing at the time.
Gator executives have also pointed out that The New York Times paid to have pop-up ads appear over The Wall Street Journal's Web site when Gator users visited that site last year.
Toby Usnik, a Times spokesman, declined to comment, but in court papers filed by The Times, the company said it had hired an advertising agency, which paid Gator to place ads on The Times's behalf. When The Times discovered early this year that its ads were appearing over sites without the publishers' permission, the company halted the Gator campaign, according to court papers.
After Judge Hilton's ruling, Gator asked the court to expedite the trial, presumably to limit lost revenues. But Jeff McFadden, Gator's chief executive, said yesterday that "less than one-third of 1 percent" of the company's ads were placed over the plaintiffs' sites, so the economic effects of the preliminary injunction would not be serious.
Terence Ross, a lawyer for the publishers, said he would welcome a speedy trial. He said he expected the trial to begin in October if Judge Hilton opted for an expedited trial, and late November if he did not.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD; 
A Business Changed, Perh aps Permanently

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
THE Salt Lake Tribune had one of those big bold front-page headlines you sometimes see in movies.
 "Record Heat Sizzles State," it cried, and the crowd of about 1,000 people gathered for a reception in a downtown plaza that remained sunny and very hot even at 8 p.m. was plenty thirsty. 
 This being a festive crowd of travel-industry executives and corporate travel managers in town for the annual convention and trade show of the National Business Travel Association, lemonade was not the beverage of choice. In a state where jokers say it's easier to buy a firearm than a gin and tonic, the booze was flowing impressively behind the guarded perimeter of the plaza. 
"This sure is one very happy crowd," said a frazzled young woman tending bar at a drink tent where the lines were 12 deep.
It seemed to be a far merrier crowd, in fact, than the one in attendance last summer during the same organization's trade show in Atlanta. Then, even before the catastrophe of Sept. 11, the business-travel industry was staggered, demoralized and bewildered after a souring economy slammed the brakes on freewheeling spending for business travel.
"I think the industry had its hard landing last year," said Allison Marble, a spokeswoman for the business travel group. Now, she and others said, as the industry regains its footing, business travelers and corporate travel managers appear to be emerging from the gloom, blinking at the light and contemplating an entirely new environment. Virtually everything about business travel, from the buying behavior of the consumers to the fundamental business models of the airlines, hotels and other suppliers, has changed, probably permanently.
The major airlines, losing billions with no realistic turnaround in sight, are facing the most difficult choices. No one I spoke to among the 4,200 people attending the trade show here expressed any faith that the airline industry's fare structures -- which depend on business travelers' paying fares that can be five times as much as those for the leisure-travel market -- can even survive the year.
"Even as people who run those airlines cut out restrictions on business fares and do everything they can to get that market back, I think they finally realize that business travelers' behavior has changed, and it just won't change back," said Krista M. Pappas, the senior vice president for strategic development at FareChase Inc.
It is no longer a debatable point that large numbers of business travelers are now flying on fares the airlines intended for leisure travelers. Now, with the financial collapse of one or more major airlines no longer an unlikely possibility, those airlines still appear to be dithering and fiddling with selected fare discounts and selected easing of restrictions, while stubbornly clinging to bedrock fare structures with the futile tenacity of the defenders of the Maginot Line in 1940.
The major airlines have steadfastly insisted that the business traveler has merely cut back on trips, and will one day resume more frequent flying. However, industry professionals say a large and sharply growing number of business travelers have actually dropped from the radar simply because they have slipped into the cheap-fare world of the leisure-travel market. 
American Express officials noted yesterday that more than 40 percent of corporate tickets the company books now are so-called nonrefundables -- the cheaper, advance-purchase tickets that traditionally have been classified as leisure fares. Business fares are generally classified as full-price tickets that are fully refundable, with no restrictions like requirements for a Saturday night stay. Two years ago, only a quarter of corporate tickets were nonrefundables, said Nancy Carlin, an American Express vice president.
As major airlines scramble to fill seats at almost any price, even restrictions like the Saturday-stay requirement, intended to discourage business travelers from buying leisure fares, are fading on many routes. Often, she said, the only real restriction on a cheap advance-purchase ticket is its nonrefundability. An unused nonrefundable ticket may be reused on the same airline within one year, with a penalty fee of $75 or $100.
Because so many business travelers now use electronic ticketing, corporate travel managers worry about the tendency of employees to forget about those tickets, and let them expire, unused.
American Express said yesterday that it would soon introduce a new service, Ticket TRAX NR, that automates for company travel managers the cumbersome process of keeping track of unused nonrefundable tickets, and applies their value to future tickets.
American Express also announced a new centralized online booking tool called TravelBahn Portal, to gather on a single internal corporate site all air fares on the Web, while at the same time enabling company travel managers to compile the booking data they need to negotiate discounts effectively with airlines, hotels and other suppliers.
Ms. Pappas, meanwhile, said that her company was releasing today a new version of its Web Automation software that gathers on one portal the hundreds of thousands of ever-changing fares available on over 150 travel Web sites. She said that the vastness of fare information available online was having an impact on travel booking that was only beginning to be understood, even by industry professionals.
"There is almost no loyalty left" among customers to specific airlines, other than that bound by frequent-flier upgrades and schedule conveniences, she said. "Once the Internet took hold" the airlines' assumptions about the viability of their existing fare structures and customer bases "went to hell in a handbasket," she added.
"It's now sort of the Wild West" in the distribution of air fares, said Pam Arway, the executive vice president of American Express Corporate Travel in North America. As business travelers find their way in the new environment, it should not be hopelessly complicated to make the arrangements.
"You want to get from Point A to Point B," she said. "That should be easy."

HEADLINE: Complex Calculations on Academics 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG and DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
In the debate over Edison Schools, the educational management company that is about to take over 20 failing schools in Philadelphia, Edison's supporters and its opponents cite test scores and academic studies to bolster their arguments.
 Unfortunately, little of that evidence is as conclusive as it has been portrayed, making an evaluation of Edison's seven-year academic record far more difficult than tracking its plummeting stock price. 
 For its part, Edison has long used opinion surveys and test scores to make its case. 
Nearly 90 percent of parents with children in Edison-run schools, for example, gave their schools an A or B on a survey conducted for the company last year by Harris Interactive. By comparison, 68 percent of public school parents gave their schools the same high marks, according to a 2001 survey conducted by the Gallup Organization for Phi Delta Kappa International, a research group. 
Edison has also calculated that more than 80 percent of its schools have improved on standardized tests. By Edison's reckoning, the average gains at those schools are larger than those in schools in dozens of the nation's largest school districts.
"Any fair-minded person sitting down with our test scores and any other large district's test scores would rather have ours," said John E. Chubb, Edison's chief education officer.
But while Edison's simplified academic results have long reassured many investors and politicians, they have not satisfied some testing experts, who caution against making generalizations about the test scores of Edison's 75,000 students in 22 states. It is hard enough, they say, to evaluate students in one district using one standardized test.
"Is Edison any good?" asked Karen Bachofer, the assessment director for the San Diego public schools, which do not employ Edison. That question, Dr. Bachofer said, "seems very straightforward, but those of us who do it for a living know how tricky it is."
Perhaps Edison's most widely cited contention is that test scores at 84 percent of the schools that it began managing before 2001 are improving. To calculate that figure, Edison took the average annual change in test scores for each grade on each subject tested and arrived at a single schoolwide average. If the number was greater than zero, the company rated the school as improving, or "positive."
Dr. Bachofer is among those experts who called that approach generous, because large gains in one subject or grade might mask declines in several others.
"Any time you aggregate something down to a single number," she said, "the number loses its utility."
At the Schomburg Charter School in Jersey City, which Edison has managed since 2000, reading scores declined in the second, third and fourth grades when those students were compared with others nationally. The losses, were outweighed, however, by the fifth grade's 17-percentage point increase. 
Edison rated the school's performance as "positive."
The same formula produced similarly glowing results when applied, for example, to schools in the Cleveland school district, which has struggled academically in recent years. When asked by The New York Times to subject its test results over the last five years to Edison's method, Cleveland achieved comparable results: 87.4 percent of its elementary and middle schools rated "positive." (High schools were excluded because Edison mostly manages elementary and middle schools.)
"I have schools that look good by this metric that we're very worried about," said Peter Robertson, the Cleveland district's chief assessment officer.
Elementary and middle schools in the El Paso Independent School District in Texas, a similar district with no ties to Edison, also had similar results when the same standard was applied: 81 percent rated as improving.
Dr. Chubb of Edison acknowledged that reducing a school's performance to a single adjective was perhaps an oversimplification, but noted that many states, including California and Texas, had similar formulas for grading schools. "There's no one way to do it," he said.
H. Christopher Whittle, the company's chief executive, said: "The great majority of our schools are up in terms of their results. The question becomes, 'How much are they up in terms of other systems?' That is a complex issue."
One of the complexities of comparison is that Edison manages mostly low-performing schools, while other districts and states have a range of performances in their schools. Moreover, students in Edison schools start at such low levels that they are more likely to make larger gains than students at better schools.
Edison does indeed assert that its test scores are improving more quickly than those in dozens of large urban districts, including Cleveland and El Paso. This, too, involves a formula that is disputed by some experts.
To reach its conclusion, Edison first separated its own schools' test scores and those of the other districts into two main categories. The first were scores on so-called criterion-referenced tests, which establish a passing grade based on the number of questions answered correctly. The second were scores on norm-referenced tests, which rank students based on how they compare to others who took the test across the nation.
In the first category, Edison calculated that the percentage of its students who passed various criterion-referenced tests increased by an average of 5.7 percentage points annually for the seven years it has been operating.
Edison then calculated the other urban districts' annual increases using the districts' test data. It found that only 15 districts -- out of 41 examined -- had gains of three percentage points or more, and that none surpassed Edison.
In the second testing category, Edison determined that on norm-referenced tests, the scores of its students increased by an average of 4.7 percentage points each year. Here, Edison examined the publicly available test scores in 23 large districts and found that only 5 had average annual increases of more than two percentage points. None matched Edison's gains.
Again, Edison's analysis was troubling to testing officials who examined it at the request of The New York Times. For one thing, the officials said, in calculating the scores of its schools, Edison combined results on tests from different testing companies. 
"If you throw oranges and grapefruits and bananas and star fruit into a blender," said Mr. Robertson of Cleveland, "you've lost all ability to say whether it's fruit anymore."
Dr. Chubb, the Edison executive, disagreed, comparing the method with a high school calculating a student's grade point average by combining scores from different teachers who might not agree what constitutes an A or C. 
He added that Edison faced a challenge in trying to analyze the performance of students spread across 22 states, each with its own standards. "What we've done is perfectly reasonable," he said. "It's not like there's a canon to follow."
Edison's critics have relied on two main studies of its performance: one published in December 2000 by the Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, and the other conducted in the late 1990's by researchers at the Miami-Dade County public schools.
Each study generally found that students in Edison schools did not outperform those in more traditional schools. The authors of both studies acknowledge, however, that their conclusions are based on data from a limited number of schools -- 10 in the Western Michigan study, and only one in the Miami study.
In the end, those trying to judge whether an Edison education is worth its sometimes high price will have to wait at least two more years for a definitive study being conducted for Edison by the Rand Corporation, a public policy research organization. That study will compare thousands of Edison students with their counterparts at more traditional public schools.
"It's a little frustrating to me that we can't provide useful information earlier," a senior Rand researcher said. "Policy makers and the public have to make decisions about Edison today."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Some agencies are revving up so that they will be in gear when the market finally turns around.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott with Allison Fass 

 BODY:
AT a time when the Dow Jones industrial average is flirting with 8,000, it seems counterintuitive, to put it mildly, for agencies to hire senior managers for new posts, expand operations and undertake other initiatives meant to build business.
 But advertising is an industry that embraces the words of Nizan Guanaes, a leading Brazilian creative executive, who is fond of saying, "When it's raining, sell umbrellas." The perennial, perhaps even cockeyed, optimists on Madison Avenue -- like the ones at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, BBDO New York and DiNoto Lee -- say they sense opportunity in adversity and seek to position themselves for the upturn in ad spending they are expecting later this year. 
 "I'm very unhappy about the stock market, but you have to take the longer-term view," said Wendy Riches, who last week became president of Arc in New York, the newly consolidated marketing services division of D'Arcy, part of the Bcom3 Group. 
"In this environment, we need to give the clients ways to move the needle," Ms. Riches said. "We have to ask where do we want to be for 2005, 2010, rather than looking backward."
Arc -- for the middle three letters in D'Arcy -- includes agencies like Clarion Marketing and Communications in North America and IMP in Europe, which work for global clients like General Motors and Procter & Gamble. Arc has 700 employees in 19 countries, handling direct marketing, interactive marketing, promotions, database marketing and other assignments with billings estimated at $842 million.
"Now more than ever, we have to make the case as an industry that we're bringing added value to marketers in the form of new-business ideas," said Bill Katz, president and chief executive at the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. The BBDO division is bringing on a new top manager for the second time in a month.
"These are not good times for anyone, and we are not immune," Mr. Katz said. "But we advocate to clients that when the economy is down, you have to invest in your brand. How can we not do the same ourselves?"
BBDO New York, practicing what it preaches, has hired Brett Shevack for the new post of vice chairman for brand initiatives. Mr. Shevack, 52, had been president at the Wolf Group, which in 1998 acquired his agency in New York, Partners & Shevack.
At BBDO New York, Mr. Shevack will help packaged-goods clients like Bayer and Unilever develop consumer campaigns that extend beyond traditional advertising like television commercials and print ads into realms like sponsorships and promotions.
"These are ideas that clients need more and more," Mr. Katz said. "Brett is good for this because he's a creative director with a penchant for business." 
The hiring of Mr. Shevack came a month after Martyn Straw joined BBDO New York in the new post of chief strategy officer, from Interbrand in New York, the corporate- identity consulting company owned by Omnicom.
An agency far smaller than BBDO New York is also expanding the ranks of top management. DiNoto Lee, a creatively focused New York shop with billings estimated at $30 million, is hiring Brian Martin as president, a new post.
Mr. Martin, 42, becomes the third partner at DiNoto Lee, joining Greg DiNoto and Esther Lee. A decade ago, the three had all worked together at Deutsch.
"Despite what the market is doing, we still feel the pendulum is swinging back, and to smaller agencies," Mr. DiNoto said. "We are preparing for that right now by taking a look inside, at operations, and taking a look outside, at new-business opportunities, and those are two of Brian's strengths."
In addition to helping seek new clients, Mr. Martin will work on developing brand strategies for current clients like CMT, the country music television network that is part of the MTV Networks division of Viacom. Mr. Martin had most recently been managing partner and executive director for account services and business development at Bozell in New York, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Another Interpublic agency is expanding through an acquisition. Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston agreed to acquire the New York office of Frankfurt Balkind, which specializes in brand identity work. Terms were not disclosed. Frankfurt Balkind, which works for clients like Schering-Plough and Sony, will operate as a division of Hill, Holliday.
Aubrey Balkind, 58, president at Frankfurt Balkind, will be president of the division. The Los Angeles office of Frankfurt Balkind will be spun off and renamed Bemis Balkind; it will be owned by Mr. Balkind and Peter Bemis, 56, who is chief executive there. Hill, Holliday is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic.

HEADLINE: MEDICINE MERGER: THE IMPACT; 
New Jersey Waits for the Shoes to Drop

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
It would have been a fitting symbol of the growing dominance of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry in New Jersey. Workers were about to remove Golden Boy, a 16-ton bronze statue that symbolized the spirit of communication, from the front of the AT&T headquarters in Basking Ridge, after the campus was purchased in July by Pharmacia.
 But for now Golden Boy still stands, its fate unclear, after Pharmacia agreed on Monday to be bought by the world's largest drug company, Pfizer, for about $60 billion in stock. 
 Now, Pharmacia's plans to move 2,500 employees from its headquarters in Peapack are in doubt, as officials from the two companies work out what will happen to their combined work force of 150,000. 
The announcement of the deal has also left economists and real estate experts wondering whether the move will mean a net loss or gain for New Jersey, which is still climbing out of a recession and is becoming dependent on the pharmaceutical industry.
They fear that the consolidation of the two companies could mean a reduction of jobs, at least initially, as the new, larger company eliminates duplication of tasks. They also wonder whether the new company will occupy as much office space as the two independent companies did. They are especially curious about what will happen to the sprawling AT&T campus.
But over all, analysts and economists say that the acquisition, which involves two companies that already have a presence in the state, only bolsters New Jersey's growing reputation as the state with the highest concentration of pharmaceutical headquarters and research centers in the world.
"They like to be where their competitors and friends are," said Joe Gonzalez, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. "That's one of the things that keeps you going when you start to have concentration of an industry here, that they keep attracting each other here. This really is the medicine chest of the world."
The statistics speak for themselves. Nineteen of the world's largest pharmaceutical and medical technology companies have national or worldwide headquarters in New Jersey, including Pharmacia, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson and Schering-Plough.
The pharmaceutical industry here employs 50,000 people, and in 2000, companies based in New Jersey generated 41 percent of pharmaceutical sales worldwide.
Last year, 53 percent of the drugs receiving Food and Drug Administration approval were produced by New Jersey companies.
That's not all. The New Jersey Technology Council said that 11 percent of all government research and development dollars were spent in New Jersey and 25 percent of all private money, ranking the state 11th in the nation in attracting such money.
But the industry has been under pressure to lower prices, even as companies struggle to come up with products that will bring higher profits. Officials throughout the state, however, said that while it was too early to speculate about what the acquisition would mean in terms of jobs lost or offices closed, in the past New Jersey has not suffered deep job losses and the shutdown of related industries like restaurants and hotels. 
"To this point, with other mergers that have taken place, New Jersey has been a winner," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "Given the highly skilled labor force here, with so many people employed in pharmaceuticals, these companies like to cluster together so they can steal each other's employees."
Pfizer, the maker of Zoloft, the antidepressant; Lipitor, the most widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drug; and Viagra, is based in Manhattan, and expects to keep its headquarters there. The company has 90,000 employees.
Pharmacia, maker of Celebrex and Bextra, two popular arthritis drugs, and Nicorette gum had planned to move about 2,500 people from its Peapack headquarters to the AT&T center, along New Jersey's Route 202/206 corridor. The company has 59,600 employees.
But Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, Henry A. McKinnell, said that move had been halted by the purchase announcement.
Albert LiCata, mayor of Bernards Township, said the AT&T complex was the town's largest taxpayer.
"Obviously we were pretty nervous when AT&T threw in the towel and said they were selling the property," he said. "But lo and behold, Pharmacia stepped up to the plate. They found that everything we had to offer here, from our community to our infrastructure, was conducive to their doing business here. I can't see that Pfizer wouldn't find it just as attractive."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
TheDow Plunges 440 Points, Then Roars Back

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Stocks plunged yesterday, then recovered most of their losses, in a volatile trading session that offered scant comfort for investors hoping for an end to a bitter bear market.
 After falling 5 percent by midafternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the day down less than 1 percent. The Dow, which had been 440 points in the red just after 2:30 p.m., closed down 45.34 points, at 8,639.19. 
 The late-day rally appeared to be driven by traders looking for quick profits on stocks that had fallen too far, too fast, not by investors looking for companies to buy and hold. No economic report or corporate announcement caused the turn. Stocks simply began to rise even faster than they had fallen. 
Nevertheless, the turnaround offered some relief for Wall Street, which was facing its worst day since the panic selling of September. 
"I'm better at 4 than I was at 2," said Kevin Parke, chief investment officer at MFS Investment Management, a Boston mutual fund company that manages $123 billion. Mr. Parke said that after the trading session ended at 4 p.m., a trader at MFS told him that "it felt like the market was up 5 percent today."
But Mr. Parke and other professional investors were not willing to predict that the sharp turnaround signaled a market bottom. In recent months, stocks have had several sharp one-day recoveries, but each time the rallies have faded and the market has turned down again.
"It's unlikely that six months from now we'll be scratching our head and saying this was a huge buying opportunity," Mr. Parke said.
Brian Belski, fundamental market strategist at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said that the gains came after technical indicators, like the number of stocks rising compared with the number falling, fell to levels that showed that stocks were "oversold" and due for a short-term bounce. 
Mr. Belski said he thought stocks were cheap based on their fundamentals, like the outlook for profit growth, and that the S.& P. 500 would rise 20 percent or more by December. But he said he was not sure whether the afternoon rally would hold. "I'm cautious through the summer," he said.
A combination of long-simmering concerns drove the sell-off. Early yesterday morning, Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, said that it would buy the Pharmacia Corporation, another big drug company, for $60 billion in stock. The announcement led investors to worry that Pfizer was being forced to make an acquisition because its research pipeline of new drugs was weak. Pfizer ended the day down $3.42, or 10.6 percent, to $28.78, its lowest level in four years.
Later in the morning, the dollar became less valuable than the euro for the first time in more than two years, a sign that the United States is becoming a less attractive place for foreign investors to put their money compared with Europe. At the same time, stock markets in Europe plunged, on concerns that slowing United States growth could damage economies worldwide.
Just before noon, stocks slid further after a speech by President Bush in Birmingham, Ala., about the health of the economy and the need for companies to behave responsibly. Many investors have complained that a speech by Mr. Bush last Tuesday on corporate wrongdoing was long on oratory but short on new laws or regulations that would force executives to be more honest. Since Mr. Bush's initial speech, the Dow has fallen more than 600 points.
Widespread speculation that big mutual fund companies have had to sell billions of dollars in stock in the last few days to meet redemptions from investors also roiled the market. Many fund investors are now getting second-quarter statements showing that their accounts have lost 10 percent or more of their value since March, and more and more of them are selling their funds in disgust with their losses and corporate accounting scandals.
Data on fund purchases and sales is several days behind investors' actions, but from late May to early July, investors sold $18 billion in United States stock funds, and most professional investors think redemptions have accelerated.
"Average Americans are looking at their statements and saying they don't want to play any longer," said Thomas Giovine, who manages a $150 million hedge fund.
In midafternoon, as the market was bottoming, professional investors said that even though some stocks appeared to have fallen to compellingly cheap levels, they were having a hard time buying.
"The market isn't exceedingly overvalued, probably for the first time in four years," Mr. Giovine said. "But a lot of guys who are sitting in my chair on the buy side just don't have the guts" to buy.
Small investors are very nervous, said Mark Fisher, a Morgan Stanley broker in Portland, Ore. Mr. Fisher said many of his clients, who are mostly retirees, had asked him to sell all their stocks recently.
With the S.& P. 500 down 40 percent from its highs of March 2000, Mr. Fisher said he thought that selling now would be a mistake. He has advised clients to hold their positions. 
But "if they call a second time and say 'I want to get out,' I let them get out," Mr. Fisher said. "Because I'm a big believer that you have to sell down to the sleep point." Investors who are so afraid of more losses that they cannot sleep should not own stocks, he said.
So far, only one client has called a second time. But if the market does not recover in the next few weeks, Mr. Fisher expects many more calls. "People will get to a point where they just want to get out."
Despite all the volatility, an investor who slept through the day would not have known he had missed much. At day's end, the S.& P. 500 was down 3.46 points, or 0.38 percent; the Dow was off 0.52 percent; and the Nasdaq had risen 9.12 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,382.62.
"It's a fascinating time," Mr. Parke of MFS said. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices slipped yesterday as stocks staged a powerful rally up from deep session lows. Testimony that is expected today from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, also kept bond investors defensive.
A rapid shift in expectations for the central bank to leave interest rates unchanged for the rest of the year and into early 2003 has sent Treasuries soaring over the last week, scoring new lows for the year on most yields.
But that surge ran out of fuel yesterday, accelerating as the Dow Jones industrial average recovered from big early losses. Bond traders grew concerned that Mr. Greenspan, faced with recent equity carnage, would sound upbeat on the economy, threatening to knock Treasuries even further from their lofty peaks.
By late in the day, the 10-year note fell 13/32, to a price of 101 29/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.63 percent from 4.57 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond fell 30/32, to 99 27/32. Its yield increased to 5.39 percent from 5.32 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

14 Companies Alleging Anti-Expos Conspiracy

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The fight over the future of the Montreal Expos has led to a civil lawsuit in which a baseball commissioner is being sued for the first time under the federal racketeering act.
 Lawyers for 14 prominent Canadian companies, including one owned by the son of the Expos' original owner, Charles Bronfman, said yesterday that they would file a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Miami today against Commissioner Bud Selig, Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, and Jeffrey Loria, owner of the Florida Marlins and former managing partner of the Expos. 
 The 14 companies, whose ownership of the Expos once totaled 76 percent but was reduced to 6 percent, contend that Selig, Loria and others conspired to eliminate baseball in Montreal as well as reduce their holdings in the team, lawyers for the companies said. They contend that the conspiracy violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970, or RICO. 
As part of the lawsuit, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, the companies seek an injunction preventing Major League Baseball from moving the Expos to another city or eliminating the team through its contraction plan.
Selig had planned to eliminate the Expos and the Minnesota Twins before this season to help ease baseball's economic problems, but legal challenges blocked him. Baseball settled a Minnesota lawsuit by agreeing not to eliminate the Twins for the 2003 season, but Selig said as recently as last week that the Expos remained a contraction candidate. It is also possible, however, that the Expos could be moved to the Washington area.
Last winter, Loria sold the Expos to Major League Baseball and bought the Marlins, whose owner, John Henry, joined the new ownership group of the Boston Red Sox. The companies suing Selig and Loria now own 6 percent of the Marlins.
The lawsuit charges that Selig, DuPuy, Loria and David Samson, the Marlins' president, "are the perpetrators of a fraudulent conspiracy and the members of a racketeering enterprise with the object of eliminating major league baseball in Montreal, and removing plaintiffs from standing in the way of that objective."
The suit alleges that when Loria, a New York art dealer, bought 24 percent of the Expos in 1999 and became managing partner, he lied to the minority owners and misled them about his intentions for the team. His misrepresentations, the companies say in the suit, let Loria gain 94 percent of the team through a series of cash calls that the companies were unable or unwilling to meet. 
The suit further alleges that contrary to his stated plans and promises, Loria had planned all along to move the Expos to the United States. The commissioner, the suit says, was involved in plans that helped Loria achieve his desire to own a team in the United States. DuPuy, speaking for himself and Selig, declined to comment on the lawsuit. "I haven't seen it, so I don't have any comment on it," he said. "When it's filed, I'm sure we'll respond."
Samson, speaking for himself and Loria, also declined to comment. "I have not read the complaint," he said. "We have no comment until we read it." 
The suit seeks $100 million in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages for violation of the RICO act, for fraud and for the commissioner's "breaches of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentations." Damage awards under RICO are tripled.
"These are not companies that are typically plaintiffs in lawsuits of this type," said Jeffrey Kessler of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a New York law firm that is representing the Canadian companies. "It just shows how wronged they feel."
One of the companies is Esarbee Investments Ltd., which is led by Stephen R. Bronfman. His father, Charles, who owned the Expos from their inception in 1969 until 1991, was a major supporter of Selig and remains a close friend.
The lawyers acknowledged the unusual nature of a member of the prominent Bronfman family suing Selig, but one said, "It's some indication of the depth of feeling."
Among the other companies suing are Fairmont Hotel and Resorts Inc., the hotel and resort company; Loblaws Inc., which operates major Canadian grocery chains; and BCE Inc., parent of Bell Canada.
The decision to make it a RICO case, the lawyers said, developed as they spoke to their clients.
"Under the RICO statute," Kessler said, "you need multiple frauds over a period of time by various people conspiring together. When you look at the facts here, that's what stood out, how pervasive this was, how widespread the frauds were."
The key to Loria's ability to gain 94 percent ownership of the Expos was a series of cash calls he made from Feb. 9 to Aug. 27, 2001. A partnership short of capital can call on its partners for cash. If they do not come up with it, their stake in the partnership is reduced and the stake of those who do come up with the cash is increased.
The suit says Loria and Samson represented the calls to be "for legitimate business purposes" but were actually made "for the purpose of diluting the ownership interests" of the companies so that Loria could take control of the Expos. The commissioner, the suit adds, aided Loria by concealing a "secret plan" to provide Loria with another franchise in exchange for the Expos.
"As a result of his fraudulent conduct and that of the other defendants," the suit alleges, "Mr. Loria was able to achieve near total ownership of the Expos without paying any compensation to plaintiffs."
The partners initially agreed to a plan that provided for cash calls, the suit says, because DuPuy and other Selig representatives told the Canadian companies that without it baseball would not approve the deal that made Loria the managing partner. When Loria negotiated that agreement, the Expos had no alternative for a new managing partner.
The suit claims that at that time Selig and DuPuy had already decided to abandon Montreal but did not advise the companies.
The companies, the suit says, "relied upon those misrepresentations and omissions in deciding to proceed with the transactions with Mr. Loria."

HEADLINE: Memorial Park Plays Large Part In Preliminary Trade Center Plans 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT and CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
All the competing plans for redeveloping the World Trade Center site include a memorial park as the centerpiece, covering as much as a third to two-thirds of the 16-acre site, according to people who have seen the six preliminary designs. 
 Some designs include the footprints of the twin towers in the memorial. Others call for at least one soaring tower that evokes the oversize presence of the trade center in the Lower Manhattan skyline. 
 The designs, which have been shown in recent days to government officials, architects and leaders of civic organizations involved in the rebuilding process, also restrict development on the site itself largely to commercial offices and retail space. Some proposals also call for a museum as part of the memorial. 
Most designs also designate existing buildings to the south for residential towers and for a cultural or a performing arts center. These elements are desired by planners to fulfill their goal of converting Lower Manhattan to a place that will attract visitors long after most office workers will have left at the end of the workday.
In what will be the beginning of a process of debate and refinement lasting at least through the end of the year, the six designs, developed by planners for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are scheduled to be released to the public today at a news conference at the Federal Hall National Memorial, the landmark building on Wall Street.
What is unveiled today, however, is unlikely to survive through the planning process, officials said yesterday. "This is the starting point for dialogue," Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for the development corporation, said yesterday. Part of that dialogue will include a large public hearing on Saturday at the Javits Convention Center, where 5,000 people are expected to participate. 
The designs have undergone several stages of revision even as they have been reviewed with public officials and others in recent days, people involved in the process say. A draft of the plans dated July 11 that was circulated among government and planning officials had eight versions of the six plans, including at least two that came directly from developers with interests downtown. 
But by yesterday, those plans had been significantly altered by architects at Beyer Blinder Belle, the urban planning and architecture firm hired to oversee the design process, making the plans that originated with developers all but unrecognizable to their authors.
Many planners, civic groups and community advocates have already expressed dismay that the Port Authority and state officials have insisted that designers incorporate what was already on the site and more: 11 million square feet of office space, 600,000 square feet of retail and an 800-room hotel. Those requirements, the critics say, allow little else and limit the possibilities for imaginative configurations of the property.
Some members of those groups have also begun to voice reactions to what they have seen that are lukewarm at best. On Saturday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he viewed the plans as "a starting point" from which to "collect as many different ideas as we can."
Mr. Bloomberg, who has an engineering degree and who helped to design his company's own office complexes, added that he would be giving his own ideas to the planners.
Others who have worked to influence the planning process have been more critical. "It's a plan for the Port Authority," said Susan S. Szenasy, a co-founder of Rebuild Downtown, Our Town, and editor of Metropolis, a design and culture magazine. "It has nothing to do with the call for a 21st-century design or a vibrant 24/7 community, or creating street life in the area. It's very discouraging. But we're living with the reality of everything the Port Authority needs. There's no room for fresh ideas."
Michael Petralia, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the agency never intended to begin the planning process with a clean slate. 
"We had to deal with the legal obligations that are a fact at the 16 acres," including the commercial, retail and hotel space that is under contract, Mr. Petralia said. "Those are part of the discussion, just as a memorial is part of it and transportation is part of it."
Mr. Petralia and Mr. Higgins declined to comment on the specific elements of the six designs.
Some who saw the plans yesterday praised elements that could raise opposition. Fredric Bell, executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, said some plans offered interesting ideas for memorial space and a museum that would require building where the towers had been, an area that many family members of the victims would like to be preserved. 
The final master plan for the site is likely to incorporate elements of all six initial proposals rather than adhere to any one proposal. But the preliminary designs will crystallize at least some of the issues facing Lower Manhattan and the redevelopment of the site, including the height and mass of commercial towers to be built, the size and location of a memorial park, which streets should be re-established and the location of a transit hub.
The plans include from two to six office towers, some topped by glass-clad see-through structures, several hundred feet high, to evoke the twin towers. Several include a huge tower, perhaps taller than the twin towers had been. One plan calls for a clear "beacon" tower that would be among the world's tallest structures.
The designs also incorporate several proposals that have been circulating among architects and planning and community groups for months, including restoring some of the streets that were eliminated when more than a dozen downtown blocks were combined to form the superblock for the trade center.
People who have seen the proposals say that all six designs include a restoration of Greenwich Street, whose southward progression formerly ended at Barclay Street, at the site of 7 World Trade Center, and re-emerged south of Liberty Street. 
Most of the six plans also call for the reopening of a corridor roughly along the line of Fulton Street, extending from Church Street westward to West Street, either as a pedestrian walkway through the redeveloped site or as a surface street. Two plans restore parts of Cortlandt and Dey Streets, usually as east-west pedestrian byways going through the site. 
The proposed designs also offer several variations on whether and how to submerge West Street. One calls for the roadway to descend below ground from Vesey Street through Battery Park, creating an 18-acre memorial promenade extending from the trade center site south to the Battery. 
One plan calls for an express roadway to be submerged from Chambers Street through Battery Park, while allowing local traffic to continue to use a smaller West Street adjacent to the site. Another plan would submerge only the section from Vesey to Liberty Street. Others call for building a platform or a pedestrian walkway over the street.
People who viewed the plans in recent days say they leave many questions unanswered. Among them are the location of the underground site of the PATH train tracks; most plans put the mezzanine station between Greenwich and Church Streets. What would be required for the condemnation and acquisition of property to build residential towers near the site remains unanswered. 
Nor is it clear when there will be a demand for new commercial space downtown. Many real estate analysts estimate that it will not be necessary to build a new office tower on the site before at least 2006.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing E-Commerce: DrKoop.com Is Sold For $186,000 

BYLINE:  By Andrew Zipern (NYT) (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 DrKoop.com, the medical information Web site that was once valued at over $1 billion, was sold yesterday to a Florida company for $186,000 in cash. Founded in 1997 by C. Everett Koop, the former United States surgeon general, the site went bankrupt last December. 
The company, which had changed its corporate name to the Dr. Koop LifeCare Corporation, was bought by Vitacost.com, a closely held company based in Boynton Beach, Fla., that sells wholesale health products over the Internet. DrKoop.com was founded in 1997 with more than $200 million, Vitacost.com said. The shares, sold to the public in June 1999, rose as high as $45.75 three years ago, before falling with the collapse of the Internet stock bubble. Andrew Zipern (NYT)

GOROG, WILLIAM F. WILLIAM F. GOROG

 BODY:
 GOROG-William F. William F. Gorog, one of America's most successful entrepreneurs who often noted that an almost warped sense of optimism, "a refusal to accept reality" was required to succeed in bringing pioneering technologies into mainstream use, died of complications from lung cancer on July 14, 2002 surrounded by his family in McLean, Virginia. Mr. Gorog was 76, and is survived by his wife of 53 years, Gretchen Meister Gorog, six children, and 21 grandchildren. Mr. Gorog's forty plus years in business included Co-Founding both Data Corporation and InteliData and serving as Chairman and CEO. During his career he also served as President of the Magazine Publishers Association, Chairman of the Chief Executives Organization, participated in the creation of VeriFone and served in President Ford's White House as head of the Council on International Economic Policy. In community affairs, Mr. Gorog served as chairman of The Board of Visitors of the Georgetown University School of Business; and as Chairman of The Washington Campus, a consortium of sixteen university business schools that provides student exposure to the workings of the Federal Government. Mr. Gorog most recently CoFounder and Chairman of InteliData (NASDAQ: "INTD") where he helped pioneer the Electronic Banking and Bill Payment (EBPP) technology. Mr. Gorog was born in Warren, Ohio on September 2, 1925. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1949, attended Carnegie Mellon and achieved his Master of Science Degree in Industrial Engineering from the Ohio State University Graduate School.

Gorog served both in World War II and the Korean War. Shortly after the Korean War, he Co-Founded and served as Chairman and CEO of Data Corporation, a high technology research and development company where he conceived of and developed the computerized law and news information systems known as LEXIS/ NEXIS now in use by thousands of law firms, courts, federal agencies, and corporations throughout the United States. Mr. Gorog's company also worked extensively with NASA and developed the photo-optics and systems for the Apollo Mission to the Moon. In 1969 Data Corporation was merged with the Mead Corporation and he became a director of Mead and remained Data's Chairman and CEO. In 1975 Mr. Gorog joined the Ford Administration as the Deputy Director of President's Economic Policy Board and in 1976 was made Executive Director of the Council on International Economic Policy. In this capacity, he was a member of the White House Senior Staff and reported directly to the President. Mr. Gorog left the White House after the change in administration in 1977 and established a trading company primarily involved in the export of U.S. computer products to the Far East.

HEADLINE: MEDICINE MERGER: THE CHIEF; 
An Executive Makes Deals And Makes Them Work

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
In August 2000, when Henry A. McKinnell was named heir to the retiring chief executive of Pfizer, William C. Steere Jr., many industry experts wondered how he could top the act he was following. After all, during Mr. Steere's nine-year tenure, Pfizer became the world's largest drug company, one whose sales -- and stock price -- kept going up, up and up some more.
 "We're No. 1, and now Hank has to figure out how to keep us there," Mr. Steere said at the time. No problem, Dr. McKinnell responded. Pointing to breakthroughs in genomics and biotechnology that he said were transforming the whole drug industry, he said simply, "I don't think you've seen anything yet." 
 He was not kidding -- although the developments on Dr. McKinnell's watch center more on economics than biochemistry. Indeed, if his proposed $60 billion acquisition of Pharmacia goes through, Pfizer will further eclipse GlaxoSmithKline, its next largest competitor.
Neither the size of the deal, nor Dr. McKinnell's seeming ease in pulling it off, surprises those who know him. They note that Dr. McKinnell, not Mr. Steere, engineered the hostile takeover of Warner-Lambert in 1999 and has made the merger work. 
"He's absolutely brilliant, an amazing communicator, and he thinks strategically at all times," said Dennis C. Carey, a vice chairman of the executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart and a friend of Dr. McKinnell. "If we're having lunch before skiing, he'll talk about strategy for the slopes," Mr. Carey said.
Hemant K. Shah, an independent drug company analyst, adds canny negotiator to the list of qualities. "He knows how to fine-tune deals to make them work," Mr. Shah said. 
As an example, Mr. Shah singles out the Warner-Lambert deal. Pfizer went after Warner-Lambert after the company had already agreed to merge with American Home Products. Moreover, as part of a deal under which Pfizer was marketing some Warner-Lambert drugs, Pfizer had agreed not to try to buy the company.
Dr. McKinnell insisted that the American Home deal put Warner-Lambert in play and thus freed Pfizer from its promise. He kept raising his counteroffer in small increments, giving himself more room to negotiate. And he used every public forum he could to stress the underlying health and stability of Pfizer's stock.
It was the time fen-phen, American Home's diet-drug combination, was first implicated in heart problems, and Dr. McKinnell thought Warner-Lambert shareholders would be more likely to vote in favor of Pfizer if they were constantly reminded that the Pfizer stock they would receive for their Warner-Lambert shares was more likely to keep rising. "He understood how to negotiate, and he understood how to make the most of the financial and psychological factors that underlie the financial markets," Mr. Shah said.
Some of that acumen was undoubtedly developed in the classroom. But, a peripatetic life has also probably added texture to his skills.
Dr. McKinnell grew up on an island near Vancouver -- and still speaks with a slight Canadian accent. His father was a ship captain, and Dr. McKinnell raised spare cash doing jobs around boats, and later, driving race cars. 
But he soon buckled down, earning an M.B.A. and doctorate in business from Stanford University. He had his sights set on being a professor, but thought he should have a few years of experience first. So, in 1971, he answered an ad to work on a short-term project for Pfizer in Tokyo. 
That temporary stint turned into almost 14 years overseas for Pfizer, mostly in Asia. He has spent the last 17 years at Pfizer's New York headquarters, clearly being groomed for the top job much of that time.
In that process, he has developed a reputation as a nonhierarchical, approachable leader, someone whose style is sometimes compared to that of John F. Welch Jr., the former chairman of General Electric.
"Just like Jack, Hank communicates easily at all levels of the organization, and it's not unlike him to pop into a meeting of managers three or four levels below him on the hierarchy," Mr. Carey said. "He'll sit with his troops for hours to make sure everyone knows the playbook before they run the play."
Most analysts agree that a reason Pfizer is on track to realize more than $1.6 billion in annual savings from the Warner-Lambert merger is that Dr. McKinnell laid off many Warner-Lambert employees. And they say Pharmacia people would be wise to brush up their resumes.
"Hank McKinnell," Mr. Shah warned, "has no problem doing what has to be done."

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
New Prospects for the Battered Drug Stocks

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Some money managers are beginning to say that the pharmaceutical industry has suffered enough. At beaten-down prices, the stocks are likely to be good long-term investments, they say, whether or not the industry quickly benefits from a wave of mergers.
 Over the last year, investors have treated pharmaceutical stocks worse than the overall market. One drug stock, Bristol-Myers Squibb, has lost more than half its value in 2002. 
 The drug companies have made numerous missteps: bets on the wrong products, run-ins with regulators, and failures to quell talk in Washington and elsewhere that prices are susceptible to being reduced. Skeptics see few potential blockbuster new drugs, and the companies face fierce competition from generic drug manufacturers as some of their best-selling products lose patent protection.
"As value investors, we rarely get to go into an industry like this," said David N. Dreman, a money manager well known for his opportunistic eye and who has recently invested in stocks like Bristol-Myers. "I just don't believe the drug industry is dead."
The news yesterday that Pfizer would acquire Pharmacia helped lift the prices of a few stocks. Pharmacia shares rose 20 percent, or $6.66 a share. The prospect of future combinations also buoyed Bristol-Myers shares, up about 5 percent, or $1.20, and Eli Lilly, which rose 2.7 percent, or $1.35.
But some other pharmaceutical stocks met with skepticism. Pfizer's stock was pummeled, down $3.42 to $28.78, on the rich premium it is paying for Pharmacia and disappointing earnings news. Shares of Wyeth, formerly American Home Products, and Schering-Plough also declined.
Trading at levels last seen in the mid-1990's, when talk of health care reform rattled investors, the drug stocks as a group now appear to have an attractive valuation, some portfolio managers say.
Based on their estimated earnings growth, the stocks are trading at a significant discount to the overall market, though they have traditionally been valued at a premium of 15 to 20 percent to the market.
"It seems peculiar to us that a technology-based, soundly growing business should trade at a discount," said Samuel D. Isaly, who manages the Eaton Vance Worldwide Health Sciences Fund. He estimates that the industry will generate annual earnings growth over the next five years in the high single digits to low double digits.
Despite their price, and yesterday's news, investors may not be able to count on a quick recovery. Dr. Kris Jenner, who manages the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund, said, "Right now, I think they are in a troughing process, and I think there are some outstanding, outstanding bargains in the pharmaceutical sector if you have a three-year horizon." 
While Dr. Jenner acknowledges many of the industry's fundamental problems, including an inability to improve productivity, he still sees tremendous promise because of the possibility of finding new treatments for conditions like Alzheimer's disease and cancer. "What we're seeing is a normal cyclical pattern but not a secular change," he said.
Wyeth's stock, for example, has fallen by about a third over the last year, largely a result of a recent study that showed that one of the company's hormone-replacement therapies was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Dr. Jenner argues that investors have overreacted to the news. "Wyeth is not a one-product company," he said.
Bristol-Myers's practice of enticing wholesalers to buy too much of some products has led to big write-offs and an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. "I think it's been pushed down too far," Mr. Dreman said. While Bristol has often been mentioned as a possible acquisition target, the S.E.C. inquiry will probably delay any possible combination for several months, he said.
Even Merck's recent brush with accounting controversy, which has punished its stock price, does not give Mr. Dreman and Mr. Isaly too much pause. The company's policy of booking revenue for its Medco unit had no impact on earnings, Mr. Dreman said, adding, "I think it's a pretty good company." Merck's share price is down by nearly a quarter over the last 12 months. Mr. Isaly, who was more critical, said the company suffered from a weak pipeline of new drugs.
Because of the difficult environment, many investors think that the industry is likely to undergo further consolidation. Companies that have already gone through successful acquisitions, like Pfizer had with Warner-Lambert, are good candidates for future deals, according to Mr. Isaly.
GlaxoSmithKline, for example, was successful in combining Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, and Novartis is a combination of the Swiss drug makers Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy. Some of the smaller companies might also combine, he said.
Mergers may not do much, he said, to solve the industry's main problem -- a lack of innovation as many top-selling products are being threatened by competition when they lose patent protection.
"The size of the combined company brings benefits of size and brings detriments of size," Mr. Isaly said.
While the merged company can save costs, by laying off workers, there are no economies of scale involved in drug development. "You've got to discover new drugs," he said. 
In the case of Pfizer, whose purchase of Pharmacia would create a giant with nearly $50 billion in annual revenue, Mr. Isaly was not concerned about the effect on research and development, saying the company knew how to manage size.
Even if there is less than they would like in the labs, these managers have faith that the companies will eventually prosper by coming up with something new.
"Analysts always want the blockbusters now," said Mr. Dreman, adding that investors have been able to profit by taking a somewhat longer view. "Those pipelines, over time, tend to pay off."
Profit, despite the bleak outlook this year, is also expected to recover at some point. "We just have to wait it out," Mr. Isaly said.

HEADLINE: Mexico Plays a North-South Divide 

BYLINE:  By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 15 

 BODY:
In matters of culture, Mexico is Latin American. But in matters of money, it is North American.
 Though most Mexicans rarely say so in public, one of this nation's greatest strengths is its privileged trade status with the United States. The United States economy plays a large role in driving the job market in Mexico, and the dream of advancement comes alive with the hum of the factory floor. 
 So when President Vicente Fox visited South America this month to increase trade ties with Brazil and Argentina, some Mexicans disapproved, fearing that their country would become more likely to contract the economic illness afflicting its southern neighbors.
"Financially, we don't want to mix in the same category as South America," said Juan Pardinas, a researcher at Cidac, a free-market research group in Mexico City. "Fox is disrupting the distinction that exists in the minds of financial managers who see Mexico as a separate economy from South America."
As President Fox toured the region, signing limited trade agreements and promising to integrate Mexico into a hemispheric free trade organization by 2006, he walked a fine line, portraying the trip as a way for Mexico to show solidarity with its struggling Latin American neighbors while not suggesting to international investors that Mexico was casting its financial lot with them.
Though Mexico's gross domestic product fell 2 percent in the first quarter of the year, President Fox said on Thursday that the economy probably grew more than 2 percent in the second quarter.
The distinction between culture and economics is crucial for Mexico. And it has been cultivating that distinction for a decade, ever since the government began migrating away from Latin America and toward the protective umbrella of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which offers Mexico a degree of stability not found in other Latin American economies.
The benefits of the partnership with the United States and Canada have been huge. Last year, the $254 billion in trade with the United States accounted for about 78 percent of Mexico's total, while the $7.3 billion in trade with Canada accounted for an additional 2 percent. Billions of foreign investment dollars have poured into Mexico. And a large part of Mexico's economic stability -- the peso is one of the strongest currencies in the world -- is a result of its anchoring to Nafta.
Despite these economic benefits, Mexico still feels a strong cultural connection to the rest of Latin America. When Mr. Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who is criticized at home for being too pro-American, said last week that "now more than ever, we want to be closer to Argentina," aides say he was sending a message of solidarity to a country that the financial world views as a contagion ready to infect. Still, some analysts, including Mr. Pardinas, grumbled.
President Fox "could scare investors and raise the perception that Mexico once again belongs to Latin America," Mr. Pardinas said.
Like many developing nations, Mexico depends a great deal on foreign investment to fuel its economy. Whether this money arrives or dries up depends largely on how investors perceive a country's economy. A Mexico firmly attached to Nafta seems a safe place to invest. A Mexico creeping toward the rest of Latin America seems less so.
Some analysts say that Mexico's trade with South America is so minuscule that nothing Mr. Fox says will make much noise in the markets. Mexico's trade balance with South America is surprisingly small. Brazil represents less than 1 percent of Mexico's trade. The entire Mercosur trade bloc -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- represents only 3 percent.
Mexico's government has been signing free trade agreements with many countries to decrease its dependence on the United States. Much of what Mr. Fox announced on his trip will probably increase Mexico's trade to South America only slightly.
Analysts predict that an agreement with Brazil to remove nearly 800 tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods will increase trade to $4 billion, from $2.7 billion.
Mr. Fox also increased the number of cars Argentina can export duty-free to Mexico, to 50,000, from 19,000. The $500 million that this is expected to bring Argentina is small compared with its $141 billion debt default and the 70 percent devaluation of its currency.
Mr. Fox's promise to integrate Mexico into a hemispheric free trade organization with all of Latin America by 2006 was something Brazil and Argentina wanted to hear, but whether such integration actually occurs will depend greatly on how the United States feels about the idea.
So why did Mr. Fox bother?
"The trip was meant to appease our Latin American friends" who think "that the natural friends of Mexico should be its Latin American neighbors," said Jorge Eshiavon, a professor of international relations at CIDE, a university in Mexico City. Mexico is constantly having to appease bitter feelings from those neighbors, who sometimes feel that Mexico has abandoned them, he said.
An aide close to Mr. Fox said the trade announcements were not intended for their economic force, but to strengthen Mr. Fox's showing in polls at home, where Congress has labeled him too friendly to United States interests. Mr. Fox's demonstration of solidarity with the rest of Latin America, his cabinet hopes, will earn him some points in the polls and perhaps a break with Congress, which has steadfastly opposed Mr. Fox on almost all his initiatives, including energy and tax reforms.
It is still too early to see if the polls have moved, but in the meantime, Mexico will continue "following a double standard," Mr. Eshiavon said. "Our pockets are with the U.S., and our heart is still with Latin America."

HEADLINE: Flurry Precedes Mideast Meeting in New York 

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER with TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 15 

 BODY:
The Israeli-Palestinian crisis caused a flurry of diplomatic maneuvering today on the eve of a high-level meeting to take place in New York on Tuesday at the request of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
 The gathering known as the Quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- faces the central issue of the future of Yasir Arafat, long the embodiment of Palestinian aspirations, who President Bush and his advisers now say cannot lead any future Palestinian state. 
 On that and related subjects, Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer of Israel met with President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian port of Alexandria today. According to public statements made by the two at separate news conferences, they appear to have reached different conclusions. 
Speaking of Mr. Arafat's role, Mr. Ben-Eliezer said, "Thank God, I think we have agreed that with all the differences of views, better just to outflank this problem and try to find someone that can be accepted by the Palestinians, by us, by the Arab world and try to go with the breakthrough."
The Egyptian president, on the other hand, said: "We differ on the issue. But we can find a way, without affecting Arafat, to help negotiations and reach a solution."
There was theorizing in diplomatic circles that there might be a plan to turn Mr. Arafat into a figurehead president in some kind of parliamentary democracy in which a prime minister would hold the real power. Who that might be remains unclear.
In remarks to a Kuwaiti newspaper, Al Seyassah, before the meeting, Mr. Mubarak said he had warned Mr. Bush of the danger of leaving Mr. Arafat out.
"Sidelining Arafat will be a big question we all regret," Mr. Mubarak said. "The man, with his experience and role, has the loyalty of Palestinians inside and abroad."
It is a delicate issue. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel regards Mr. Arafat as the central terrorist mastermind, and his Palestinian Authority has been losing credibility among Palestinians for corruption, inefficiency and a failure to stand up to Israeli military incursions. 
But though he sits, increasingly isolated, in the ruins of his Ramallah headquarters, with Israeli tanks vetting visitors in the parking lot, foreign orders alone are insufficient reason for Arabs to abandon him, even among leaders like Mr. Mubarak, who have privately found him as infuriating as the Americans do.
Paradoxically, Mr. Bush's decree is now Mr. Arafat's main strength.
The United Nations, the Europeans and the Arabs differ with the administration's insistence that Mr. Arafat be replaced, but share its goal of reorganizing Palestinian security forces, lending relief aid and reforming Palestinian political institutions.
The United States has been working with other countries on how to channel economic assistance to the Palestinians through international relief organizations, and not directly to the Palestinian Authority, which the Bush administration sees as corrupt. Officials said that approach already appeared to be gaining wide acceptance and would not be on Tuesday's agenda.
Instead, senior administration officials and diplomats said they expected that the meeting and public statements would emphasize the points of agreement, as a way of "creating momentum for Palestinian reform, and for easing off on the Israeli side," as one official put it.
Another meeting -- a seminar for Middle Eastern peace -- is being planned for later this week in Denmark under United Nations and European Union sponsorship.
Among those taking part are to be the United Nations representative for the Middle East, Terje Roed Larsen, and the Palestinian representatives Nabil Shaath and Yasir Abed Rabbo. Others include Muhammad Rashid, who is part of Mr. Arafat's old guard, and Sari Nusseibeh, who has a reputation as a moderate.
But given the abyss here, neither planned meeting seems likely to offer a reprieve. Indeed, some in the press said they seemed to reflect the hatreds and hopes of a decade ago, if not before.
"If someone were to wake up this week from a coma that began in July, 1992," the columnist Akiva Eldar wrote today in the daily Haaretz, everything would seem the same.
"Once again," he said, "we're looking for kosher Palestinians, those who don't appear to be subject to Yasir Arafat. Once again, busybodies and officials are getting their per diem expenses for flying off to America. Even the name on the White House door is almost the same as it was then."
But, Mr. Eldar wrote, "there is no magic formula will suddenly pop up at the meeting of the Quartet in New York." The only solution, he said, in a bow to American dominance, must come from the White House.
"Everything else," he said, "is hot air."

HEADLINE: In Kabul, Rumsfeld Aide Regrets Toll in Raid 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, July 15 

 BODY:
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz struck an apologetic note today after meeting here with President Hamid Karzai about security issues that have caused serious problems for the new government of President Hamid Karzai in the last few weeks.
 Relations between the United States military and its Afghan allies have been strained since an American airstrike on July 1 that local villagers say killed more than 50 civilians and injured more than 120 in southern Afghanistan. The Afghan government has demanded an investigation and "serious measures" by the American military to ensure that such mistakes do not occur again. 
 After meeting with Mr. Karzai, Defense Minister Marshal Mohammad Qasim Fahim, and Foreign Minister Abdullah today in Kabul, Mr. Wolfowitz said at a news conference that he deeply regretted the civilian deaths in the raid in Oruzgan Province. 
He said a full investigation would be conducted. "When we make a mistake, or think we may have made a mistake as in Oruzgan, we will try to track down as thoroughly as we can the causes of it, to try to prevent it," he said. 
American troops were doing a dangerous job in difficult circumstances and were doing their best to make the right judgments, he said. "But no one can say the risk can be eliminated completely." 
Mr. Wolfowitz's visit also comes just a week after Vice President Hajji Abdul Qadir was assassinated, and as continued violence in northern Afghanistan threatens foreign aid programs. 
He promised continued support for Mr. Karzai's government, in particular the United States-sponsored program to build and train an Afghan Army, and said he would urge other nations and groups to honor their pledges to provide for the country's economic reconstruction.
Other countries have pledged $4.5 billion for Afghanistan over the next five years, but Afghan officials have complained that very little of that money has materialized.
In comments to American troops at Bagram Air Base, the American military headquarters here, Mr. Wolfowitz said the fight against Al Qaeda and Taliban was by no means over. But he acknowledged that operations should not weaken Mr. Karzai's fledgling administration.
"It is very important that we carry out our operations to capture and kill terrorists who threaten the United States," he said. "It is also very important to us to work with Afghan authorities on both a national and local level to make sure operations are coordinated and contribute to long-term stability of this country." 
Mr. Wolfowitz also flew to the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif to urge competing factions in northern Afghanistan to stop the sporadic violence that has been destabilizing the region and hindering aid efforts there. He met with the Uzbek general, Abdul Rashid Dostum, a close ally in the war against the Taliban, and with the Hazara and Tajik leaders in the region. 
"We had two messages," he said after the meeting. "The first message was appreciation for the role that they played in the liberation of Afghanistan. 
"At the same time I said to them that in some ways the challenges of war are sometimes easier than the challenges of peace. It is very important to try to control the level of violence in northern Afghanistan." 
But Mr. Wolfowitz also said that the world must make good on its promises of economic assistance if it wants to maintain leverage over warlords. The world will not abandon Afghanistan to become a haven again for terrorists, he said. 
"One of the most important things is to train and equip the Afghan national army," he said, "and the other piece, which is equally important for the security picture, is to be able to make good on the promises that the whole world has made to this country to deliver economic assistance."

HEADLINE: It's the Real Thing 

 BODY:
With President Bush digging in his heels in defense of accounting tricks that hide the true cost of stock options, and Congress equivocating under intense corporate lobbying, reform has come from an unexpected place -- the Coca-Cola Company. Coke announced this week that it would start counting against its yearly earnings the options it grants employees. It is a bold commitment to reform, and one that, particularly given the meltdown in the stock market in recent days, the White House and Congress should take to heart. 
 Options, the right to buy stock in the company at a given and generally favorable price, were a fast-growing part of employee compensation packages in the 1990's. They can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the case of top executives, but unlike salaries and bonuses, they almost never show up as expenses on corporate balance sheets. That works out nicely for the corporations, which can report better earnings as a result. 
 In 1994 the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets the nation's accounting rules, was on the verge of requiring companies to count options as expenses. But under heavy pressure from Congress, the standards board backed down. In the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals, the board has made it known that it is once again considering mandating that options be counted as expenses. If it does so, as it should, Congress will probably be reluctant, in the current post-Enron climate, to put up a fight.
Coca-Cola, to its credit, is not waiting. (In making the shift, it joins other companies, including Boeing and Winn-Dixie, which have counted options as expenses in recent years, and The Washington Post, which made the decision in May.) Coke has also done something else of considerable value -- it has developed a new method of pricing stock options. Defenders of the status quo argue that it is impossible to count options as an expense because there is no way of knowing for sure what they will be worth at the time they are ultimately exercised. There is already one workable formula for pricing options, called the Black-Scholes model. But Coca-Cola has devised a simpler, cleaner approach: it will ask investment banks to place bids on the options, and average those to set a price.
Opponents of the reform warn that it will drive down stock prices, by lowering companies' annual earnings per share. There may be some truth to the charge -- Coca-Cola says that its profits of $1.60 per share in 2001 would have been reduced to $1.51 per share if it had reported options as expenses. But what Coca-Cola gains is credibility with investors, who have been fleeing the stock market because they have lost faith in corporations' accounting methods. 
President Bush, speaking yesterday in Alabama, assured the nation that "our economy is fundamentally strong." Like his speech on Wall Street last week, this address was long on rhetoric and short on substance. With the Dow down 8 percent over the last six trading days, and a deep malaise settling on Wall Street, what the economy needs now is not presidential cheerleading but serious reform. The White House and Congress ought to be embarrassed that it took a soft-drink company to lead the charge.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From President Bush's Address on the Economy 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech to business leaders at the University of Alabama at Birmingham yesterday, as recorded by the Federal News Service Inc. A full transcript is online at nytimes.com/politics.
 In order for us to have the security we all want, America must get rid of the hangover that we now have as a result of the binge, the economic binge we just went through. We were in a land of endless profit. There was no tomorrow when it came to the stock markets and corporate profits. And now we're suffering a hangover for that binge. But I want you to know the economy -- our economy -- is fundamentally strong. This economy has got the foundations for growth, so that people who want to find work can find work, so that the entrepreneurs in America can flourish. 
 Listen to the facts. Inflation is low. An important part of an economic recovery is to make sure that inflation is under control. It is. We've got sound monetary policy. Interest rates are reasonable. If people want to borrow money, you don't have to pay a lot of interest.
Productivity is increasing. We lead the world in productivity gains as a result of the entrepreneurial spirit and the fine workers we have in America. That's an important indication of how sound our economy is.
The first-quarter growth of 2002 was a little over 6 percent. That's a pretty good sign that the foundations for growth are there. Orders for durable goods for the past six months are up.
The manufacturing sector was down, and slowly but surely, it is recovering from a slowdown that began for all of our economy in early March of 2000. Last month retail sales were up by 1 percent. Consumers are buying. In other words, in spite of the fact that we've been in a slump for a while and in spite of the fact that the terrorists attacked us and affected our economic outlook, American businesses and workers are resilient and resolved, and this economy is coming back. That's the fact. . . .
So I want to talk about long-term economic growth and what we can do about it. I want to make sure it is clear to those in Congress that I will resist runaway Congressional spending, which can serve as a drag on economic vitality.
And finally, I expect and you expect and our country expects the highest ethical standards in corporate America.
First, we're promoting long-term growth, the kind of growth that understands that the main job creators in America are small-business entrepreneurs -- that if you're interested in recovery of the job base, it is important for us to remember who creates most of the jobs. And those are the small-business owners in America. . . . 
Another way to make sure that we foster growth and restore confidence is to hold people accountable for misdeeds in the public sector.
It is important for corporate America to hear this call. In order to be a responsible American, you must behave responsibly. We expect there to be full disclosure of assets and liabilities. 
We expect there to be fair accounting practices. We expect you to treat your investors and employees with the respect that they deserve. And if not, we intend to do something about it at the federal level. We intend to hold people accountable.
That's why I set up what they call a Corporate Fraud Task Force in the Justice Department. We also have proposed doubling the jail time for corporate fraud. I proposed provisions to make sure that corporate executives cannot transfer company funds to their personal accounts while their company is under investigation.
I'm for increasing the budget of the regulatory authorities, to make sure that there is enough manpower and technology available to run down the facts and to hold people accountable.
We're making sure that executives who commit improper acts will forfeit phony profits. And we're saying that if you have defrauded investors, you can never serve as a C.E.O. or on the board of a company again. 
I support the creation of a strong independent board that will provide effective oversight of the accounting profession. In other words, I'm willing to work with Congress to make sure that we've got the necessary law in place that will hold people accountable without stifling the entrepreneurial spirit of America, without stifling innovation in America.
The House has passed a bill. The Senate is going to pass a bill tonight, I understand. The two need to get together as quickly as possible and get me a bill that I can sign before the August recess.

HEADLINE: Pataki Bests 2 Main Rivals on Donations 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 15 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki, already leading in polls, far outpaced his Democratic rivals in fund-raising over the last six months, taking in about $12.7 million in contributions, according to campaign filings.
 The state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat hoping to challenge Mr. Pataki in the November election for governor, took in about $2 million over the same period. Andrew M. Cuomo, a former federal housing secretary also vying for the Democratic nomination, raised $3.1 million. 
 Only Mr. Pataki had released a complete filing to the state board of elections by late this evening. The two Democratic candidates and an Independence Party candidate had released the totals they had raised and spent, but had yet to file details.
Those details are likely to spark political debates, as the candidates are already accusing each other of accepting donations from people who have business with the state or who want to gain favor with a future governor to obtain contracts.
The filings also suggest that New York may be on track to experience one of the most expensive statewide campaigns in its history. The record is currently held by Rick A. Lazio, who spent about $40 million in an unsuccessful attempt to vanquish Hillary Rodham Clinton in the race for an open United States Senate seat in 2000.
Mr. Pataki, a popular moderate Republican who has a two-to-one lead in most polls over either Democratic challenger, is on pace to spend almost as much, if history serves as a guide. He has about $23.3 million on hand and has spent $6.8 million so far, most of it in the last six months.
In May, the governor started running ads trumpeting what he maintains are his main accomplishments: creating jobs, reducing crime and lowering taxes. One ad has concentrated on efforts he has made to help the teetering economy upstate, which the Democrats have tried to exploit as a failing.
The governor has also placed numerous ads on Spanish-language radio and television. Those echo the themes in other ads, but also mention his opposition to the Vieques naval base in Puerto Rico and make note of the disaster relief the state has given to nations in the Caribbean basin. Since January, Mr. Pataki has spent about $2.4 million on advertising targeting Hispanic voters, with most going to English-language outlets.
Mr. Pataki's large lead in fund-raising is typical for an incumbent, but given his high popularity ratings, it makes the path for the two Democrats that much harder. If he continues to raise money at this rate, the governor could outspend either rival by at least two to one.
Mr. Cuomo, the 44-year-old son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, started his advertising campaign in May with a series of spots highlighting his work helping the homeless and bemoaning what he sees as the poor state of education and the upstate economy. One advertisement, for instance, talks about college graduates leaving the state to find work, and says that Mr. Cuomo has a plan to create 325,000 new jobs.
The Cuomo campaign has tried to portray Mr. Cuomo in the ads as a young, optimistic and effective administrator. He frequently links himself not to his father, whom Mr. Pataki ran out of office, but to Bill Clinton. Though he has not said what the ads cost, Mr. Cuomo has raised $11.8 million to date and still has $6.4 million on hand.
For his part, Mr. McCall, who is 66, has yet to launch any advertisements, conserving his relatively scant resources until the Sept. 10 primary draws closer. On the hustings, he has attacked the governor's record on education and the economy. His spokesman, Steven Greenberg, played down the importance of Mr. Pataki's monetary advantage, contending that the comptroller's support among rank-and-file party regulars would compensate for it. Mr. McCall has $5.6 million on hand, less than a quarter of the governor's war chest.
A fourth candidate, B. Thomas Golisano, a Rochester billionaire who is fighting in a primary with Mr. Pataki for the Independence Party line, filed an odd campaign report: $20 in contributions and $52 million in "miscellaneous receipts," meaning money from the candidate himself. Mr. Golisano , a fiscal conservative and social moderate, has pledged to spend as much as $70 million to unseat Mr. Pataki. In a press release, Mr. Golisano said his personal wealth frees him from the "special interests" in Albany.
While Mr. Golisano plots an assault on Mr. Pataki upstate, the two Democrats have been needling each other with tit-for-tat barbs. Mr. McCall's camp has harassed Mr. Cuomo for declining to release the list of his legal clients and other sources of income.
The Cuomo camp has faulted Mr. McCall for failing to predict the bankruptcies of companies like Enron and WorldCom, and thus losing some of the state pension's money. Mr. Cuomo also has attacked the governor and the comptroller for taking donations from people who do business with the pension fund Mr. McCall oversees. He has proposed banning such contributions.
"If Governor Pataki and Comptroller McCall were serious about campaign finance reform," said Josh Isay, Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager, "they would also release a list of all their contributors who have business before the state." 
Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for the governor, said if Mr. Cuomo was serious about changing campaign finance rules, he should support the governor's bills to do so. Mr. McCall has said he would support overhauling the rules, but he would not unilaterally stop accepting contributions from people with state business.
In the state comptroller's race, John J. Faso, the Republican nominee, has raised more than his Democratic rivals, pulling in $1.8 million in the last six months. Mr. Faso, of Kinderhook, N.Y., was the minority leader in the State Assembly until he stepped down to campaign, and his run for office received a boost when Rudolph W. Giuliani agreed to serve as his campaign chairman in June. He has raised a total of $3.5 million and has $2.7 million in cash.
William Mulrow, a little-known Westchester money manager and longtime Democratic fund-raiser, raised $1.27 million. His opponent in the Democratic primary, Alan G. Hevesi, the former city comptroller, raised $950,000, said Hank Morris, a campaign consultant. Mr. Hevesi is using $1.3 million left over from his mayoral campaign in 2001, and Mr. Mulrow has contributed about $1 million of his personal fortune.
Mr. Mulrow has raised more over all, but he also has spent more to overcome Mr. Hevesi's greater name recognition. That has left the two with just about the same amount of cash on hand: Mr. Mulrow has $2.6 million and Mr. Hevesi has $2.4 million. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 23, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Tuesday about Gov. George E. Pataki's campaign finances misstated the amount spent by the campaign since January on advertising to reach Hispanic voters. It was $400,000; the total for all advertising was $2.4 million. The article also misstated the language used in the ads for Hispanic voters. It was Spanish; none of the ads were in English.

HEADLINE: Taking Hold Of the Wheel 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
At one point yesterday afternoon, George W. Bush was beginning to look like the president with perhaps the worst market touch since Herbert Hoover. Every time he tried to sound reassuring, a few hundred points vanished from the Dow Jones industrial average.
 "This economy is coming back," Mr. Bush said in Alabama, assigning the blame for Wall Street's current problems in no small part to the "economic binge" of the late 1990's, when someone else was president. "That is the fact." 
 By 2:36 p.m., well after those reassuring words, the Dow had fallen to 8,245, off 439 points for the day and down more than 1,000 points since Mr. Bush began his first attempt at reassurance, in a speech last Tuesday. The index was less than 10 points above where it closed Sept. 21, when panic over the Sept. 11 attacks and expectations of a severe recession were at their heights.
But then the market turned around. The Dow ended the day off just 45 points for the day, nearly 400 points higher than it had been 84 minutes earlier.
"It was a classic one-day reversal," said Barton Biggs, the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley and a man who was often negative during the great bubble but recently has been forecasting a rebound. "It sure feels like a bottom."
Just why the market turned around is hard to say. Mr. Bush is right about the economy: the current statistics do look reasonably good. True, the telecommunications industry is still suffering from its wildly excessive investments before the bubble burst. But while consumer confidence has slipped recently, it remains far higher than it was last fall, when things seemed truly bleak. Now, a so-called double-dip recession seems unlikely.
But that was equally true a week ago. And it did not keep the market from plunging.
The answer to the market's fate in the near future -- whether this rebound will endure as the one on the day after the July 4 holiday did not -- is probably in the hands of two groups of investors, neither of them anything like Wall Street insiders. 
The first is individual investors. For most of the boom, and for a good part of the bear market that began in 2000, individuals could be relied upon to be more bullish than professional money managers when things looked bleak. Many had learned from the aftermath of the 1987 crash that buying the dips was a sure way to profits. When the pros became nervous, whether in 1998 when Asia was crumbling or in 2000, after the Nasdaq bubble began to burst, it was individuals whose orders to buy stocks helped to create startling reversals like the one seen yesterday.
Recently, the picture has been more mixed. "The last eight times they bought the dip, they lost money," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company. That string has clearly shaken the faith -- or perhaps the cash reserves -- of some Main Street investors.
But yesterday afternoon, it appeared that a lot of buying came from the small orders that are characteristic of individual investors. 
The second group is foreign investors, who for the first time in years have been unwilling to invest enough money in this country to offset the huge American trade deficits. That has hurt the dollar, and yesterday the euro sold for more than $1 for the first time since early 2000.
But foreign markets have not been any better than the American one -- prices in Britain, Germany and France are down more than 20 percent this year -- and a market recovery here could draw in more foreign money.
The farther away from a market investors are, the more details can get lost. To some in Europe, the weakness of the American market has appeared to be an indicator of a possible renewed recession here.
But the action within the American market does not appear to be forecasting a recession, despite the fact the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite are both well below where they were in September. 
Some companies most sensitive to the economy -- like 3M, Boeing, Honeywell and the Norfolk Southern railroad -- are more than 30 percent higher than they were then. But that strength has been offset by weakness in technology and telecommunications. I.B.M., SBC Communications and AT&T are all down 20 percent or more from September levels, as are Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, pharmaceutical companies facing political hostility.
Many investors will pay attention today to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who is scheduled to testify before Congress. Some Wall Street economists have started to suggest that the Fed, reacting to the stock market weakness, might actually lower interest rates further when it meets next month, even though the economic indicators do not indicate such a move is needed. Hints will be eagerly sought, and could have an impact on the market.
Then there is the issue that has riveted the attention of Congress and the media: the continuing accounting scandals. Some polls show that investors are horrified and say they have lost faith in auditors and corporate managements. But they also show there has been little selling because of the scandals and that a majority still thinks the stock market is a good long-term investment.
One thing that is clear is that many Wall Street professionals saw yesterday's recovery coming, just as they had -- wrongly -- seen rallies coming for most of last week. Stock index futures trade overnight, and provide a way for traders to bet on where the market is going. Consistently those overnight traders have bet that the rally is just around the corner.
Historically, the stock market has always done well for several months before a recession ends and for several months after the recovery begins. But that has not happened this time. Some point to the scandals, some suggest the economy is weaker than it looks and some, like John Lonski, the chief economist of Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, suggest there is a fear of war, whether with terrorists or in Iraq, that has held down prices.
And one part of the explanation may be simply following the herd. At the height of the bubble, there were many money managers who ignored measures of valuation and basically bought what was going up. That was called momentum investing.
Recently, there have been reports of the reverse -- momentum shorting -- particularly among the hedge funds that are willing to take bigger risks. That strategy involves selling stocks that have declined in a bet they will fall further.
Such sales are risky, but recently they have worked well. WorldCom, for example, looked very cheap based on its fundamental cash flow and earnings -- and then it turned out the fundamentals were fake.
But if the market does turn around, the result could be explosive, as the funds that have sold stocks short rush to buy to cut their losses.
"At some point, we'll have a whopper of a rally," Mr. Biggs of Morgan Stanley forecast. "But I don't know if this is the start."

HEADLINE: Bush and The Texas Land Grab 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Democrats and media hounds are baying under the wrong tree. The point in President Bush's business career where he took outrageous shortcuts was not at Harken Energy, but rather when he was grabbing land for a new baseball stadium in Arlington for his Texas Rangers baseball team.
 Mr. Bush broke no laws. Neither do the overwhelming majority of corporate executives. The cloud over the business world comes not so much from law-breaking as from avaricious bruising of the public interest. 
 The challenge is not catching criminals but injecting public scrutiny into a culture of cronyism in which executives, accountants, regulators and "independent" board members all ooze empathy for each other. 
When Asia had its economic crisis in 1997-98, Americans properly trashed its "crony capitalism." But we suffer from the same affliction ourselves, and President Bush will not address the issue seriously because cronyism has been his way of life -- the Bushes call it loyalty.
I have a stack of court documents from Arlington that portray the "sordid and shocking tale" of the Rangers stadium, as one lawsuit puts it. Essentially, Mr. Bush and the owners' group he led bullied and misled the city into raising taxes to build a $200 million stadium that in effect would be handed over to the Rangers. As part of the deal, the city would even confiscate land from private owners so that the Rangers owners could engage in real estate speculation.
"It was a $200 million transfer to Bush and Rangers owners," complains Jim Runzheimer, an anti-tax campaigner in Arlington.
William Eastland, a leading Republican in Arlington, is also outraged, and puts it this way: "You're using public money for a private purpose." Mr. Eastland was a Bush delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2000 but still believes that the Bush group behaved shadily and against the public interest. 
Local voters overwhelmingly approved the deal, so maybe we shouldn't get so exercised by star-struck local officials giving $200 million to rich baseball owners. But the most unseemly part of the deal was that Mr. Bush and the Rangers' owners conspired with city officials to seize private property that would be handed over to the Bush group.
"A group of wealthy and influential people threatened and traded their way into an unprecedented takeover of government power and private property in an awesome display of greed and avarice," charges a lawsuit by the landowners, in what strikes me as a fair recitation of events. Another suit charges that the deal "can only be described as astounding, unprecedented and blatantly illegal."
A copy of the secret agreement among Mr. Bush and the other Rangers owners shows that they intended to make money not just by running a baseball club but also by land speculation.
For example, one owner found a nice chunk of land and sent a memo suggesting that it "sounds like another condemnation candidate if you want to work the site into your master plan," according to the court documents. Another of the owners' internal memos casts a proprietary gaze on a property and declares: "We plan to condemn this land."
For a group of financiers to go around town admiring properties and deciding which to seize through the government power of condemnation so that they can acquire free land and speculate on it is appalling. Even Kazakhstan would blush at such practices.
Horace Kelton, for example, owned land that the Rangers wanted. The owners got Arlington to seize it, with the city paying less than $1.50 per square foot even though it had previously paid $10 a square foot for other land nearby.
"It was an extremely low price, and that's why we had a court case that lasted seven years," Mr. Kelton recalled. Eventually, his family got $11 a square foot.
In fairness, Mr. Bush was simply being a hard-nosed businessman. He did a great job leading the owners' group, and it's hard to take seriously the caricature of him as unintelligent when he led the Rangers so lucratively. Indeed, his $14 million profit on the Rangers financed his entry into politics.
But it's also a sordid tale of cronyism, of misuse of power, of cozy backroom money-grubbing -- a more pressing threat to American business than outright criminality.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE OVERVIEW; 
SENAT E APPROVES A BROAD OVERHAUL OF BUSINESS LAWS

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15 

 BODY:
The Senate tonight unanimously passed a broad overhaul of corporate fraud, securities and accounting laws to curb the abuses that have rocked Wall Street, and President Bush strongly hinted that he was inclined to sign almost any bill that emerged from negotiations by the Senate and the House.
 The vote, 97 to 0, came only a few hours after Mr. Bush, speaking in Birmingham, Ala., tried to restore investor confidence by declaring that the economy was coming back, but he warned that it had to work through a "hangover" after an "economic binge" that lasted much of the last decade. Excerpts, Page C4. 
 That hangover was much in evidence today as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged as much as 440 points during an unusually volatile day, only to recover and close down 45 points, or 0.5 percent, just before the Senate acted. Page C1. 
The dollar, meanwhile, fell below the value of the euro for the first time in two and a half years. That underscored how jittery the rest of the world has become about investing in the United States at a time of scandal and distrust of corporate earnings statements. But the weaker dollar may also speed an economic recovery by making American goods less expensive abroad.
The bill passed by the Senate tonight would create a new regulatory board with investigative and enforcement powers to oversee the accounting industry, limit the amount of consulting work auditors can perform and prohibit Wall Street investment firms from punishing honest research analysts whose reports anger clients of the firm. 
But it was far from clear tonight what form a final bill might take by the time it emerges from a conference committee where House and Senate versions of the legislation must be reconciled.
While President Bush said in a statement tonight that he was "pleased the Senate has now acted on a tough bill that shares my goals and includes all of the accounting and criminal reforms I proposed," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, suggested that Republicans might seek to scale back the long jail sentences included in the Senate version for corporate officers who mislead investors. He said it was important to review the legislation, which he voted for, to see "if we've gone too far."
Republicans said they might also seek to modify the powers of the federal board to oversee the work of the accounting industry. That new panel is a main element of the "Sarbanes bill" that passed tonight -- named for Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who has long championed these measures. 
Mr. Bush's speech today at the University of Alabama at Birmingham was the third time in a week he has tried to calm what his political advisers have described privately as a market panic that if unchecked could threaten Republican prospects in November.
But, as was the case when he spoke last week on Wall Street, Mr. Bush's reassuring words contrasted with the gyrations of the stock market that were playing out on television screens as he spoke.
"In order for us to have the security we all want," Mr. Bush said, "America must get rid of the hangover that we now have as a result of the binge, the economic binge we just went through. We were in a land of -- there was endless profit, there was no tomorrow when it came to, you know, the stock markets and corporate profits. And now we're suffering a hangover."
Mr. Bush never mentioned his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose presidency spanned most of the era Mr. Bush called a binge. Last week Mr. Bush was asked whether he blamed Mr. Clinton for any of the current economic troubles, and he said "no." His aides repeated that today.
The timing of final Congressional action on the corporate reform measure was unclear, although the President urged action before the summer recess.
"There's a lot of worry that the White House and others will try to string this out and water it down," Senator Jon S. Corzine, the New Jersey Democrat and a former top official of Goldman, Sachs, said today. President Bush's statement urged the House and Senate leaders to send him a bill before the August recess and said "we owe it to America's workers and shareholders to crack down on wrongdoing and fix the system to prevent future abuses."
Republican leaders said that a vote before the Congressional recess was possible, but far from certain. And within the Republican camp, some conservatives and free-marketeers argued that the recent market sell-off has been fueled by fear of a new era of government intervention in the capital markets. Democrats attributed the market decline to the opposite concern -- that the government would do too little, and the accounting abuses would continue.
That debate will almost certainly be a topic on Tuesday as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman who warned of "irrational exuberance" in the markets as stocks began soaring during the high-technology boom of the 1990's, testifies before the Senate Banking Committee. He is certain to be questioned sharply about whether the market swoon will threaten the entire economy, and his position in favor of forcing companies to expense stock options.
While Coca-Cola announced on Sunday that it would begin to include stock options on its expense reports, most other companies -- especially in high technology -- oppose that requirement. They lobbied heavily, and today the Senate blocked an amendment offered by Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat, calling on the Financial Accounting Standards Board to review the issue within a year. In 1994, the board, which sets the accounting rules for American businesses, proposed forcing companies to record stock options as an expense -- but it backed down under extraordinary pressure from senators. 
"The use of a technical blocking tactic to prevent a vote on my stock option amendment leaves one of the most important post-Enron reforms unaddressed," Mr. Levin said. "Huge amounts of stock options, which benefited mainly top executives, helped fuel Enron-type accounting deceptions."
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, said, however, that he planned to bring up the Levin amendment soon.
The Senate bill passed tonight was a result of a frenzy of bill writing in which Republicans and Democrats seemed to compete to show who could be tougher on corporate malfeasance. Amendments that were considered dead only a few weeks ago passed by comfortable margins.
The Senate bill includes a provision, sponsored by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat, calling for prison terms of up to 10 years for using any "scheme or artifice" to defraud investors; it is intended to make it easier for prosecutors to bring securities fraud cases.
Another provision also calls for prison terms of up to 10 years for senior executives of publicly traded companies who "recklessly" or "willfully" publish misleading financial statements. Other provisions increase penalties for criminal violations of federal employee-benefit laws intended to safeguard pension plans and lengthened maximum prison terms for conspiracy convictions related to white-collar offenses.
Now, the legislation will be sent to conference committee, where House and Senate lawmakers will work out the differences in the Sarbanes bill and a measure by Representative Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican, that passed in April. 
Some fundamental differences remain in the two approaches. Mr. Bush and House Republicans, for example, want the proposed new regulatory board to have less investigative and enforcement powers. "We want to make sure we don't have a board that is not accountable to anyone," one senior Republican aide said tonight.
Many Republicans also say that the Senate bill goes too far in requiring accountants to give up much of the consulting work for the same companies they also serve as auditors. This provision, although less sweeping than an outright ban, was inserted by Senator Sarbanes and his allies to make sure that auditors do not relax their scrutiny to please a company that pays them a lot of money for nonaudit services -- exactly what many senators suspect happened with Arthur Andersen and Enron.
Today, John Feehery, a spokesman for Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, predicted that the conference committee would begin this week. He said Mr. Hastert still supported the criminal penalties in the Sarbanes bill, but that on other issues he favors the approach taken in the House bill.
Republicans in the House are planning their own package of criminal-penalties legislation, to be introduced as soon as Tuesday, but the exact details were not clear tonight. 
A Democratic aide said, however, that drafts of the legislation indicated that Republicans planned to take out two crucial parts of the Senate proposal: provisions giving new protections to corporate whistle-blowers, and a requirement to retain important audit documents for five years. As expected, House Republicans also plan to delete Senate language that would lengthen the time plaintiffs' lawyers and defrauded investors have to file securities-fraud lawsuits against corporations.
Whatever the shape of the final bill, the White House's concern about the markets, and the message it sends about confidence levels, is rising quickly. Mr. Bush's aides say he was appalled at how the economic downturn of the early 1990's wiped out his father's hopes for a second term in 1992 after the military victory of the Persian Gulf war, and that he learned from the experience. Apparently by happenstance, his speech here came 10 years to the day after Mr. Clinton was nominated for president by the Democrats and won on a constantly repeated theme of "it's the economy, stupid." 
Mr. Bush has often told friends how he absorbed the lessons of the 1992 campaign, and he appeared today before a White House-created backdrop that repeated the words "Strengthening Our Economy." Such backdrops -- one last week read "corporate responsibility" -- are intended to send a message to TV viewers, "even those who keep the sound off," one Republican strategist noted last week.
There was no talk today of Congressional excess as lawmakers competed to show that they are in the lead in cracking down on corporate abuse. But inside the administration, concern about that movement continues. Vice President Dick Cheney, the former chief executive of Halliburton, has been the most outspoken in expressing those concerns, according to aides who have heard him question lawmakers about the potential consequences of their proposals. "His message," said one member of Congress who emerged from such a session," is that we are going to create disincentives for chief executives to take necessary risks, and that sooner or later we will pay an economic price."
Mr. Bush may share those concerns, but today he was focused on the metaphor of the economy as a binge drinker. At a $4 million fund-raising lunch today for Representative Bob Riley, who is seeking to unseat Alabama's Democratic governor, Don Siegelman, Mr. Bush -- who broke his record for a single fund-raising appearance -- described the era this way: "It is like we were on a binge, and the horizon was forever going up."

C5) Chart: "Legislation to Overhaul Accounting Practices"The Senate passed legislation last night that would tighten oversight of the accounting industry and increase criminal penalties for corporate fraud. It must now be reconciled with a less stringent version passed by the House. The Bush administration has said it shares the goals of the Senate bill but has problems with some aspects of it.

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: IN PAKISTAN; 
Man Convicted in Murder of Reporter Calls for Retaliation by Other Muslims

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: HYDERABAD, Pakistan, July 15 

 BODY:
With security heavy and officials bracing for a retaliatory attack, the man condemned today to death for the kidnapping and murder of the American reporter Daniel Pearl called on fellow Muslims to take revenge for the sentence.
 "We shall see who will die first -- either I or the authorities who arranged the death sentence for me," the condemned man, Ahmed Omar Sheikh, 28, said in a statement read by one of his lawyers here after the sentence was handed down. 
 "The war between Islam and nonbelievers is going on, and everyone should show whether he is in favor of Islam or in favor of nonbelievers," the statement continued, as Islamic groups in Pakistan also expressed outrage at the verdict.
Mr. Sheikh, a British-born former student at the London School of Economics, was one of four men convicted this morning on charges including murder, kidnapping and terrorism. He was the only one sentenced to death. His lawyers said he would appeal the sentence, which would be carried out by hanging. 
The other defendants, Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem and Shaikh Adil, were sentenced to life in prison. That usually means 25 years, though several lawyers said the actual time could be much less.
With the potential for violence very real, the verdicts were handed down by Judge Ali Ashraf Shah under extraordinary security. Six hundred police officers were stationed at the prison here in Hyderabad, where most of the three-month trial took place, including a line of sharpshooters on the roof. An additional 2,000 were posted around the city. 
In Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and the place where Mr. Pearl disappeared on Jan. 23, police vehicles and elite soldiers patrolled the streets tonight and posted themselves in front of consulates downtown.
"Terrorists, they've got hideous designs," said Moazzam Ansari, chief of police in Hyderabad, about 100 miles north of Karachi.
Mr. Ansari outlined possible terrorist threats, saying: "It could be toxins, it could be water contamination, it could be a car bomb. It could be an attempt to break the prison."
Several of the convicted men's lawyers called the verdict political, assured by Pakistan's embattled military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, under pressure from the United States, with which he is cooperating against terrorists. 
"Pakistan wants to please America," said Rai Bashir, a defense lawyer. 
The prosecutor, Raja Qureshi, denied that, saying: "It was absolutely a fair trial. No political influences."
But the accusations, widely believed here, seemed only to add to General Musharraf's troubles.
His partnership with the United States is unpopular, viewed by many as an alliance with the West against Muslims. His recent proposals to amend the constitution, part of what he says are plans to return Pakistan to democracy, brought so much criticism he felt obliged last week to defend them in a televised speech.
It was quiet tonight in Karachi, an often-volatile port city where anti-American sentiment runs high. A car mechanic, Mohamad Aurengzeb, 37, joked darkly that people were not protesting only because the Americans would not allow it. 
"All reactions depend on America," Mr. Aurengzeb said at a gas station in a lower-middle-class neighborhood outside downtown. "Nothing has to do with Pakistan. All food is America. Even we sleep and wear America.
Mr. Pearl, 38, was the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, disappeared after heading to a meeting with Mr. Sheikh. Mr. Sheikh reportedly promised to put Mr. Pearl in touch with a Muslim prayer leader who might have information about Richard C. Reid, a Briton accused of boarding a plane with explosives in his shoe in December. 
In May, the police recovered a headless body believed to belong to Mr. Pearl, though DNA tests have not been released.
Today, Mr. Pearl's family said in a statement they were "grateful for the tireless efforts by authorities in Pakistan and the United States to bring those guilty of Danny's kidnapping and murder to justice." 
The Bush administration praised today's verdicts, with Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman calling it " a further example of Pakistan showing leadership in the war against terror."

HEADLINE: Euro Edges Past The Dollar In a VictoryFor Europeans 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, July 15 

 BODY:
The euro became worth slightly more than the battered American dollar today for the first time in more than two years, giving Europeans a shot of pride at a time when many of them view the United States with some resentment.
 In a period when the United States is the world's only superpower, often perceived as selfish and unthinking about its European allies, today's little psychological victory of the euro over the dollar provided some not-so-sheepish satisfaction. 
 Analysts cautioned that the surge of the euro was largely about the weakness of the dollar, which they hoped would not fall too far too fast, dragging down the world economy. The dollar also fell to a near 10-month low against the Japanese yen and multiyear lows against the British pound and the Swiss franc. The euro finished United States trading at $1.0055. 
"Mentally and psychologically, it is important, yes," said Josef Janning, head of the politics division of the Bertelsmann Foundation.
Currencies go up and down, but they provide a rough judgment of the confidence of investors in national economies and markets. And even if this renewed equality is less about a strong euro than worries on Wall Street translating into a troubled dollar, "the effect is the same in the way Europeans feel vis-a-vis the United States," Mr. Janning said.
When the euro was weak -- as it has been for most of its three and a half years -- there was "a sense of decline felt in the society, especially in countries with a hard-currency background, like the old Deutsch mark zone," Mr. Janning said.
A stronger euro helps bolster the European economy by making it easier for the European central bank to control inflation without having to raise interest rates. But the weakening of the dollar is not all bad for the United States; in particular it benefits American manufacturers by allowing them to sell goods abroad more cheaply and enables them to compete more effectively against foreign rivals.
Some analysts said that Americans may now begin to take the euro seriously as a symbol of how far Europe's efforts at integration have come. "This is not the worst thing for the trans-Atlantic relationship," a senior German diplomat said.
The European Union, 15 countries working to expand to 25 by 2004, is already a rival to the United States in the size of its population and of its economy. And it is debating a new constitution to make it more efficient and perhaps more united.
But as a collection of nation-states that have different views about how much power to cede to Brussels, the union has viewed the euro -- like the common European passport -- as an important symbol of the reality of this experiment in shared sovereignty. And that makes the moment of its breakthrough especially significant to Europeans. 
The euro began life as a virtual currency on Jan. 4, 1999, worth about $1.18. As a measure of its member economies, whose currencies were then fixed at a certain rate against the euro, it created a more stable money based on a wider economic area. The idea was "to insulate the European economy from the volatility in the currency markets that had been devastating individual countries for 30 years," said Fabio Scacciavillani, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs in London.
But the euro immediately slid against the dollar, hitting a record low of 82.25 cents in October 2000, just after the Danes rejected joining the euro zone. The euro, as a physical currency with its own bills and coins, went into circulation in 12 of the 15 member states of the European Union on Jan. 1 of this year.
"Certainly, parity is a psychological boost that could have important repercussions that are more tangible," Mr. Scacciavillani said. "It's about confidence, and it could impact the availability of capital and lower long-term interest rates if people buy euro financial instruments."
But the fundamentals of the economies on either side of the Atlantic do not make a clear case for the long-term prospects of the euro against the dollar, he and others said.
Mr. Scacciavillani said that the weakness of the dollar was driven by concerns over the gaping trade deficit in the United States "and the need to finance this deficit at a time when stock markets are weak and not attracting much capital from abroad."
Oscar-Erich Kuntze, an international economist at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich, said, "What we've not had until recently is twin deficits in the United States," both a trade deficit and a budget deficit.
He said the deficits combined with the business scandals like Enron and Worldcom undermined "the credibility of the U.S. economy." 
That undermined credibility causes foreigners to pull money out of the United States and keep it in short-term investments denominated in euros, a senior German government economist said. "It's not really being invested right now," he said. 
The idea of parity is a form of magic, of no significance in strictly economic terms, Mr. Kuntze said. "But weakness in the euro does have a detrimental psychological effect on the Europeans," who are feeling a bit more optimistic, he said. 
"As a German I know how important psychology is in politics and economics," he said. "The strong German mark had such a strong effect on our psychology and this case may be similar."
With Germany in the middle of an election campaign centering on a weak economy and high unemployment, every little bit of good news can help the incumbent chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, who faces a strong challenge from the conservative Edmund Stoiber.
Still, Christoph Bertram, a well-known analyst, said the psychological impact would not be very deep. "For a while people thought that a strong currency is a virility symbol, but those days are gone," he said. "This won't lead to fireworks on Potsdamer Platz," the rebuilt center of a reunified Berlin.
At the same time, no one wants to see a collapse of the dollar and a large flight of capital from the United States. "If this happens in a bigger way," a senior German official said, "there will be a lot of fright."
Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform in London, said a stronger euro would provide help to those who want Britain to replace the pound with the euro. "It will put a bit of spring into the stride of the bedraggled pro-Europeans in this country," he said.
He said the euro's value was only one issue in a highly political decision for the Labor government. More broadly, he said, "if parity gets people in the United States to understand that the euro is there and won't go away, then it's good."

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS; 
Greek Fare in the Classic Home Tradition

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov; William Grimes is on leave.

 BODY:
FIVE years can be an eternity in the restaurant business. Some restaurants, built on the shaky bases of fashionable dishes and celebrity appeal, will have already been blown away. Others may have been too hyperactive to evolve gracefully or too sluggish to evolve at all. 
 Landlords, the economy, partnership disputes and a fickle public are but a few of the problems any restaurant will face. Just as thousands of small fry are born so that a few might survive, only a small percentage of restaurants make it to robust adulthood. 
 When Molyvos opened a little more than five years ago near Carnegie Hall, its food, solidly grounded in the traditions of Greek home cooking, earned hearty applause. Like most restaurants, though, Molyvos has not been immune to change. Rick Moonen, one of the founding partners and a consultant to the executive chef, Jim Botsacos, left recently to open his own restaurant, and the tourist economy, on which its business partly depends, has been slow.
Yet Molyvos shows few signs of faltering in the kitchen. Mr. Botsacos, who has been at Molyvos from the beginning, has almost imperceptibly tweaked the menu. Relying on the eternal appeal of traditional cooking and excellent ingredients, his newer dishes feel like graceful additions to the canon, but never like departures. 
From the long bar in the front, with booths and a large wooden communal table, to the airy room in the rear, its walls cluttered with urns and vases, black-and-white photos and maps, Molyvos is pleasingly informal. In a city where restaurants typically treat dining rooms as rush-hour subway cars, cramming too many tables into too little space, Molyvos is spacious enough to cross your legs or freely throw your arm over the back of a booth without fear of catastrophe.
While familiar Greek dishes dominate the menu, it's worth trying some of Mr. Botsacos's more recent additions, like one called Greek fava. In fact, this appetizer is not made with fava beans but with yellow split peas, mashed and whipped to a froth and served as an almost lighter-than-air flan. Mr. Botsacos has also added a fabulous roasted tomato soup with a tangy flavor that seems a mile deep, and a lovely salad of black-eyed peas woven through with tender pea shoots and slivers of oven-dried tomatoes.
Of course, it's hard to resist the old standbys, like the outstanding melitzanes salata, a light eggplant dip that resounds with the flavor of lively olive oil, which, along with tzatziki, a thick, refreshing yogurt made from sheep's milk, and oceanic taramasalata, the whipped cod roe dip, form an almost platonic ideal of Greek mezedes. Meaty pastitsio, served in a small ramekin and deftly touched with cinnamon and nutmeg, may be the best I've ever had, while baby octopus, grilled to a withered dryness on one occasion, was at its moist, smoky best on another. I was not won over by astringent stuffed grape leaves, but I was by an unusual version of dolmades, cabbage leaves stuffed with savory ground meat, in which simple flavors of olive oil and lemon gave an unmistakably Greek treatment of these more typically Eastern European ingredients.
The best main courses tend to be the most straightforward. The kitchen gives special care to the fresh fish grilled simply over wood, like a light, lemony branzino and the slightly richer, more strongly flavored dorade royale. Grilled grouper made an appealing combination with new potatoes, green beans and chickpeas, and baby lamb chops are perfect with no more than a sprinkling of salt and pepper. 
While lamb shanks, braised and baked in a clay pot, may seem like a hefty dish for summer, the meat is exceedingly juicy and tender, served with orzo and roasted tomatoes. But the rabbit in stifado, a slightly sweet stew made with red wine and pearl onions, was dried out, and a roasted leg of lamb, though flavorful enough, was also too dry.
Service is efficient and friendly, yet there seemed to be puzzling gaps in knowledge. Simple questions about Greek dishes and traditions required trips back to the kitchen for answers, all done willingly enough, but not what I expected. Similarly, the extensive wine list includes many Greek bottles, and waiters, though eager to advise on choices, were hard-pressed to say more than, "That one's dry, that's dry, too, and that one's really dry."
Desserts include many of the standards, like tart yogurt flavored with honey and walnuts, or a cylinder of baklava dripping with syrup, yet they are executed exceptionally well and served in enormous portions. I counted nine fritters on one plate -- each the size of a small doughnut, freshly made and drizzled with honey -- where maybe two or three would have done. Best of all was a sensational new dessert, a rough-textured walnut cake, flavored with olive oil, yet pleasingly sweet.
Molyvos retains its thoroughgoing Greek appeal, and despite the rough waters facing many restaurants these days as they chart their courses toward middle age, Mr. Botsacos has kept a steady hand on the tiller. His assurance about where Molyvos comes from imparts a sure confidence about where it is going.

HEADLINE: The Cycles of Financial Scandal 

BYLINE:  By Kevin Phillips; Kevin Phillips is the author of "Wealth and Democracy: A Political History of the American Rich."

DATELINE: GOSHEN, Conn. 

 BODY:
America is at a turning point. Corporate scandals, the fall of the stock markets, the sudden mobilizations in Washington of the last few weeks to legislate against some of the more egregious corporate abuses: they all indicate that the nation's attitude toward business is changing. It is potentially a bigger change than many politicians realize. What's unnerving them is that the payback from the market bubble of the late 1990's is becoming apparent to Main Street. The charts of the downside since March 2000 are starting to match the slope of the earlier three-year upside.
 Not that it's a new phenomenon. In the Gilded Age of the late 19th century and again in the Roaring Twenties, wealth momentum surged, the rich pulled away from everyone else and financial and technological innovation built a boom. Then it went partially or largely bust in the securities markets. Digging out is never easy. But this time, the deep-rooted nature of "financialization" in the United States that developed in the 1980's and 90's may make it even tougher. 
 Near the peak of the great booms, old economic cautions are dismissed, financial and managerial operators sidestep increasingly inadequate regulations and ethics surrender to greed. Then, after the collapse, the dirty linen falls out of the closet. Public muttering usually swells into a powerful chorus for reform -- deep, systemic changes designed to catch up with a whole new range and capacity for frauds and finagles and bring them under regulatory control.
Even so, correction is difficult, in part because the big wealth momentum booms leave behind a triple corruption: financial, political and philosophic. Besides the swindles and frauds that crest with the great speculative booms, historians have noted a parallel tendency: cash moving into politics also rises with market fevers.
During the Gilded Age, the railroad barons bought legislatures and business leaders bought seats in the United States Senate. In the last years of the 19th century, one senator naively proposed a bill to unseat those senators whose offices were found to have been purchased. This prompted a colleague to reply, in all seriousness, "We might lose a quorum here, waiting for the courts to act."
Over the last two decades, the cost of winning a seat in Congress has more than quadrupled. Legislators casting votes on business or financial regulation cannot forget the richest 1 percent of Americans, who make 40 percent of the individual federal campaign donations over $200. Money is buying policy.
Speculative markets and growing wealth momentum also corrupt philosophy and ideology, reshaping them toward familiar justifications of greed and ruthlessness. The 1980's and 1990's have imitated the Gilded Age in intellectual excesses of market worship, laissez-faire and social Darwinism. Notions of commonwealth, civic purpose and fairness have been crowded out of the public debate.
Part of the new clout and behavior of finance is so deep-rooted, however, that it raises questions that go far beyond the excesses of the bubble. In the last few decades, the United States economy has been transformed through what I call financialization. The processes of money movement, securities management, corporate reorganization, securitization of assets, derivatives trading and other forms of financial packaging are steadily replacing the act of making, growing and transporting things.
That transformation has many roots. Finance surged in the 80's partly because deregulation removed old ceilings on interest rates and let financial institutions offer new services. The rising stock market, in turn, drew money from savings accounts into money market funds and mutual funds, turning the securities industry into a huge profit center. Computers underpinned the expansion of everything from A.T.M.'s to scores of new derivative instruments by which traders could gamble with such dice as Treasury note futures or Eurodollar swaps. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department proved during the 80's and 90's that nothing too bad could happen in the financial sector, because Washington was always ready with a bailout.
Supported so openly, rescued from the stupid decisions and market forces that pulled down other industries, the finance, insurance and real estate sector of the economy overtook manufacturing, pulling ahead in the G.D.P. and national income charts in 1995. By 2000, this sector also moved out front in profits. It also became the biggest federal elections donor and the biggest spender on Washington lobbying.
The effects have been profoundly inegalitarian -- and not just in the loss of manufacturing's blue-collar middle class. In the last two decades, as money shifted from savings accounts into mutual funds, promoting the stock markets and the money culture, corporate executives became preoccupied with stock options, compensation packages and golden parachutes. "More" became the byword.
In the new management handbook as rewritten by finance, the concerns of employees, shareholders and even communities could be jettisoned to raise stock prices. Major companies could make (or fake) larger profits by financial devices: writing futures contracts, investing in stocks, juggling pension funds, moving low-return assets into separate partnerships and substituting stock options for salary expenses. Enron was only the well-publicized tip of a large iceberg.
A century ago, putting a new regulatory framework around abuses of the emergent railroad and industrial sectors became a priority. This effort largely succeeded. Whether another such framework must be put in place around finance in order to safeguard household economic security is a question that at the very least calls for a national debate. Whether the current proposals are the beginnings of that debate or mere window dressing remains to be seen.

HEADLINE: Canadian Auto Workers Open Talks With the Big 3 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 16 

 BODY:
The union representing 46,000 Canadian auto workers began talks today with the big three North American automakers on a new labor contract that might set precedents for similar talks next year in the United States. There were signs that the local unit of General Motors would be the union's primary, and most accommodating, target.
 G.M., Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler all have closely integrated their American and Canadian operations, with assembly lines in each country producing vehicles for the entire North American market. But for the first time in many years, bargaining on labor contracts is not taking place simultaneously in the two countries. 
 Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, told reporters at a downtown hotel here today that "we have the full attention of corporate executives on both sides of the Detroit River." Mr. Hargrove's union signed three-year contracts with the companies in 1999, while the agreements concluded by the United Auto Workers at the same time run for four years. The Canadian contracts expire Sept. 17.
Scott R. Hill, an analyst at Bernstein Investment Research and Management in New York, said that the talks in Canada would probably be dominated by demands for greater job security, while bargaining in the United States next year was likely to center on pensions and health benefits.
Canadian union officials presented their contract proposals to G.M. today. They are to meet with Ford on Wednesday and DaimlerChrysler on Thursday.
Al Green, vice president for personnel at General Motors of Canada, said that whatever deal was reached in Canada would not necessarily influence the parent company's talks next year with the U.A.W.
The union in each country usually selects as a target the company that it thinks will yield the most favorable deal. It negotiates, and if necessary takes job actions, against that company first. Whatever contract is reached with the target then becomes the basis for negotiations with the other two.
The union expects to announce its choice shortly after Labor Day. Echoing other industry watchers, Mr. Hill said that General Motors was "the likely initial target."
G.M. "could agree to a lot of things on plant closures that Ford and DaimlerChrysler would have difficulty agreeing to," Mr. Hill said. G.M. has been posting overall sales and profit gains in recent quarters, including a strong second-quarter report released today, while both Ford and DaimlerChrysler results are off from a year ago. The sales pattern in Canada is much the same.
Mr. Hargrove would not say directly which company the union intended to choose as its target, but he hinted that it would be G.M., saying, "If they're making money, as you head down to the deadline, they're much easier to deal with."
Mr. Green said his company would welcome being the initial target. "It gives us an opportunity to fashion an agreement that's most appropriate to us," he said. The Canadian union last chose G.M. as its bargaining target in 1984.
Flanked by a chart showing rising motor vehicle sales and falling jobs in Canada, Mr. Hargrove said that the union would be seeking to lower the present 10-year seniority threshold for workers to qualify for guarantees of work or income under the contract. The union was also asking for "substantial" wage increases and compensation for the reduction of benefits under Canada's public health system, Mr. Hargrove said.
All three automakers have recently announced plant closings in Canada. A G.M. plant at Ste. Therese, Quebec, that produces Camaro and Firebird sports cars is scheduled to close next month, eliminating 1,400 jobs. Ford plans to close a pickup truck assembly line at Oakville, west of Toronto, next year.
But G.M. recently added a shift at its large plant in Oshawa, east of Toronto, to step up output of Chevrolet Impala sedans. It also said last month that it would invest $195 million there to produce a new midsize Pontiac. "They have already provided the security that the union is asking for," Mr. Hill said.
Mr. Green said the main issue for his company was "intense competitive pressure," especially from foreign manufacturers, whose share of the North American market has risen markedly in recent years. He said G.M. would seek to lighten its expenses for retirees' pension and health care costs with "cost offsets," but declined to elaborate.

HEADLINE: G.M. Profit Doubles, but Worries on Pensions Hurt Stock 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 16 

 BODY:
Profit at General Motors more than doubled in the second quarter, the company said today, but its pension liabilities and its investment in Fiat continued to pull down its stock price.
 Foremost among Wall Street's concerns is how much money G.M. will have to inject into its huge pension fund to offset the falling value of its stock investments and maintain payments to its more than 400,000 American retirees. 
 G.M. said today that the value of its fund declined 3 percent in the first half of the year. Though that was far better than the 14 percent decrease in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the period, the company had projected a 10 percent gain this year. Such swings can require the injection of billions of dollars to make up the difference. 
Another worry is the $2.4 billion investment for a 20 percent stake in Fiat, the struggling Italian automaker. John M. Devine, the chief financial officer, said G.M. would take a substantial write-down of the value of that stake in the third quarter. 
The news overshadowed G.M.'s more positive news. The company earned $1.29 billion, or $2.43 a share, in the quarter, compared with $477 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $48.27 billion from $46.22 billion.
Excluding losses from its Hughes Electronics division, which it is selling, and nonrecurring charges, the company earned $2.63 a share, beating analysts' expectations of profit of $2.42 a share on that basis, according to Thomson First Call.
G.M.'s share of the United States auto market also increased, to 28.1 percent in the quarter from 27.3 percent in the quarter a year earlier. 
Shares of G.M. fell $2.08, or 4.3 percent, to $45.84. The stock closed as high as $68.02 in May. 
Despite momentum on sales and earnings, G.M. has not been able to shake concerns about how painful it will be to meet its pension obligations with the stock market sliding. G.M. said today that if its returns were flat for the year, its pension fund would be underfinanced by $12.7 billion, compared with $9.1 billion at the end of last year. But Mr. Devine said the situation was not nearly as dire as some analysts saw.
"Our cash requirements are significantly below what a lot of people have been guessing," he said.
Last week, Saul Rubin, an analyst at UBS Warburg who had been bullish on G.M., downgraded the stock to a hold from a buy solely because of the pension liability and said if investment returns stagnated the fund could have a $31 billion deficit by 2005 and jeopardize the company's plan to earn $10 a share annually by the middle of the decade. 
"If one ignores the pension fund, the G.M. story is a good one," Mr. Rubin wrote in a report. He added that it was "unfortunately impossible to ignore the pension issues."
There are also concerns from Wall Street that G.M.'s sales are driven by the company's big rebate and interest-free financing offers. Such incentives are good for car buyers but hugely expensive for G.M., as well as Ford and Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
Because of quality and reputation issues, the Big Three have to use far more incentives than foreign competitors to sell cars. Big Three incentives were more than $2,500 for each vehicle in June, while the average Asian car sold in the United States had incentives of $857, according to the Autodata Corporation, an industry research firm. 
Some analysts, though, think that G.M.'s steep stock decline since May makes it an attractive bargain. Scott Hill, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said if the economy recovered in the second half, as he expects, G.M. would gain twice as much. Not only will its business be strengthened, but a recovering market will change its pension outlook.
"The risk to the pension plan hasn't changed in the last two years," he said. "What's changed is that each time the market swoons, it exacerbates the negative issues." 
Mike Holton, an analyst at the investment firm T. Rowe Price, had a similar view.
"If you are worried about the economy and the market, then clearly G.M. has issues," he said. "However, if you think we're heading to a better economy in the second half and gaining traction in 2003, that's clearly positive for G.M. and the automakers. And along with that, you figure the capital markets will act better."

HEADLINE: As Recession Drags On and Coalition Crumbles, Turkey's Premier Calls Early Elections 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL SIMPSON 

 BODY:
Turkey's ailing prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, succumbed to the inevitable yesterday and agreed to early elections, in November, after more defections from his wobbly coalition brought it below a majority in Parliament.
 The three-party coalition has been crippled by bickering over reforms that are a condition for talks on joining the European Union. 
 Mr. Ecevit's hand was forced by an exodus from his own Democratic Left Party this month of almost half of its members in Parliament, making it the smallest party in the coalition instead of the biggest. 
Mr. Ecevit, who is 77 and has been sidelined for weeks with illnesses that include a spinal disorder and Parkinson's disease, plans to soldier on until the elections, which will be 18 months earlier than required.
Although six more members resigned from the party yesterday, Mr. Ecevit persuaded a bloc of nine to stay, apparently removing the threat of a vote of no confidence as the political focus shifts to the election campaign.
Deputy Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Devlet Bahceli's Nationalist Action Party, now the biggest party in the coalition, had promised not to block reforms needed for European Union membership, in return for setting an election date.
"We will start working toward recalling the Parliament as soon as possible," Mr. Yilmaz said, "at the latest by the end of this month, to make the necessary legal amendments for E.U. membership."
All three parties in the governing coalition are fighting for their survival. None can be sure of clearing the threshold of 10 percent of votes that they would need to be returned to Parliament.
Opinion polls indicate that the new Justice and Development Party, forged a year ago from the ashes of a banned Islamic party, is by far the most popular with voters.
Many of the defectors from Mr. Ecevit's party are expected to join a new centrist party being formed by his most prominent former allies. They jumped ship fearing that the political deadlock could jeopardize the ambition of Turkey, NATO's only mostly Muslim country, to join the European Union and to receive a $16 billion International Monetary Fund loan.
The stakes are high for this country of 65 million, which is suffering from high unemployment and its worst recession since 1945. They are also high for the United States, which needs a compliant and stable ally as a base if it decides to proceed with military action against neighboring Iraq.
Financial markets appeared to be relieved that the election had been called after weeks of bluster and uncertainty that have pushed the currency, the lira, to all-time lows and increased Turkey's already huge debt service. But the outcome is uncertain.
The new centrist group, announced last week by former Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, is expected to attract support in the big cities. But it needs time to develop effective party machinery, and Mr. Ecevit appears to be banking on elections as the best way to thwart its challenge.
"At the last minute, coalition leaders agreed on an early election in an effort to preserve their strength," said Dr. Ahmet K. Han, a political scientist at Bilgi University in Istanbul. "Their aim is surely to dissolve the new formation, given its organizational uncertainties."
Mr. Bahceli plans to make Turkey's European Union candidacy an election issue. He opposes membership because of requirements to abolish the death penalty and to ease curbs on the use of the Kurdish language by the country's ethnic Kurds.
His party, which is seeking voters in more nationalistic rural areas, insists that concessions to the Kurds would encourage them to renew a separatist revolt. The captured Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was sentenced to death for treason, has been granted a stay of execution pending a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights.

HEADLINE: John J. Gilbert Is Dead at 88; Gadfly at Corporate Meetings 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
John J. Gilbert, one of the earliest and most persistent gadflies to speak out at annual meetings on behalf of small shareholders -- dramatizing his demands with such attention-getting props as a red clown's nose -- died on Monday at his daughter's home in Denver. He was 88.
 Margot Gilbert Frank, his daughter, said he became ill last September while attending a reception to honor his establishment of a chair in accounting at the University of Denver. He never returned to his home in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Gilbert and his older brother, Lewis, each attended more than 80 annual meetings a year to press what they called corporate democracy. By persistently questioning chief executives -- not a few of whom considered it badgering -- they succeeded in prodding more companies to hold annual meetings in accessible locations, to issue post-meeting reports, to limit stock options for executives and to require the independent auditors of companies to attend meetings.
Some companies were persuaded to adopt one of the Gilberts' pet ideas, cumulative voting for directors, which improves the chance of minority shareholders to name board representatives. Under this method, shareholders are permitted to cast all their votes for one candidate.
As a result of cumulative voting, "we can get honest directors on the board," Mr. Gilbert argued. "We want to keep these companies honest."
Mr. Gilbert brought more flair to the campaign than his more cerebral brother. At a PepsiCo meeting, he donned his clown nose and asked why none of the directors were wearing PepsiCo ties.
After being kicked out of a Chock Full o' Nuts meeting, he returned the next year with two pairs of boxing gloves hanging from his neck.
The result approached outright theatricality in settings where a few shareholders had formerly gathered in small numbers to quickly and quietly pass the management agenda. Wilma Porter Soss, who once dressed as a cleaning woman to protest the quiz show scandals at CBS, and Evelyn Y. Davis, who waved an American flag at a General Motors meeting, were others who brought showmanship to the fight for shareholder rights. Sometimes, all appeared at the same meeting.
But the Gilberts were leaders. In 1983, they proposed 198, or 20 percent, of the 972 resolutions proposed at annual meetings, according to the American Society of Corporate Secretaries. The next closest, with 100, was Andrew W. Duncan, a champion of conservative causes.
John Jacob Gilbert was born in Manhattan on May 8, 1914. His father had owned part of a paper mill, but sold it and lived from investments.
"I was born with a silver spoon and polished it," Mr. Gilbert said. He attended private schools and graduated from Patrick Business School, since closed, in Manhattan.
He and his brother started attending annual meetings in the 1930's, at first just to watch over their investments. But Mrs. Frank -- who along with three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren survives Mr. Gilbert -- said they were "appalled" at what they saw.
"It was like going to a private club," she said. "It was the good old boys."
So they amassed relatively small blocks of stock in 1,500 companies, initially as an investment. Because of this, their early complaints often concerned companies that paid no dividends, but greatly increased executives' compensation.
Mr. Gilbert considered his 1946 stand against the insurance company Transamerica a defining moment for outside shareholders. He proposed moving its annual meeting from Delaware, the state of incorporation, to California, where operations were. He further proposed that shareholders approve management's choice of auditors, and that those who could not attend be provided minutes.
A result was that the Securities and Exchange Commission began to require that relevant shareholder resolutions be included in proxy statements. Mr. Gilbert called this ruling "the Magna Carta" for small shareholders. Not only did this propel his push for shareholders' economic rights, but such diverse shareholders as unions and churches started using proposals in proxies to advocate social and political causes.
For 40 years, ending in 1979, the Gilberts published an annual compendium of activities at corporate meetings. They, of course, were often at the center of the action.
At a Macy's annual meeting in 1963, for instance, John Gilbert railed against "management stooges."
Jack I. Strauss, the company's chairman, replied, "Mr. Gilbert, we love you."

HEADLINE: VISIONS OF GROUND ZERO: AN APPRAISAL; 
An Agency's Ideology Is Unsuited to Its Task

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
Six plans for redeveloping the World Trade Center site are now on view at Federal Hall, the landmark Greek Revival building on Wall Street half a block north of the New York Stock Exchange. Except as a starting point for public discussion, the plans have little to recommend them. 
 And the discussion should extend far beyond the narrow, not to say provincial, scope of the task that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the state agency created after Sept. 11, has defined for itself. Thus far, it has demonstrated little besides a breathtaking determination to think small. 
 Don't come looking for ideas that reflect the historic magnitude of last year's catastrophe. Nor will you find any sign of recognition that ground zero has become a tragic symbol of the troubled relationship between the United States and the rest of the world. What you see, instead, are proposals for real estate development: six ways to slice the pie. 
The plans, which will also be presented this Saturday at a town hall meeting at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, are more notable for similarities than differences. All of them meet the same quotas for mixed-use development: 11 million square feet of office space, and 600,000 square feet each for retail space and a hotel. These figures represent the amount of space lost.
To a greater or lesser extent, all of the plans reintroduce the Manhattan street grid to divide the 16-acre site into smaller parcels. In each, Greenwich Street would cut through from north to south, while Fulton Street would cut from east to west. All but one of the plans envision a memorial park or green space.
The differences lie mainly with the number and shape of the individual parcels, and with the inclusion or not of superblocks containing multiple high-rise buildings. There are also implied ideological differences. Two plans reflect the New Urbanist retro theme park approach favored by Alexander Garvin, vice president for architecture and planning for the development agency. The superblock proposals evoke presently disfavored planning strategies employed by modern architects in the mid-20th century.
Three of the six plans should not even be considered in their present form. Gov. George E. Pataki is correct to insist that the footprints of the twin towers should not be built upon. Half the plans fail to respect the symbolic sanctity of this ground. 
Otherwise, the distinctions are superficial. All six plans emanate from the underlying ideology of privatization, which is what public debate should be focused upon. These plans represent a crisis for the increasing privatization of the city planning process through its vehicle of choice, the public-private real estate development process. As the most ambitious model of this vehicle yet realized, the development corporation itself deserves far closer scrutiny than the plans it has set out.
(Disclosure: The New York Times Magazine is sponsoring an architectural study project on the future of the financial district. I have advised the editors on the composition of the design team. An overview is scheduled for publication in September.)
As a planning agency, the development corporation is multiply redundant. Since the Koch administration, New York's woefully understaffed Department of City Planning has steadily deteriorated into an engine for economic development. A second city agency, the Economic Development Corporation, performs the same function, on a more explicit basis. The Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency created to build subsidized housing, also funnels resources into profit-making ventures.
Meanwhile, business improvement districts, like the Alliance for Downtown New York, have also subsumed planning functions within commercial considerations. Another agency, geared to the same market-driven agenda, was scarcely needed.
However, the Law of the Instrument states: The instrument must be used. It is not in the nature of bureaucracies, once created, simply to wither away. Although the development corporation merely adds a new layer of officialdom to an already overcrowded field, it must justify its existence by undertaking what appear to be tasks it is uniquely qualified to perform. Leaving aside, for now, the experience or competence of the corporation's officials in city-making, the authority by which the agency operates is open to question.
Clearly, that authority does not derive from cultural values. Though we have been told to expect an international architectural competition to design a memorial, and despite vague allusions to something called "cultural programming" (a contradiction in terms), no effort has been made to solicit guidance from thinkers, historians or economists, or from any architects or groups known for depth of historical awareness. This is an astonishing oversight at a time when the architectural field is crackling with ideas for rejuvenating older urban centers for the era of globalization.
What we see, instead, are the usual strategies employed to foster an image of expertise. Chief among these is secrecy. Despite an outward display of transparency, the agency has gone about its business with a remarkable lack of candor. Though a competition to design site plans was heralded with much fanfare, for example, two of the six plans were prepared by Peterson Littenberg, a New York firm retained independently by Mr. Garvin.
Peterson Littenberg's plans are not identified as such in the Federal Hall exhibition. Indeed, the display provides no provenance for any of the plans. But those who have been tracking the story closely will recognize that one of the plans originated with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, a firm retained by Larry Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease on the property. Another plan is based on a concept developed by Cooper, Robertson & Partners, architects for the Brookfield Properties Corporation, owner of most of the World Financial Center.
While Beyer Blinder Belle, the New York firm selected in the competition, has tweaked these plans, the failure to attribute authorship is a public disservice.
Without this information, we might as well be looking at Rorschach tests, or floor plans for luxury condominiums. All that's missing from these decontextualized images are the names. Do you prefer "The Greenwich" duplex, say, or "The Wall Street" suite?
There is a Potemkin quality to the development corporation's planning efforts. We're never quite certain whether the agency is talking about actual proposals, plans that stand a chance of implementation, or pipe dreams that will fade away after the election for governor this November.
Without the power to implement its plans (this power resides with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the owner of the site), the development corporation is "like" a planning agency and the six proposals are "like" plans. In precisely the same fashion, this Saturday's town hall meeting will be "like" democracy. Five thousand people will be invited to weigh in, but who will hold the microphone?
Let's put this undertaking back in context. Here is the news of the day. The financial marketplace is in disarray. Markets for publishing, music, art, fashion and other New York-centric industries have all been affected. Last year's attack on the twin towers was a contributing factor. Along with the Enron scandal, it helped to precipitate widespread challenges to the conduct of business as usual.
And here, in the geographical midst of the disarray, is the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, going about business as usual with what to this observer looks a lot like a vengeance. Our public-private development machines must press on, regardless of the actual need for square footage, with no consideration for the conflicts of interest and the lack of accountability that they typically involve. It is hard for the city lover to stomach the enlistment of architecture in such an unworthy cause.

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Nuclear Fears Have to Stand in Line 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: MANCHESTER TOWNSHIP, N.J., July 16 

 BODY:
The talk was of terrorists and the possibility that they might strike 15 miles from here at Oyster Creek, the nation's oldest operating commercial nuclear plant. But as she stood in line last weekend to collect federally issued potassium iodide tablets -- a precaution in case of radiation exposure -- Marcie Ekelmann said that in the event of an attack, she would most likely opt for something less medicinal, but perhaps more soothing.
 "Chances are it will be too late," she said, "so I'll just grab a six-pack and head out onto my boat." 
 Sunglasses perched atop her head, Ms. Ekelmann, 36, said she was collecting her handful of foil-covered pills mostly to calm the fears of her three children. But for herself, she waved away talk of any barleyfree precautions: "I think there is a lot of worrying over nothing." 
She might well have been speaking for much of the rest of New Jersey. Residents of other communities in the New York region that are near nuclear reactors -- the Indian Point plant in New York and Millstone in Connecticut -- have been moved to anxiety and activism by fears of terrorism. But the response has been noticeably muted in New Jersey, which has four nuclear plants.
Distributions of potassium iodide tablets here have drawn a small fraction of the takers they have attracted elsewhere. The public debate over other steps that might be taken to prevent nuclear terrorism has been more subdued. And people on all sides of the debate say there is a perceptible nonchalance about potential dangers here that may be born of such factors as income levels, the chemical hazards common in New Jersey (insert your own toxic waste joke here) and this state's somewhat cynical view of itself.
"Bad things are part of being in New Jersey," said Frank Kasmer, 43, a maintenance worker in an Atlantic City casino who lives about a mile from the Oyster Creek plant. "It's a part of being everywhere. People in New Jersey have that type of attitude -- you have to take the good with the bad."
New Jerseyans are well acquainted with the painful toll of terrorism: nearly one of every five people killed in the World Trade Center attack was from the state. There is a growing chorus of residents concerned about a possible nuclear disaster, and state emergency officials remain at their highest state of alert.
Still, the vague threat of calamity has left many here unfazed.
"Perception is always worse than reality," said Dr. Barry E. Truchil, a sociologist at Rider University. "If you look at what New Jersey has faced -- we've had anthrax scares, chemical dumping in Toms River, the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, we have Superfund sites -- New Jersey has a lot of reality that they can use to put this risk into context.
"It may be a false sense of security, but it also qualifies why people may not react in a loud, scary way."
Their silence may also stem from the location of the state's reactors, in small towns in South Jersey, far from densely settled places like Westchester County, N.Y., where Indian Point sits. The Oyster Creek reactor is in Forked River, about 80 miles south of Manhattan on the Jersey Shore. The Hope Creek and the Salem 1 and 2 generators are clustered in Lower Alloways Creek Township, in the southwesternmost corner of the state. 
"This is a small town, and I don't think they've had anything happen here yet," Dolores Aviles, a waitress at the Forked River Diner, said of the threat of terrorism. "You're closer to it in New York, so you're more likely to be sensitive to it."
Consider the turnout for potassium iodide pills on Saturday at Manchester High School, about 15 miles north of Oyster Creek -- one of five giveaways planned statewide during the next few weeks.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has offered the pills to everyone who lives or works within 10 miles of any of the nation's 74 nuclear power plants, suggesting that the tablets be ingested in the event of radiation exposure. Officials say the pills prevent cancer-causing radioactive iodines from invading the thyroid.
At Manchester High, residents took home only about 4,000 of the 100,000 doses that Ocean County emergency officials had on hand. Three times as many pills were distributed last month during a similar handout in Rockland County, N.Y., across the Hudson River from Indian Point in Buchanan. Rockland has about half the population of Ocean County, but had stocked almost twice as many pills.
Likewise, there are more potassium iodide pills than people in Westport, Conn., where town officials last month bought 50,000 doses -- a figure roughly twice the town's population. And Westport is not even within the 10-mile radius in which the pills are recommended; Indian Point is more than 40 miles away, and the Millstone plant is more than 60 miles away, in Waterford, Conn.
Dr. Truchil wonders if the difference in the public response can also be traced to economics. The median income levels in Rockland and Westchester Counties are at least $15,000 more than those in Ocean and Salem Counties.
"The higher up the social plane you are," he said, "the more likely you are to have the wherewithal to deal with governments, the more likely you are to know how to work the system," he said.
In smaller, more remote communities, a power plant can also be a major economic engine, a provider of jobs and money. That is the case in Salem County, where an antinuclear group, the Unplug Salem Campaign, has been urging since September that all four New Jersey plants be closed because of the terrorist threat and other potential hazards. 
A similar campaign to close Indian Point has drawn hundreds of supporters to rallies. But the response in South Jersey has been disappointing, said Norm Cohen, a coordinator of the campaign.
"Salem County is unfortunately an econmically depressed area," he said. "People are looking at day-to-day realities like putting food on the table."
The group has actually been more successful in marshalling opposition the farther it gets from the Salem plant. But it is still difficult to mobilize New Jerseyans over issues of plant safety, advocates say.
"They don't seem concerned, but I think that people certainly need to be concerned," said Joe Deckelnick, an organizer with the New Jersey Environmental Federation, which has tried to focus public attention on ecological threats from the plants.
He attributes much of the indifference he has seen to a belief that safeguards will prevent accidents like the one in 1986 at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union. But he said Sept. 11 had shown the dangers of such assumptions. 
"We're not talking about people who think the way we think," he said of terrorists. "Certainly, if they could fly a plane into the trade towers, they can fly a plane into a nuclear plant."
Even if that were to occur, experts in nuclear power say that a large-scale catastrophe is unlikely.
"The chances are just very, very small that you'll get a large leaking of radiation," said Raymond W. Durante, a Washington consultant on nuclear power issues.
Mr. Durante, a former official with Westinghouse Electric, a manufacturer of nuclear plants, said the buildings designed to contain nuclear reactors in the United States were stronger than those in other countries. That, he said, would prevent major radiation exposure.
He conceded that in an extreme case like Sept. 11 -- heavily fueled jets striking power plants at sensitive points and starting hard-to-extinguish fires -- "we'd see a lot of serious damage, a lot of problems related to nonnuclear equipment."
But even then, at least four layers of protective coverings around the radioactive core must be destroyed before there is any serious danger of extreme radiation exposure, Mr. Durante said.
Emergency management officials have ordered extra security measures outside the state's nuclear plants since September. National Guard posts and loaded dump trucks in front of entrances at Oyster Creek are just some of the visible signs of the security changes. "Everything that can be done is being done," said Capt. William A. Nally, deputy coordinator of emergency management for Lacey Township, which includes Forked River.
Many people here seem content to leave the worrying to someone else. Even those who stopped by Manchester High for potassium iodide pills seemed to do so more out of curiosity than concern.
Carole Lake, 55, a software saleswoman from Bayville, a town that was evacuated last month because of a fire in the pinelands that ravaged 1,300 acres, said the blaze was a reminder that some preparations can be pointless. "I have plenty of bottled water and an evacuation route, if necessary," she said, "but it'll be useless if we all get vaporized anyway."

HEADLINE: June Industrial Production Rose; Gain of 0.8% Beat Expectations 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve reported today that production at factories, mines and utilities increased in June for a sixth consecutive month, jumping by 0.8 percent, the largest monthly increase since October 1999. The report on industrial production showed a stronger performance than the 0.5 percent many analysts had been expecting. 
 The output of automobiles and parts, home electronics and computers, and office equipment rose. Declines were reported in appliances, furniture and carpeting. 
 "Manufacturing activity is gaining momentum," said Stan Shipley, senior economist with Merrill Lynch.
Industrial production in May was revised slightly higher, to 0.4 percent compared with the 0.3 percent advance the Fed estimated a month ago.
Factories alone rose 0.7 percent in June. Output at mines expanded 1.1 percent, and production by utilities increased 1.6 percent.
"The growth was widespread across manufacturing industries since 17 of the 20 major industries within the manufacturing sector experienced growth in June," said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI.
Also encouraging, Mr. Meckstroth said, was an increase in business capital equipment and a 0.6 percent gain in communications equipment, an industry that had been shrinking.
The Fed said capacity utilization rose sharply, to 76.1 percent from 75.6 percent in May, a sign factories were using more resources to increase production.
The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified to the Senate Banking Committee today that the economy was "poised to resume a pattern of sustainable growth," but had been hampered by uncertainty over the revival of profitability, fears of terrorism, and the recent corporate scandals and resulting lack of investor confidence.
Some economists worry that higher unemployment, the wave of scandals and the sour stock market might dampen the willingness of consumers to spend and businesses to invest, which would slow the economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Arafat's Role Is in Dispute During Talks in New York 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
The administration and its major Middle East mediating partners agreed yesterday on the broad goal of creating a Palestinian state within three years, but differed sharply on almost everything else, including the future role of Yasir Arafat and the correct degree of emphasis on security as a condition for resuming peace talks with Israel.
 In a daylong series of meetings in New York, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and top envoys from the United Nations, the European Union and Russia discussed how to create fresh momentum for political talks in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The group, which styles itself the Quartet, said in a statement that it remained committed to "promote a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement." 
 But even in public comments intended to be upbeat, the diplomats could not avoid revealing differences over specifics. 
Speaking just hours after the latest bomb attack in Israel, Secretary Powell made his strongest acknowledgment yet that the administration had abandoned its brief springtime effort to jumpstart political talks while working to provide economic assistance to Palestinians and crack down on terrorism.
"I wish they could all move in parallel," Secretary Powell said at a news conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan. "But until we get a better handle on the security aspect of it, and until we get a little more movement on the humanitarian side of it, they will be parallel, but they will not exactly be in synchronization with one another."
But a different view came from the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, who while acknowledging the need for better security said there would have to be swift progress on the other fronts or terrorism would continue. "Even if the security track gains some traction, unless we show some progress on the other tracks, that would not work, that would also fail," Mr. Annan said. 
Except when pressed by reporters, the officials seemed to go out of their way to avoid discussing Mr. Arafat's future role. Parrying the question yesterday, Secretary Powell said, "Most of our time was spent on real, concrete things, and we did not spend a great deal of time on personalities."
But in an interview with the ABC News program "Nightline" on Monday, he said under repeated questioning that he would be "more than willing to consider" an arrangement in which Mr. Arafat remained as a kind of figurehead leader in a Palestinian government with a different prime minister who exerted day-to-day control. 
Mr. Annan -- along with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia and Javier Solana, the European Union's national security chief -- said Mr. Arafat was still regarded as the legitimate Palestinian leader.
"It is only for the Palestinians to decide who they want to have as their leaders," Mr. Ivanov said. "It is the sovereign right of the Palestinian people. As for Chairman Arafat, he is the legitimately elected leader of Palestine and while he is in this capacity we will continue to maintain our relations with him."
As for when Israel should begin easing its occupation of the West Bank, none of the officials gave a time frame; but in the group statement, they said it should do so "as security improves through reciprocal steps."
Secretary Powell also said Washington was close to presenting specific new ideas for security cooperation between Israel and a restructured Palestinian security force, and Mr. Solana said he expected that an American-led delegation would go to the region within two weeks to begin work on such an effort, probably with Arab assistance. 
Secretary Powell also met separately yesterday with the foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan, who then met with the other officials at Mr. Annan's East Side town house last night. Together with the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Arab ministers are to go to Washington on Thursday for further talks with Secretary Powell and with President Bush at the White House.
After his meeting with Secretary Powell yesterday, Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher of Jordan said that although he and his Arab colleagues remained committed to working out specific benchmarks and a "work plan" that would lead to Palestinian statehood within three years, devising the specifics would take more time. "I think it's too optimistic to get it today," he said, "but I think all the parties are committed." 
In fact, senior American officials said, much quiet work is under way among Europeans, Arabs, international institutions like the World Bank and the Palestinians themselves on how to restructure Palestinian security forces and civilian society, and how to provide economic and relief assistance to a Palestinian population facing crisis conditions in the West Bank and Gaza.
"We obviously do have tactical differences" over how to handle Mr. Arafat, which occupied "two or three minutes" of discussion yesterday, one senior administration official said. "But again, what was striking was the degree of strategic agreement" on the need for Palestinian reform, increased security and relief assistance.
Secretary Powell said there had been discussion of how best to provide financial aid. The United States is urging its allies to contribute through international relief organizations, instead of directly to the Palestinian Authority.
Israel has said that European Union money provided directly to the authority has effectively been siphoned off to support terrorism, but Mr. Solana took umbrage at that notion yesterday, saying briskly, "I want to tell you that the donors community's resources that go to the Palestinian Authority, including the European Union, has more controls than any other donors community contributed to any other country in the world."
Mr. Annan said Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel had called him before the meeting yesterday to advocate a "worldwide humanitarian operation to alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people."
"Of course we shall have to find out more details about that," Mr. Annan added, "but meanwhile the Quartet agreed that full humanitarian access would be the fastest way to begin improving the plight of the Palestinians." 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 19, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about talks in New York on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict misstated the title of Javier Solana, a European Union official who took part. He is the high representative for common foreign and security policy, not the national security chief. The article also misidentified the location of a bombing attack on a bus that coincided with the talks. It was near the Immanuel settlement in the West Bank, not inside Israel's pre-1967 borders.

HEADLINE: In Westchester, a New High School Builds on Diversity 

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Under most circumstances, David Distant and David Gallagher probably would never have met each other.
 Last fall, David Distant was a freshman at Woodlands High School in Greenburgh in central Westchester County. David Gallagher was a freshman at Harrison High School in a mostly white and more affluent community on the eastern side of the county. 
 This winter, though, the two Davids became classmates. They are members of the first class of the Westchester Magnet Academy, an experiment started in late January on the Purchase College campus here that brings together some 55 students from three quite different school districts -- Greenburgh, Harrison and Irvington -- for the express purpose of creating a more diverse school. The program's first group has 25 black students, all from Greenburgh, and 19 white students, 4 Hispanic, one Asian and 6 who classify themselves as multiracial. 
Created in collaboration with Purchase College of the State University of New York, the magnet school was set up to address an issue that few people in Westchester speak about but everyone tacitly understands. As a hodgepodge of more than 40 cities, towns and villages, most with a distinct economic profile, Westchester provides relatively few opportunities for racial and economic integration in its schools. School systems are either overwhelmingly white or overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, with only a few schools like New Rochelle and White Plains High Schools providing genuine opportunities for mingling.
"Some of the kids from the other schools hadn't seen so many African-Americans before," said Melva Lloyd, who, like David Distant, came from the Greenburgh Central 7 district. 
The school, which received a $2 million three-year grant from the United States Department of Education, is neither an academically selective school like Stuyvesant, the entrance-exam-driven high school in New York City, nor an alternative school for troubled students. And the mix of schools participating in the program makes for somewhat unlikely bedfellows. Harrison is a place where millionaires live behind gates and working-class residents dwell in modest homes on small lots or in apartment buildings. Irvington, a village nestled on the Hudson River, is predominantly wealthy and white. And Greenburgh has an economically diverse black population, along with a substantial number of whites, who live primarily in the hamlet of Hartsdale.
"There are lots of suburban communities that are in decent shape, and attract large numbers of black and Latino students," said Gary Orfield, a professor of education and social policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "Then whites move out, and they become minority schools, and lose that diversity of community. There's far too little cooperation among suburbs to address the issue of integration." 
Partly because the school has not yet completed a full academic year -- the first semester ended last month -- and partly because the school is so small, the outcome of Westchester's experiment is still uncertain.
While the concept has been embraced enthusiastically in Greenburgh and Harrison, the decidedly lukewarm response in Irvington suggests that the program is less attractive to students and parents in that wealthy community.
Consider the selection process at each school. In Greenburgh, where there were 75 applicants for that district's allocation of 30 slots, the district assigned placement by lottery, a procedure it is using for next year's class as well. A similar process is being used in Harrison, where 37 students have applied for the 15 slots allocated to that district for next year. By contrast, Irvington so far has 11 prospects for its 15 slots in next year's freshman class. This year's 10 students were recommended by the high school guidance counselors or school psychologist.
After only a semester in operation, it is also too soon to tell if the Magnet Academy's ideal of racial amity will take root. 
"There hasn't been complete intermingling, but there hasn't been overt tension," said Bill Gladstone, the social studies teacher. "It's not the same integration model that used to exist. These things shouldn't matter. The point is to give as many kids as possible a different educational opportunity." 
Still, the Magnet Academy's supporters remain optimistic about the program. "People are opting to come back into the public schools because of the magnet," said Miriam Bernabei, director of arts, music and special projects in the Greenburgh Central 7 district. "One of our goals was to give the option within the public schools, to get people back. At Greenburgh, it's a choice, not an 'alternative' for troubled kids." 
That is certainly the appeal for Felicia Walker, a parent in the Greenburgh Central 7 district who hopes that her son, who just completed the eighth grade at a local parochial school, will be able to attend the magnet program in September. 
"I didn't want my son to hang out with the wrong group of kids," said Mrs. Walker, a graduate of Woodlands High School whose older children also attended there. "At the Magnet Academy, it's much smaller, and there's more discipline. When he went for the day to shadow another student, he came home and said: 'Mom, I really love it. The work looks really hard, but there are so many different types of kids, and no one was fighting with anybody.' I'm not letting him go to Woodlands. I think the magnet is part of how the district keeps people." 
What seems to have drawn most of the students was the prospect of smaller classes and a more intimate academic setting. For the Greenburgh students particularly, the Magnet Academy is seen as a surer path to further education than their previous high school. "This is a better school if I want to go to college and get a scholarship," David Distant said. "This will make it a lot easier."
Students spoke about the pleasures of wandering around the sprawling SUNY Purchase campus, being liberated from the restrictions of a single high school building, and having the chance to pursue theater and music classes after school with SUNY professors as well as pursue weekly Outward Bound-type experiences with Magnet Academy instructors. 
And even though the curriculum follows the Regents requirements, the Magnet Academy structures the classes in blocks of an hour and fifteen minutes, giving students more time to work on English, earth science, biology, math and global studies. Each day, students spend a half hour meeting with their advisers and writing compositions, with Fridays dedicated to laboratory work and field experiences like participating in an archaeological dig. In a 14-student English class recently, nearly all students participated in the intense debate and discussion about slavery, the meaning of mixed race, and the Haitian exodus from political repression in Edwige Danticat's story collection, "Krik? Krak!" During a biology class, the students sat around a seminar table and followed on laptop computers as their teacher led them through a detailed explanation of how to analyze DNA strands. 
Getting to know other teenagers, beyond the limited social confines of their home districts, was another lure. Many of the students have attended their districts' relatively small high schools where they have known the same students since preschool days. The current ninth-grade classes number about 235 students in Harrison, 115 in Irvington, and about 110 at Woodlands.
"I wanted to meet new people," said Jennifer Tassler, who came from Woodlands.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
There's something to celebrate for the cable TV networks as preseason ad sales beat expectations.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IN another indication that the advertising economy is turning upward after its long recession, cable television networks are taking in more advertising dollars ahead of the 2002-03 season than had been expected even a month ago.
 Though the preseason negotiations between the cable networks and advertisers -- known as the upfront market -- are still unfinished, industry analysts are now estimating that when the dickering is done in the next week or two the final total of purchased commercial time could reach as much as $4.8 billion. That would represent an increase of 20 percent from the $4 billion sold in the depressed cable upfront market of last year. And it would tie the record set before the start of the 2000-01 season. 
 The more robust demand for commercial time on cable networks, from marketers seeking to peddle wares including cars, movies and mortgage loans, represents a trifecta for the television industry. The broadcast TV networks set a sales record in their upfront market, which concluded last month, at more than $8 billion, compared with about $7 billion for 2001-02. And the demand for commercial time in syndicated series also exceeded recent forecasts, totaling an estimated $2 billion.
Although the cable upfront market proceeded more slowly than had been expected, and the rising tide is not lifting all the boats, the anticipated end result is being welcomed by the industry.
"We're certainly above last year, which wasn't too difficult to achieve, and an increase of 20 percent is a real possibility," said Joseph W. Ostrow, president and chief executive at the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau in New York.
"The ratings story" is a big reason for the increased demand, he added. In June, for the first time, cable networks carrying commercials -- that is, excluding premium-priced movie channels like HBO and Showtime -- were watched by more than 50 percent of American households in prime time.
High ratings for original movies and series like Sunday's William H. Macy film "Door to Door" on TNT helped fuel increased ad sales there and at TBS, said Mark Lazarus, president for Turner Entertainment sales and marketing in Atlanta and New York, part of AOL Time Warner. The gains, he said, came in categories like fast-food restaurants, films and telecommunications.
"It's pleasantly surprising," he added, "but logical."
Rival general entertainment channels like FX also benefited from advertiser ardor.
"Advertisers moved a little more cautiously in cable after the speed and strength of the broadcast upfront and the syndicated upfront, but we are in double-digit volume gains," said Bruce Lefkowitz, executive vice president for entertainment advertising sales at the Fox Cable Networks Group in New York, part of the News Corporation, who handles ad sales for FX as well as the National Geographic Channel.
Marketers are buying commercial time during "The Shield," Mr. Lefkowitz said, a series on FX that some advertisers shunned during the 2001-02 season because of its frank content, as well as during "Lucky," a dark sitcom to be introduced by FX in the second quarter of 2003.
A Fox sibling, Fox News Channel, is also reporting strong gains.
"I keep knocking wood because I've done this for a while, but we're about 80 percent done and our dollar volume has almost doubled," said Paul Rittenberg, senior vice president for advertising sales at Fox News in New York.
Among the ad categories contributing to the gains, Mr. Rittenberg listed automobiles and financial services.
"They're still a little nervous," Mr. Rittenberg said of the brokerage firms and mutual funds, "but they do a lot of spending not because the market is good but to say 'You can trust us.' "
Greg D'Alba, a counterpart to Mr. Rittenberg at CNN, the AOL Time Warner cable news network, said that he was seeing gains in "our blue-chip business" like automobiles and financial services, including banks and mortgage lenders, along with computer hardware and telecommunications.
Some companies have cut back ad spending, said Mr. D'Alba, who is executive vice president for sales at CNN in New York, but those losses are being compensated by increased budgets from other advertisers.
Other cable networks that are selling commercial time beyond projected levels, in addition to the general entertainment and news channels, are niche networks that are aimed at more specialized audiences. Those include MTV and VH1, part of Viacom; Comedy Central, owned by Viacom and AOL Time Warner; and the Food Network and HGTV, owned by E. W. Scripps.
"The targeted networks are enjoying high-single-digit and double-digit volume increases," said Joe Mandese, editor of Media Buyer's Daily in New York, a newsletter published by Primedia.
Some networks did well by lowering their rates and gaining market share, agency executives said. They included Lifetime, owned by the Walt Disney Company and the Hearst Corporation, and USA Network, part of Vivendi Universal. Networks that lagged their peers, the executives said, included A&E, owned by Disney, Hearst and General Electric; and Discovery Channel, part of Discovery Communications.
For all the growth in demand for commercials on cable, questions loom for the coming season. The major one is also being asked of the broadcast networks: How much of the sales increase is attributable to more money coming into the market and how much is just being shifted from the money spent during the season, in what is known as the scatter market?
"It's too soon to tell," said Mr. Lefkowitz of Fox Cable. "Some advertisers moved their scatter dollars into the upfront, but that's not to say they also weren't putting more into the upfront, too."
"And as the season goes on and the economy picks up," he added, "we should get advertisers that didn't commit at all in the upfront."

HEADLINE: Facing New Costs, Some Smokers Say 'Enough' 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ill., July 12 

 BODY:
Michael Krygowski curses his shortness of breath while coaching his 10- year-old son's baseball team. He dreads dying before his three children finish college. And the 40-cent tax rise that took effect July 1 brings his two packs of Marlboro Lights to $8.70 a day -- $269.70 this month. 
 "That's a pretty big car payment," Mr. Krygowski, 39, who lives in Hirscher, Ill., lamented during a call to a smokers' "quit line" today. "I am just sick of smoking. I'm tired of the way I feel. 
 "I wanted to quit even before the price went up," he added. "The cost just kind of sealed the deal." 
So it has been for scores of smokers who have flooded the telephone lines here since Illinois raised its tax to 98 cents a pack. Calls to the quit line, which is financed through the state's share of the settlement reached with tobacco manufacturers and run by the American Lung Association, have spiked along with the tax, to an average 155 a day, from 100. On Tuesday, it was 205.
Illinois is among 16 states that have raised tobacco taxes this year, as budget deficits have collided with an election-year aversion to broader tax increases.
The per-pack increases are the largest and most widespread since the states began taxing tobacco in the 1920's, from Tennessee's rise of 7 cents a pack to New Jersey's jump of 70 cents. Smokers in New York City were hit twice: not only did the state raise its per-pack tax by 39 cents, but packs sold within city limits faced an additional city tax increase of $1.42. The federal government, which now charges 39 cents a pack, initiated such levies in 1794.
Economic studies have suggested that a price increase of 10 percent reduces smoking about 4 percent. It is too early to track significant shifts in behavior, but this could be the busiest season yet for the business of quitting.
Sales of nicotine patches and gum on the drugstore.com Web site were up 43 percent the second week in July compared with sales in the second week in June. In New Jersey, where the per-pack tax is now $1.50, QuitNet.com, an online cessation program, has registered 272 residents so far this month, compared to 300 in all of June.
"Everybody's like, 'Yeah, I've got to quit smoking now,' " said Bill Scheer, president of the New York City Pharmacists' Society, who has filled a dozen Medicaid prescriptions for nicotine patches and gum in the past two weeks, up from three in June, at Scheer Drugs in Flushing, Queens. "It's implied -- but not said -- that this is the reason: because cigs have gone up. I think it's the breaking point."
In previous years, a dozen states might introduce tobacco taxes, but only a handful would enact them. Lee Dixon, director of the health policy tracking service at the National Conference of State Legislatures, explained this year's rush in two words: budget shortfalls. All together, the 16 states expect to raise $2.2 billion this year.
Despite their deficits, only a few states raised overall sales taxes this spring; 19 states considered raising alcohol taxes, but only Tennessee did so. Mr. Dixon said that cigarette taxes were more popular among lawmakers, in part, he said, because of "the push from the public health advocates and the antitobacco groups who see it as an issue that will help cut tobacco use."
Indeed, Connecticut's smoking cessation hotline experienced a 50 percent surge in calls since the state's per-pack tax rose 69 cents, to $1.10, in April; New York's quit line has received 12 percent more calls than usual just this month.
Here in Springfield, in a hive of plain-gray cubicles at a building on the west end of town, the tax rise has translated into 30, 40 or 50 voice-mail messages each morning.
"I just keep hitting the button," sighed Carol Ramm, a respiratory therapist, as she hung up on one smoker and greeted another. "They start out and say 'it's because of my health.' But the big reason is the tax."
Counselors here spend 10 to 15 minutes on each call and encourage quitters to check in at least once a week, as with a parole officer. 
Raymond Buckner, a deputy sheriff in Cook County, said he had called the quit line 26 times since Nov. 13, 2000. When he sees the "Killing Me Softly" billboards with the quit line's telephone number, 866-QUIT-YES, it is "almost like I am being watched" by the voices he now knows so well, Mr. Buckner said when he called this afternoon.
Trained at the Mayo Clinic, the counselors, who are former smokers themselves, urge people to try a combination of Zyban or Wellbutrin -- anti-depressants that spur a brain response similar to the one stimulated by nicotine -- and nicotine patches in decreasing strengths, to wean themselves off cigarettes in about 12 weeks.
At the same time, trainers caution the quitting smokers that they must reprogram themselves to drink orange juice when they wake rather than light up, for instance, or take a walk after meals to avoid reaching for the ashtray, chew toothpicks instead of smoking in the car.
"You've got to deal with your stress in a way other than reaching for a cigarette -- that's just like a pacifier, James," Sarah Skeadas, 23, told a caller in his early 50's who suffers from emphysema.
"I quit every day," he responded. "I've quit at least a thousand times, I always go back to it because I say 'well, James, you ain't got that much going for you, you might as well smoke.' "
Ms. Skeadas's voice softened. "It's not that bleak, honey," she said, promising to call him the next morning. "I can tell you're having a hard time breathing just talking to me. It doesn't have to be that way."
In the next cubicle, Priscilla Matli stood and stared out a window, telephone headset in place, as she soothed a woman whose husband had lung cancer yet smoked through chemotherapy. 
Ms. Ramm told Marvin, a pack-a- day smoker, to get out his calendar and mark Saturday and Sunday 19, Monday and Tuesday 18, tapering his daily cigarette intake to 15 before starting the patch so he would not experience withdrawal.
And Michael Mark, the nurse who runs the quit line, spoke with Mr. Krygowski, who was recently laid off from a marketing job in which he stood outside gas stations, dispensing coupons for free cigarettes.
"There will come a point in time where you will say, 'Well, I've done real good, I can have one,' " Mr. Mark warned. "No. If you have one, you're back to 40 again."

HEADLINE: Gray Outlook From Intel; Bluer Skies AtMotorola 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Intel, the world's largest microchip manufacturer, said yesterday that it had encountered few signs of economic recovery in the second quarter and that it expected weaker than normal seasonal improvement in demand the rest of the year.
 As a result, Intel said, it plans cost-cutting measures, including a cut in capital spending and the elimination of about 4,000 jobs, almost 5 percent of its work force. It has cut about 5,000 jobs in the last year. 
 "We have yet to see momentum from the economic recovery," said Andrew Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer. 
In another sign of weakness for the technology sector in the second half of 2002, Apple Computer said that its sales and revenues slumped in the recent quarter and that earnings in the current quarter could be well below Wall Street's expectations. But another bellwether technology company, Motorola, which makes a broader array of microchips than does Intel and is among the world's largest cellular communications companies, said that it had returned to operating profitability in the quarter, ahead of forecasts, and that its markets were slowly improving.
All three companies announced their results after stock markets had closed. In after-hours trading as reported by Instinet, Apple fell; Intel recovered a small portion of its 3.9 percent decline, to $18.36 during regular trading; and Motorola, which had risen 5 percent, to $14.53 in regular trading, rose as high as $14.75. 
Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said that it earned $446 million, or 7 cents a diluted share, in the quarter, up 133 percent from the 3 cents a share, or $196 million, it reported in the second quarter of 2001. But earnings were down more than 50 percent from the first three months of this year.
In addition, stripped of one-time charges related to how it accounts for acquisitions, Intel's operating income for the quarter actually fell 27 percent from a year ago. More important to many analysts, Intel's revenue for the quarter, of $6.32 billion, was slightly less than the $6.33 billion reported a year ago, as well as 7 percent lower than in the first quarter.
The second quarter is historically a weak one for personal and desktop computers, which account for 80 percent of Intel's business, but the decline this year was among the worst in recent years. Intel said that the current quarter, which normally produces a rebound fueled by back-to-school sales, might be flat and would at best result in an improvement of 9 percent. Intel typically expects 3 percent to 14 percent growth for the quarter.
Intel's performance would have been worse had the company not managed to gain market share in all of its businesses, according to Craig R. Barrett, Intel's chief executive. The company cited emerging markets, sales of flash-memory chips and continued consumer demand as bright spots. But Intel said that businesses remained reluctant to invest in new information technology equipment.
Investors' expectations were reined in on June 6 when Intel told Wall Street that revenues could end up anywhere from $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, down from its forecast of $6.4 billion to $7 billion in April. At that time, Intel had warned that it was encountering weaker than expected European sales and a decline in gross margins from 53 percent to 49 percent. Its actual margins ended up slightly lower, one reason that earnings per share ended up 2 cents below the consensus estimate of analysts tracked by Thomson First Call.
Intel's net loss included a $106 million charge resulting from the company's decision, announced last month, to end its three-year, money-losing venture as a host of Internet sites. Shedding marginal operations and attrition will permit Intel to cut its work force with few layoffs, if any, in its core businesses, analysts said.
"They are really focusing on the stuff that matters," said Mark Margevicius, an analyst at Gartner.
Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., said that its net loss jumped to $2.32 billion, or $1.02 a diluted share, from $759 million a year ago. But that figure included $2.37 billion to cover one-time costs like cutting 7,000 jobs, writing down factories it closed and potential losses from a loan to a Turkish cellphone company. Excluding such costs, Motorola earned $48 million, or 2 cents a share, beating forecasts by 6 cents.
The news was good only compared with what investors had come to expect from the company the last two years. Revenue declined 10 percent from a year ago, to $6.74 billion, the smallest decline in the last six quarters. Sales in the cellular phone unit, its largest business, climbed 5 percent, to $2.6 billion, and Motorola forecast further growth the next two quarters.
In addition, Motorola continued to clean up a balance sheet that was formerly so debt laden that its investment and strategic options had been severely limited. It increased its cash and cash equivalents $500 million, to $6.5 billion.

HEADLINE: VISIONS OF GROUND ZERO: THE OVERVIEW; 
Six Plans for Ground Zero, All Seen as a Starting Point

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
On the day that six proposals for the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site were unveiled, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation said yesterday that the public could consider a seventh possibility, a new design without some of the requirements for office and retail space that shaped the initial proposals. 
 The chairman, John C. Whitehead, characterized the six designs as simply a starting point, a means for Americans to demonstrate their resilience and determination after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. 
 If the current proposals do not create "the kind of beautiful center that we want this to be, then we will change our plans," Mr. Whitehead said at one of a series of briefings at Federal Hall, the landmark on the Wall Street site where George Washington was first inaugurated as president.
His suggestion that the six plans were not at all the only approaches that could be considered seemed to be prompted by the disappointment of many people who had reviewed them. Those critics said the plans seemed driven more by the desires of developers and businessmen than by concerns about what was best for Lower Manhattan. Some objected that the designs would make the site too dense and crowded, and others felt they did not offer enough variety. 
Mr. Whitehead asked for "the ongoing input, feedback and recommendations of citizens here and throughout the country" about the plans. 
All of them call for a memorial, for office and retail space, and for a new transportation complex to be built on the site, but they varied widely in their details. The proposals for memorials varied in size from 5 to 10 acres, some including the footprints of the twin towers and others favoring an elegant promenade leading away from the building site. 
Each plan contained several office towers, responding to the requirement by the development corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the owner of the 16-acre site, that the designs replace all of the commercial and retail space that was destroyed on Sept. 11. 
Although Mr. Whitehead said he believed the six plans adequately achieved those goals, he added, in response to a question after the presentation, that the plans could be significantly altered if the public strongly favored that.
The suggestion met with hopeful surprise among some of the civic leaders, architects and family members of trade center victims who attended the presentation. 
"I thought it was very heartening," said Fredric Bell, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. "There are more options that need to be drawn, and different options that need to be considered."
Many of those people who had already reacted negatively to the plans said they packed too much office space on too small a site. Several of the civic groups monitoring the process had also objected that the brief time in which the plans were produced did not allow consideration of their affect on the area's economy and traffic patterns, among other factors.
Margaret Helfand, an urban planner who is co-chairwoman of the executive committee of New York New Visions, a civic group that has offered ideas and designs for the redevelopment of downtown, said the designs did not meet the spirit of the design principles outlined by the development corporation in April.
"That called for a vibrant, mixed-use community," Ms. Helfand said. "What we got was what was there before, packaged differently." 
Several people involved in the planning process said that they had not heard until about a month ago that the designs would have to replace all 11 million square feet of office space in the trade center and that the available retail space would be increased to 600,000 square feet from about 450,000. In addition, the planners were directed to include space for a hotel to replace the one that formerly stood on the site with the twin towers.
"These plans are all driven by hard economics," said Beverly Willis, an architect and the co-founder of Rebuild Downtown Our Town, a civic group. "There's no heart in them and no recognition of what we all had been led to believe would occur, that we would wind up with something wonderful on this site."
Kent Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society, a planning organization that organized a series of public forums to discuss the future of the site, said the office and retail constraints "diminished the prospects" for the designs.
"There hasn't been time for the analytical work that generally precedes that kind of site planning," Mr. Barwick said. "The next phase needs to be to go back and do the analytical work necessary and determine what this part of town can and should support in terms of office space and retail space."
Steven K. Peterson, whose firm, Peterson Littenberg Architects, worked on the designs, said the planners always considered them to be a first step.
"We knew we couldn't solve every problem at once," he said, "but we first had to prove that there are many ways to do what had to be done under the current restrictions. It's easy to then reduce the program if the economic or political considerations call for it."
Officials from the Port Authority and the development corporation also said that from the first, they had intended to consider everything that might be done on the site, then to scale back those plans. 
"This was the opening offer," one government official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, "but this was not the time to amend those restrictions." 
City and state officials were also unanimous in characterizing the plans presented yesterday as "a starting point." 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that what the planners have done so far was simply "to take a concept and give you some variations on it to get you to think, to realize that we shouldn't be tied into any one thing." 
Gov. George E. Pataki, who appointed Mr. Whitehead as chairman of the development corporation to lead the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, said he expected New Yorkers, who "are not inherently shy," to offer their most creative ideas.
Federal Hall was a building under heavy security, a reflection of the continuing concern about possible terrorist acts directed at anything associated with the World Trade Center. Armed federal agents were in evidence, bomb sweeps were conducted with dogs, and bags were searched when people entered. 
Now that the initial designs have been presented for public comment, discussions about amending the restrictions that limited them can be considered, Mr. Whitehead said. 
"We have looked carefully to see whether it is possible to preserve those private-sector rights that those two groups had and still rebuild this as a beautiful place and a place of which we are proud," Mr. Whitehead said, referring to the lease agreements that Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the commercial rights to the trade center site, and Westfield America, which holds the retail right, have with the Port Authority.
"So far, we believe that it is possible to do that," he said. "If we conclude differently, that it is not possible to rebuild and still meet those requirements and have the kind of beautiful center that we want this to be, then we will change our plans."
Nikki Stern, who attended the presentation yesterday and whose husband, James E. Potorti, was killed in the Sept. 11 attack, said Mr. Whitehead's comment "surprised me and gratified me."
"There are a lot of fine things in the plans," Ms. Stern said. "But they were created using givens that may have to be changed. This process is all about the art of compromise, and we want to make sure that all the parties are practicing compromise, including the developers."
