HEADLINE: At the Democratic Convention, an Emphasis on Social Issues

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: At times, it seemed as if every speaker on the first night of the Democratic National Convention was touting same-sex marriage. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. - On Monday night, Michelle Obama told the nation that her husband wants everyone to succeed no matter "who we love."
If that was not clear enough, she returned to the point later in her address. "If proud Americans can be who they are and boldly stand at the altar with who they love," she said, "then surely, surely we can give everyone in this country a fair chance at that great American dream."
She was not the only one. At times it seemed as if almost every speaker on the first night of the Democratic National Convention was touting same-sex marriage.
"When it comes to letting people marry whomever they love, Mitt Romney says no," Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio said of the Republican nominee. 
"Today in Massachusetts, you can also marry whomever you love," said that state's governor, Deval Patrick.
Kal Penn, the actor and former White House aide, praised Mr. Obama for being "cool with all of us getting gay-married."
The two back-to-back conventions are highlighting an interesting role reversal between the political parties. The Republicans, who in the past eagerly waged a culture war, tried to emphasize economic issues, while the Democrats, stuck with a bad economy, were no longer running away from social issues that once petrified their strategists.
Same-sex marriage was the most obvious example of that, although not the only one. Democrats were eager to talk about abortion rights and contraception, issues they hope will rev up their liberal base and paint Mr. Romney's Republican Party as out of the mainstream. A speaker scheduled for Wednesday night is Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown Law graduate whose support for Mr. Obama's mandate for insurance coverage of contraceptives has made her a party favorite.
But if abortion has been a critical issue for Democrats for years, same-sex marriage has moved to the forefront in a striking way. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed legislation defining marriage as the union of a man and woman, and just eight years ago, President George W. Bush supported a Constitutional amendment codifying that, while nearly a dozen states held referendums to ban same-sex nuptials.
Mr. Obama had formally opposed same-sex marriage until switching positions this year. Now that he has declared his support for the practice, the party has put same-sex marriage in its platform for the first time.
"The center of gravity on gay marriage has moved at an amazingly quick pace toward support for marriage equality, and the majority of voters are comfortable with the position Obama has taken on it," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "The issue is a defining one for younger voters, who see it as a litmus test of whether someone is in sync with modern times and their generation."
Even so, Democrats are trying to couch their support with careful language. With the exception of Mr. Penn, most did not use the word "gay" but instead framed it as allowing everyone to marry "who they love."
Some strategists said the embrace of same-sex marriage carried risks, particularly with older voters who are not as comfortable with it. While polls show a shift in public attitudes, particularly among the young, advocates of same-sex marriage have lost every statewide referendum that has gone on the ballot.
Just days before Mr. Obama announced his change of position, voters here in North Carolina became the 31st state to approve an amendment to the State Constitution banning same-sex marriage. Others have banned it via state legislature.
Other states will vote this fall. Maryland, where state lawmakers and Gov. Martin O'Malley approved same-sex marriage this year, will vote in November on whether to ratify the move, and some advocates believe that may be the first state where the public supports the practice.
Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary under Mr. Bush, said Democrats were taking a gamble in focusing on divisive social issues, just as Republicans have in the past, if from the opposite ideological pole.
"It tells you how far the Democratic Party has changed," he said. "Issues where only the most liberal were comfortable talking about - now the entire party reverberates to that beat."
He added: "Republicans define themselves for many swing voters as too interested and too focused on divisive social issues. The open question is, are Democrats at risk of alienating independent voters because of their overemphasis on social issues."

HEADLINE: Ryan Cites Policy Kinship With Bill Clinton

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Paul D. Ryan suggests that President Obama is more like Jimmy Carter than Bill Clinton. 

 BODY:
ADEL, Iowa - From tying President Obama to the economic stagnation under one former president, Jimmy Carter, the Romney-Ryan campaign has moved on to offering rosy recollections of another Democrat in the White House, Bill Clinton. In both cases the aim is to paint an unflattering contrast with Mr. Obama.
Anticipating Mr. Clinton's speech Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention, Representative Paul D. Ryan predicted at a rally here that "we'll get a great rendition of how good things were in the 1990s, but we're not going to hear much about how things have been the last four years.''
Mr. Ryan, who has been the tip of the Republican ticket's spear as Mitt Romney quietly preps for next month's presidential debates, praised Mr. Clinton for working with Republicans to pass welfare reform and budgets that cut spending. Mr. Obama, he said, tried to undo work requirements for welfare and has offered budgets with "a gusher of new spending.''
The president has shown "only demagoguery for those who've offered solutions,'' he said, speaking to a modest crowd before a picturesque county courthouse about 25 miles west of Des Moines. 
In response, the Obama campaign characterized Mr. Ryan's description of the administration's offer to adjust the welfare law as a distortion. "Even he should know that President Clinton has joined with every independent fact checker, news organization and a Republican architect of welfare reform in calling the welfare attack blatantly false,'' said Danny Kanner, a campaign spokesman.
Starting with the 2012 nominating race, Republicans have sought a measure of credit for the prosperity of the Clinton era, the last time federal budgets ran a surplus. Democrats, too, paint those years as a golden era but for a different reason - to draw a contrast with George W. Bush's ledger of large deficits because of tax cuts and two unfunded wars. 
With federal debt reaching a symbolic milestone of $16 trillion on Tuesday, both parties are engaged in a furious debate over whose economic policies can reverse the trend of growing deficits. Mr. Ryan, the intellectual author of the Republican commitment to stem explosive federal health care spending by transforming Medicare, also sought to link Mr. Clinton to the plan and portray it as enjoying bipartisan support. 
"The Medicare reform that Mitt Romney and I are proposing,'' Mr. Ryan said, "it's an idea that came out of the Clinton commission to save Medicare.''
That picture is incomplete. Ten members on a 17-person commission in 1999 recommended that the government give subsidies to seniors to buy insurance - Mr. Ryan's plan - but the idea was rejected by the four Democrats appointed by Mr. Clinton, who also denounced the draft report, and the commission disbanded. 
Mr. Ryan spoke on his second day in Iowa, a battleground state with only a handful of electoral votes, but a state where the Obama campaign has been waging an especially fierce stand. Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. along with their wives plan to campaign in Iowa City on Friday, the morning after Mr. Obama's acceptance speech and when new jobs numbers are due to come out.
Mr. Ryan suggested that he also might come back to Iowa, not only this year but in the future. Like waves of caucus candidates seeking a visceral connection with Iowans, he noted that he was from "corn and soybean country" in Wisconsin. 
"You drive five miles that way,'' he said in this rural county seat, "it looks like five miles from my house.''

HEADLINE: In Clinton and Warren, Competing Messages for the Middle Class

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: Wednesday begins the hard sell of President Obama to the middle class. And for this task, the campaign has juxtaposed two prime-time speakers - Elizabeth Warren and Bill Clinton, one right after the other - who in their core philosophies represent contradictory, even irreconcilable strains of American liberalism. 

 BODY:
If you're a candidate for president, the convention affords you a fleeting window of opportunity, about three hours total of network airtime, to present speakers who will get across your one central message to the wide section of America. In the case of this Democratic convention, though, Wednesday's lineup reveals the essential dilemma that has often made President Obama's re-election campaign, and much of his presidency, seem as muddled as a Clint Eastwood monologue.
 The opening festivities on Tuesday, at least before Michelle Obama's emotional prime-time appearance, were about dispensing with all the speakers whom Democrats didn't really want the rest of the county to notice. Jimmy Carter did a video. Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid took the stage to remind Americans of how much they love Congress. There was a moving tribute to Ted Kennedy.
Wednesday, though, begins the hard sell of President Obama to the middle class. And for this task, the campaign has juxtaposed two prime-time speakers - Elizabeth Warren and Bill Clinton, one right after the other - who in their core philosophies represent contradictory, even irreconcilable strains of American liberalism.
Mr. Obama's strategists will tell themselves what they have said since the president first ran in 2008 - that there is no real inconsistency in these two wings of the party, that both Mr. Clinton and Ms. Warren speak to the same imperiled middle class, a category so broad and ill-defined that the vast majority of Americans would say they belong to it. 
In truth, though, Mr. Clinton and Ms. Warren speak to different audiences and reflect inescapably divergent perspectives on how to confront the epic challenges of globalization and inequality. 
Mr. Clinton is the president who made the sustained case to Democrats that they had to be pro-growth and pro-Wall Street, not just to get elected, but also to build a more modern economy. He was the one, as spokesman for the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, who told Democrats again and again that they couldn't succeed as a party that "loved jobs and hated business." Mr. Clinton transformed welfare, balanced the budget and declared an end to the liberal era of government, which is why a lot of conservative-leaning independent voters would re-elect him if they could.
As a Harvard law professor during the Bush years, Ms. Warren, who is now a candidate for Senate in Massachusetts, came to represent a rebuke of such Clintonian expedience. Her indictment against the excesses of Wall Street and the abdication of centrist Democrats became popular among a new generation of old-style economic populists (most notably John Edwards and then Mr. Obama), who often cited Ms. Warren's arguments in making the case that the party had to reverse course from the Clinton years and rein in a business community that was prospering at the expense of the middle class. 
The contradiction here isn't perfectly stark, of course, and there are ways in which the two overlap, politically and culturally. Mr. Clinton, for instance, lambasted the rising pay of executives, in relation to their employees, as far back as 1992, long before anyone had heard of Ms. Warren. And Ms. Warren isn't the privileged, effete liberal her critics would make her out to be; like Mr. Clinton, she's a self-made product of Middle America. 
But in their essential worldviews, Mr. Clinton and Ms. Warren nicely embody the enduring confusion over what it is Mr. Obama really believes about the direction of his party and the country. As a candidate in 2008, Mr. Obama took advantage of an extraordinary moment to run as all things to all people; beneath the airy notion of "hope and change" lay an implicit appeal to disaffected independents and fatigued liberals. And this noncommittal strategy worked spectacularly.
As Mr. Clinton himself once told me, however, there are consequences for not clarifying one's own beliefs as a candidate and then trying to make it up as you go along in office. He wasn't talking specifically about Mr. Obama, but he might as well have been. As president, Mr. Obama has often seemed to veer between "postpartisan" pragmatism and anticorporate populism, confounding his supporters and satisfying neither constituency. 
This time out, as a candidate, it seems unlikely that Mr. Obama can count on winning a majority of independent votes and turning out the same historic numbers of younger and minority voters. In the weeks ahead, he may have to finally decide whether to speak principally to the fickle voters who gave him a chance in 2008 or whether to fire up the more ideological types who want a more Warren-like champion. 
You can probably pursue both objectives behind the scenes, and this is the kind of multitasking at which modern campaigns excel. But at a convention or during debates, when everyone is tuned to the same message, the divide is harder to bridge. Is Mr. Obama, at bottom, the Clintonian candidate who tried to hammer out a "grand bargain" on the budget with Republicans, or is he the more traditional Democrat who skewers Wall Street bankers as "fat cats" and pretends he can fix inequality with gimmicks like "the Buffett rule?"
 A coherent convention should answer that question. On this night, at least, it won't.
An earlier version of this post misspelled the word Buffett in a reference to "the Buffett rule," a tax plan proposed by President Obama that is named after the investor Warren Buffett.

HEADLINE: Fact-Checking the Democratic Platform

BYLINE: SCOTT SHANE and ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The Democratic Party platform, which was released during the convention in Charlotte, N.C., contained some exaggerated or misleading claims in civil liberties and housing. 

 BODY:
The Democratic Party platform, released this week during the convention in Charlotte, N.C., contained a number of exaggerated or misleading claims in civil liberties and housing.
CIVIL LIBERTIES
The Democratic platform includes a plank called "Staying True to Our Values at Home," which pledges to make sure that the nation's antiterrorism efforts do not run afoul of the Constitution or people's civil liberties - a pledge critics say has not always been kept in the last four years.
"Advancing our interests may involve new actions and policies to confront threats like terrorism, but the president and the Democratic Party believe these practices must always be in line with our Constitution, preserve our people's privacy and civil liberties, and withstand the checks and balances that have served us so well,'' the platform states. "That is why the president banned torture without exception in his first week in office. That is why we are reforming military commissions to bring them in line with the rule of law. That is why we are substantially reducing the population at Guantánamo Bay without adding to it. And we remain committed to working with all branches of government to close the prison altogether because it is inconsistent with our national security interests and our values."
Some civil libertarians, disappointed that many Bush counterterrorism programs continued without significant changes, would take issue with the claim that Mr. Obama's policies have been "in line with our Constitution" or have adequately protected privacy and civil liberties. Perhaps most contentious has been Mr. Obama's overseas use of drones. While there have been few complaints about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, some legal scholars and rights activists were especially critical of Mr. Obama's approval of using a drone to kill an American citizen, the cleric and Al Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, in Yemen last year.
While the administration has asserted that Mr. Awlaki was a dangerous threat and a legitimate target under domestic and international law, some people are uncomfortable with the idea that a president can designate an American citizen for execution without presenting evidence in court or allowing a defense. At least two other Americans have been killed in strikes in Yemen, but officials have said they were not the targets. 
It is true that Mr. Obama outlawedbrutal interrogations in his first week, requiring that detainees in American custody be treated "humanely." Although torture was already illegal, the Central Intelligence Agency under the Bush administration had been authorizedby the Justice Department to use the suffocation technique called waterboarding and several other methods considered by most human rights experts to be torture.
Mr. Obama's executive order eliminated any uncertainty about whether coercive methods were permissible. But Mr. Obama disappointed many supporters by opposing any comprehensive review of Bush counterterrorism programs, and his Justice Department last week closed the last investigation of C.I.A. interrogations without charging anyone.
It is also true that, with the cooperation of Congress, military commissions have been significantly altered under Mr. Obama to bring their rules closer to those of civilian courts. But as the platform suggests, Mr. Obama's promise to close Guantánamo in his first year in office remains unfulfilled. Some critics believe the administration mishandled the issue, not moving quickly enough to empty and close the prison. But Congress passed restrictions on moving detainees out of Guantánamo, and instability in Yemen prompted officials to stop sending Yemeni detainees home, so the prison is likely to remain open for years.
The platform also says that the administration is committed to "the most open, efficient and accountable government in history" - a pledge some critics say Mr. Obama to carry out so far. The Justice Department has continued to block lawsuits involving intelligence matters by invoking "state secrets," and the administration has prosecuted six former government workers for leaking classified information to the press, more than all previous administrations combined. 
HOUSING
The Democratic platform states that "President Obama took swift action to stabilize a housing market in crisis, helping five million families restructure their loans to help them stay in their homes, making it easier for families to refinance their mortgages and save hundreds of dollars a month, and giving tax credits to first-time home buyers." 
He did take action to help stabilize the housing market, though with what many critics describe aslackluster results. Mr. Obama's signature initiative to help homeowners is HAMP, the Home Affordable Modification Program. It did help many Americans lower their monthly payments, though only about 1 million homeowners have completed permanent modifications. (The modifications have saved the average family $536 a month.) The other major housing program - HARP, or the Home Affordable Refinance Program - has aided an additional 1.3 million homeowners. 
So where does that five million number come from? It seems to include the three million modifications completed through the HOPE Now Alliance - an umbrella group of mortgage servicers, housing counselors and mortgage finance players. But it's not a government function, so the Democrats should not be taking credit there. 
As for the credit for first-time homebuyers, economists think it enticed few new buyers into the market, instead encouraging people with the means and desire to buy a house to do so sooner than they otherwise might have to gain the credit.
Moreover, home prices continued to fall after the credit expired - in many places, they have only just bottomed out recently - leaving thousands of homeowners who took advantage of the credit underwater on their mortgages. 
More generally, the Obama administration has met with broad criticism for not doing enough to aid homeowners - by changing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's rules to allow principal reduction for homeowners who owe more than their houses are worth, or by allowing bankruptcy courts to alter mortgages, or by simply reaching more homeowners with HAMP and HARP, for instance. 
The administration combats those criticisms by arguing that doing more to help homeowners might have destabilized banks, or by saying that Congress would not have agreed to go along with more ambitious housing plans. 
One way or another, housing remains a major drag on the economy, and millions of Americans remain at risk of losing their homes.

6:00 P.M. | James Taylor Serenades the Hall
Forget the speeches. Earlier this afternoon, James Taylor walked out on the convention floor to sing for a surprisingly full hall, opening with "Carolina in My Mind," to cheers and flashbulb pops. Mr. Taylor was wearing a cowboy hat and a tie; considerably more dressed up than when he appeared here a few hours ago to do a sound check.
He walked out, glanced at the empty chair waiting for him - "Hope that empty chair doesn't make you nervous," Mr. Taylor quipped in the first Clint Eastwood joke of the night. People spilled out onto the balconies to photograph Mr. Taylor performing.
"I've been watching the coverage and I've got to say, I don't get it: I'm an Old white guy. And I love Barack Obama."
 From there, it was to "You've Got a Friend"
 Music for the younger set is coming up later: The Foo Fighters.
- 
11:37 P.M. | Clinton and Obama, Together in the Hall
Without any announcement, at the end of the 45-minute speech, President Obama walked out on the stage, hugged Bill Clinton, waved to the crowd, grinned widely and walked offstage.
The crowd is chanting "We are fired up."
And we are done for the night.

10:59 P.M. | Clinton Extols Cooperation and Chides G.O.P. 
The man whose wife once directly called out the "vast, right-wing conspiracy'' took his own shot at the conservative caucus of the Republican Party, describing it as the controlling force of his opposition party of yore.
"There's something I've noticed lately, you probably have, too," former President Bill Clinton said. "Though I often disagree with Republicans, I actually never learned to hate them the way the far right that now controls their party seems to hate our president, and a lot of other Democrats."
Mr. Clinton, who had some of the biggest partisan fights of the modern times - including impeachment - but cut big deals on items like welfare reform, said, "The politics of constant conflict may be good, but what is good politics does not necessarily work in the real world. What works in the real world is cooperation."
Mr. Obama tried, he said.
"That didn't work out so well," he said. "But it could have been because as the Senate Republican leader said in a remarkable moment of candor two full years before the election that their No. 1 priority was not to put Americans back to work. It was to put the president out of work."
"I hate to break it to you," he said, adding "we're going to keep the president in the job."
- 
10:46 P.M. | 'We Are Here to Nominate a President'
Former President Bill Clinton took the stage to wild applause, and quickly began laying out his case for President Obama. It took him about two minutes to get to one of the lines that you can bet the Clinton and Obama camp view as most likely to survive beyond the night.
"I want to nominate a man whose cool on the outside, but who burns for America on the inside," he said.
Mr. Clinton's voice sounds less than robust. Throughout his career, he has battled allergies that can make it harder to hear him (though rarely stops from him talking). Still, he is presenting arguments new and old in making his case for Mr. Obama and against the "this Republican narrative, this alternative universe."
"We Democrats, we think the country works better with a strong middle class, for real opportunity for poor people to work into it," he said. "You see we believe 'We are all in this together' is a far better philosophy than 'You are on your own.' "
- 
10:35 P.M. | Fact Check: Middle-Class Tax Hike
This evening, both Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Senate candidate, and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said that Mitt Romney plans to raise taxes on the middle class while giving a tax cut to the rich.
"Mitt Romney? He wants to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires," Ms. Warren said. "But for middle-class families who are hanging on by their fingernails? His plans will hammer them with a new tax hike of up to $2,000." 
It's a claim that many Democrats are making, but it is not an entirely accurate one.
Here's how the Democrats get there.
Mr. Romney has three central pillars of his tax proposal. First, he wants to cut all marginal tax rates by 20 percent. (That means the tax rate in the top bracket would fall to 28 percent from 35 percent, for instance.)
Second, he wants to pay for the rate reductions by cutting out the underbrush of expenditures, credits, preferences and loopholes in the code, though not those for saving and investment.
Third, he wants the tax code to raise the same amount of money as it does today: what economists call "revenue neutrality." He also wants to keep the relative burden of the tax code on poor, middle-income and rich families about where it is now.
Here's where things get tricky: A whole bunch of tax experts, from the left, the right and the center, don't think there is any way to do all of those things. (For the definitive analysis, though one the Romney campaign vociferously disputes, see this Tax Policy Center study.)
When you cut tax rates that much, the tax liability of rich families falls considerably. Even if you take away all of their noninvestment credits and expenditures, rich households would still be paying less than they do now. Thus, for the tax plan to raise the same amount of money as it currently does, someone else needs to pay more.
That's why Democrats argue that Mr. Romney would raise taxes on the middle class.
But it's not clear that Mr. Romney would do that, and it is not necessarily true that his tax plan implies it, either.
For one, Mr. Romney has explicitly promised not to raise taxes on middle-class families. And his campaign argues that the math in its tax plan works out, in part because they anticipate that the tax reform would spark bang-up growth.
Even if the math does not work out, though (and, again, many economists argue that it does not), it does not mean that Mr. Romney's proposal raises taxes on the middle class. It just leaves a question as to how to actually make the numbers add up.
One way, yes, would be to raise taxes on the middle-class or even the poor. Another way would be to contribute to the deficit. A third would be to have smaller cuts to marginal tax rates. A final one would be to take away expenditures on investment and saving.

10:29 P.M. | Warren Appeals to Party Base and Delivers Broadsides
Elizabeth Warren is serving as the warm-up act for Bill Clinton, but her speech shows her breathing fire into her role as the voice of the beleaguered middle class as she delivers a broadside against Mitt Romney.
"People feel like the system is rigged against them," she said. "And here's the painful part: they're right. The system is rigged."
"Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies," she said in a passage sure to stir the hearts of the progressives and Occupiers who have supported her from the beginning. "Wall Street C.E.O.'s, the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs, still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them."
Ms. Warren at first only alluded to Mr. Romney, saying that no one she talked to "made big bucks from the risky Wall Street bets that brought down our economy." None of them, she says, stash "their money in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying their fair share of taxes."
Then, she opened up and blasted him by name.
"Mitt Romney wants to give billions in breaks to big corporations," she said. "But he and Paul Ryan would pulverize financial reform, voucher-ize Medicare, and vaporize Obamacare."
She criticized Mr. Romney for having said that "corporations are people." 
"No, Governor Romney, corporations are not people," she said. "People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they cry, they dance. They live, they love, and they die. And that matters. That matters because we don't run this country for corporations, we run it for people. And that's why we need Barack Obama."
Ms. Warren praised Mr. Obama for having stood by her in her fight to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
"The big banks sure didn't like it, and they marshaled one of the biggest lobbying forces on earth to destroy the agency before it ever saw the light of day," she said. "And when the lobbyists were closing in for the kill, Barack Obama squared his shoulders, planted his feet and stood firm. And that's how we won."
She concluded by saying that Mr. Obama believes in a level playing field and in a country "where nobody gets a free ride or a golden parachute" and "where women get equal pay for equal work."
It is a speech that will fire up the base of her party. When she goes back to Massachusetts on Thursday, she will have to again focus on reaching independent voters, who at this point are leaning toward Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican.

10:25 P.M. | Cantor Criticizes Obama on Israel 
Taking the opening the Democrats gave them on Israel and Jerusalem, the Republicans are continuing to weigh in on the party's big night.
In a statement distributed by the Romney campaign, the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, who is Jewish, said:
"President Obama's failure to take a coherent and decisive stand in recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel reflects his administration's vacillating policies toward the Jewish state. Today's floor fight and begrudging platform reversal at the Democratic National Convention should be seen for what it is - a case study in political posturing."
- 
10:19 P.M. | Sandra Fluke Speaks
Completing their full embrace of social issues and abortion rights, the Democrats have used the opening minutes of the hour the networks are giving them in prime time to showcase Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown law graduate who came to embody the fight over employer health insurance coverage of contraception this year.
Ms. Fluke lit into Mitt Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, for their positions against abortion rights - and, in Mr. Romney's case, for staying silent initially after the talk-show host Rush Limbaugh called her a "slut.''
(After initially ignoring a reporter's question when he was asked about it in March, Mr. Romney then said, "I'll just say this which is it's not the language I would have used," and "I'm focusing on the issues I think are significant in the country today, and that's why I'm here talking about jobs and Ohio.")
President Obama called her at the time to say that he wouldn't want his daughters to be attacked for standing up for something they believed in, as Ms. Fluke did when she was blocked from testifying on coverage of birth control.
Giving a "two Americas, two political parties" speech, she spoke of "an America in which our president, when he hears a young woman has been verbally attacked, thinks of his daughters - not his delegates or donors - and stands with all women." 
"And strangers come together, reach out and lift her up. And then, instead of trying to silence her, you invite me here - and give me a microphone - to amplify our voice. That's the difference."
- 
10:18 P.M. | Elizabeth Warren Addresses Convention Crowd
Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law school professor and nationally known consumer advocate running for Senate in Massachusetts, took to the stage tonight to finish up an evening marked by repeated attacks on Mr. Romney's business record.
Ms. Warren, who is seeking to oust Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, may be particularly apt to make the case, given her long history of running against Wall Street. She is popular with the many on the left in the Democratic Party, although she has been struggling in her race against Mr. Brown.
Her words, leading up to a speech by former President Bill Clinton, were among the sharpest of the night.
"The Republican vision is clear: I've got mine, the rest of you are on your own," she planned to say, according to prepared remarks. "Republicans say they don't believe in government. Sure they do. They believe in government to help themselves and their powerful friends. After all, Mitt Romney's the guy who said corporations are people."
Ms. Warren, who served Mr. Obama as a consumer advocate in the Treasury Department, not only attacked Mr. Romney, but also defended Mr. Obama's attacks against Wall Street.
"President Obama believes in a level playing field," she planned to say. "He believes in a country where nobody gets a free ride or a golden parachute. A country where anyone who has a great idea and rolls up their sleeves has a chance to build a business, and anyone who works hard can build some security and raise a family. President Obama believes in a country where billionaires pay their taxes just like their secretaries do."
Those attacks have created some discomfort among the president's former allies and some Democrats - including a certain former president who is going to speak later tonight.
- 
10:13 P.M. | The Romneys Love Costco
Jim Sinegal, the co-founder and former chief executive of Costco who just took the stage here at the arena, may like President Obama. But Mitt Romney likes Costco. It may be a good time to go back to this recent clip of Ann and Mitt Romney, talking about their love for Costco with Chris Wallace on Fox News:
ANN ROMNEY: Oh, we both like Costco.
(LAUGHTER)
ANN ROMNEY: I love Costco.
CHRIS WALLACE: Why?
ANN ROMNEY: It's great. Are you kidding? Have you ever been to it?
CHRIS WALLACE: Yeah, I've been to a Costco.
ANN ROMNEY: I love Costco.
CHRIS WALLACE: I'm in touch. What are you talking about?
(LAUGHTER)
MITT ROMNEY: It's got great produce.
ANN ROMNEY: I know how to shop Costco. You go in the door. Don't - don't - I don't want everyone to learn this trick.
(LAUGHTER) You go in the door, you take a sharp right and you go way down to the back of the store and just go - just shop the outside of aisles, boom, boom, boom.
MITT ROMNEY: She also got me one of these three-packs of shirts the other day from Costco. And they're...
ANN ROMNEY: Yeah.
MITT ROMNEY: They're very nice shirts.
ANN ROMNEY: The Kirkland shirts. He's - he's wearing them all the time now. I'm like, hey, that's - that looks - that shirt looks pretty good. I got them - I got them at Costco.

10:06 P.M. | Bain Employees in the Spotlight
Bain Capital, the investment firm Mitt Romney ran and helped found, is getting a close-up.
Taking the stage here in Charlotte were three workers from companies that they said were put out of business after being bought by Bain.
"Mitt Romney said 'I like to fire people','' said one of them, Randy Johnson, who worked at an office supply manufacturer that came under the ownership of Bain and was shuttered after Mr. Johnson's union threatened to strike.
"Mitt Romney said 'I like to fire people,'" Mr. Johnson said. "And I can tell you from personal experience, he does."
Mr. Johnson was an advocate against Mr. Romney during his failed Senate race against Edward M. Kennedy in 1994.
As the Politicker blog of The New York Observer noted, Mr. Romney wrote to Mr. Johnson after that campaign to suggest he had been misled by his union and used by the Kennedy campaign. 
[Related: Michael Cooper wrote earlier about the "I like to fire people" quotation being taken out of context.]
- 
10:03 P.M. | Crowd Grows as Admission to Arena Is Denied
A huge crowd of people gathered outside the security checkpoint at Times Warner Cable Arena earlier Wednesday night, awaiting entrance to the convention hall to see former President Bill Clinton address the Democratic National Convention here. 
For almost 30 minutes, and despite some desperate pleas - "You have to let him in! He's running for Congress!" - no one was allowed past security. 
Well, almost no one. The first V.I.P. to make it through the throng was the former Obama body man Reggie Love, which added to speculation that the president would be in the hall, as was later confirmed. Another special guest, the musician and prominent Obama supporter will.i.am simply went around the barricade.
But all celebrities are not created equal. One stranded reporter said on Twitter: "The namedropping here @ the security checkpoint is growing unwieldy, as if being the most DC person in line will lead to admittance."
As the crowd grew increasingly anxious, only the stalwart remained. "Forget this," one admission seeker said. "I'm going to the CNN Grill."
Those willing to remain were rewarded, however, as the doors soon opened and the crowd began to file in.
- 
9:55 P.M. | Are You Ready for Some ... Speeches?
The first night of the Democratic convention was marked by bubbling political energy, attacks on Mitt Romney and affirmation for President Obama.
The big speeches of the night lay ahead, but it's fair to say that tonight has yet to meet the standards of last night.
In a Twitter message, Edward Frantz suggested that the reason for the lighter program might be football. Specifically, the N.F.L.'s season opener featuring the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants being shown on NBC (which is not broadcasting tonight's convention events). Could the convention planners have decided to shoehorn most of their best speakers into last night and tomorrow night? 
That sounds smart. Still, in a little while, as former President Bill Clinton takes the stage, that may be a moot point - particularly if, as many people suspect, he is joined onstage by President Obama. Who knows, maybe even some viewers will take a break from the game to watch these two big-timers share a stage.
At 9:48 p.m. it was halftime and the score was Cowboys 7, Giants 3. NBC still did not plan to broadcast the expected Obama-Clinton appearance.
"We'll go live to Brian Williams and David Gregory in the convention hall," said Erika Masonhall, an NBC spokeswoman. "It will be a brief news and analysis update with them rather than the live feed of the hall activity."
- 
9:36 P.M. | Obama to Watch Clinton From Arena
President Obama, who watched first lady Michelle Obama's address from home on Tuesday night, is to come to Time Warner Cable Arena tonight to take in former President Clinton's address in person, campaign sources said.
Mr. Obama had scheduled his walk-through of the convention for Wednesday night, and a Democratic official hinted earlier Wednesday that he might join Mr. Clinton onstage.
In any event, this hall has been pretty dead tonight, especially after last night, so the arrival of Mr. Obama should help get this crowd on its feet.
It also might - by design or not - distract from the embarrassment of the last-minute wrangling over the political status of Jerusalem.
- 
9:32 P.M. | Clinton Aide Said to Be Voting for Romney
Former President Clinton will try to persuade an audience of millions on Wednesday night to vote for President Obama. But apparently he has been unable to persuade one of the people closest to him.
Douglas J. Band, the former president's longtime counselor, has told associates he plans to vote for Mitt Romney, according to the New Yorker magazine, citing unnamed sources. Mr. Band did not respond to e-mail messages this week, and a spokesman for Mr. Clinton had no comment.
Mr. Band, who followed Mr. Clinton from the White House to New York and helped establish his far-flung charitable ventures, particularly the Clinton Global Initiative, is in many ways the most important person in the former president's circle other than Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. He has been a virtual alter ego for years, constantly at Mr. Clinton's side and able to speak with his authority. Few if any get to see Mr. Clinton without going through Mr. Band.
That Mr. Clinton's own close aide would vote against Mr. Obama even as his boss is touting him was quickly interpreted by some as a statement about lingering suspicions between the camps of the two most prominent Democrats in America. But it is not clear what Mr. Band's reasoning might be, and he is not explaining at this point.
- 
9:22 P.M. | Democrats Court the Beer Caucus
The Democrats are taking a bold stand for beer.
The party seems to be reaching out to a new potential constituency, beer lovers, or, microbrew lovers to be more exact.
One of tonight's speakers, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, founded Wynkoop Brewing Company, an early microbrew in the West. In his remarks tonight, he declared himself "the first governor since Sam Adams to get his start brewing beer. I'm happy to announce that even craft beer production is up 35 percent."
Earlier, however, Mr. Hickenlooper went off script and SLAMMED - O.K., that's blog for "mildly criticized" - the White House for its recently released beer recipe in an interview with The Atlantic.
"It's none of my business and I don't want to criticize the White House chef, but I think maybe they could use a little less honey,'' he told the magazine. "One recipe I'm pretty sure would be better without the honey and the other one I think would be. A little bit less honey would be nice."
On Wednesday, he was followed in the speaking lineup by Bill Butcher, founder of Port City Brewing Company of Alexandria, Va., who said the Small Business Administration loan program helped him get the business off the ground.
"I hear President Obama has been brewing some beer in the White House recently, and I know you're not supposed to endorse a competitor, but in this case I'm going to make an exception," he said.
Um, given that the administration helped him with his business, isn't that a pay-to-play sort of deal?

9:08 P.M. | Taking Apart Romney's Qualifications
This is shaping up as a night when Democrats are trying to take apart Mitt Romney's qualifications to be in the White House. In the latest example, Jack Markell, the governor of Delaware and former corporate executive who described himself as a "proud, card-carrying capitalist," argued that Mr. Romney's experience did not qualify him to be president.
"As an executive in private equity, Mitt Romney's focus was on the bottom line," he said. "And that makes sense: his constituents were his financial shareholders. When he closed factories and sent jobs overseas, it was to benefit his shareholders. That was his job, and he was good at it."
- 
9:04 P.M. | Fact Check: 'I Like to Fire People' Out of Context
 Some speakers at the Democratic National Convention used an out-of-context quote in their speeches Wednesday night to give the misleading impression that Mitt Romney enjoys firing people.
 "Mitt Romney says he likes to fire people," Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a former executive who called himself a "proud card-carrying capitalist," told the delegates in Charlotte, N.C. "And Barack Obama? He likes to see people hired."
 But the quote he referred to was taken out of context, from a speech Mr. Romney gave in January in Nashua, N.H., when he was talking about the importance of having a choice of health care providers.
The full quotation? "I want individuals to have their own insurance," Mr. Romney said then. "That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy. It also means that if you don't like what they do, you can fire them. I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. If, you know, if someone doesn't give me the good service I need, I want to say, you know, that I'm going to go get somebody else to provide that service to me."
The remark was seized on by Mr. Romney's Republican primary opponents, then by Democrats, who have highlighted the plant closures and layoffs ordered by his old company, Bain Capital. But its use Wednesday was reminiscent of the way Republicans used "you didn't build that," an out-of-context line from President Obama, last week at their convention.
- 
8:42 P.M. | Hoyer Blames G.O.P. for Blocking Obama
So far this year, Democrats have been tentative about blaming Republicans for blocking President Obama's agenda in Washington. Some party strategists have expressed worry that doing so risked appearing like whining.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland went there tonight.
"Last week, Mr. Romney said he wished President Obama had succeeded when he took office," Mr. Hoyer said. "If so, he was alone in his party."
"Let's review the history," he said. "Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said that Republicans' No. 1 priority was the defeat of President Obama. Not the defeat of terrorism, not the creation of jobs, not the reduction of our deficit and debt, not ensuring access to health care, not educating our children."
It was just the sort of hit the crowd here was waiting for, and it drew a loud cheer for Mr. Hoyer.
(Mr. Hoyer was referring to a moment first captured by The New York Times's Carl Hulse and Adam Nagourney in 2010.)
- 
8:35 P.M. | At Convention, an Ann Richards Revival

In 1988, a high point of the Democratic convention was when Ann Richards, then the Texas state treasurer, convulsed delegates with a riff poking fun of then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. "He was born with a silver foot in his mouth."
Tonight, Ms. Richards, who died in 2006, drew some of the biggest applause of the night as her daughter, Cecile, invoked her name in a speech aimed at defeating another wealthy Republican, Mitt Romney.
Cecile Richards is the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and she avoided the kind of lacerating humor that her mother was known for.
Instead, she was one of a series of speakers talking about women and abortion rights in assailing the Republican ticket.
"Romney and Ryan are campaigning for women's votes by saying, 'Women need our help,' " she said. "This is coming from two men who are committed to ending insurance coverage for birth control. Who would turn women's health care decisions over to our bosses."
She also offered a posthumous endorsement of Mr. Obama's re-election from her clearly still very popular mother.
"As women, we've come too far to turn back. And we won't. Mom wouldn't stand for it, and neither will we."

Protesters returned to the streets of Charlotte for a fourth consecutive day on Wednesday, but this time without confrontation or arrests as the Democratic National Convention continued.
A flash mob that grew to 150 to 200 marched in the streets protesting corporate money in politics and the handling of detainees, just as delegates were arriving in the afternoon for the second day of the convention. The group was surrounded by police officers but allowed to march to within about a block of Time Warner Cable Arena, gathering in an intersection for several minutes.
The march eventually moved on without incident. Read more ...

7:07 P.M. | Schumer Touts Obama's Record on Israel
An hour after the Democratic Party bowed to pressure from Israeli advocates and restored language in the Democratic platform describing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat and one of the Senate's biggest advocates of Israel, used his speech to present Mr. Obama as resolutely pro-Israel.
The timing appears coincidental. Mr. Schumer was scheduled to speak at 6:30 p.m. or so, and the advance text was sent out at 5:48 p.m.
By design or not, Mr. Schumer, who is Jewish and from Brooklyn, has strong pro-Israel credentials. His words could carry weight at a time when Republicans, and some Israelis, have criticized Mr. Obama as being a weak supporter of Israel. Republicans have been looking to chip away at Mr. Obama's support among Jewish voters to help Mitt Romney in states like Florida.
Mr. Schumer said there was no reason to doubt Mr. Obama's commitment to Israel.
"When it comes to one of our closest allies - Israel - President Obama has been resolute," Mr. Schumer said. "The two biggest threats to Israel are the threat of Iranian nuclear weapons and the launching of Hezbollah rockets. No president in history has done more to confront these threats."

7:03 P.M. | Reaction to Thursday's Site Change
While a decision to move President Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention to a smaller venue might have left some volunteers and visitors here feeling left out in the cold - or the rain, as the weather forecast was predicting - many took it in stride, their support for the president undiminished.
"It happens," said Roshunta Cochrane, a 24-year-old Charlotte resident. "I'll vote for him anyway." 
People on the streets of uptown Charlotte this afternoon instead criticized the convention organizers, who, citing concerns about severe weather, announced this morning that Mr. Obama's speech would be moved to the enclosed Time Warner Cable Arena, where the convention's first two days have been held, from the open-air Bank of America Stadium.
"With it being hurricane season, I definitely feel like they could have prepared for it more," Ms. Cochrane added. "It's an open-air arena, so you kind of have to prepare for rain and things like that."
Bob Barrows, a 62-year-old volunteer from Charlotte, was scheduled to work at the stadium on Thursday and would have stayed to watch the speech after his shift ended. "I think they may have pulled the trigger too soon," he said, looking at his watch. "It's near 4 o'clock right now, and it's getting better. It's usually bad between 3 and 4. But the weather can be very fickle."
Kesha Lee, 30, a resident of Washington, D.C., sat in the sun with two friends on Wednesday afternoon. "Our game plan was to get up early and brave the crowds before they got there," she said.
She hoped that those who planned to arrive here tomorrow would get the message in time. 
"Rain and 50,000 people without a seat is not a really good thing for Charlotte," she said.
Some still hoped for the best. James Jackson, 63, and Yolanda Jackson, 61, weren't sure if they would be able to see the president's speech tomorrow inside the arena. But the Jacksons, a retired couple from South Carolina, still had their passes and planned to wait in line anyway.
Plan B? "I will go back to my son's house and watch," Mrs. Jackson said.
Others didn't seem the least bit disappointed. "I'm from a swing state," said Fayre Ruszczyk, a 64-year-old volunteer from Littleton, Colo. She has seen Mr. Obama speak before.
"This isn't for us, anyway," she said. "This is for the delegates."
Andrew Beary, 59, a volunteer checking press credentials, still proudly wore his ticket for entry, now merely a souvenir. He feared that the move could hurt the enthusiasm of others who also would be left out.
"We hope that those volunteers stay fired up," he said. "'Cause we're going to need it. It's going to be a tough one to win in North Carolina."

Here is your Barney Frank observation of the day.
 In an interview, Mr. Frank, a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, was asked about the extent to which convention planners vet and scrub the speeches of officials speaking at the convention. Mr. Frank is set to speak tonight.
 He proceeded to outline what he called the "trapdoor" rule. To wit: There is no trapdoor under you once you get on the platform. Once you get up there, you can say whatever you want. "What are they doing to do?" he asked.
 For any convention planners now nervous about what Mr. Frank might do, fear not: He was planning to stick to a script that will include challenging Mitt Romney's record as governor of Massachusetts.

6:40 P.M. | Democrats Affirm Support for Jerusalem as Israel's Capital
The Obama administration, facing a storm of protest from Republicans and pro-Israel groups, reopened the Democratic Party platform on Wednesday evening to restore language declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The change, approved in a voice vote that had be taken three times because of a chorus of "Noes" in the half-empty arena, reinstates the line, "Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel." That sentence was in the party's 2008 platform and has been featured in the past platforms of both parties for decades.
That Democrats had omitted the line in this year's platform stirred discontent among pro-Israeli groups. Read more ...

6:30 P.M. | Obama Arrives for Convention's Second Night
Former President Bill Clinton intends to try to rebut Republican arguments against the re-election of President Obama in a major speech at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, saying Mr. Obama has taken steps to turn around an economy left in shambles by Republicans.
"In Tampa, the Republican argument against the president's re-election was pretty simple: We left him a total mess, he hasn't finished cleaning it up yet, so fire him and put us back in," Mr. Clinton will say, according to excerpts from his remarks released by the party.
"I like the argument for President Obama's re-election a lot better," Mr. Clinton says in the excerpts. "He inherited a deeply damaged economy, put a floor under the crash, began the long hard road to recovery, and laid the foundation for a more modern, more well-balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs, vibrant new businesses, and lots of new wealth for the innovators."
The Clinton speech has taken on added weight since Mr. Obama, despite some differences with the former president in the 2008 election, is looking to his predecessor to sway Democrats and independents who remain uncertain about their presidential vote. Read more ...

HEADLINE: A Day of Protests, Spared of Confrontations

BYLINE: VIV BERNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Protesters again take to the streets on the second day of the Democratic convention. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Protesters returned to the streets of Charlotte for a fourth consecutive day on Wednesday, but this time without confrontation or arrests as the Democratic National Convention continued.
A flash mob that grew to 150 to 200 marched in the streets protesting corporate money in politics and the handling of detainees, just as delegates were arriving in the afternoon for the second day of the convention. The group was surrounded by police officers but allowed to march to within about a block of Time Warner Cable Arena, gathering in an intersection for several minutes.
The march eventually moved on without incident.
It was one of several protests during the day, including a gathering of about two dozen in front of the Duke Energy Center. Protesters planned to give the company's chairman and chief executive, Jim Rogers, a U.S.B. flash drive that included 150,000 signatures asking the corporation to stop supporting the American Legislative Exchange Council, which promotes conservative causes with lawmakers around the nation.
"ALEC is responsible for a host of right-wing backwards bills all over the country that are totally written by corporations like Duke to benefit corporations like Duke,'' said Ben Carroll, part of the Coalition to March on Wall Street South. "There's been in recent months a lot of pressure on a lot of these corporations that are part of ALEC, and leading many of them to leave. So we've got to keep the pressure on."
A group of undocumented Hispanic immigrants returned for another day of protest after 10 members were arrested on Tuesday when they sat in the middle of an intersection near the convention and refused to move.
"There are things that he can do right now that he's not doing,'' Unzueta Carrasco, an undocumented immigrant who was arrested on Tuesday, said of Mr. Obama. "If I'm going to continue believing in him as my president, I need him to take those actions and I need him to take those steps to really support every person in our community."
If protesters were hoping to generate a following in Charlotte, which has an unemployment rate of 10 percent and saw thousands of layoffs by the banks based here after the 2008 economic collapse, they weren't successful. Charlotte has not historically been a protest town, and apparently that hasn't changed.
"It's not and it's bad manners in the South to protest,'' said Beth Henry, a retired corporate lawyer from Charlotte who was on the streets protesting Duke's contribution to global warning, "and I wouldn't be out here if there wasn't so much at stake."

HEADLINE: Steel Leads Revival in Ohio River Valley

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
PADUCAH, Ky. -- On a mile-wide reach of the Ohio River, just upstream from where it converges with the Mississippi, Ray McKinney, the first mate aboard a towboat named the Mike Weisend, pounded the slack out of steel cables that lash 15 barges together in a 1,000-foot-long tow.
The heavy pipe in his hands and the tangle of cable at his feet are common equipment for deckhands on the Ohio, a central artery of American commerce for nearly 250 years. But the cargo that the 6,000-horsepower towboat was readying to push upriver was far less familiar to Mr. McKinney and the eight other crew members.
Instead of the usual load of coal, the barge holds were filled with more than 25,000 tons of iron castings. Their destination: a steel plant in Ghent, Ky., 400 miles away. 
The iron castings are evidence of a seminal economic transition that is unfolding in the six-state Ohio River Valley, a region that once encompassed much of what used to be called the Rust Belt. ''The coal trade is way down,'' said Mr. McKinney, 54, who has spent more than 30 years moving bulk cargo on the Ohio River. ''But we're doing a lot more commercial cargo now. We're seeing more steel, more rock, more concrete. Somebody's making money.''
Business at the iron and steel foundries in Kentucky and Ohio is soaring. Automakers are ordering more steel. Steel pipe and steel construction equipment are needed to tap the deep natural gas-saturated shales of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. General Electric has an $800 million program in Louisville, Ky., to retrofit buildings to make new types of appliances. The company said it had hired nearly 900 workers this year and would hire several hundred more.
There are many ways to assess economic performance. On Wall Street and in Washington, data about product inventories, plant openings, business starts and employment are assembled into economic assessments, many of which report that the national economic recovery has sputtered and nearly stalled.
But those same conventional metrics tell a more encouraging story for the Ohio River Valley. Between June 2011 and June 2012, Ohio generated 100,000 new jobs, the fourth leading state in job generation behind California, Texas and New York, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found. In one month, from this June to July, Indiana generated 12,500 new jobs, ranking it fourth among states in that period. Ohio's unemployment rate dropped 1.7 percentage points between July 2011 and this past July, a larger percentage drop than all but three other states in that period. West Virginia's unemployment rate in July was 7.4 percent, according to bureau figures, nearly a full percentage point below the national rate of 8.3 percent.
By virtue of transporting the basic bulk materials that make the country work, Mr. McKinney and the rest of the Mike Weisend crew members are afforded a closer and, arguably, more immediate weekly measure of the economy. The details they are piecing together as they drop tows of steel at modern plants in Kentucky and West Virginia, and pick up tows of chemicals and grain in Ohio and Illinois, are evidence of the steadily strengthening and modernizing economy evolving along the Ohio River Valley after decades of Rust Belt decay.
''We're getting busier and busier,'' said Luke Patterson, 31, a West Virginia native and one of the towboat's two pilots. ''There's more traffic on the river. You can tell that things are changing.''
The region deserves some credit, said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''It's rejected the narrative of decline and the theory that we would be just fine if we designed our goods here, but produced them offshore,'' Mr. Muro said. ''What's turning out to be the case is that production can occur here. Our strongest industrial sectors are still based in that very region of the country.''
For two generations, few places so darkly illustrated the erosion in American industrial vitality, and the heart-sore circumstances of its people, than the Ohio River Valley. The 981 miles of river from Pittsburgh to Cairo, Ill., strikingly beautiful as it flows past rounded hills, also drained a landscape of shuttered plants, broken towns and lives bent by lost jobs and frantic worry.
To some extent, the rust has not been rubbed off of some river towns, particularly those tied to the coal industry. Natural gas, which is in abundant supply and available at near-record low prices, is replacing coal as a fuel source in generating electricity, particularly in the Midwest.
In July, for instance, the Ohio Valley Coal Company announced that it would cut 29 workers from its Powhatan No. 6 mine in Belmont County, Ohio, across the Ohio River from Wheeling, W.Va.
''The communities that host the industrial jobs, that have power plants or are tied to the coal industry are really suffering,'' said Pat D. Hemlepp, a spokesman for American Electric Power, based in Ohio. ''I'm originally from Ashland, Ky., a river city, and still visit there every few months. If you looked at the economy in an Ashland, or an Ironton or Portsmouth, Ohio, or a Huntington, W.Va., you'd get a much different view of the Ohio River economy. The job market is pretty depressing in those areas.''
As recently as 2010, the last year for complete figures, 122.7 million tons of coal was shipped by barge on the Ohio River, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. This year, towboat companies anticipate that shipments could fall to 110 million tons.
Kentucky's coal production in the first three months of 2012 fell to 26.3 million tons, 5 percent less than during the same period in 2011, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. West Virginia's 2012 first-quarter production, 32.8 million tons, was down 7.2 percent from the same 2011 period.
Yet even with diminishing coal shipments, Ohio River cargo traffic is climbing over all, and towboat companies are expanding. AEP River Operations, a subsidiary of American Electric Power, operates 3,200 barges and 90 towboats, including the Mike Weisend. The company anticipates that its commercial traffic will grow to 46 million tons this year, 2 million tons more than last year. ''We've added 300 barges to our fleet through acquisitions,'' said Tim Light, AEP's senior vice president for fuel, emissions and logistics.
Aboard the Mike Weisend, though, crew members notice they are towing more materials more often to plants that are operating at capacity, like the Gallatin Steel Company in Ghent. There also are more jobs on river barges. Crew members work two six-hour shifts for 21 straight days, followed by 21 days off.
''It takes a little time to get used to it,'' said Brandon Detty, 27, the assistant engineer from Chillicothe, Ohio, who has worked on the river for five years. He said his paycheck was about $1,100 every two weeks.
The $12 million Mike Weisend, one of the newest towboats in the Ohio River fleet, is designed to help AEP retain its towboat employees. The boat has comfortable private rooms. Crew members eat well thanks to the cook, Caroline Pollitt, 44.
''It's nine people to feed every day,'' said Ms. Pollitt, who lives in Vanceburg, Ky., and has two grown sons. ''I care for them like family.''

HEADLINE: Europe to Investigate Chinese Exports of Solar Panels

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
CHENGDU, China -- Defying Chinese threats of retaliation against European wines and industrial materials, the European Union is preparing to begin on Thursday morning a broad investigation into whether Chinese companies have been exporting solar panels for less than it costs to make them.
The case would be one of the largest trade actions in European history and could lead to steep tariffs on much of China's $20 billion in annual exports of solar products to Europe, four people familiar with the dispute said Wednesday.
The anti-dumping case, which follows a series of bankruptcies and factory closings by European and U.S. solar panel manufacturers, would broaden what has already become one of the biggest sticking points in trade relations between China and the United States. The U.S. Commerce Department imposed preliminary anti-dumping tariffs in May of at least 31 percent on Chinese solar panels, in addition to preliminary anti-subsidy tariffs of 2.9 percent to 4.73 percent that were imposed in March.
The Chinese government has responded by accusing American producers of polysilicon, the main material used in solar panels, of engaging in unfair trade practices and has threatened steep tariffs on the producers. 
Chinese polysilicon producers have asked the country's Commerce Ministry to investigate whether their European rivals have sold subsidized material below cost in China. The official newspaper China Daily on Wednesday quoted an unidentified person at the Commerce Ministry as saying that if the European Union opened the solar panel trade case, the Chinese government might retaliate with trade restrictions aimed at European wines and polysilicon.
Chinese government officials declined to comment Wednesday evening, saying that they wanted to see first what the European Union would do.
The E.U. trade case differs from the American action in that the European case will most likely be limited to an anti-dumping complaint, without including an anti-subsidy charge, the people familiar with the dispute said. They insisted on anonymity, citing the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue.
The Union also takes longer than the United States to investigate such cases. Preliminary tariffs could be imposed in Europe next May, and final tariffs would not be set until December of next year.
E.U. officials declined to comment on the solar panel issue. Regarding the possibility of Chinese retaliation, they repeated the Union's standard position that foreign countries should impose trade restrictions only if they follow procedures that comply with the World Trade Organization's rules.
The United States and the Union each follow elaborate, quasi-judicial procedures for anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases, taking voluminous statements from affected companies before acting, and following detailed rules for setting any tariffs. China's methods for assessing trade penalties are relatively mysterious, and have been the subject of periodic European and American criticism.
The Union is preparing to start the investigation in response to a complaint filed by a coalition of about 20 European companies led by SolarWorld, a German maker of solar panels. SolarWorld, which also has operations in Oregon, had previously set up a coalition of solar panel producers in the United States that used a legal filing to force the Commerce Department to file the cases there.
Chen Huiqing, deputy director for solar products at the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, said at an industry conference in Guangzhou two weeks ago that the Chinese industry had sent a team of representatives to Brussels in one last bid to talk European officials out of starting a trade case. She warned that Chinese solar panel manufacturers already faced declining profit margins, shortages of capital and weakening foreign demand.
Chinese companies played a tiny role in the global solar power industry until five years ago, when they began a surge that has now brought them two-thirds of the global market. That rapid growth has been accompanied by a steep plunge in wholesale prices for solar panels, which have dropped by up to three-quarters in the past four years.
Retail prices have fallen much more slowly, as the bulk of the cost of a solar panel system lies in installation, and those costs have not fallen nearly as fast.
Chinese industry officials and regulators have periodically denied allegations that they are selling solar panels below cost in foreign markets, insisting that their huge investments in big new factories have brought down costs. But big Chinese solar companies have been posting heavy losses, particularly in the second quarter.
Frank Haugwitz, a solar industry consultant based in Beijing, said that if the Union imposed tariffs, it would be a serious blow to a Chinese industry already suffering from overcapacity. But the Chinese government is strongly committed to having a large solar panel industry, and is starting to use subsidies to expand the modest domestic market for solar panels.
''Beijing is very committed; it will not let them down,'' Mr. Haugwitz said.
Milan Nitzschke, the president of European Union ProSun, the industry coalition assembled by SolarWorld to seek tariffs on Chinese competitors, expressed skepticism that China would actually levy steep tariffs on imports of polysilicon from the United States or Europe, which are among the world's largest producers.
Chinese solar panel manufacturers buy a lot of imported polysilicon because domestic producers cannot make enough. So tariffs on European and U.S. polysilicon would have to be paid by Chinese solar panel makers that are already struggling, said Mr. Nitzschke, who is also a vice president of SolarWorld.
China is rapidly expanding its own polysilicon production. But environmentalists are skeptical, because making polysilicon requires huge amounts of electricity, and nearly four-fifths of China's electricity comes from burning coal, which produces air pollution and global warming gases.
It takes up to two years for a solar panel to generate enough electricity to match the electricity that went into manufacturing it, mostly for the polysilicon.
Chinese retaliation against European wines could be more politically feasible in Beijing. Tales of lavish spending on expensive wines by the wealthy and by government officials periodically surface on the Chinese Internet, and feed public anxiety about the wide gap between rich and poor.
China exports over 90 percent of its solar panels. It has done so to tap into billions of dollars in subsidies from government agencies and other electricity users in the United States and Europe for homes and businesses to install solar panels. W.T.O. rules have discouraged Western countries from banning the use of their subsidies for the purchase of Chinese solar panels.
The exception has been government procurement of solar panels, for which the United States has some ''buy American'' provisions. China has not joined the W.T.O. side agreement on government procurement, as many Chinese provincial governments have been leery of being required to accept foreign bids for local and provincial government contracts. So Western governments also have the option not to entertain bids from Chinese companies, though this option has seldom been exercised.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Home of the Future Still Years Away

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Sabine Starling, a Berlin architect, tapped her iPad and selected a cartoon video for her two daughters. The Apple tablet beamed the choice onto the screen of her white, Internet-ready flat panel television a few feet away.
In the wireless household, using a tablet as a television remote is supposed to be just one conversation in a din of synchronized chatter between electronic devices like TVs, phones, audio equipment and computers -- and also involving dishwashers, refrigerators, heaters, motion sensors, lights and windows.
But in Ms. Starling's apartment near Kollwitz Platz in the Prenzlauer Berg district in Berlin, the iPad remote, which works with Apple's own TV service, is an all-too-rare sign of the wave of wireless home automation that was supposed to arrive a decade ago. 
Experts say there are several reasons why the uncabled home, which became possible with the advent of Wi-Fi networks, has been slow in coming, with consumer indifference, the cost of consuming wireless data, the global recession and competing technical standards among them. ''Theoretically, the technology is already there,'' said Peter Cooney, an analyst at ABI Research in London. ''But there needs to be something to motivate consumers to get it into the home. And there's no one system to pull it all together. It's early days.''
Wireless connectivity in the home was a major theme of the Internationale Funkaustellung, the largest European consumer electronics trade fair, which was expected to draw a quarter million visitors and nearly 1,500 exhibitors through Wednesday in Berlin.
Wi-Fi networks and residential gateways, which are home networking devices that combine broadband modems, routers, firewalls and network switches, began appearing in 1999.
So far, they have enabled a range of services including home security and lighting, multidevice audio and video streaming and ''smart'' meter energy management.
But in Pacific Palisades, California, a new 4,539 square-foot, or 422 square-meter, contemporary Mission style home on the market for $3.5 million illustrates the technology's full potential.
Smart thermostats and sensors use electricity and natural gas at maximum efficiency. Air-conditioning, security and irrigation systems are managed by iPads and other smart devices. Video, audio and Internet stream over the Elan G, a multimedia system made by Elan Home Systems of Carlsbad, California. The washer, dryer and bathroom fans are connected wirelessly, letting the local utility reduce power consumption during peak demand. Lighting is controlled by motion sensors. The front, back and garage doors can be activated remotely with an e-mail.
''Improving the efficiency of homes with wireless Internet connectivity is where the industry is headed,'' said Robert Kleiman, the co-founder of Structure Home, a custom builder in Los Angeles that built Vision House Los Angeles with Green Builder Media. Mr. Kleiman said home buyers are increasingly demanding wireless technology to save on energy costs and add convenience. ''The technology is readily available and will become standard in the near future,'' Mr. Kleiman said.
As the number of home networks rises, new automation services are beginning to appear. According to IHS, a research firm in Wellingborough, England, the number of homes worldwide with ethernet connections, which is necessary for Wi-Fi, will double to 800 million by 2016 from 400 million this year. The number of low-power, low-bandwidth networks essential for monitors and always-on sensors is to surge to 28.8 million by 2016 from 3.3 million, IHS expects.
In June, France Télécom introduced MyPlug, a wireless monitor that adjusts household energy consumption and can notify working parents when their children arrive home. MyPlug inserts into an electric socket and uses a remote sensor to detect the arrival of individuals carrying custom electronic IDs, and sends notifications by text message.
''The connectivity is already a reality,'' said Thibault de la Fresnaye, a France Télécom vice president at the Orange Technocentre, a marketing research center in Paris. ''There are now more enablers for home automation, security, presence detection, energy management. What is slowing the speed of this development is the protocol diversity.''
Protocols are the arbitrary digital languages or codes that devices use to communicate with each other. Apple and specialists like Sigma Designs of Milpitas, California, which owns the Z-Wave interoperable device protocol, are promoting proprietary solutions.
But there are many other standards too, like new, low-power versions of Bluetooth and DECT, the digital cordless phone standard, Wireless USB and ZigBee, a standard used by Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Samsung and other chip and component makers.
Fear of copyright piracy has also slowed the distribution of audio and video over multiple devices. Music and film studios require broadcasters to secure their multi-device streaming technology to prevent theft, said Adam Nightingale, a sales director at Irdeto, a company in Amsterdam that makes security software for broadcasters. ''The process can be onerous and tedious,'' Mr. Nightingale said.
The cost of mobile data that wireless devices generate to communicate in the home can also be an obstacle, said Lisa Arrowsmith, an analyst at IHS. France Télécom's MyPlug, for example, communicates the arrival of individuals in a home with a short text message. The texts are billed at the standard rate. ''The lack of flexibility in tariff pricing is an issue,'' Ms. Arrowsmith said.
Some appliance makers said they were wary of committing to wireless devices in a down economy. ''In this type of economic environment, the costs of any type of new wireless device must be weighed carefully against consumer demand,'' said Alberto Prado, a vice president at Philips, Europe's largest home appliance maker, in Amsterdam.
Philips is selling wireless home patient monitors. The work on connected appliances is in development, Mr. Prado said. But others are moving quickly into what they see as the future of their industries.
Harman International, the maker of Harman Kardon, Infinity and JBL audio equipment, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut, introduced 56 new products at the IFA technology fair, all of them with wireless capability.
Most of Harman's wireless speakers, headphones and home entertainment systems can use Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or Airplay, the transmission technology owned by Apple. ''We are technology agnostic,'' said Dinesh Paliwal, the chief executive of Harman International, during an interview at IFA. ''Our philosophy is to follow the content, and consumers want that content to be mobile.''
Minoru Usui, the president of Seiko Epson, the maker of Epson wireless printers, and new devices like the Moverio BT 100, a set of see-through multimedia glasses that can stream movies and Internet data via Wi-Fi, said the building blocks were in place for the wireless home of the future. Eighty percent of Epson's ink jet printers, and 50 percent of its projectors, can be operated over wireless networks, Mr. Usui said. ''The connectivity and the consumer applications are all there,'' Mr. Usui said during an interview at the Japanese Embassy in Berlin during IFA. ''There is some consumer reluctance to going wireless, but I think this will be overcome over the next five years.''
One sign that consumers are embracing the future is The Nest, a wireless thermostat that adjusts home energy use for maximum efficiency. Sales of the Nest, which costs $249, have been skyrocketed since it went on sale in October. In the first three days, the company, Nest Labs of Palo Alto, California, sold what it thought it would sell in three months, said Matt Rogers, the company founder and a former head of iPod software development at Apple.
''We are at the brink of a new era in the home,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''It is a function of how many companies understand the big picture and are willing to put the features in place.''

HEADLINE: FedEx Down, Facebook Up In Mixed Day for Traders

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed on Wednesday, held in check by a warning from the package delivery company FedEx that its profits would be hurt by a slowdown in the global economy.
FedEx cited weakness in its express package delivery business, a sign that its customers around the world are choosing slower, less expensive delivery options. The company's stock fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.80.
''It's one more piece of news that suggests that the global economy is slowing and therefore makes central bank action more likely,'' said Brian Gendreau, market strategist at the investment advisory firm Cetera Financial. 
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said the central bank is inclined to provide new stimulus to the United States economy if needed. Investors will get more guidance on Friday when the government releases its monthly report on employment, which is considered one of the most important barometers for the world's largest economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 11.54 points, or 0.09 percent, at 13,047.48. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.50 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,403.44. The Nasdaq composite index lost 5.79 points, or 0.19 percent, to 3,069.27.
Earlier, the Labor Department reported that companies got more productivity from their workers this spring than originally estimated. Productivity increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the April-June quarter, up from an initial estimate of 1.6 percent. Labor costs rose at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, slightly lower than the 1.7 percent initially estimated.
FedEx cut its earnings forecast late Tuesday, blaming the weak global economy. The company said the shortfall was primarily in its express division, which moves 3.5 million packages on an average day. Poor economic conditions in Europe and slowing growth elsewhere, including in Asia, have led customers away from overnight air delivery.
Stock indexes were mostly higher in Europe, and the yields on government bonds issued by Spain and Italy declined -- a sign that investors are becoming more optimistic about the ability of those countries to repay their debts.
Benchmark indexes rose 0.5 percent in Germany and 0.2 percent in France.
The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, is expected on Thursday to reveal details of a new bond-buying program intended to cut borrowing costs for Spain and Italy, the latest focuses in Europe's sovereign debt crisis. Without some way to reduce the interest rates on the bonds they sell, the two nations could be pushed into asking for a bailout, following a path taken by Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
Among other stocks making big moves, Facebook gained 85 cents, or 5 percent, to $18.58 after its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said he would not sell any shares for a year. The company also announced a major stock buyback.
The Hartford Financial Services Group closed up 35 cents, or 2 percent, at $18.05. The insurer and wealth manager said it had agreed to sell its retirement plans business to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance for $400 million.
Nokia fell 45 cents, or 16 percent, to $2.38. The Finnish company announced a new Windows-based smartphone in New York. It faces tough competition from Apple, which is expected to announce the latest version of its iPhone next week.
Safeway gained 68 cents, or 4 percent, to $16.50. The supermarket chain said it planned to take the gift-card business Blackhawk Network Holdings public by the first half of 2013.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 6/32 to 100 9/32, and the yield rose to 1.60 percent from 1.57 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: New Wrinkle in Men's Wear: Shops Just for Men

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom about guys and shopping has always been that they go together like paisley and plaid, which is to say not very well. There is a reason men's wear in most stores is relegated to the back walls and the basements, while women's wear is front and center.
But at the beginning of another New York Fashion Week, an event long dominated by the top designers of women's wear, it would seem that the fight for gender equality has finally come to the place where one might least expect it. When shopping, men are demanding better service, and retailers are providing it.
''For too long, male shoppers were considered to be the stepchildren,'' said Jim Moore, the creative director of GQ. ''There were a lot of assumptions on the retail level that men weren't interested in fashion and that they just went to department stores to buy socks and underwear.'' 
But in recent months, a surprising number of retailers have opened stores that cater solely to their male customers, with specialized environments and customer service. Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue have remodeled their men's floors, and Urban Outfitters created a separate catalog for men. Even Fashion Week has more events tailored to men's wear.
Details magazine has rented a space this week at Lincoln Center, home to the fashion shows, to encourage more men's designers, like John Bartlett and Mark McNairy, to show their collections here, rather than in Europe, where men's designers typically get more respect.
While men have traditionally been stubborn consumers, and the fastest to close their wallets during times of economic strain, there is a growing sense among retailers, evidenced by the phenomenal success of new men's concepts from labels like Coach and J. Crew, that a new generation of male consumers actually embraces fashion. Or at least that younger guys are not so afraid of shopping.
Luxury designer labels like Hermès and Bottega Veneta have responded to a growing market by opening distinct stores for men, and Lanvin, the French fashion house that dressed both the best actress and best actor winners at the Oscars this year, plans to open an expensive one on Madison Avenue this fall.
In August, Christian Louboutin, the designer known for his red-soled stilettos, opened a store for men in the meatpacking district, the first of three men's-only stores planned this year. Mr. Louboutin expects men's shoes to grow to 20 percent of his business, from 5 percent, within a few years. And they typically cost $2,000 a pair.
The trend has also reached more democratically priced stores like Club Monaco, Ralph Lauren and even Ugg, the shearling shoe company, which opened a men's store this summer. On Thursday, Nordstrom is opening a temporary men's store in SoHo, with products selected by the editors of GQ, like Warby Parker eyeglasses and Billy Reid sportswear. Other touches intended to appeal to guys include a coffee bar, complimentary shaves and, naturally, lots of gadgets.
The reason for all this attention to men is fairly obvious: since the recession, they have represented the fastest-growing segment of the adult apparel market, according to the NPD Group's Consumer Tracking Service. In 2011, dollar sales in men's wear increased 4 percent, to roughly $55 billion, led by strong gains in categories like dress shirts, tailored suits and sports coats. (The women's market is twice as large, but it grew at a rate of 3 percent for the same period.)
While the gain in men's wear is partly attributed to the economy, a bigger factor has likely been the broader interest in fashion.
''Men's wear has traditionally lagged behind women's wear for decades and decades,'' said Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst of NPD. ''It's the first thing to spiral downward during a recession, and the last to recover -- with the exception of this one.''
In a much-noticed remark made during a CNBC special in May that focused on the rise of J. Crew, Mickey Drexler, the chief executive who has long been considered a merchandising visionary, observed that ''to walk through a women's department, always, is just not a men's thing.'' And anything said by Mr. Drexler, who also charted much of the Gap's growth in the 1990s, is generally seen as retail gold.
When the company began experimenting with men's retail concepts in 2009, its success with a style of tailored suit called the Ludlow was a big surprise. So in March, it opened a spinoff suiting store in TriBeCa called the Ludlow Shop that has been a hit with male shoppers. Sales of men's wear at J. Crew are now growing at a higher rate than women's wear, according to the company, which has plans to open two more men's shops this year, in Boston and Los Angeles.
Figuring out the new male consumer, however, is not so simple, and retailers are studying their shopping habits in intimate detail. Among the unexpected things they have discovered is that guys like chairs, which create the impression that it is fine for them to hang out in a store, even if they are not shopping. Darker colors are also important in the décor. And the music should be tailored to their tastes. A lot of stores are using the term ''man caves.''
Since Coach, a company best known for its women's handbags, began opening stores for men two years ago, its sales of men's products like briefcases and wallets quadrupled, to a projected $400 million this year. Men have become such important customers that the company has differentiated the shopping environment for them in existing stores.
In its store at 595 Madison Avenue, the men's area has chocolate-brown walls and subdued lighting, while the rest of the store is lined with gleaming white subway tiles. And men are greeted differently.
''Women like to be helped, while men like to help themselves, but be guided,'' said Greg Unis, a senior vice president. ''They don't want to be pounced on when they first walk into the store.''
Inside Club Monaco's Bloor Street flagship in Toronto, a dedicated space for men's wear opened in November and has displays of tweed jackets mixed with chopped logs, and you might hear a track from the Rolling Stones album ''Exile on Main St.'' or 1960s reggae.
At the same moment in the women's area, you would hear contemporary music from First Aid Kit or Warpaint, songs that inspired Caroline Belhumeur, the store's women's designer, this season. Another store for men is planned to open in Hong Kong this month with a theme of Americana, featuring Rancourt & Company shoes, Southwick suits and vintage Rolex watches.
''At this point,'' said Aaron Levine, the company's vice president for men's design, ''our guy wants to have his own environment and wants to be catered to much in the same way that our girl does.''

HEADLINE: As China Ages, Beijing Turns to Morality Tales to Spur Filial Devotion

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and ADAM CENTURY

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Reading it now, six centuries after Guo Jujing wrote this paean to parental devotion, ''The 24 Paragons of Filial Piety'' comes off as a collection of scary bedtime stories. There is the woman who cut out her own liver to feed her sick mother, the boy who sat awake shirtless all night to draw mosquitoes away from his slumbering parents and the man who sold himself into servitude to pay for a father's funeral.
While the parables are even more familiar to most Chinese than Grimm's Fairy Tales are to Americans -- the text remains a mainstay of educational curriculum here -- they have understandably lost much of their motivational punch.
But when the government, in an effort to address the book's glaring obsolescence, issued an updated version last month in the hope that the book would encourage more Chinese to turn away from their increasingly self-centered ways and perhaps phone home once in a while, it wasn't quite prepared for the backlash. 
Compared with its predecessor, the new book brims with down-to-earth suggestions for keeping parents happy in their golden years. Readers are urged to teach them how to surf the Internet, take Mom to a classic film and buy health insurance for retired parents.
''Family is the nucleus of society,'' intoned Cui Shuhui, the director of the All-China Women's Federation, which, along with the China National Committee on Aging, published the new guidelines after two years of interviews with older Chinese. ''We need family in order to advance Chinese society and improve our economic situation.''
So far, those good intentions appear to have prompted mostly ridicule. But they have also unintentionally kicked up a debate on whether the government, not overextended children, should be looking after China's ballooning population of retirees.
In a fast-aging nation where hundreds of millions of people have left their former homes in the countryside in search of jobs, ''The New 24 Paragons of Filial Piety'' strikes many as nearly as out of touch with the problems of modern China as the old parables.
Take, for example, the responsibility to ''take one's parents traveling frequently.'' While feasible for successful professionals, the obligation is all but impossible for working people, especially the nation's roughly 252 million migrant workers, few of whom have ever experienced the joys of leisure travel.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, their numbers are rising 4.4 percent annually, meaning that nearly 11 million rural migrants arrived in Chinese cities last year alone -- and most likely left their aging parents behind.
Zhang Yang, a fruit vendor in Beijing, scoffed at the suggestion that he should take his parents on vacation, noting that he rarely stops working or has time to visit them in their hometown in Henan Province, roughly 400 miles south of the capital.
''One time I didn't get to go home for four years,'' he said sheepishly. ''Business here is good, but I feel guilty for not being with my parents.''
Li Ji, a popular columnist at the state-run Legal Daily newspaper, lashed out at the new guidelines, arguing that they would not be necessary if the government provided better care for its citizens. ''If the national health insurance was up to par, children wouldn't have to worry so much about their parents' health, and if companies were required to provide a certain number of vacation days, children would be able to go home more often,'' he wrote.
Despite the demands of an increasingly fast-paced society, the Confucian idea of filial devotion is deeply embedded in Chinese society. Tradition dictates that children live with their parents and care for them in their old age, a convention that historically provided a safety net.
But the custom is rapidly fraying as children struggle with the logistical and financial burdens of caring for their aged parents.
This has proved particularly challenging in recent years to the huge numbers of only children born after the introduction of strict family-planning rules in the late 1970s. One result, demographers say, is a skyrocketing number of so-called empty nests filled by older people who live alone while their children build their own roosts in distant cities.
According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, empty nests now account for more than 50 percent of all Chinese households; in some urban areas the figure has reached 70 percent. A 2011 report by the official Xinhua news agency said that nearly half of the 185 million people age 60 and older live apart from their children -- a phenomenon unheard of a generation ago.
Like many young Chinese, Chen Xuena, who works for a public relations company in Beijing, said she was torn between chasing a career and tending to her parents in far-off Zhejiang Province.
''Every time I visit home I see signs that my parents are getting older, and it really brings me down,'' said Ms. Chen, sitting at one of the capital's coffee bars. ''But once you get used to the opportunities and culture of Beijing, it's hard to leave.''
Such angst will only continue to grow, and not just because China still lacks a meaningful social safety net for the elderly. Demographers estimate that the population of those over 60 will triple before 2050; around the same time, projections show the median age of Chinese will be higher than that of Americans, but with perhaps one-third of the average income, adjusted for the cost of living.
Such figures help explain the sense of urgency that is beginning to grip the governing Communist Party. Last year, in an attempt to ease the impact from so much atomized living, the National People's Congress, China's legislature, proposed a law that obliges sons and daughters to ''return home to visit their parents frequently.''
The legislation would enable neglected parents to sue their children for infractions, though the vagueness of the law -- it does not spell out the frequency of visits -- has raised some doubts about its enforceability.
''The New 24 Paragons of Filial Piety,'' despite its ham-handedness, tries to address the root causes of loneliness.
It urges children to throw their parents a birthday party each year and listen attentively to their stories from the past. It even asks that children help widowed parents remarry, a task that some parents found objectionable.
''I would be really embarrassed if my son tried to help me remarry,'' said Xu Zhihao, a retiree who was sunning himself with friends in a Beijing park on Wednesday. ''That's not part of Chinese tradition.''

HEADLINE: Learning as Freedom

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. ROTH. 
Michael S. Roth, the president of Wesleyan University, is the author, most recently, of ''Memory, Trauma and History: Essays on Living With the Past.''

 BODY:
Middletown, Conn.
IN March, a task force organized by the Council on Foreign Relations tried to reframe the problems of the nation's public schools as a threat to national security. ''Large, undereducated swaths of the population damage the ability of the United States to physically defend itself, protect its secure information, conduct diplomacy, and grow its economy,'' it warned, while also referring to students as ''human capital.''
While the report focused on K-12 education and called for better college preparedness, its instrumentalist rhetoric has remarkable affinities with that of critics who see higher education as outmoded. Conservative scholars like Charles Murray, Richard Vedder and Peter W. Wood ask why people destined for low-paying jobs should bother to pursue their education beyond high school, much less study philosophy, literature and history. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel has offered money to would-be entrepreneurs to quit college and focus on Web-based start-ups instead. Business school professors like Clayton M. Christensen tell us that ''disruptive innovation'' is causing liberal-arts learning to be ''disintermediated'' so as to deliver just what the ''end user'' needs. 
From this narrow, instrumentalist perspective, students are consumers buying a customized playlist of knowledge.
This critique may be new, but the call for a more narrowly tailored education -- especially for Americans with limited economic prospects -- is not. A century ago, organizations as varied as chambers of commerce and labor federations backed plans for a dual system of teaching, wherein some students would be trained for specific occupations, while others would get a broad education allowing them to continue their studies in college. The movement led to the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, which financed vocational education, initially for jobs in agriculture and then in other industries.
The philosopher John Dewey, America's most influential thinker on education, opposed this effort. Though he was open to integrating manual training in school curriculums, Dewey opposed the dual-track system because he recognized that it would reinforce the inequalities of his time. Wouldn't such a system have the same result today?
To be sure, Dewey recognized the necessity of gainful employment. ''The world in which most of us live is a world in which everyone has a calling and occupation, something to do,'' he wrote. ''Some are managers and others are subordinates. But the great thing for one as for the other is that each shall have had the education which enables him to see within his daily work all there is in it of large and human significance.''
Education should aim to enhance our capacities, Dewey argued, so that we are not reduced to mere tools. ''The kind of vocational education in which I am interested is not one which will 'adapt' workers to the existing industrial regime; I am not sufficiently in love with the regime for that.'' Are we?
Who wants to attend school to learn to be ''human capital''? Who aspires for their children to become economic or military resources? Dewey had a different vision. Given the pace of change, it is impossible (he noted in 1897) to know what the world will be like in a couple of decades, so schools first and foremost should teach us habits of learning.
For Dewey, these habits included awareness of our interdependence; nobody is an expert on everything. He emphasized ''plasticity,'' an openness to being shaped by experience: ''The inclination to learn from life itself and to make the conditions of life such that all will learn in the process of living is the finest product of schooling.''
The inclination to learn from life can be taught in a liberal arts curriculum, but also in schools that focus on real-world skills, from engineering to nursing. The key is to develop habits of mind that allow students to keep learning, even as they acquire skills to get things done. This combination will serve students as individuals, family members and citizens -- not just as employees and managers.
Higher education faces stark challenges: the ravaging of public universities' budgets by strained state and local governments; ever rising tuition and student debt; inadequate student achievement; the corrosive impact of soaring inequality; and the neglect by some elite institutions of their core mission of teaching undergraduates.
But these problems, however urgent, should not cause us to neglect Dewey's insight that learning in the process of living is the deepest form of freedom. In a nation that aspires to democracy, that's what education is primarily for: the cultivation of freedom within society. We should not think of schools as garrisons protecting us from enemies, nor as industries generating human capital. Rather, higher education's highest purpose is to give all citizens the opportunity to find ''large and human significance'' in their lives and work.

HEADLINE: Like the Army Itself, Recruiters Prepare to Make Do With Less

BYLINE: By ADESHINA EMMANUEL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- From Uncle Sam saying ''I want YOU'' through ''Be All You Can Be'' to today's ''Army Strong,'' the United States Army has tailored its recruiting strategy to fill its ranks in war and in peace, in the years of the draft and with an all-volunteer force. It has reframed its education targets, sometimes opening its doors to high school dropouts, at other times pursuing college graduates and, more recently, finding a way to assess home-schooled students.
And as the Army makes the transition to a smaller fighting force with a tighter budget, it is not surprising to find Pentagon officials expressing confidence that recruiters are nimble enough to adapt to a new organizational model. 
But along with this confidence, there is concern about how recruiting will be affected by even sharper budget cuts scheduled to take effect in January, unless Congress can find a way to avert them. Some defense analysts say a military career could become a tougher sell, especially if federal budget cuts reduce pay and benefits for service members and the economy improves.
The Army has begun remaking its recruiting structure, a change it aims to complete by 2015. Donald Herth, chief of advertising and public affairs for the Army's Columbus Recruiting Battalion, based in Ohio, said the staff and duties of recruiting offices would be consolidated to make better use of resources and bring recruiting ''more in line with everyday Army life,'' where soldiers are deployed as teams.
In the past, recruiting officers worked alone, identifying prospective soldiers, processing their applications and preparing them for basic training.
Kathleen Welker, a public information officer for the Army Recruiting Command at Fort Knox, Ky., said recruiters failed or succeeded on their own merit.
''But the fact is, even though they are all trained, just by virtue of personality, not everybody is as good at everything,'' she said.
Under the new model, recruiters will be deployed as teams from centralized offices that have civilian employees to handle much of the administrative work. A handful of such consolidated centers are up and running. One in Coney Island, in Brooklyn, is scheduled to open this month, and will be staffed by recruiters from three nearby offices that are closing.
For the 2013 fiscal year, which will start on Oct. 1, the Defense Department asked for $913.8 million for recruiting, $53.4 million less than the year before. About $37.5 million of that drop would come from the Army, which has a $338 million recruiting budget through the reorganization and, with the war in Afghanistan winding down, the need to enlist fewer soldiers.
Ms. Welker said in an e-mail that the transition to the new recruiting model would continue, though ''we anticipate having to go slower than we thought'' because of uncertainties about the automatic budget cuts, known as sequestration.
The Obama administration recently shielded active-duty personnel from cuts in pay and benefits if Congress cannot agree on how to undo sequestration by the end of the year.
The administration's decision potentially means taking more money from elsewhere, including training, at a time when the military has been focusing on filling the jobs of specialists in technology, health care, nuclear energy and foreign languages.
Special training opportunities that can translate later to the private sector are important incentives in the recruiting of college graduates, according to Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, a policy group based in Washington.
One recent Army recruit, a 23-year-old Midwesterner who graduated last year from a small liberal arts college, said he had enlisted in large part because he thought such specialized training could help him at the end of his five-year contract, when he plans to seek a bigger paycheck in the private defense sector.
He opted to join the Army after assessing the job market at the start of his senior year. With degrees in philosophy and political science, he was afraid of ending up like many of his peers, jobless and freighted with debt. He now earns about $1,500 a month training as a signals intelligence analyst in an Indo-Iranian language.
A stronger economy might have led to a different decision.
''It's hard to say, as my whole adult life has been marked by economic doomsday predictions and real economic crises,'' said the recruit, who spoke without permission from superiors and did not want his name published. Better prospects for a civilian job ''would have reduced the chances'' of his joining the Army, though he said he was happy to be there now.
Military analysts debate what it would take to dull the luster of enlisting in the Army, either for a short-term contract or as a career. James Jay Carafano, a security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said cuts in compensation and benefits could send more people to the private sector if the jobs picture brightens and ''financial support for the military drops.''
Michael E. O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, said he did not see the value of a military career diminishing any time soon.
However, he said other issues could eventually affect recruiting, including the ''publicity and reality'' of post-traumatic stress disorder in returning troops and the increase in military suicides.

HEADLINE: Hunts Point Market Deal Runs Into a New Obstacle

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
New York City's Hunts Point Produce Market, which threatened to move to New Jersey in 2010, finally got the subsidy it wanted from the Bloomberg administration to revamp and expand its longtime home in the Bronx.
But its operator says there is something else it wants, aside from the $172.5 million in cash and tax breaks from the city.
The Hunts Point Terminal Produce Cooperative notified city officials on Wednesday that it had reached an impasse with the city over the continuing role of the Business Integrity Commission, a city agency created to root out organized crime in the carting industry. The produce operators say that the commission has overstepped its authority and is interfering with business by setting operating hours and showering delivery and storage trucks with parking tickets. 
The cooperative has not broken off talks with the city, but it said in a letter to Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, that it was ''discontinuing the exclusive negotiations with the administration.''
''They feel they have an open-ended power to oversee everything done by the management of this market,'' Matthew D'Arrigo, co-president of the cooperative, said in an interview. ''We fundamentally disagree. Their mission begins and ends with organized crime.'' Mr. D'Arrigo said his members did not want to abandon Hunts Point for New Jersey, but they believed that the commission had usurped the cooperative's role and had created an intolerable situation. The wholesale market makes about $2.3 billion in annual sales and employs more than 3,500 workers.
Shari C. Hyman, the chairwoman of the Business Integrity Commission, did not return calls requesting comment.
''We're as committed as ever to keeping the Hunts Point Terminal produce market in the Bronx, where it belongs,'' Benjamin Branham, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation, said. ''The fulfillment of more than $170 million in public funding towards its redevelopment puts us one step closer to reaching a deal that will preserve thousands of jobs and a critical component of the city's infrastructure.''
The impasse is only the latest chapter in the story of a Bloomberg administration job-retention program that most often focuses on financial institutions and Fortune 500 companies. But in this instance, city officials say they do not want to lose relatively high-paying blue-collar jobs. This year, the city and the state promised FreshDirect, the online grocer, a $128 million package of tax breaks and cash so that it could build offices and a warehouse at the Harlem Rail Yards, adjacent to the Mott Haven and Port Morris neighborhoods. Like the produce cooperative, Fresh Direct, which is based in Queens, had threatened a move to New Jersey, which was offering a generous subsidy package of its own.
The produce cooperative, which has been based in Hunts Point since 1967, has long sought to expand its refrigerated operations and establish a better rail link to bring in carloads of fruits and vegetables. It uses as many as 1,000 truck trailers scattered across a 113-acre site to store produce.
Hunts Point also has a meat market and a seafood market, making it one of the world's largest food-distribution centers.
In May 2010, Stephen Katzman, co-president of the produce cooperative, told reporters that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey had called him offering ''pretty much whatever it would take to get us to go there.''
The cooperative, however, soon entered ''exclusive'' talks with New York City officials. After more than a year of talks, the Bloomberg administration, along with state and federal officials, agreed to provide the cooperative with the $172.5 million package.
In return, the cooperative was expected to sign a 99-year lease and spend about $330 million to revamp its operation at Hunts Point. The cooperative must also obtain about $160 million in additional financing for the project, no easy matter. The two sides must also negotiate the terms of a lease.
The city and the state announced on Tuesday that they had received $25 million in federal money with the help of Senator Charles E. Schumer for the last piece of the public contribution. But the cooperative delivered a letter on Wednesday saying that it would allow the second extension of the exclusive negotiating period to lapse.
Mr. D'Arrigo said the cooperative had never disagreed with the original mission of the integrity commission to root out organized crime. Relations between the two camps have improved somewhat recently, but he said the produce operators wanted a permanent solution.
Mr. D'Arrigo conceded that a move to New Jersey, which he said ''would welcome us to their side of the river,'' would present a logistical challenge.
''We're not here to play the Jersey card,'' he said. ''We want to see this through in Hunts Point.''

HEADLINE: Biden's Speech Likely to Spotlight Strengths, or Foibles

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Rick Berke contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Folksy and loose, passionate and sometimes off script, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrives onstage Thursday night as the president's most important political partner, policy enforcer, conscience, scold and occasional albatross.
Four years after joining the Democratic ticket, Mr. Biden has defied the skeptics who wondered whether he would still be on it this year, solidifying his place in President Obama's orbit and even positioning himself for a possible third run for the Oval Office in 2016.
But if the president's campaign strategists are counting on Mr. Biden to woo working-class white voters in Midwest battleground states, they also know a certain creative destruction comes with the territory. From time to time, they realize, some gaffe or provocative statement will give the opposition ammunition and undercut the campaign's desired message for a day or two. 
On Thursday evening, at least, it is reasonably certain Mr. Biden's script has been well scrubbed and he will stick to it, as he did four years ago when he talked about his roots and the perils of Republican rule. Bumped out of his own night in the spotlight by former President Bill Clinton, Mr. Biden will introduce Mr. Obama before all of the broadcast networks tune in (NBC will show it; CBS and ABC will not). His role in his 25-minute address, aides said, is to validate Mr. Obama the president, much as Michelle Obama validated Mr. Obama the family man.
In doing so, Mr. Biden speaks with a voice that eludes the president. In campaign terms, at least, he is everything Mr. Obama is not, for good or ill. In more than 100 campaign events so far, Mr. Biden has been the president's emissary to groups like labor, Hispanics and veterans. He will spend much of the next two months in Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa and Florida.
''He always looks out for the average Joe,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who has been tapped to play Mr. Biden's opponent, Representative Paul D. Ryan, in debate practice. ''He connects well with hard-working Americans like those in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and I think he will again just reinforce in an effective way the fundamental choice the country faces.''
Mr. Biden has played a significant role over the last four years. He oversaw the spending of the economic stimulus program, managed the end of the Iraq war and tried to negotiate a fiscal grand bargain with Republicans. He has been the liberal voice, though sometimes losing on issues like sending more troops to Afghanistan.
He says that Mr. Obama has kept his promise to hear him out even when they disagree. ''Everybody says, 'Does he listen to you?' And I say yes,'' Mr. Biden said in an interview this summer. ''You get to tell the president exactly what you think in vivid detail, and you get to leave. And he has to make the right decision.''
Mr. Biden has at times framed the race in a sharper way than his running mate might. He says the campaign's slogan boils down to ''Osama bin Laden is dead and G.M. is alive.'' Jabbing Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, for refusing to release more tax returns, Mr. Biden told a Hispanic audience, ''Mitt Romney wants you to show your papers, but he won't show us his.''
He can veer off course, as he did when he told a television interviewer that he supported same-sex marriage, forcing Mr. Obama to announce his own support before planned. More recently, the vice president told a largely black audience in Virginia that Mr. Romney's policies would enable banking and financial sectors to ''put you all back in chains.''
Mr. Biden's aides said the same-sex marriage announcement ended up working out, and that the chains comment made no real difference. But Republicans happily pounced. ''Joe Biden is a gaffe-prone surrogate who has managed to undermine President Obama and throw his campaign wildly off message,'' said Ryan Williams, a spokesman for the Romney campaign.
The American Future Fund, a conservative advocacy group, produced a video mocking Mr. Biden's misstatements, showing him saying that those who work in convenience stores tend to be Indian-Americans and emphasizing what he called ''a three-letter word, jobs, J-O-B-S.'' The video showed politicians and news anchors calling Mr. Biden a ''drunk uncle'' who is ''not very smart.''
The criticism has taken a toll. Just 28 percent of registered voters said they had a favorable view of Mr. Biden in a CBS News poll last month, while 37 percent had an unfavorable opinion and the rest did not know.
A separate survey released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center and The Washington Post found that more Americans by roughly similar proportions used negative language when asked for a one-word impression of Mr. Biden. The most frequently used negative words included ''idiot,'' ''incompetent'' and ''clown.'' The most frequently used positive words were ''good'' and ''honest.''
That worries some Democrats here as they mull possible successors to Mr. Obama in 2016. ''He's almost become the Dan Quayle of the Democratic Party,'' said Rick Williams, a Democratic strategist and lobbyist from Nashville. ''He keeps putting his foot in his mouth. I just don't think he's presidential.''
Still, in the convention hall, Democrats cheer his unabashed advocacy and his willingness to take the fight to Republicans. It remains unclear whether Mr. Biden actually would run in four years; he would be 74 upon taking office and 82 if he finished two terms.
But he certainly wants to be thought capable of running. If he does, then his speech Thursday night may be a kickoff of sorts.

HEADLINE: Shell to Test Capturing Of Carbon In Canada

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON - In a bid to make oil sands production less polluting, Royal Dutch Shell announced on Wednesday that it would go forward with the first carbon capture and storage project ever tried in the fields of western Canada.
The announcement of the Quest project after years of study comes just months before Washington will reconsider whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline to increase imports of heavy oil from the oil sands. Environmentalists have fought the project, arguing that refining and burning oil from the oil sands emit far more carbon than conventional oil.
The project, which is scheduled to begin operations by 2015, is intended to capture and permanently store underground more than a million tons of carbon dioxide a year, which Shell estimated was equivalent to taking 175,000 cars off the road. Carbon capture projects have lost favor in recent years because of concerns about their heavy costs, which have typically been subsidized by governments. 
The Shell project, with an estimated cost of about 1.35 billion Canadian dollars ($1.36 billion), will be heavily subsidized by the Canadian federal government and the provincial government of Alberta, which together are putting in 865 million Canadian dollars (about $874 million) over more than a decade.
Shell said it was hoping to reduce the carbon emissions from a treatment plant in Scotford, outside Edmonton, that processes extra-heavy oil called bitumen so it can be shipped to refineries in the United States.
"We recognize that our growth requires that it be accompanied by improved environmental management," said John Abbott, Shell's executive vice president for heavy oil, at a news conference in Calgary, Alberta. "Quest is a very big part of that."
Mr. Abbott said that Quest would reduce the emissions from the Scotford plant by 35 percent and demonstrate the technical viability of carbon capture and storage techniques. He added that it would help lead to wider application "through the energy industry and other sectors in the years to come."
Canada is already the top source of imported oil for the United States and currently produces more than 1.7 million barrels a day of synthetic crude from oil sands. The country's leaders hope to more than double oil sands production by 2025. To accomplish that, they need the Keystone XL pipeline - which would run to Gulf Coast refineries - to export more oil to the United States, or they must build an alternative pipelines to Canada's western coast to export the crude to Asia.
President Obama rejected TransCanada's application for a permit to build the 1,700-mile, $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline in January, but the Canadian pipeline company is reapplying for a permit. Mitt Romney has said he will approve the pipeline if elected president. An improved environmental outlook for oil sands might well encourage President Obama to reconsider his initial rejection.
On Wednesday, TransCanada proposed a new route for the pipeline to avoid an environmentally sensitive region of prairie and sand dunes in Nebraska, reducing the length of its transit across the Ogallala Aquifer.
"We know the world is watching," Ken Hughes, Alberta's energy minister, said at the news conference. "We are deeply committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions."
The Canadian government estimates that carbon emissions from oil sands production and refining has declined by roughly 40 percent since 1990, but the process remains more carbon-intensive than for all but the heaviest conventional crude oils produced around the world.
Canadian and American environmentalists have been opposed to oil sands development because of concerns over pollution and the destruction of natural habitat for hundreds of bird species in the Canadian boreal forest. But at least some Canadian environmentalists have expressed support for the Quest initiative.
"We see it as one tool in the tool kit that we need to tackle climate change," said Ed Whittingham, executive director of the Pembina Institute, an influential Canadian environmental group. "We have been critical of oil sands but we are supportive of C.C.S.," he added, using shorthand for carbon capture and storage.
But Kate Colarulli, deputy director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Oil campaign, said the project would not change her opposition to the pipeline.
"It's a lot of taxpayer money spent on greenwashing," she said. "The truth is there is an environmental Armageddon happening in northern Alberta. There are also questions about whether these gases can be safely stored underground."
The Quest project will pipe liquefied carbon dioxide to injection wells and then store the substance nearly a mile underground under multiple layers of rock and mineral formations. The oil sands will originate from the Athabasca Oil Sands project, a giant mining endeavor operated by Shell in a partnership with Chevron and Marathon. The companies have not disclosed how much money they will invest in the project.
Graham van't Hoff, Shell's executive vice president for carbon dioxide and alternative energies, said in an interview that it was important that Canada make a large financial commitment because "there is not yet the economic justification on this scale of abatement."
"Government subsidies are needed to get things off the ground," he added.
Iain Pyle, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, estimated that the project would probably break even with the government subsidies. "It's more a move to improve the environmental impact of the oil sands," he said.
Stanley Reed contributed reporting from London.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bill, Barack And Us

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Charlotte, N.C.
On Wednesday, the Democrats got to the point.
That was thanks to Bill Clinton, Beloved Democrat, a man who got negative ratings from only 27 percent of Americans in one recent national poll. There are pictures of kittens that get worse grades.
Everyone at the convention was eager to hear what Clinton had to say, particularly Barack Obama's aides who had been pacing around all day waiting to get a look at the transcript. 
A lot! Clinton ran overtime -- surprise! -- talking for nearly 50 minutes about a President Obama who had saved the auto industry, passed a stimulus that totally worked, improved the environment, reduced student loan costs, passed a transformative health care law, offered a reasonable and workable plan for debt reduction and helped create millions of private-sector jobs. If there was still stuff left undone, it was because ''no president -- not me, not any of my predecessors -- could fully have repaired the damage he found in just four years.''
He also said cooperation is better than conflict and a broken clock is right twice a day. He supports our men and women overseas. It's not like every word was golden.
But, really, it was some endorsement from a guy who'd been consigned to the Alpha Doghouse for trash-talking Obama during the 2008 primaries. Remember what F. Scott Fitzgerald said about there being no second acts in American lives? So wrong, Scott. Let me introduce you to Mr. Act Twelve.
The Democrats had been waiting for Clinton's speech for two days, during which they diverted themselves with a couple of brief platform fights, one about inserting a mention of God, who had inadvertently been cut out of the platform's 40 pages. (The Republicans left Tampa, Fla., wondering who had invited Clint Eastwood. The Democrats are now wondering who disinvited God.)
There was, of course, a lot of talk about rising from humble roots. The Republicans played that card hard, too. But Ann Romney's story about eating off an ironing board in college couldn't match Michelle Obama's saga of riding in a car ''so rusted out I could actually see the pavement going by in a hole in the passenger side-door.''
When she mentioned that, I remembered that when my husband and I were in graduate school, he had a car with exactly the same problem. I wonder if the president had to park in out-of-the-way places to conceal the fact that the safety sticker on the windshield was four years out of date. If so, perhaps it's just as well not to go into it.
Michelle was a wow, but there's something kind of ironic about a woman wearing the best dress in the history of political conventions, one that offers a particularly flattering view of the best upper arms in the history of the female gender, giving a speech in which she earnestly explains how she is just like us.
The first lady had a lot to say about the burden of student loans, but in her eagerness to press a mom-centric theme, never mentioned her work life after Harvard Law. One of the unremarked-upon factoids in recent political history is that the last two Democratic presidents both had their careers underwritten by lawyer spouses who served as the chief family wage-earners.
That brings us back to Bill Clinton, the first Democratic president to be the target of the wild-eyed hatred of a new far right that seemed incapable of accepting the fact that more people had voted for him than their alternative. In 1993, he got his party to raise taxes to get the soaring national deficits under control. It was a huge lift, and politically disastrous. The Democrats lost Congress in 1994. A freshman House member from Pennsylvania, who reluctantly cast the deciding ''yes'' vote, was politically ruined forever. (Chelsea is now married to her son. Really, you cannot make these Clinton stories up.)
The country got the reward. By the time Clinton left office, trailed by yet another scandal involving presidential pardons, the unemployment rate was 4 percent. Then he handed the country over to George W. Bush, who was pressured to cut taxes by the right wing that is now running the Republican show.
We're saddled with monster deficits, and the Republicans refuse to let this president do the brave thing Bill Clinton did, and get us more revenue.
So, we're almost done, convention-wise. We've learned that both parties like God and moms, particularly moms with humble roots. They both have faith that people who work hard and play by the rules can overcome exposure to secondhand furniture while they're in college. Otherwise, it's just a matter of whether you want to raise taxes and balance the budget like Clinton, or cut taxes and plunge us into a hopeless sea of debt like Bush. Let the fight begin.

HEADLINE: Obama Counting on Clinton to Help Sway Independent Voters

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Former President Bill Clinton tried to rebut Republican arguments against the re-election of President Obama in a major speech at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, saying Mr. Obama has taken steps to turn around an economy left in shambles by Republicans.
''In Tampa, the Republican argument against the president's re-election was pretty simple: We left him a total mess, he hasn't finished cleaning it up yet, so fire him and put us back in,'' Mr. Clinton said.
''I like the argument for President Obama's re-election a lot better,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''He inherited a deeply damaged economy, he put a floor under the crash - he began the long hard road to recovery, and laid the foundation for a more modern, more well-balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs, vibrant new businesses, and lots of new wealth for the innovators.''
Mr. Clinton described Mr. Obama as a man who is ''cool on the inside,'' but who ''burns for America on the outside.'' And in one of his most well-received lines, he said, ''I want a man who had the good sense to marry Michele Obama." 
The Clinton speech took on added weight since Mr. Obama, despite some differences with the former president in the 2008 election, is looking to his predecessor to sway Democrats and independents who remain uncertain about their vote. Mr. Obama was set to appear on stage with Mr. Clinton.
''The most important question is, what kind of country do you want to live in?'' Mr. Clinton asked in his speech. ''If you want a you're-on-your-own, winner-take-all society, you should support the Republican ticket. If you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility -- a we're-all-in-this-together society -- you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.''
Mr. Clinton's speech followed an address by Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Senate candidate who assailed oil companies and Wall Street executives by saying, ''People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: they're right. The system is rigged.'' And before that, Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown law graduate who came to embody the fight over employer health insurance coverage, appeared in a prime-time speaking slot, highlighting how Democrats were fully embracing social issues and abortion rights as they seek to draw female voters.
Earlier, Mr. Obama arrived in Charlotte as threats of bad weather led convention organizers to move his acceptance speech on Thursday from the outdoor venue of the Bank of America Stadium to the arena where the rest of the week's convention events are being held.
The president traveled on Air Force One from Washington as his party gathered in Charlotte, which was spared from rain for the first time in days. However, organizers cited the threat of potentially bad storms in abandoning their plans to hold the last night of the convention in the stadium.
Jen Psaki, a campaign spokeswoman, said organizers feared that they would have had to evacuate the stadium if a dangerous storm approached and that the president was disappointed with the outcome.
''We're all disappointed, because we had 65,000 ticket holders plus 19,000 people who were on the waiting list, excited to hear him deliver his speech tomorrow night,'' Ms. Psaki said. ''This isn't a call we wanted to make.''
The decision to keep the convention indoors is a disappointment to the Obama campaign and means that Mr. Obama will not recreate the scene of the 2008 convention speech he gave in a Denver football stadium packed with cheering supporters -- a signature moment for the campaign.
''We have been monitoring weather forecasts closely, and several reports predict thunderstorms in the area, therefore we have decided to move Thursday's proceedings to Time Warner Cable Arena to ensure the safety and security of our delegates and convention guests,'' said Steve Kerrigan, who is overseeing the convention for the Democrats. ''The energy and enthusiasm for our convention in Charlotte has been overwhelming, and we share the disappointment of over 65,000 people who signed up for community credentials to be there with the president in person.''
Despite the abrupt shift in plans, Democrats believed they were off to a strong start with their convention, and that the lineup of speakers on Tuesday night, led by the first lady, Michelle Obama, had roused the audience and television viewers for what promises to be a hard-fought final two months of the campaign between the president and the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney.
''This is what this convention is all about,'' said Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, in an appearance on MSNBC. ''It gives us an opportunity to really crystallize for the American people this stark contrast. And it's their choice what direction we want to go forward.
''So at the end of the week, I think we will have told a very effective story that should help not just galvanize our base, but galvanize our country,'' Ms. Jarrett said.
The campaign had hoped to recreate the excitement of Denver, when an enthusiastic throng embraced the president at the climax of the convention four years ago. That event drew ridicule from Republicans who derided it as an over-the-top setting with its stage framed by Greek columns. Republicans immediately sought to turn this week's change in venue against the Democrats.
''The Democrats continue to downgrade convention events due to lack of enthusiasm -- this time they are moving out of Bank of America/Panther stadium,'' began a statement from the Republican National Committee put out within minutes of the announcement. ''Problems filling the seats?''
Convention organizers needed to make a decision Wednesday because of the logistics of moving the convention and its large news media contingent to the stadium, used by the Carolina Panthers.
Both parties have been troubled by bad weather at their respective conventions. Hurricane Isaac forced the cancellation of the first day of the Republican convention last week in Tampa, Fla., and it has rained steadily here in Charlotte, leaving conventiongoers soaked or covered in rain gear and the organizers fretting about the potential for lightning at the outdoor arena in the heart of the city.
The party had been reluctant to move the speech since the stadium allowed them to build a crowd of as many as 65,000 people and distribute thousands of tickets to Obama supporters in a state the campaign would sorely like to win a second time.
Mr. Kerrigan said those ''community credential holders'' would be able to listen to the president on a special conference call Thursday.
''We will work with the campaign to ensure that those unable to attend tomorrow's event will be invited to see the president between now and Election Day,'' he said.
Campaign officials had hoped that a packed stadium rally would answer the lingering concerns that the energy around Mr. Obama's re-election bid is less than that for his race four years ago.
A day after Jim Messina, the campaign manager, pledged to go forward with the outdoor speech ''rain or shine -- unless there's a safety issue,'' organizers concluded Wednesday morning that the weather was too unpredictable. The campaign dismissed suggestions that it would have had trouble filling the seats, which were distributed to people who volunteered on the campaign or waited in line for hours to get tickets.
Four years ago, Mr. Obama became the third major presidential candidate to leave the site of his convention to give an acceptance speech at a stadium. Organizers planned that speech after John F. Kennedy's appearance in 1960 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the only other such address to be held in an outdoor stadium in the modern television era.
Here in North Carolina, the outdoor speech was always risky, considering summertime rain and thunderstorms are far more common than in Denver. In 2008, the campaign produced a raft of meteorological data showing it had rained on the date of the speech, Aug. 28, only once in 20 years.
But Mr. Messina and other campaign officials had been committed to trying to reprise the stadium rally here. A day before canceling the outdoor speech, he told reporters: ''It's going to be a special moment, and we're really excited about it.''

HEADLINE: Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Former President Bill Clinton and President Obama hugged onstage Wednesday night after Mr. Clinton delivered an impassioned plea on behalf of Mr. Obama's re-election, the 42nd president nominating the 44th to a second term with a forceful and spirited argument that Democratic values would restore the promise of the middle class.
The former president delivered a point-by-point rebuttal of the arguments made during the Republican National Convention last week, warning against Republicans taking back the White House and declaring, ''We can't let it happen.''
He offered an equally detailed affirmative case for the re-election of Mr. Obama, saying there was no question the country was in a better position than it was four years ago. 
''We simply cannot afford to give the reins of government to someone who will double down on trickle down,'' Mr. Clinton said, repeatedly bringing the crowd at the Democratic convention to its feet. He added, ''I love our country so much and I know we're coming back.
Mr. Clinton drew sharp lines between the choices facing voters in November. He made the case in a deeply personal way, sometimes articulating the argument for Mr. Obama more forcefully than the president has done throughout his race with Mitt Romney.
''We believe 'we're all in this together' is a better philosophy than 'you're on your own,' '' Mr. Clinton said.
The delegates at the Democratic convention conducted the ceremonial roll call vote after Mr. Clinton's speech, with Ohio putting Mr. Obama over the top and formally elevating him as the party's presidential nominee at 12:06 a.m.
In a convention hall still buzzing from Mr. Clinton's speech well after it ended, delegates said they believed the former president had managed to give the defense of Mr. Obama they had been waiting for.
''Some people just have to have it spelled out for them,'' said Linda Brooks, 64, of Hampton Roads, Va. ''He speaks in plain words people can understand.''
In the 45-minute speech, Mr. Clinton paid tribute to a spirit of bipartisan political cooperation that he lamented was now missing. He characterized Mr. Obama as a president who wanted to bring that spirit back, noting that the president appointed Republican cabinet secretaries and former political rivals like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. The relationship they built, he said, sent a signal abroad.
''Democracy does not have to be a blood sport,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It can be an honorable enterprise.''
The arrival here by Mr. Clinton had the feel of a valedictory, particularly as Mr. Obama arrived on stage at the end of the speech, while thousands of Democrats here thundered their approval. It was, perhaps, a capstone in the political career of Mr. Clinton, who was delivering his eighth speech to a Democratic National Convention.
Mr. Clinton offered a comprehensive, even exhaustive, assessment of Mr. Obama's first-term priorities, from the auto bailout to the health care law. Brandishing statistics with a familiar vigor, he laid out a case that each of Mr. Obama's initiatives had met the Republican litmus test: leaving Americans better than four years ago.
''Is the president satisfied? Of course not, but are we better off than we were when he took office?'' Mr. Clinton said, pausing as the crowd roared in approval. He added, ''The answer is yes.''
Mr. Clinton used the successful economic record of his presidency to offer an illustration of the magnitude of the problems Mr. Obama inherited when he took office in 2009.
''President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''No president, not me, not any of my predecessors, could have repaired all of the damage he found in just four years.''
Following the speech by Michelle Obama on Tuesday night, the appearance of Mr. Clinton was the highlight of the convention's second night and underscored the tight nature of the presidential race. He was invited by Mr. Obama himself, who asked him earlier this summer to become more involved in his re-election campaign.
It was in many ways a poignant evening, in part because it marked the full reconciliation of the two most popular Democrats of the past 30 years, but also because Mr. Clinton has been increasingly talking about his own mortality.
Mr. Clinton's voice was hoarse, as it has often been through his career, but that seemed to do little though to tamp down his energy, enthusiasm or appeal to the crowd.
Mr. Clinton's presence here inspired gratitude among Mr. Obama's aides and followers, particularly given the close nature of the presidential race, but it also stirred at least a degree of speculation about the future of one of America's most prominent political families. For all of Mr. Clinton's ebullient praise of Mr. Obama, he also was seen by some Democrats as setting the stage for his wife's possible return to politics in 2016, a prospect yearned for by many of Mrs. Clinton's supporters.
He made only a quick reference to his wife, drawing laughter from the crowd as he raised another attribute of Mr. Obama, declaring: ''Heck, he even appointed Hillary!''
For Mr. Clinton, the speech dramatized the evolution in his relationship with Mr. Obama, from bitter antagonism to cautious embrace and now a full-throated endorsement. People who know both men do not play down the lingering tension between them, a legacy of the 2008 Democratic primary, when Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton in a fierce battle that seemed to leave Mr. Clinton more wounded than his wife.
''President Obama beat Hillary Clinton for the nomination,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, who worked for both men. ''President Clinton loves his wife. It took him a little longer to get over it; she got a job.''
This time, Mr. Clinton may have had the dual purpose of not only defending his wife's boss, but also enhancing her political prospects, should she decide on another presidential run in 2016. Mrs. Clinton, who plans to step down as secretary of state in January, was in Beijing on Wednesday, negotiating with the Chinese on Syria and the South China Sea.
The speech from Mr. Clinton concluded an evening that began on a discordant note when party leaders, at the behest of Mr. Obama, pushed through a vote to change language in their platform to affirm Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. With the hall noisily divided, it took three tries before the vote was declared passed, leaving some delegates grumbling and analysts saying that the organizers had botched the proceedings.
The Jerusalem reference, which was in the 2008 platform, had been dropped this year, prompting criticism from Republicans and pro-Israel groups. Mr. Obama, bowing to pressure, decided to restore the language, even though official American policy is that the status of Jerusalem should be resolved through negotiations.
The second night of the Democratic convention unfolded in a series of hard-hitting speeches aimed directly at the Republican ticket, with speaker after speaker assailing the records of Mr. Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan, his running mate.
Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Massachusetts, delivered a forceful critique of Mr. Romney's business background and invoked anti-Wall Street language to make her case on behalf of Mr. Obama, who she said would fight tirelessly for the middle class.
''People feel like the system is rigged against them,'' she said. ''And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged. Look around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies. Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries.''
Tightening their embrace of social issues, the Democrats also showcased Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown Law School graduate who earlier this year became a symbol of women's reproductive rights in a fight over insurance coverage of contraception.
Her speech, which was delayed so it would be included in the network's prime-time coverage, lit into Mr. Romney and his running mate for their positions against abortion rights -- and, in Mr. Romney's case, for staying silent initially after the talk show host Rush Limbaugh called her a ''slut.''
On the eve of Mr. Obama's acceptance speech, a threat of rain and storms prompted convention organizers to move his speech from an outdoor rally at Bank of America Stadium on Thursday to the significantly smaller Time Warner Cable Arena, where the convention is being held.
It was a disappointment for the Obama campaign, which had been working for months to build a crowd of at least 65,000 supporters for the president's speech.

HEADLINE: Old Time Religion, in the French Manner

BYLINE: By ROBERT ZARETSKY

 BODY:
With the start of the school year, the nation has quite suddenly been pulled into a debate over the role and responsibilities of the public schools. Should they limit themselves to teaching skills and broadcasting knowledge? Or must they also furnish the foundations of morality -- the ethical groundwork that will allow students to make sense of the world?
Oddly, the debate has sprung up not in the United States, but in France. Even odder, just as they would be in the United States, the opponents in France are secular humanists and religious conservatives. Oddest of all, it is the secularists who are pushing for the old time religion of moral instruction, while the faithful are more than a bit dubious. 
In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche, Vincent Peillon, the Socialist government's Minister of National Education, called for the revival of la morale laïque, or secular morality, in primary schools. This concept, Peillon explained, means teaching students to distinguish between justice and injustice, and good and evil.
But he quickly disabused those American observers who wondered if he was channeling William Bennett, secretary of education under President Ronald Reagan. French schools, he declared, must ''inculcate the notions of universal morality, founded on the ideas of humanity and reason ... . The capacity to reason and criticize, to doubt, must be learned at school. France's recovery is not only material, but also intellectual and moral.''
Like écoliers bursting out of the school door at recess, politicians and commentators fell over one another in their reactions to Peillon's remarks. The minister of education under Nicolas Sarkozy, Luc Chatel, viciously tweeted that Peillon had repeated the notorious chestnut from Philippe Pétain, the ruler of Vichy France, who called for a ''redressement moral'' in 1940. (It happened to be in the same speech in which Pétain announced France's surrender to Nazi Germany.) Other conservative politicians denounced the proposal as an ideological Trojan Horse, while Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme right Front National applauded: ''Secular morality is morality that obviously derives from our Christian morality. So much the better if it is taught.''
No less obviously, Le Pen consulted neither French Jews nor French Muslims about ''our''-- i.e., France's -- Christian morality.
Peillon had scarcely regained his feet when a second herd of critics, issuing from cathedrals and churches, stampeded his way. The Catholic thinker Bertrand Vergely hailed the reintroduction of a single code of morality into the school system, but wondered if the Socialists -- ''who have devoted the last 40 years to the destruction of the meaning and sense of morality'' -- were best equipped to undertake the task.
Similarly, the editor of France Catholique welcomed Peillon's remarks, but asked if a consensus was possible. ''Will we teach our children,'' he asked, ''that the right to be different implies the acceptance of same-sex marriage?''
Some Socialists, in fact, were also leery about a government, even their own, defining one and just one code of moral values for France's school children. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, expressed misgivings about an ''official'' set of morals being taught in the schools. His doubts make him and the French Catholic hierarchy strange bedfellows: an openly gay politician who supports same-sex marriage, Delanoë, though he clearly has a different moral compass from the Catholics, shares their concern about the state affirming a single magnetic ''north'' for one and all.
For the moment, dissension and doubts over Peillon's defense of secular morality are the only traits that seem to be universal. If nothing more comes of this affair, it will be a pity, for it touches on a vital issue for the future of the French Republic. Among the ''republican'' values Peillon deemed universal are knowledge, devotion and solidarity. Could they be any more relevant today, he rightly asked, when society is awash in ''the values of money, economic competition and selfishness''?
Nevertheless, it is impossible to overlook the great differences between today and the late 19th century when la morale laïque was first proclaimed. When public education became a cornerstone of the fledging Third Republic, France had recovered with dizzying speed from its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. Though dramatic economic disparities existed, as did competing interpretations of the nation's revolutionary heritage, France surged with optimism. Whether reflected in the World Exposition of 1889 (which gave the Eiffel Tower to the world) or the triumph of justice in the Dreyfus Affair a few years later, France was on a roll.
Nothing seems farther from the truth today. With three million unemployed and economic growth near zero, caught between the domestic need to spur demand and a European imperative to cut its deficit, France -- now home to some five million Muslims whose place in the nation is endlessly debated -- seems largely impotent to inflect its destiny. In a recent poll, nearly two out of three respondents declared they are pessimistic about the future. Indeed, at the very moment Peillon announced his project, his school system was grappling with the cut of 13,000 teaching and staff positions made by the previous government.
Hardly the moment, it seems, to hold a national debate over the teaching of secular morality. Or is it? Clearly, France needs a citizenry armed with the skills, languages and knowledge to compete successfully in a radically changed world from their 19th century ancestors. But as the historian Jean Baubérot argues, these students also need something else. The teachers of the Third Republic helped their students, he notes, to reflect on the balance between rights and duties, as well as the need to respect certain principles essential for a dynamic democracy. Their descendants should expect nothing less of their students or of themselves.

HEADLINE: Obama's First-Term Report Card

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
On a backpacking trip once, I slipped on a steep ice sheet and began sliding uncontrollably toward the edge of a cliff overhanging an icy river.
Luckily, my son pulled me to safety with his trekking pole. Am I better off now than I was when I was sliding toward the abyss? Duh!
That's a useful starting point in any assessment of President Obama. In many ways, his first term has been disappointing: the economy remains weak, housing is a mess and, for a man with a silver tongue, he has been a wretched communicator. Then again, we're incomparably better off than when we were tumbling toward another Great Depression. 
With that in mind, let me offer a first-term report card for Obama.
ECONOMY: B In January 2009, the month Obama took office, America lost 818,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was the biggest monthly loss in six decades, and many feared a complete banking collapse.
Obama rescued the banking and auto sectors. Independent estimates suggest his stimulus may have saved or created more than three million jobs, and an anemic recovery began. The Economist magazine, conservative by nature, assessed: ''His handling of the crisis and recession were impressive.''
However, the administration blew it with overoptimistic comments that shredded its credibility. It was also too generous to banks in negotiating their rescues, and it often seemed oblivious to resentment of crony capitalism, and to broader issues of economic inequality.
Worst of all, Obama dropped the ball on housing, betraying struggling homeowners. Far fewer mortgages have been modified or refinanced under administration programs than expected, and some Americans have lost their homes as a result, exacerbating inequality. Underwater mortgages have been a drag on the entire economy.
EDUCATION: A- Democrats traditionally favored every antipoverty program except the one that might be most effective: reform of inner-city schools. Finally, that has changed under Obama and his education secretary, Arne Duncan.
They have pilfered Republican ideas and repositioned the Democratic Party to make school reform a top priority. They are willing to offend teachers' unions but recognize the practical need to work closely with them. Obama's Race to the Top initiative bribed states to devise their own school reforms, a cost-effective way to achieve nationwide change.
Obama has pushed Pell grants to make college more affordable and has promoted investments in community colleges. (Unfortunately, he hasn't done quite as well on early childhood education, which should be every bit as much a priority as tertiary education.)
OTHER DOMESTIC ISSUES: B+ Obama gets credit for ending ''don't ask, don't tell'' and allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in our armed forces. He took a step toward immigration reform by allowing certain young immigrants to obtain work permits. Above all, he achieved health care reform -- a goal of presidents for more than half-a-century.
FOREIGN POLICY: B+ Obama brought troops home from Iraq and took out Osama bin Laden. He was superb in providing bold leadership in Libya, at a time when so many American experts were saying that the intervention wouldn't work. His unusual move in picking Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state has paid off brilliantly, and it's great to see the State Department pursuing a 21st-century agenda that includes girls' education as well as, say, arms control.
Then again, Obama's ''surge'' in Afghanistan has accomplished little except a huge increase in blood and treasure spilled there. In Pakistan, a more important country than either Iraq or Afghanistan, Obama has stumbled.
Obama's peace effort in the Middle East collapsed, partly because of administration infighting and ineptitude, and he often seemed behind the curve during the Arab Spring. He has been purely reactive in Syria and hypocritical in the case of brutal repression by our ally Bahrain.
A bright spot is Obama's international coalition to squeeze Iran, while restraining jingoists in Israel from dragging us into a war there. One way or another, I fear that we may well end up at war with Iran in the next four years, but my sense is that that is less likely in an Obama administration than in a Romney administration.
COMMUNICATION: F A president's central job is not policy wonk but national team captain. There Obama failed us. He has not made the case for his policies, nor has he comforted the nation as Franklin Roosevelt did in his fireside chats. Presidents always campaign in poetry and govern in prose, but the prose doesn't have to be chilly Latin!
In short, we have a mixed picture, not as triumphant as the Democrats in Charlotte, N.C., claim, but still much better than many Americans give Obama credit for. A pithy summary comes from Vice President Joe Biden: Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive. That's not a bad re-election bumper sticker.

HEADLINE: 4 Years Later, Scarred but Still Confident

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- He warned them in 2008, and when he formally opened his re-election campaign in May, he put it in his speech again. He will ''never be a perfect president,'' he said, a line he now repeats at stop after stop. The unspoken subtext: It's not my fault if you didn't listen or expected too much.
If rapturous supporters in Denver four years ago were not paying attention, those expected here on Thursday night surely know better. This is not a perfect president; this is a proud yet humbled president, a confident yet scarred president, a dreamer mugged by reality, a pragmatist confounded by ideology, a radical to some, a sellout to others.
This is a president who has yet to realize the lofty expectations that propelled him from obscurity to the Oval Office, whose idealism or naïveté or hubris has been tempered by four years in the fires. Long after the messiah jokes vanished, the oh-so-mortal Barack Hussein Obama is left to make the case that while progress is slow, he is taking America to a better place -- and that he will be a better president over the next four years. 
If Denver was all about promise, Charlotte is all about patience. Whether Americans grant the 44th president a four-year extension will depend in part on his ability to reconcile the heady aspirations of 2008 with the messy results of the four years that followed. Remade by his time in office, the candidate of change will now argue for staying the course.
Although ''he certainly seems more grizzled or hardened,'' as his former economics adviser Austan Goolsbee observed, Mr. Obama expresses confidence that he has figured out how to wield power in an age of political polarization and economic stagnation.
Now on his third chief of staff, he describes his change in management in sports terms, no longer picking the best overall athlete but whoever best fits the particular job. Burned by failed Roosevelt Room summits with Republican leaders and faced with implacable resistance, he has abandoned the inside game to barnstorm the country pressuring lawmakers. Once a virtual prime minister tethered to Congress, he now advances immigration, environmental and education initiatives through executive authority.
In the privacy of the West Wing, of course, there are moments when he feels discouraged by what he has not accomplished or unappreciated for what he has. ''That's been our sweet spot -- finding policies that don't make anybody happy, that make both sides angry,'' he has joked, Mr. Goolsbee said. ''And the experts then say, well, they didn't do enough anyway.''
But those close to him say he takes the long view, understands things will not change as quickly as he likes, and retains his famed never-too-high, never-too-low reserve. During the dark days of summer 2011 when a grand bargain with Republicans on spending slipped away, he took a walk with David Axelrod, his strategist, to the White House basketball court and shot hoops.
''Do you ever rethink this, about whether it was worth doing?'' Mr. Axelrod remembered asking.
Mr. Obama looked at him incredulously. ''Of course not,'' he said. ''If you're in public life, where else would you rather be?''
The Limits of Rationality
A few months ago, Mr. Obama read ''Thinking, Fast and Slow,'' by Daniel Kahneman, about how people make decisions -- quick, instinctive thinking versus slower, contemplative deliberation. For Mr. Obama, a deliberator in an instinctive business, this may be as instructive as any political science text.
Mr. Obama, the 51-year-old Harvard law graduate, sees himself as a rational thinker and came to office with what might be called the Reasonable Person Theory of Government. If he could simply sit down and talk with other political actors, whether they be Republicans from the House or mullahs from Tehran, he seemed certain he could work something out. His faith in his own powers of persuasion was deep.
But politics is often not rational, at least not as Mr. Obama defined it. The Iranians have proved immune to Mr. Obama's charm, as have the North Koreans, the Taliban and Vladimir V. Putin. So have the Republicans and, for that matter, even some Democrats.
After a year of failed Middle East peacemaking, he conceded being too confident that he could cajole Israelis and Palestinians into resolving age-old disputes. ''We overestimated our ability to persuade them to do so when their politics ran contrary to that,'' he concluded at the time.
So, too, has his reliance on oratory diminished. At first, there was no problem, it seemed, that could not be solved by a presidential address. ''Race problem? Speech,'' one former aide recalled. ''Afghanistan? Speech.'' But speeches by themselves rarely generated the action he sought.
Indeed, Mr. Obama in private sometimes expresses surprise at the constraints of the office. Lulled by his success in passing an $800 billion stimulus package 24 days after his inauguration, and perhaps not fully cognizant of the tone set by doing so almost exclusively with Democratic votes, he found that everything else came harder, like his health care program, or not at all, like climate and immigration legislation.
He keeps a list and argues that he has fulfilled most of his core promises. He pulled the country back from the economic abyss, rescued the auto industry, killed the world's top terrorist, withdrew troops from Iraq, imposed regulations on Wall Street, put two liberal justices on the Supreme Court, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia and cut taxes for the middle class.
Yet looking back, he realizes that some of his ''heal the planet'' ambitions that would prove fodder for mockery by Mitt Romney, his Republican rival, were unrealistic, at least in four years. During the 2008 campaign, he said he would talk with rogue leaders from countries including Iran and Cuba, make peace between Pakistan and India so Pakistan could shift forces to the Afghan border, close the prison at Guantánamo Bay, win Senate approval of a never-ratified test ban treaty, negotiate legislation live on C-Span and usher in a new era of bipartisanship.
His contemplative decision-making can be isolating. He does not readily let others in. ''It's hard to gain the president's confidence -- not trust, but confidence in your judgment,'' Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. observed in an interview this summer. ''It doesn't come easily to this president.'' As a result, he said, Mr. Obama demands a rigorous process. When someone proposes something, the president's reaction is, ''Get me a paper on that.'' When he receives it, Mr. Biden said, ''he devours it. He masters it.''
His deliberation proved refreshing to those weary of President George W. Bush's swagger. ''I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak,'' Mr. Obama once said when asked why it took him days to respond to a controversy.
But when he waited to speak out about the would-be underwear bomber at Christmas 2009 or the BP oil spill in 2010, he paid a political price. He learned the public wants to see its president during crises. So when a gunman shot up a movie theater in Colorado this summer, Mr. Obama appeared before cameras within hours.
As Mr. Kahneman said in an interview, ''Being a slow thinker for a leader is not necessarily an advantage because the public likes a leader to think quickly and react instinctively.''
Hardball Time
How has Mr. Obama applied the lessons he learned? One day last spring, aides told him interest rates on federal student loans would double on July 1 unless Congress acted. Early on in his presidency, Mr. Obama might have invited lawmakers to the White House.
Instead, he headed to Air Force One and flew to college campuses in North Carolina and Colorado to castigate Congress for not heading off the rate hike. There was never any debate about the strategy; no one, even Mr. Obama, thought about talking with Republicans.
''Our view on student loans was they wouldn't do it without really putting their backs against the wall,'' said David Plouffe, the president's senior adviser. ''He realized this was a simple thing, it was clear, it was something we could motivate people on.''
Republicans angrily accused the president of bad faith. ''He was making a political argument,'' said Representative John Kline of Minnesota, chairman of the education committee. ''I never saw any engagement from the White House about what really to do about it.''
Maybe so, but Obama aides crowed that it worked because Republicans instantly came out against the rate increase, too. Republicans said they saw it the other way, arguing that they defused the Obama attack by reacting quickly. Either way, it was a sign of how much the president had changed.
No longer would he give Republicans the benefit of the doubt. Having been surprised by the unbreakable solidarity against his initiatives, Mr. Obama came to privately use the phrase ''not on the level,'' meaning Republicans were not playing straight. ''They came in like they were the East German judge at the Olympics,'' said Mr. Goolsbee. ''He could hit the triple flip and they would give him a 2. That was a pretty grim lesson that he had to learn.''
In Mr. Obama's mind, it is a one-way street, and he takes no responsibility for the divisions, dismissing Republicans who consider him highhanded. ''Elections have consequences,'' he told Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican whip at the time, during an early meeting, ''and Eric, I won.''
The breakdown of last year's grand bargain talks proved a turning point. ''That was a searing experience,'' Mr. Plouffe recalled. The lesson: Forget negotiations and use the bully pulpit. Policy is not about applying reason; it's about applying power.
''You're never going to convince them by sitting around the table and talk about what's good for the country,'' said John D. Podesta, who ran Mr. Obama's transition and still advises him occasionally. ''You had to demonstrate that there's political pain if you don't produce an acceptable outcome.''
Bold and Cautious
If Mr. Obama has changed over his presidency, in part it suggests Americans never really knew him to begin with. Where conservatives see an unremitting liberal, supporters on the left wish he were. To mystified admirers, it is unrequited love. When they read in David Maraniss's biography of how a girlfriend told him, ''I love you,'' only to have him reply, ''Thank you,'' some joked they knew how she felt.
On the hustings, Mr. Obama is more careful to reply in kind. When someone shouts out, ''We love you,'' he calls out, ''I love you back.'' But sometimes it does not feel that way. His has become a bloodless presidency, built on cold calculations, not quixotic crusades. His argument now boils down to asking voters to stick with him because the other side will revive failed policies that would enrich the wealthy, shred safety-net programs and undermine the economy.
With unemployment stuck above 8 percent and his approval ratings stuck below 50 percent, Mr. Obama has turned to the sort of campaigning he once disdained. The man who bristled when critics claimed without evidence that he was born in Kenya or was a Muslim now does not object as advisers and allies make unsubstantiated assertions about Mr. Romney's taxes and business record.
Asked about such incidents, he says the behavior of the Republicans is worse. He does not talk about changing Washington rules; he is playing by the rules as he found them.
He is sensitive to the costs he has imposed on his own party. After the Supreme Court upheld his health care program, he reached out to three House Democrats who lost in 2010 after supporting the legislation, including Tom Perriello of Virginia, who said liberals have come around. ''To the extent there was a passion for Obama in 2008, that's matured into a comfort and a trust by 2012,'' he said.
Mr. Obama is a curious mixture of bold and cautious. He spent months in what amounted to a grueling graduate seminar on Afghanistan and then disregarded his vice president and top advisers to order 30,000 more troops to the war zone. Even the action considered his most decisive, ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, took place only after months of secretly monitoring intelligence and considering options.
He defied advisers by pressing for his expansive health care program rather than settling for a ''skinny'' alternative. Yet he stays doggedly away from hot-button issues like gun control and race, took two years to lift the ban on gays and lesbians in the military, and took even longer to endorse same-sex marriage. He appointed a bipartisan commission to fix the nation's finances, then shelved its plan.
On foreign policy as well, he has his priorities, and those that do not fit are put to the side. Since pulling American forces out of Iraq, for example, he has seemed removed from its fate. Adm. Dennis C. Blair, Mr. Obama's director of national intelligence until he was pushed out over policy and personality differences, said the president took a checklist approach to foreign policy overly influenced by domestic politics.
''There quickly developed what I thought of as the top-10 list of individual issues that needed to be worked -- Iran, a treaty with Russia, the South China Sea, the Middle East peace process,'' he said. ''Never did there seem to be an idea of a strategy -- where do we want to be, what's important, and how do we get there?''
Moreover, he said, decisions on foreign policy were shadowed by concern for how they would play with the American public. ''Domestic political considerations were ground in very early, very early,'' he said.
A Second Term
The isolation can be palpable. Riding in his motorcade after an event, Mr. Obama sometimes stares out the windows at the world he cannot really touch. When he arrives at a hotel at the end of a campaign day, he confers with aides in his suite, then sometimes asks what they plan to do the rest of the evening. When they mention going to the hotel bar to unwind, he notes he is not free to follow, essentially confined in his suite until morning.
''He was a little wistful when I was with him about his new public life, his presidential life, and its cost in terms of isolation from ordinary life experiences,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin, his former Illinois colleague.
Mr. Obama enjoys watching ''Homeland'' and ''Boardwalk Empire,'' and recently took in the Will Ferrell movie ''The Campaign'' (not great, in his review, but some funny scenes). His fixation with ESPN remains unabated, and, like others in Washington, he ruminates on the wisdom of the Nationals' sitting down their star pitcher, Stephen Strasburg, before the playoffs.
But his inner circle is the same tight group it was before. It is probably fair to say he has made no new friends since moving to Washington. ''The times he wants downtime or personal time, he seems to naturally gravitate to the people he's known for a very long time,'' said John W. Rogers Jr., an old friend.
In private, he speaks of his challenger with disdain. While intellectually understanding the odds, aides say, the president finds it hard to conceive of losing to Mr. Romney, a rival he does not consider a serious thinker who knows what he wants to do with the country. The president has told people he is determined to win because he believes the economy will bounce back and does not want Mr. Romney getting credit.
Mr. Obama has convinced himself, or so he says, that things will be different next time around. Should he win, maybe Republicans will finally cooperate.
''I believe that if we're successful in this election -- when we're successful in this election -- that the fever may break,'' he said last spring. ''My expectation is that after the election, now that it turns out the goal of beating Obama doesn't make much sense because I'm not running again, that we can start getting some cooperation again.''
If that sounds like optimism overcoming experience, Mr. Obama promises to be on guard. ''I'm not going to just play it safe,'' he tells aides. But he intends to play by the lessons he has learned.

HEADLINE: The Better Economic Question

 BODY:
Democrats have been nervous about the inevitable election-year question, ''Are you better off than you were four years ago?'' Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland even stumbled over it a few days ago, saying ''no,'' before quickly blaming President George W. Bush.
There is really no reason for any hesitancy. The country is unquestionably better off than it was in 2008. The economy has added 4.5 million private-sector jobs since January 2010; even if you subtract the vast job losses in the early months of President Obama's term, before his policies went into effect, the country is still ahead by 332,000 private-sector jobs. 
That level of job growth is close to the recovery following the 1990s recession, and it is actually stronger than after the early-2000s recession. But it doesn't feel strong because the original hole was so deep and so many people are still suffering: 12.8 million remain unemployed.
The contradiction between the plain facts of the data and the tepid feel of the recovery suggests that the recession created a more important question than the simplistic ''are you better off?'' Voters should ask themselves -- and their leaders -- how to keep this and future generations better off. How to prevent future recessions. How to design a tax code that promotes fairness and reduces inequality. How to make sure a safety net is in place for those who inevitably need more help.
And when the question is phrased like that -- looking forward rather than backward -- it becomes obvious that the Republicans' answer is inadequate.
''When we vote in this election, we'll be deciding what kind of country we want to live in,'' former President Bill Clinton told the convention Wednesday night. ''If you want a winner-take-all, you're-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket.''
The damage Mr. Obama faced when he took office was far greater than any president, current or past, could repair in four years, Mr. Clinton said, yet Mitt Romney wants to return to the policies that caused it. ''They want to cut taxes for high-income Americans, even more than President Bush did,'' he said.''They want to get rid of those pesky financial regulations designed to prevent another crash and prohibit future bailouts.''
At every step, when Mr. Obama and Democrats have proposed measures to reduce the risk of the kind of recession still haunting the economy, Republicans have opposed them. Mitt Romney regularly sneers at the most fundamental protections against Wall Street excesses and promises to repeal them.
House Republicans, including Representative Paul Ryan, have passed budgets that gutted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, hoping to prevent it from regulating toxic derivatives that undermined the economy in 2008. They have voted to withhold money needed by the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill.
They have sent a clear signal to the corporate executives spending hundreds of millions to elect Mr. Romney that they need not worry about restrictions on their behavior, no matter how destructive to the economy or the lives of millions still struggling to get back on their feet.
As Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in Massachusetts, told the convention: ''Mitt Romney wants to give billions in breaks to big corporations, but he and Paul Ryan would pulverize financial reform, voucherize Medicare and vaporize Obamacare.''
Mr. Obama could have demanded even stronger regulation of the banks, but he at least clearly supports the need for government to step in when the financial industry threatens the rest of the economy.
Voters should remember the days when the country was hemorrhaging jobs by the millions, but it is far more important to make certain they never have to remember another financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Competition Gap Grows In Europe, Study Says

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- European economies are diverging in competitiveness, according to a report published Wednesday that highlighted a growing north-south divide as one of the factors at the heart of the continuing euro zone crisis. 
The annual rankings of 144 nations, published by the World Economic Forum, show a vast difference between the best- and worst-performing nations in the 17-nation single currency area, with Finland taking third place and Greece languishing in the 96th spot -- the lowest in the European Union.
Switzerland, which is not a part of the European Union, takes top place in the global table, with Singapore second, the United States occupying 7th position -- down two places from last year -- and Canada at 14th. China, in 29th place, is rated the most competitive among large emerging markets.
The survey comes during a crucial period for the euro zone, with the European Central Bank's governing council due to meet Thursday and intensive discussions under way among European leaders both about Greece and about broader efforts to stem the debilitating debt crisis.
The report does not paint a hopeless picture for Europeans, but suggests that high competitiveness is largely confined to the north and west of the continent. That suggests that the desired process of convergence among euro zone economies, expected by the architects of the single currency, has gone into reverse.
''The lack of competitiveness of several of its members is among the root causes of the current difficulties in the euro zone,'' the report says.
The document argues that the origins of the crisis gripping several southern European nations are diverse but adds that ''one shared feature at the heart of the current situation in all these economies is their persistent lack of competitiveness and, therefore, their inability to maintain high levels of prosperity.''
It adds, ''Overall, low levels of productivity and competitiveness do not warrant the salaries that workers in Southern Europe enjoy and have led to unsustainable imbalances, followed by high and rising unemployment.''
The study also notes that there is no longer a divide in competitiveness between the 15 older members of the European Union and the 12, mainly ex-Communist, nations that joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007.
Six European nations are among the world's top ten most competitive, and ten are among the best 20. Several of these, however, are outside the euro zone -- Sweden in 4th place, Britain in 8th and Denmark in 12th -- while first-place Switzerland and 15th-place Norway are outside the European Union.
The euro zone can boast Netherlands in 5th place, Germany in 6th, Austria in 16th and Belgium in 17th.
France is in 21st place, Spain lies in 36th place, Italy in 42nd, Portugal in 49th.
''With six of the ten best-performing countries, Northern and Western Europe is a competitiveness hotspot,'' the report said. ''The assessment is considerably bleaker when looking at Southern and Eastern Europe.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Embedded on the Front Lines of the Digital Revolution

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Having been witness to famine and catastrophe, Doug Menuez sought answers in a project that served a purpose and gave guidance, turning his camera on the tech boom occurring right in his Silicon Valley backyard. 

 BODY:
PERPIGNAN, France - When Doug Menuez covered the Ethiopian famine in 1985 for Newsweek, he was devastated by the sheer scale of human suffering and by his inability to do anything about it.
He wished his photos could change what was happening. Though he had seen a lot of bad things in his career, this experience hit him particularly hard.
"I felt like, what is the purpose - the world is such a horrible place, what can I do to find meaning in my own life?" he said. "What can I shoot that would give me a sense of hope?"
So he found religion. Well, not exactly religion - more like a cult. The cult of Steve Jobs.
Mr. Menuez, 54, started photographing people who were actually changing the world - not missionaries in Africa but geeks in Palo Alto, Calif.
He photographed the young, often idealistic, engineers of Silicon Valley, following Mr. Jobs as he and his acolytes invented the NeXt computer. He had unrestricted access and recorded the process of innovation from beginning to end. Later, he photographed at Adobe and at Apple as the Newton handheld personal computer was created.
"I switched my whole idea from looking around for stuff in the third world to right here in my own backyard," Mr. Menuez said. "Instead of trying to make pictures that might bring light to injustice or change the world, these guys are actually doing it, these people are changing the world, and I could just make pictures of them."
The resulting project, "Fearless Genius: The Digital Revolution 1985-2000," is on exhibit this week at the Visa Pour l'Image photojournalism festival in Perpignan, France.
Mr. Menuez approached his subject as a visual anthropologist, studying a tribe that was developing a new culture and language. It was a culture that worked nonstop. A culture, Mr. Menuez said, "that's not about the money, that wasn't about share prices, that wasn't about I.P.O.s. A culture that had a higher purpose."
This was a story that was difficult to tell visually. There was little drama, and what action there was took place inside plastic boxes. No starving children. No guns. No colorful clothing or scenic landscapes.
"I would pace through the hallways of these corporations, sit in a common area, sit in on meetings for hours, or I'd go at three in the morning because I'd get a phone call saying, 'Oh, we're working on this thing,' " Mr Menuez said. "I'd just put time in, then suddenly see some human behavior across the room and race over. But I would try to get anything I could that showed emotion. "
Mr. Menuez did not talk much with the famously mercurial Mr. Jobs, mostly staying out of his way when they were in the same room. But Mr. Menuez witnessed up close a complicated personality. A man with incredible passion and vision, exploding with energy - but a man who could also be harsh and rude with the people he worked with.
"He thought that he could make a computer that some kid could cure cancer with in a dorm room at Stanford," Mr. Menuez said.
Mr. Jobs was there at the creation of personal computers, but the period after he left Apple and started NeXt Inc. were his years of wandering in the desert. It was a period of great innovation but financial failure. The little cube computers did not sell well. But the software he wrote, the operating system, became the core of the Apple operating system leading to iPods and iPhones. When Apple purchased NeXt and adapted the software, he was on his path to redemption.
Mr. Jobs and his band of idealistic digital revolutionaries did indeed change the world. The economic, medical and educational benefits have been staggering. Yet our behavior has been modified - Mr. Menuez fears we've lost our privacy and someday, perhaps soon, we'll have chips in our brain.
Mr. Menuez said that that the new digital frontier is what is known as the singularity, where "we'll merge our brains, we'll upload our brains into the hive mind."
"Is that the loss of the identity of the individual, or is it utopia, and we live forever?" Mr. Menuez asked. "I don't know, I don't want to have a closed mind to it, but I think we have to talk about it."

HEADLINE: A.I.G. to Raise $2 Billion for Share Buyback

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The insurance giant plans to sell a $2 billion stake in its Asian insurance unit as part of plans to repurchase $5 billion worth of its own stock from the United States government. 

 BODY:
The insurance giant American International Group said on Thursday that it planned to sell a $2 billion stake in its Asian insurance unit as part of a plan to repurchase $5 billion worth of its own stock from the United States government.
The move is the latest effort by A.I.G. to shed assets and repay the government after the firm received a $182 billion bailout in 2008.
A.I.G. has been progressively selling its stake in its Asian insurance business, the A.I.A. Group, since listing the company on the Hong Kong stock exchange in an initial public offering that raised $17.8 billion.
Under the terms of the deal announced, A.I.G. will offer investors 600 million shares in A.I.A. at 25.75 Hong Kong dollars to 26.75 Hong Kong dollars, according to the term sheet obtained by DealBook. 
On the low end, the price represents a 2.1 percent discount to A.I.A.'s closing price in Hong Kong on Thursday; on the high end, it represents a 1.7 percent premium. The deal will leave A.I.G. with a stake of about 13 percent stake in A.I.A.
Earlier this year, A.I.G. sold a $6 billion stake in A.I.A., which is the region's third-largest insurer.
A.I.G. said on Thursday that it planned to buy as much as $5 billion of its own stock, the third repurchase of its shares this year. A.I.G. added that it would use the proceeds of the A.I.A. share sale, in part, to repurchase its shares. 
The Treasury Department has been selling off its stake in A.I.G. Last month, officials said they would sell about $5 billion worth of A.I.G. stock to reduce the government's holding to around 53 percent, from 92 percent when the firm was first bailed out.
The government's links with A.I.G. now lie primarily with the Treasury Department's shares in the insurer. The holdings could prove profitable. The stock is currently trading at almost $35, ahead of the government's break-even price of $29.
Since receiving a government bailout, A.I.G. has recovered by reinventing itself as a smaller company that largely shies away from the types of complex investments that nearly led to its downfall. 
Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are managing the $2 billion share sale for A.I.G.

HEADLINE: Video View of an Endangered Program Cutting Energy Waste

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A video chronicle of a now-endangered project cutting energy losses in homes. 

 BODY:
I first got to know the photography of Joshua Wolfe through his collaboration with Gavin Schmidt, the NASA climate scientist and RealClimate blogger, on "Climate Change: Picturing the Science."
Wolfe recently got in touch about a video project he's worked on over the last two years documenting the longstanding federal program helping poor households cut energy waste. The program got a big boost under the stimulus package of spending during the great recession, but now is being funded at levels far below the spending before the economic crisis. The video is out today. Watch it below and read a "Your Dot" contribution from Wolfe on the film and the underlying political and economic issues: 
Filling The Gaps: The History of The Weatherization Assistance Program from State and Local Energy Report on Vimeo.
From Joshua Wolfe: 
Two years ago I set out to make a five minute film on the history of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) for a joint project of the State & Local Energy Report magazine and the National Association for State Community Service Programs. As we started collecting footage, stories, and artifacts from the program, what emerged was a compelling story of people who work day in and day out to make the homes of low-income Americans safe, affordable and energy efficient. It turned into a two-year project and a 50-minute film.
As we've finished the film this summer, I didn't expect to see WAP disappear before my eyes. Under the $5 billion allocation from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), WAP funding shot up for a few years. As ARRA fades WAP now survives on its yearly appropriation. Program funding has dropped from $210 million in 2010 to $68 million for this year. The only reason the program hasn't collapsed this year is because of remaining stimulus funds and supplemental funding that was available from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. A second year of funding at $68 million will simply not be enough to run a national program. The six-month continuing resolution that congress is considering in September would continue the program funding level at $68 million.
WAP is a small but important piece of the social safety net. According to the US Department of Energy, families receiving weatherization services see their energy bills reduced on average by about $437. Many of these are the most vulnerable families - throughout the filming we spoke to people who would not be able to stay in their homes without the help of WAP.
WAP came into existence in 1976 under Jimmy Carter. The program was designed to increase the efficiency of low-income peoples' homes through basic measures like improved insulation, weatherstripping and caulking. During the 36 years of the program, the growth of the program led to advances in our understanding of building technology and led to the development of diagnostic equipment like the blower door. The green building practices of today owe a debt of gratitude to the workers and engineers of WAP.
What we often forget is that in those 36 years, the program has not just made peoples' lives better but it has accumulated knowledge, talent and resources that make it better each year than the year before. If the program's budget gets cut dramatically, much of those 36 years of investment will be lost. We can't rebuild it overnight if we decide to increase program funding two years from now. It is also probable that if the continuing resolution passes at the $68 million funding level many of the people you meet in this film will lose their jobs in the near future. I hope that this film can help lawmakers realize the value of WAP and preserve the work of the last 36 years.

HEADLINE: A Fuller Explanation of Bain Stories Told at Democratic Convention

BYLINE: MICHAEL LUO


HIGHLIGHT: The basic outlines of the stories told at the Democratic convention about layoffs and plant closings that occurred after Bain bought three companies were accurate, but they lacked context and mitigating details. 

 BODY:
 The three people who told their stories about their experiences with Mitt Romney's firm, Bain Capital, Wednesday night during the Democratic National Convention laid out the by-now-familiar Democratic critique that he prized profits over people during his 15-year career in private equity and that he was a job destroyer, rather than a job creator.
The basic outlines of their stories about layoffs and plant closings that occurred after Bain bought their companies - Ampad, Dade International and GST Steel -- were accurate, but they lacked context and mitigating details, ones that often get lost in the shorthand of political combat.
Ampad
The first speaker, Randy Johnson, worked at a paper plant in Marion, Ind., when it was bought in 1994 by Ampad, a company created by Bain through of a series of acquisitions. Ampad was a textbook example of a private equity "roll-up." In 1992, Bain acquired American Pad & Paper from the Mead Corp. and then set out to buy up other companies in the same industry, seeking economies of scale and other efficiencies. Sales ballooned but so did the company's debt, which climbed to nearly $400 million. The company also found itself squeezed by the proliferation of "big box" office supply stores. Ampad wound up closing several plants across the country, including one in Marion, Ind., where Mr. Johnson worked. 
The Marion closure, however, was preceded by a labor dispute. After the acquisition by Bain, the plant's employees were notified that they were being laid off but could reapply for their jobs at lower wages. The plant's workers decided to strike. At this point, Mr. Romney was deep in the throes of his ultimately unsuccessful 1994 Senate campaign against Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and the strike became a major issue, with workers appearing in television advertisements on behalf of Mr. Kennedy. In early 1995, with Mr. Romney back at the helm of the company, Bain decided to shutter the plant. 
A critical open question is what role Mr. Romney played in Bain's decisions relating to the plant, given that he was busy running for Senate when Bain acquired the plant. In response to a personal letter from Mr. Johnson as the plant's closure neared, Mr. Romney said he had privately urged a settlement but that he had been advised by lawyers not to personally intervene. 
In a 2007 Los Angeles Times article, Marc Wolpow, a former Bain managing director who was on Ampad's board, said Mr. Romney could have ordered him to settle with the union, since Mr. Romney was still, technically, in charge, but he had not. Mr. Wolpow described this as the "right business decision as C.E.O. of Bain Capital."
Ampad wound up filing for bankruptcy in 2000, after Mr. Romney had departed to run the Salt Lake City Olympics and several years after Bain had relinquished majority-control of the company. In return for their original $5 million investment, Bain and its investors walked away with profits of more than $100 million. Bain itself also collected at least $17 million in fees. 
Dade International
The second speaker, Cindy Hewitt, worked in human resources at Dade International, a medical diagnostics company purchased by Bain and other investors in 1994 for $450 million, largely paid for with debt, in order to limit Bain's risk. 
Over the next few years, Bain and other investors collected nearly $100 million in fees from the company, with Bain gobbling up the lion's share. Bain guided Dade through a series of acquisitions, helping to more than double the company's annual sales. But just like with Ampad, Dade's debt ballooned. Cost-cutting became a premium at the company. Ultimately, the company laid off 1,700 workers in the United States, including 850 in Miami, where Ms. Hewitt worked, after Bain's shuttered Dade's facilities there in 1997. 
By 1998, Dade's investors had begun looking for a way to cash out. They settled on a plan in which Dade borrowed $455 million to buy out about half of their shares, with Bain collecting $242 million in the transaction, which was completed in April 1999. Even with the lucrative payouts to investors and top executives, the job losses at the company continued.
A few months before the payout, Mr. Romney left to run the Olympics, though he still benefited from it, because of his continuing financial arrangements with the firm. 
Ultimately, the debt load proved too much for Dade. Interest rates rose and the value of the euro slid, twin blows that severely impacted the company. A new distribution center also experienced unexpected delays. Dade filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002. 
The company, however, would later emerge from the restructuring process and thrive. The company was eventually sold to Siemens, the German conglomerate, for $7 billion in 2007, leading some to argue Bain's strategies ultimately paid off. 
GST Steel
The final anti-Bain speaker, David Foster, was a union negotiator for workers at GST Steel, a struggling Midwest steel manufacturer that Bain bought in 1993, investing $8.3 million and borrowing the rest. 
Bain took steps to modernize the steelmaker, investing in new technology and upgrading its facilities. A year later, the company issued $125 million in debt, some of which was used to pay a $33.9 million dividend to Bain's investors. About half of that was plowed back into the company. But the debt load, again, proved crippling, particularly as the industry experienced a downturn in the late 1990s, eventually forcing the company into bankruptcy in 2001. Bain's investors still earned at least $9 million.
By the time the steelmaker filed for bankruptcy, Mr. Romney was no longer running day-to-day operations at Bain, though his name remained on S.E.C. filings and other documents as the firm's owner. 
It is also important to note that the collapsing steel market devastated many other companies in the industry as well.

HEADLINE: The Defiant Ones

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: The unfettered ferocity of the Democrats speaking up in Charlotte makes last week's Republican convention seem like weak tea. 

 BODY:
The rousing start to the Democratic convention here in Charlotte, N.C. makes last week's Republican convocation in Tampa look like, well, a tea party.
If viewers thought Democrats might tuck in their tails and run away from the president's record, they were mistaken. The speakers gave full-throated, bare-fanged defenses of Barack Obama - rattling off hours of his accomplishments - and they used that record to draw a stark distinction with the plans of Mitt Romney, whom they attacked with unfettered ferocity.
The Democrats came to the party ready for a fight.
If you had to sum it up in a word, it would probably be defiance, as in defying the polls, defying the pundits and defying some harsh political realities.
The energetic and consistent speeches - all a variation on the theme of an already present and still growing America that the Republicans are willfully and possibly even congenitally blind to - ran counter to tight polls, the "enthusiasm-gap" hawks of cable news and a still-struggling economy.
As Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, told the crowd Tuesday:
My message is this - it is time for Democrats to grow a backbone and stand up for what we believe. Quit waiting - quit waiting, quit waiting for pundits or polls or super PACs to tell us who the next president or senator or congressman will be. We are Americans. We shape our own future.
To soften the first night it took the first lady, who, in dulcet tones but to devastating effect, delivered an exquisitely crafted speech that linked her personal love for her husband to devout Democrats' endless love affair with both of them. And her speech did something that Ann Romney's failed to do: it gave listeners an inside look at how her husband approached problems and worked through them.
One criticism of Obama, even among many supporters, is that he can sometimes seem detached. The first lady painted a portrait of a man who is empathetic and engaged. The crowd swooned.
Wednesday was a little more uneven and a little less well-scripted, but the masterful Bill Clinton wrapped the evening up as only he could: delivering a wonky speech with the passion of a southern preacher and keeping the crowd rapt the whole way through. 
"I want to nominate a man cool on the outside but burning for America on the inside," Clinton said near the beginning of his speech and by the end he was arguing starkly that
when we vote in this election, we'll be deciding what kind of country we want to live in. If you want a winner-take-all, you're-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket. But if you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibility, a we're-all-in-this-together society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
Whatever Clinton's faults, oration is his gift. No speaker at the Republican National Convention even came close.
It's not clear if the Democrats' performance will win converts - on Tuesday Gallup reported that there was no bounce in the polls for Romney after his convention - but their speeches may well stiffen loyalists' spines. In an evenly divided election where a win or a loss may come down to mobilization and turnout, that's not nothing.

HEADLINE: Who Built That?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: American success and growth has drawn on a deep partnership between business and government, a history and practical approach that many Republicans seem eager to deny, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Perhaps the biggest issue of this presidential election is the relationship between government and private business. President Obama recently offended some people by appearing to imply that private entrepreneurs did not build their companies without the help of others (although there is some debate about what he was really saying).
Mitt Romney's choice of Paul D. Ryan as vice presidential running mate is widely interpreted as signaling the further rise of the Tea Party movement within the Republican Party - with the implication that the private sector may soon be pushing back even more against the role of government.
For most of the last 200 years, national economic prosperity has been about creating and sustaining a symbiotic relationship between government and private business, including entrepreneurs who build businesses from scratch. This symbiosis was long a great strength of the United States, something it got right while other nations failed to do so, in various ways.
Is the partnership between government and business now really on the rocks? What would be the implications for longer-run economic growth of any such traumatic divorce?
To think about these issues, I suggest starting with "Why Nations Fail" by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, a sweeping treatise on political power and economic history. (I have worked with the authors on related issues, but I wasn't involved in writing the book. I am using their material as a reference point throughout my new course this fall at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "Global Controversies.")
Income per capita in 1750 was relatively similar around the world. There were some pockets of prosperity - imperial capitals and trading cities - but most people lived at roughly the same level of income (and lived about the same length of time). That changed dramatically in the hundred years after 1800; some countries charged ahead in terms of industrialization and broader economic development, while others lagged. (Lant Pritchett memorably labeled this phenomenon "Divergence, Big Time.")

Since 1900, while average income levels have risen almost everywhere, there has been surprisingly little convergence in income per capita. Countries that were relatively rich in 1900 are, for the most part, relatively rich today. Most countries that were poor in 1900 have failed to catch up with the highest income levels today - with some notable exceptions in East Asia and for some countries with a great deal of oil.
In the Acemoglu-Robinson view, it was all about having a favorable head start - based on strong and fair rules of the game:
Countries such as Great Britain and the United States became rich because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power and created a society where political rights were much more broadly distributed, where the government was accountable and responsive to citizens, and where the great mass of people could take advantage of economic opportunities.
These were excellent conditions for innovation and private-sector investment. People who were not born wealthy were able to educate themselves and create their own enterprises. But the government also played a very helpful role, with investments in clean water and public health, developing public education and supporting the creation of transportation and communication networks.
Equality before the law also became an essential component of successful societies - for example, much more present in the United States than in Mexico.
At least in the 19th century, government cooperated closely with private business in the United States. In much of the world, this relationship has never worked well - and conditions for growth are consequently undermined. "Why Nations Fail" explores in great detail exactly when and why politicians choke business, how economic oligarchs capture and abuse political power and what happens when militaries become too powerful. It is sobering reading.
"Why Nations Fail" has been very successful, in part because the history appeals to people on both the right and the left of the political spectrum. To those on the right, economic development requires strong property rights. To those on the left, constraints on the power of elites are essential. Both views garner a great deal of support from the Acemoglu-Robinson view of how the United States, Western Europe and a few other places did so well.
The United States avoided the problems on which the book focuses, but nevertheless it now faces a major struggle regarding the nature of its society -- and its future.
The 20th century brought a new and expanded role for government, putting into effect regulations that constrained what private business could do (starting with antitrust laws and food purity rules), providing various forms of social insurance (including old-age pensions) and increasing marginal tax rates (particularly on income). The modern federal government also operates a global military presence on a scale unimaginable to any American before 1941.
Unlike the populations of some countries, the American people have never reached a consensus over what was achieved and what was given up in the 1930s. In the United States, the rising role of the state produced a long-term backlash, culminating most recently in the form of a tax revolt (from the 1960s), a move to the right in the Republican Party (beginning with Ronald Reagan and running through Newt Gingrich directly to Mr. Ryan) and a deep-seated conviction that tax rates and government spending must be reduced ("starve the beast").
The discussion of Mr. Ryan and his budget ideas is likely to become central to the election over the next two months - and this is entirely appropriate.
A powerful coalition has risen against the state. It sees modern government as abusive and as standing in the way of economic recovery and growth. There is a strong urge to undo the reforms of the 1930s and roll back government at all levels. The economist Arthur Laffer spoke for many others when he said, "Government spending doesn't create jobs, it destroys jobs."
In truth, we all built the modern American economy. This certainly includes individuals taking responsibility for themselves, becoming more educated and working hard to develop their own companies. But the government also played a constructive role.
Can our political system reach a reasonable agreement on how to divide the benefits and share the costs? In "White House Burning," James Kwak and I proposed one way to do this - phasing in a fiscal adjustment based on the principle that revenue should return to where it was before the Bush tax cuts. Mr. Ryan is proposing a very different vision: phasing out the nonmilitary part of federal government.
In my assessment last month, I found that anything close to Mr. Ryan's version would be too extreme.
Mr. Ryan wants to strengthen the private sector and get government out of the way. In my reading of Professors Acemoglu and Robinson, Mr. Ryan's fiscal intentions would destroy the positive role of government in modern America -- throwing the baby out with the bath water. This would not be good for continued private-sector development, on which we all depend.

Qatar Imperils Big Merger of Commodity Companies | A huge merger in the natural resources sector is close to falling apart. 
On Friday, shareholders in Xstrata, one of the world's biggest miners of copper and coal, are to vote on an offer from Glencore International, which dominates the global trading of such materials. The deal, which values the combined company at $86 billion, would create a commodities giant whose activities touch all types of firms that need raw materials to make cars, mobile phones and other goods.
But Qatar Holding, a unit of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, is poised to thwart the acquisition.
Over the last year, Qatar, an increasingly powerful investor with holdings in large multinational companies, has spent nearly $5 billion amassing a 12 percent share of Xstrata. That stake gives Qatar a big voice in the process, and it plans to vote against the deal. DealBook »
Pruning Hedge Fund Regulation Without Cultivating Better Rules | Fresh from having declined to constrain money market funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to loosen marketing constraints on hedge funds, writes Jesse Eisinger in The Trade.
Two weeks ago, the agency threw up its hands and said it would not be able to defend millions of investors from money market funds that do things like invest in dodgy European bank bonds yet proclaim themselves to be perfectly safe.
Instead, the S.E.C. - mandated by Congress through its misnamed and harmful JOBS Act - proposed rules last week to lift advertising restrictions for hedge funds and other kinds of private investment offerings. The rules have not been completed, but we can look forward to an ad featuring a wizened couple in matching tubs overlooking a sunset, holding hands and talking about how they just put money with the next George Soros.
The old rules for hedge funds make little sense. Surely, hedge funds should be able to promote themselves to investors with data about their returns and methods.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton And Structural Unemployment

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: One thing he got wrong. 

 BODY:
I'm pretty annoyed with Bill Clinton right now; he's just spoiled one of my standard joke lines. You see, when giving talks about the economy, I've often said that I am have a different take from other pundits, because I know some stuff most political reporters don't, like ... arithmetic. I'll never be able to use that line again without being accused of stealing it from the Big Dog.
Seriously, that was an awesome speech. Clinton isn't just an amazing political talent; he has the ability to make wonkery accessible and compelling. Of course, he had one major advantage over the supposed wonks on the other side (still shaking my head over the Ryan implosion), namely, the well-known liberal bias of the facts.
But -- you knew there was going to be a but -- Clinton did get one thing wrong, which he has persistently gotten wrong for years. He's stuck on the notion that we have a big structural unemployment problem:
Of course, we need a lot more new jobs. But there are already more than 3 million jobs open and unfilled in America, mostly because the people who apply for them don't yet have the required skills to do them. 
He's been saying this for years. But it's not true -- even Republican economists agree.
In the context of the convention, this isn't important. But I hope that if reelected, Obama won't fall into the structural trap.

HEADLINE: The Clinton Magic

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: What Bill Clinton did for Democrats (and to Republicans) last night. 

 BODY:
In a sweeping, sprawling, drawling 48-minute stemwinder of a speech last night, the former President of the United States drove a rhetorical truck through the biggest opening that Mitt Romney and the Republicans created for Democrats last week. The G.O.P. convention promised to make difficult choices and hard calls and be bracingly honest with the public, but the Republican speakers discussed policy in only the broadest and loosest terms, eschewing detail in favor of generalizations and creativity in favor of boilerplate. In response, Bill Clinton did everything they didn't, diving deep on policy detail, covering issues ranging from Medicaid to welfare to prescription drugs to student loans, and effectively defining the Republicans - defining them negatively, it need hardly be said - on a range of issues where they declined to define themselves. Writing on Paul Ryan last week, I said that we shouldn't be surprised that his speech was less wonky than his reputation, since a VP address is "hardly the time to talk about block grants and premium support and whether to peg spending rates to inflation or G.D.P. plus one percent." But Clinton reminded us that this need not be true - that it's possible to get wonky without losing your audience, and to embrace policy detail as a weapon against your opponents. Journalists tend to assume that voters tune policy substance out, and when the substance is delivered droningly or too abstractly no doubt they often do. But for the most effective rhetoricians, the mere act of talking in detail about the work of government can be a more effective way to persuade the public that you're serious than a hundred vague promises to "make the hard choices" and "level with the American people."
Clinton's performance last night wasn't just masterful on the merits, though: It also saved Democrats from what had previously been a debacle of a day, beginning with a platform fight over the words "Jerusalem" and "God" that included a moment when convention delegates appeared to boo God from the convention floor (they were really booing the chair's procedural bullying, I presume), and proceeding to a grindingly ideological undercard of speeches that seemed designed to make the previous night's middling orators look impressive by comparison. If you had tuned in before 10:30, the Democrats looked like a party of apparatchiks, activists and time-servers, whose vision for the country at a time of economic disarray could be condensed to "no to Bain, yes to birth control." There were hints, and more than hints, of the cloistered left-wing irrelevance that Bill Clinton saved his party from once before - and then he was there again, saving the night if not the entire campaign.
The only aspect of his speech that Democrats might be wise to worry over, I would say, is the ratio of time Clinton spent defending to President Obama against Republican attacks on Medicare, welfare reform and of course the economy to the time he spent attacking the Romney-Ryan vision more directly. The direct attacks, when they came, were extremely effective: There was a section on the Republican Medicaid proposals that pushed an argument that the White House hasn't even really tried to make (the Medicaid spending projections in the Ryan budget are, indeed, implausible), and, inevitably, a long litany of all the popular programs that Republicans would need to cut in order to make their arithmetic add up. But Clinton barely touched Medicare premium support, which remains the most controversial (albeit, yes, also the best) of the Republican reform ideas. Maybe he didn't want to misrepresent Romney's proposal as brazenly as some other Democratic speakers, maybe he privately supports premium support and expects President Hillary Clinton to embrace it in the deficit negotiations of 2017 - but whatever the reason, it was an odd lacuna in a slashing speech. And without strong attacks on the Republican vision for Medicare (or, for that matter, Social Security), the policy sections as a whole were more defensive than I expected, batting away conservative attacks more than they carried the fight to Romney.
In a way, it's a small issue in a successful address. But entitlement reform, not funding for national parks or Pell grants or Head Start, still seems like the place where the Republican budget proposals are most vulnerable. And if I were in the Romney-Ryan campaign, I'd feel relieved and also a little puzzled that Clinton, who exploited so many openings last night, didn't exploit the entitlement issue as ruthlessly and sweepingly as a different, less defensive speech might have done.

HEADLINE: Nomura Seeks to Save $1 Billion By Scaling Back Mainly in Europe

BYLINE: HIROKO TABUCHI


HIGHLIGHT: Nomura's operations in the Americas will also take the brunt of the cutbacks. 

 BODY:
8:38 p.m. | Updated 
TOKYO - Nomura Holdings, the scandal-hit Japanese investment bank, outlined a broad reorganization plan on Thursday that would pare back its business to a shadow of what it held after acquiring parts of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Most of the $1 billion in cuts, initially announced last week, will be made abroad. They are driven by a grim outlook for the global economy, Koji Nagai, Nomura's new chief executive, told analysts and investors at the company's headquarters in Tokyo.
Nomura's operations in Europe, which will account for 45 percent of the cost savings, and the Americas, which will account for 21 percent, will take the brunt of the cutbacks, the bank said.
 Though Mr. Nagai declined to specify the number of jobs Nomura would eliminate, the company said it would shave $450 million from personnel expenses. Other cuts would come from savings made by optimizing spending on information technology, the bank said.
"We will take stock of the company from the roots upward and rebuild," Mr. Nagai said.
It has been a swift and striking fall for Nomura. For a nominal sum, it bought the Asian and European operations of Lehman Brothers, the American brokerage firm that failed in 2008, and set out to build a global investment franchise.
But that acquisition saddled Nomura with huge personnel costs, and the task of marrying two vastly different corporate cultures undermined efforts to capitalize on Lehman's talent pool.
Many top Lehman executives left Nomura, and it was forced to cut costs and try to end the hemorrhaging of money in its wholesale operations, which include equities, fixed income and investment banking. Nomura's foreign operations have lost money for nine consecutive quarters.
One of the last Lehman executives at Nomura, William Vereker, stepped down this week as joint head of investment banking. He is widely expected to leave the company soon.
Compounding the problems, an insider trading scandal in Japan this year led Nomura to replace its chief executive, Kenichi Watanabe, who had handled the bank's takeover of Lehman and had pushed for global expansion. His successor, Mr. Nagai, had been head of the Japanese domestic securities unit.
Under Mr. Nagai, the bank is narrowing its global aspirations and will focus closer to home in Asia, where it can better leverage its dominant position in Japan, senior executives said.
"When the global economy comes back, the recovery will start in Asia," Atsushi Yoshikawa, Nomura's new chief operations officer, said, "so we place great weight on Asia. But we have no plans to make aggressive investments like the kind we've made in America over the past three years. We intend to make good with what we have."
The latest retrenchment comes on top of a $1.2 billion cost-cutting Nomura struggled through last year. That effort eliminated 1,000 jobs.
The company plans to scrutinize sectors or businesses that perform poorly for two years in a row. Nomura's electronic brokerage unit Instinet, which it bought in 2006, will handle most equities execution outside Japan.

HEADLINE: What Obama Should Say

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Readers weigh in on what the president should say at the D.N.C. tonight. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C.--Yesterday I asked readers what Obama should say tonight at the Democratic Convention. Here's a small selection of their responses. (To see the rest, go to the comments section of the original article.)
Hugh McElyea, Florida
The President should make a very specific point re The Affordable Health Care Act:
"This is an ethical issue before it is a fiscal issue."

It has been fourteen years since Hillary Clinton attempted to introduce a solution to this shameful reality of American culture; and her efforts were defeated by the AMA and the Medical Insurance Industrial Complex. In the ensuing years, why haven't they come up with a plan of their own? It was an act of courage that this President took a stand and succeeded in passing the Act. As imperfect as it is, at least it was a beginning, one that will hopefully evolve.
Helmberger, Wisconsin
We all know our economy should be doing better than it is, that unemployment is too high. The central question in this campaign is what can we do to kick the economy into high gear? One thing we must do is invest in the nation's infrastructure. Workers are looking for more and better jobs. Businessmen and women look for ways to mobilize resources to produce and sell goods and services. And make no mistake, investors including big investors from overseas, are perfectly willing to lend our government money at near-zero rates of interest. Now listen up, America, for this is important. Can you think of a better time for the federal government to invest in our infrastructure? I'm not talking about spending money on consumption goods like bread and butter. I'm talking about roads, better transit systems for big cities, investing in human capital through education and basic research, improved railway systems. The examples are everywhere if you just stop to think about it. Now is the time to invest in America and create jobs. Of course we will need deal in time with the deficit, and we will, too. But now we must get the economy back on its feet, back like it was when Bill Clinton was our President. 
Lanny Arvan, Illinois
The President should pretend to be Paul Krugman for this one evening. The economy desperately needs a more active fiscal policy. We need another stimulus, which should be all spending increase. Much of that should be spending to help restore state-level cuts. Some of it should be new things - a 21st century version of the New Deal/WPA. In 2009, when the Democrats controlled both houses a stimulus bill was passed, but it wasn't big enough and a significant amount of it was tax cuts for people who mainly pocketed those funds or used them to pay off debt. In the lame duck Congress of 2010, we had more an extension for two years of the Bush Tax cuts. Now we need new spending.
It would be impossible to get that recommendation through the current Congress. So the President should say that and that part of doing the right thing is electing a Congress that will pass legislation for an active fiscal policy. That should be the bulk of his message.
There are fears, some legitimate, much misguided, on the long run threat posed by our National Debt. Since undecideds probably care about that a lot, some of the speech must be devoted to that. This is not the time to talk about Medicare reform or changes to Social Security. But the President must assert the seriousness of the issue and that it needs to be resolved, but should not hold hostage the near term need for an active fiscal policy.
J. Robert Surface, South Carolina
He must emphasize we are all Americans no matter where we worship or how much money we make. That while we have many opportunities to lie back and enjoy the life we've earned, we should always remember we have a responsibility to look out for our fellow man. That while there is nothing wrong with "getting" and "acquiring," there is even more happiness when we give back to our communities. That this is not only altruistic but it also makes good business sense because when everyone has an opportunity to enjoy a piece of the American pie, we all do better as a people. That our lives are great balancing acts and that we are all potential heroes when we help a poor family or lend a hand to a fellow employee or neighbor. That we show our best colors and our best face when we help others to grow, to develop, and to succeed. Why? because we are all interconnected in this thing called Life.
Mark E White, Georgia
Time for details and brass tacks.
1. Detail why we are better off than when he took over.
2. Hammer republicans in congress for obstructing tax cuts for the middle classes, etc.
3. Describe the fallacies and failures of the Ryan budget proposals.
4. Show how he is controlling costs for Medicare while expanding coverage. Remind audience of the parts of Obamacare they love.
5. Give examples of Romney's chameleon flip flopping. Then ask "How can we trust a man who won't release his tax records, who keeps Caribbean secret accounts, who promises he has the secret for controlling government debts when he ran Massachusetts over a fiscal cliff.
6. Then, he should provide the inspiring future message, "Yes we did and together we will build a fair and prosperous, and great America."
Jfitz, Massachusetts
What should Obama say?
1. Play to the fact checkers. No lies. We expect POTUS to be above that.
2. Be careful with the blame game. While true, the blame stuff gets old fast. Leave that to others (Biden?).
3. Take the high road. Tell of accomplishments (there are many) and explain failures. Tell what you've learned in the first term and how you can use that to your advantage.
4. Build trust. The world is on egg shells left, right and center. We want a leader who will make reasoned decisions, not some trigger-happy reactionary.
5. Avoid the overblown issues like abortion, gay marriage. You won't change any minds, and it's not worth the effort.
6. Talk about foreign policy and how we're in a difficult space. You can boast about your successes here, but also make clear that foreign affairs today is complex, and not for amateurs.
7. Outline your vision for your next term. The republicans have been very short on even a high-level strategy. Let's hear something more than overblown rhetoric. You're the president. You have the advantage of talking like the president, not some wannabe.
9. Make sure of the correct emphasis on the economy. People give you a C on the economy. You have to do better. Admit it. And you'll need help from all the good people in Congress.
10. Encourage people to make smart choices during this election. It's more than just the president. It's Congress, state and local elections. Information (and misinformation) is rampant. People have to make tough choices.
Rufus T Woodrow, New England
Think of the thing you most enjoy doing: golfing, reading, having a beer with your chums, walking your dog, texting your classmate, etc. Then think really hard about what goes into that activity: the water for your golf course, how you learned to read, quality control for the beer, sidewalks, phone networks, etc. Did the government have anything to do with those essentials to your enjoyment? Did your taxes support those actions? Did your neighbor pay his share?
It's easy to disdain "the government" because it doesn't have a name and a face like your generous Uncle Mel who helped you pay for college, or Mr. Squibb, the guy down the street who has an "illegal" in-law apartment. But the government is a partner in almost everything we do: sometimes blatantly and sometimes less obvious. If you accept that the government is a partner, then you are inclined to become more interested and involved in how it works, rather than simply trying to deny it's value and tearing it down. Of course the government screws up...but so does Uncle Mel and Mr. Squibb. But the answer isn't to chase them out of town, rather it is to find ways fair for all involved.

Obama should tell the younger generations that if R &R succeed in weakening social security/medicare with vouchers, millions of elderly will be thrown back on their family's help. The vouchers will be increasingly inadequate-that's their purpose.
Young people will be forced to help support their elders, even as they pay off their huge college loans, while looking for a decent paying job. If no college, they will work in lower wage service jobs, and still have to shell out for supporting parents and grandparents. Their own standard of living will have to go down. Picture 3 generations living together as they did generations ago, before elder poverty was reduced by govt programs.
Obama should tell in vivid, concrete terms how weakening the federal govt's elder support will drastically affect people of all ages in every stage of life.
He should contrast the Democrats' belief in science with the GOP's make believe world.

HEADLINE: Cuomo, in Convention City, Gives Spirited Speech From Small Stage

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: By turns stirring and scathing, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo sounded unmistakably like a man with ambitions well beyond Albany even as he tried to stay out of the spotlight. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Giant clusters of red, white and blue balloons hung overhead and an imposing black rope line stretched across the room. Campaign-style bunting festooned the podium and Bon Jovi's "Working for the Working Man" blared through loudspeakers. A seasoned political spouse leapt to her feet at applause lines, and the candidate shouted to be heard over an adoring crowd.
As Democrats assembled for their convention this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo steadfastly refused to appear on his party's biggest stage.
Instead, he set up his own inside a white banquet tent on the asphalt parking lot of a Doubletree Hotel on the outskirts of the city. 
The scene at the Cuomo Convention on Thursday may have lacked TV-ready glamour (those balloons aside), but the result was no less splashy: the governor of New York delivered a stemwinder of a speech - filled with tart-tongued denunciations of Republican economic policies and praise for New York as a progressive ideal for the country - that intensified speculation about his White House ambitions for 2016. 
With its conflicting message and goal, the site seemed to perfectly encapsulate Mr. Cuomo himself at the moment, at once wanting to be a Big Deal but worried about becoming a Big Deal. 
Since taking office last January, Mr. Cuomo has all but penned himself into the state, avoiding any out-of-town travel and high-profile speaking engagements that might expose him to the unforgiving scrutiny of the national political press. 
Here in Charlotte, that reluctance seemed magnified. The governor waited until Thursday morning to fly in from New York, skipping the first two days of his party's gathering and the parties that surround it. To avoid unwanted headlines, he canceled a fund-raiser with top Democratic donors. 
And yet. 
On Thursday, inside the tent, he sounded unmistakably like a man with ambitions well beyond Albany.
In a speech by turns stirring and scathing, he drew on his experience in Albany - and legislative achievements on taxes, education and same-sex marriage - as a blueprint for how Democrats can govern nationally.
It was clear that, despite the out-of-the-way location, his remarks were more tailored to the national audience in the convention hall, as he slipped between addressing his audience as "New Yorkers" and "America." 
He called on the country to embrace his vision of progressivism, describing the choice between President Obama and Mitt Romney as a "gut-check election" and the "truest test of who we are."
"Do you believe in interconnection and interrelation and, do you believe that I am connected to you, to you and to you?" he asked, pointing to people in the crowd, his voice rising to a full shout as audience members stood and clapped madly. 
"And there is a cord that connects us all. And that cord weaves a fabric. And when one of us is raised, we are all raised. And when one of us is lowered, we are all lowered. Do you believe that the sweetest success is shared success, when we all do well?"
Mr. Cuomo rarely engages in partisan broadsides, emphasizing his across-the-aisle diplomacy with members of the New York Legislature. 
But on Thursday he starkly departed from that script, variously deriding the speeches and policies articulated at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., last week as "absurd" and "obnoxious."
"I found it amusing. It was great theater - it was theater," he said, smiling. "That's why the actors felt so at home."
He reserved his deepest disdain for the claim, made by Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, that cutting taxes for the nation's wealthiest will, as Mr. Cuomo put it, "unleash the American entrepreneurial spirit." 
In an extended riff, he mocked this "American spirit they talk about all the time." 
"That great mystic spirit will come out," he continued. "The American spirit has a special wand and he will wave the wand. And everything will be O.K."
"No," Mr. Cuomo added. "When you cut taxes on the rich, there is no spirit that appears. The rich people get more money."
Like Mr. Cuomo himself these days, the event toggled between local and national, polished and rough, big and small. The Syracuse mayor made self-deprecating jokes as Mr. 
Cuomo's glamorous girlfriend, the Food Network personality Sandra Lee, turned heads among the wait staff. 
As the governor sat onstage, waiting to speak, a state senator and local union official received the state Democratic Party's highest honor: the "Progressive Tax Reform Achievement Award." (Mr. Cuomo posed for photos with both.)
But in the moments after he finished speaking, the normally voluble and friendly governor, who is known for mingling with reporters, suddenly seemed more like a national candidate, quickly dashing out through a side door and hopping into a waiting S.U.V., which whisked him away.

HEADLINE: Clinton Was Not Always an Obama Fan, Romney Ad Recalls

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: The day after Bill Clinton forcefully made the case for the president's re-election, a new Romney ad notes Mr. Clinton's reaction to Barack Obama was once "Give me a break." 

 BODY:
Bill Clinton proved Wednesday night to be one of President Obama's most forceful and substantive surrogates, but he has hardly been the most consistent. In fact, in a new ad, Mitt Romney's campaign is reminding voters that Mr. Clinton was once a sharp critic of Mr. Obama, in 2008.
"Give me a break," Mr. Clinton said in New Hampshire on the eve of that state's primary more than four years ago, when Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Obama were in a tight race for the Democratic nomination. "This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen," he said of Mr. Obama's position on the Iraq war. 
Mr. Clinton's words drew immediate criticism from Democrats, especially African-Americans.
The ad notes that Mr. Clinton is sounding a different tune today, though it casts him as "a good soldier, helping his party's president" after being called upon to support a "failing campaign."
The narrator then recites recent unemployment figures and says that the middle class is falling "further behind" before the "Give me a break" clip rolls a second time. 
The Romney camp has spoken well of Mr. Clinton's presidency. Stumping in Iowa on Wednesday, Representative Paul D. Ryan, the vice-presidential nominee, noted Mr. Clinton's economic successes and said that Mr. Romney would save the welfare reforms that the 42nd president enacted.
The Romney campaign declined to provide any details about where the ad was running, its standard practice, and the Obama campaign did not offer an immediate response. But after Mr. Clinton's 48-minute convention speech, one thing is clearly better off than it was four years ago: the Clinton-Obama relationship.

HEADLINE: Honda Introduces an Accord Buffet in New York

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: At a launch event in Chelsea, Jim Motavalli gets acquainted with the redesigned midsize sedan, including its coupe and hybrid variants. 

 BODY:
On Wednesday, Honda introduced the 2013 Accords at Chelsea Piers, on Manhattan's West Side. The sedan and coupe were joined by the company's first plug-in hybrid.
After passing a fraught 18 months that included the earthquake in northeast Japan, flooding in Thailand and unflattering reviews for the revamped Civic, Honda is back on track, recording 2012 sales of 732,165 vehicles through July in the United States, its best seven-month period since 2008. In August, Honda's American sales were up 59.5 percent compared with the same month in 2011, with 131,000 cars sold.
Though the sales boost can be largely attributed to the redesigned CR-V crossover, Mike Accavitti, a marketing executive for American Honda Motor, noted the Accord was "the single most important model in our lineup." Honda has sold more than 11 million Accords on the American market since 1976, and representatives here repeatedly emphasized the importance of the 2013 model to the brand's health in North America.
As noted previously by Wheels, the 2013 Accord does not represent a major styling departure, though the sedan and coupe accomplish a major hat trick, shrinking overall length and wheelbase while holding the course on interior dimensions. Rear legroom is up, and is notably good in the sedan. Once ensconced, a taller rear-seat passenger in the coupe has acceptable headroom and legroom.
Honda has emphasized utility throughout the interior with clear, conventional instrumentation, comfortable seats and, breaking an industry trend toward loading every function onto touch screens, an assortment of knobs and buttons. There are enough bins, pockets and cubbies to suit a minivan. All the Accords have capacious trunks except the plug-in hybrid, which surrenders considerable space to its battery pack.
Honda was keen to highlight a rather clever optional safety feature, a camera mounted below the passenger-side mirror that relays a view of the rear right flank to the 8-inch display whenever the driver signals a right turn.
Knowing the purchasing tendencies of the Accord's 11 million buyers, Honda expects a new 2.4-liter i-VTEC direct-injection engine, producing 185 horsepower, to be the most popular powertrain choice. Coupled to a new continuously variable transmission, a vehicle so equipped is certified by the Environmental Protection Agency with combined fuel economy of 30 miles per gallon. Conventional 6-speed manual and automatic transmissions will also be available.
Honda expects to sell about 350,000 Accords annually in the United States, with 85 percent of its sedans being equipped with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and just 15 percent with the available 278-horsepower, 3.5-liter i-VTEC V-6 unit. Orders for the coupe, with its sportier mien, are expected to skew 65 percent toward the 4-cylinder engine and 35 percent for the V-6.
The sedan goes on sale Sept. 19 and the coupe Oct. 15. Primary assembly of both models is to be performed in Ohio, though the plug-in hybrid, available in early 2013, is to be assembled at the company's plant in Sayama, Japan. That model arrives after the battery-powered Fit EV, reinforcing Honda's rather recent embrace of electrification. A conventional hybrid version of the Accord is also in the pipeline for the summer of 2013.
The Accord Plug-in Hybrid is powered by a 2-liter Atkinson Cycle 4-cylinder engine producing up to 137 horsepower, coupled to a 124-kilowatt electric motor and a 6.7-kilowatt-hour BlueEnergy lithium-ion battery pack provided through Honda's joint venture with the GS Yuasa Corporation. Maximum output from what Honda calls the two-motor hybrid system is 196 horsepower, closely aligned with that of the Toyota Camry Hybrid. Total range is said to exceed 500 miles.
Like the Toyota Prius PHV, Honda says the Accord Plug-in Hybrid would be capable of traveling 10-15 miles in purely electric mode, though the gas motor would intervene at high speeds or under significant throttle pressure. There are three driving modes. The relatively small battery pack is coupled to a 6.6-kW onboard charger that enables a complete recharge from a 240-volt outlet in under an hour. Fuel economy figures are not available, but Honda is aiming for an E.P.A. rating of more than 100 MPGe combined and a very clean emissions rating of Advanced AT-PZEV from California's Air Resources Board.
The plug-in model is also positioned as a range-topper of the Accord model line, optioned up to virtually match the top-line Touring sedan, with touch screen, LEDs and safety features. Would that make it more expensive than the Prius PHV, with its manufacturer's suggested retail price of $32,760 in base form?
"It would be un-Honda-like to price this new model in the stratosphere," was all Chris Naughton, a Honda spokesman, would say.

11:15 P.M. | Balloons Were a Casualty of Move From Stadium
As President Obama brought his 38-minute acceptance speech to an end, it seems fair to ask what this speech would have been like if Mr. Obama had delivered it to 75,000 people in an outdoor stadium as originally planned?
The smaller arena - and the smaller crowd - gave the moment a more serious and contained feeling, far from the explosion of energy Mr. Obama set off at Mile High Stadium in Denver. It also felt more, well, conventional.
Perhaps that was never clearer than at the very end, as the confetti guns shot into the air and the video screens displayed the images of fireworks that would have been set off live at the stadium. And because of the speech's move from an outdoor stadium to the arena - a last-minute bow by convention planners to forecasts of heavy rains and lightning - there wasn't even time to set up a balloon drop.
- 
11:12 P.M. | A Closer Look on Obama and Alliances
President Obama said in his speech that "around the world, we've strengthened old alliances," and elsewhere praised the members of the military for making "this country safer and more respected." 
Attitudes toward the United States are generally more positive now in other countries than they were in 2008, the last year of George W. Bush's presidency - but they have slipped moderately since Mr. Obama took office in 2009, according to a 21-nation survey conducted this spring by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project.
The countries that warmed most to the United States in that time were in Europe, the survey found. In France, Spain and Germany, the percentage of people with a positive view of the United States is at least 20 percentage points higher than it was in 2008. But in several strategically important Muslim nations, including Jordan and Pakistan, America's already low image slipped further during the Obama presidency, it found. 
The report found that Mr. Obama consistently received higher ratings than Mr. Bush did in all the nations surveyed except Pakistan, but that "global approval of President Barack Obama's policies has declined significantly since he first took office."
"There remains a widespread perception that the U.S. acts unilaterally and does not consider the interests of other countries,'' the report found. "In predominantly Muslim nations, American antiterrorism efforts are still widely unpopular. And in nearly all countries, there is considerable opposition to a major component of the Obama administration's antiterrorism policy: drone strikes. In 17 of 20 countries, more than half disapprove of U.S. drone attacks targeting extremist leaders and groups in nations such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia."[#x2028]
- 
11:00 P.M. | A Closer Look at Obama on Foreign Policy
"In 2014, our longest war will be over." That is what President Obama said tonight about Afghanistan. 
Well, maybe. That is the deadline for pulling out all American and other foreign troops. But the White House has said that it envisions an "enduring force" in Afghanistan for years to come, one that some officials told me this year could amount to 10,000 to 15,000 troops. They would not be in combat, but they would be there to keep the Taliban from overtaking Kabul, and Pakistan from losing control of its 100 or so nuclear weapons. Combat may be over; it's less likely the war will be.
The president's real goal, though, was to get to a line he has used often before: that he plans to "do some nation-building right here at home," spending on roads and schools and runways. It's a sure applause line, but again, it skips by a reality: American promised some nation-building in places like Afghanistan, and places like it, and gradually, it is walking away. 
There were some other questionable lines in tonight's speech. The president said he "stood up to China." He did, starting in 2010, but before that the Chinese interpreted his outreach to the country as a sign of weakness. And Mr. Obama didn't make categorical statements about how far toward a bomb the Iranians could go; instead, he said the right goal was to keep Iran facing "a world that stays united against its nuclear ambition."
And there was Mr. Obama's biggest zinger at Mr. Romney: that he was "stuck in a cold war time warp." It could be a while before Mr. Romney lives down that line about Russia as the country's biggest geopolitical adversary. If Mr. Romney makes it to the Oval Office, the world may look a little more complicated.
- 
10:45 P.M. | Obama's Opponent Remains Mostly Anonymous
And here's the answer to one of the night's questions: Once, in a 4,400-word speech.
That's how many times President Obama mentions Mitt Romney by name, at least in the prepared remarks of his speech.
The quote: "But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well, you do the math," he said. "I refuse to go along with that. And as long as I'm president, I never will."
- 
10:43 P.M. | Obama Presses Past Audience Participation
As President Obama is speaking, there are various chants from the audience - "U.S.A., U.S.A." is one. "We love you" is another. When he mentioned Detroit and Michigan, there was a swirl of applause from what appeared to be that state's delegation.
One sign of Mr. Obama's skill as a public speaker is that he doesn't flinch, pause or acknowledge the cheers. He pushes along with his speech, realizing - presumably - that viewers at home won't really hear the cheers, but would notice if he paused in the middle of delivering an argument or a line.
- 
10:19 P.M. | Biden Gets Some Network Airtime
The networks were tuning in just as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was delivering one of his toughest lines of the night.
"You never quit on America," he said. "And you deserve a president who will never quit on you."
"And one more thing that our opponents are dead wrong about: America is not in decline," he said.
"I've got news for Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan, it has never, never, ever, been a good bet to bet against the American people."
- 
9:58 P.M. | Biden Praises Bin Laden Decision
The second major event Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. laid out on Thursday was President Obama's decision to order a raid on Osama bin Laden's hide-out in Pakistan.
"It was about righting an unspeakable wrong," Mr. Biden said. "It was about healing a nearly unbearable wound in America's heart. He also knew the message we had to send to terrorists around the world - if you attack innocent Americans, we will follow you to the ends of the earth."
Mr. Biden retold the story of the deliberations that led to the decision, describing how Adm. William H. McRaven, the commander of the operation, told the president, "Sir, we can do it." Mr. Obama, he said, authorized the mission.
"Bravery resides in the heart of Barack Obama," Mr. Biden said.
- 
10:04 P.M. | Biden on the Auto Bailout
If there was any doubt about how important the White House views its auto rescue plan as central to President Obama's re-election campaign - and really, there should not have been - Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. put it to rest tonight with a long and detailed comparison of Mr. Obama's support to save the auto industry and Mitt Romney's opposition to the plan.
Mr. Biden said that Mr. Romney, a former businessman whose father was an automobile executive, looked at the crisis as a business decision, with the goal of maximizing profits. Mr. Obama, he said, viewed it as a crisis that would result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs and hurt the United States' image across the world.
"This was a lot more than the American auto industry," he said. "This was about restoring America's pride. He understood in his gut what it would mean to leave a million people without hope if he didn't act."
When Mr. Biden began talking about Mr. Romney and the auto industry, a boo was heard from one corner of the room. Mr. Biden sought to quiet the jeerer.
"President Obama and Governor Romney are both loving husbands, they are both devoted fathers," he said." But let's be straight, they bring a vastly different vision and a vastly different value set to the job."
- 
9:49 P.M. | Biden Pays Tribute to Obama
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. began his speech tonight with a lengthy tribute to President Obama, describing him as an intense, unwavering man who had survived and grown during the crisis the two encountered upon taking office.
"Folks, I've watched him," Mr. Biden said. "He has never wavered. He has never backed down. He always steps up."
Mr. Biden talked about life working 30 feet down the hall from Mr. Obama - "I've had a ringside seat" - as he grappled with the financial crisis and the rescue of the automobile industry. He referred to the president as "Barack."
"Day after day, night after night, I sat beside him as he made one gutsy decision after another to stop the slide and reversal," he said. "I watched him stand up to intense pressure and stare down enormous challenges."
Mr. Biden has, at times, been criticized for being windy and self-involved. But at least at first, he spoke mainly about Mr. Obama and what he said was his loyalty to this president.
"You know, Barack and I, we've been through a lot together these four years," he said. "We learned about another one. A lot about one another. One of the things I learned was the enormity of his heart, and I think he learned about me the depth of my loyalty to him."
- 
9:42 P.M. | Biden Accepts Nomination and Turns to Making Case
"I accept," Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said. "I accept, with great pleasure."
With those words, Mr. Biden accepted the nomination as vice president and kicked off the second-most important speech of the evening. But before he got to the business of praising President Obama and laying out the case for his re-election, Mr. Biden offered an emotional tribute to his wife, Jill, and his children.
"We're as worthy as any generation that has gone before us," he said. '"We're on a mission to move this nation forward, from doubt and downturn, to promise and prosperity."
- 
9:36 P.M. | Jill Biden Introduces Vice President
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. isn't getting his own night during the convention here - that went to former President Bill Clinton. But at least he got the early part of the evening.
He was nominated by acclamation. Was the subject of a biographical video. And he was introduced by his wife, Jill Biden, who provided another in what has been a series of spousal tributes at these conventions (the one exception was Paul D. Ryan, who was not introduced by his wife, Janna).
Mrs. Biden was warm and effusive in paying tribute to Mr. Biden as a husband and as vice president.
"Thanks to the leadership of President Obama and my husband Joe, the war in Iraq is over," she said.
- 
9:31 P.M. | Kerry Attacks Romney on Foreign Policy
 If Senator John F. Kerry's best line tonight was his query of whether Osama bin Laden is better off today than he was four years ago, his biggest task was to cast Mitt Romney as a man lost in the wider world.
It is a theme that is already beginning to resound in the Obama campaign: that the Romney/Ryan ticket has less national security experience than any Republican ticket in memory. And it was Mr. Kerry's job to make the case that a president who took office nearly four years ago with no foreign policy experience is now something of a hardened veteran of the Situation Room, who has confounded his critics with his aggressiveness.
 It is a delicate balance. Mr. Kerry celebrated the United States' withdrawal from Iraq - a "war of choice," he said, using the phrase that so angered George W. Bush - and made the argument that Mr. Obama was on his way to withdrawal from Afghanistan. (For that conflict, Mr. Kerry used the phrase "war of necessity," which Mr. Obama himself has avoided for nearly two years.) In a country that is war weary, it is understandable why Mr. Kerry pressed the case that Mr. Obama has found the United States' way to the exits. More difficult is the question of whether America achieved anything lasting there, especially in Afghanistan.
 But Mr. Kerry's approach pointed the way that Mr. Obama and his surrogates are likely to follow for the next two months. They will try to cast Mr. Romney as a man who talks tough, and speaks of American "exceptionalism," but in the end backs away from embracing go-it-alone strategies far different from Mr. Obama's. And it will be Mr. Romney's task to argue, as Mr. Obama did four years ago, that a lack of experience is not disqualifying.
- 
9:07 P.M. | On Israel, Kerry Says Republicans Have 'Lied'
In his speech to the Democratic convention, Senator John F. Kerry said that Republicans have "lied" repeatedly about President Obama's support for Israel and quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as declaring that the two countries have "exactly the same policy" and that "our security cooperation is unprecedented." Those quotations, echoed by other top Israeli officials, are accurate. But they do not fully capture the history between the two leaders. 
Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu have had a cool and sometimes rocky relationship, and some American supporters of Israel have questioned the reliability of the president's oft-stated commitment to Israeli security in the face of Iran's nuclear program. By contrast, Mr. Netanyahu is an old friend of Mitt Romney; the two men worked together in the 1970s at a Boston consulting firm.

9:35 P.M. | Wives Take Center Stage
Wives have become the main character references for political leaders at this convention. Ann Romney spoke of her love for Mitt Romney, Michelle Obama expressed her love for Barack Obama, and now Jill Biden has done the same for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
Noting that Mr. Biden often claimed he had to ask Jill to get married five times before she said "yes," Mrs. Biden said, "I always loved Joe."
Mrs. Biden's testimonial was followed by a slick video about the vice president, in which he is lavishly praised by Mr. Obama, and Mr. Biden returns the favor, talking of the president's "ramrod" spine.

9:07 P.M. | John Kerry Highlights Foreign Policy
Foreign policy finally made it front and center at the convention, in a biting speech by Senator John F. Kerry. 
Mr. Kerry, a former Democratic presidential nominee and potential future secretary of state, criticized Mr. Romney for failing to pay tribute to troops in Afghanistan during his acceptance speech last week and said he had lied repeatedly about Mr. Obama's record on Israel. 
"We have a president who has made America lead like America again," Mr. Kerry said. "What is there on the other side? An extreme and expedient candidate, who lacks the judgment and the vision so vital in the Oval Office." 
As for Mr. Romney's pointed question to economically depleted voters about whether they were better off than four years ago, Mr. Kerry said, "Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago." Mr. Kerry even turned his own flip-flop on the Iraq war against Mr. Romney. 
Reciting what he said were examples of serial switching in Mr. Romney's positions on military intervention in Libya and the pace of troop withdrawals in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Kerry said, "Talk about being for it before you were against it."

9:01 P.M. | Granholm Delivers Impassioned Speech - and Broadsides
So far, the rabble-rousing speech of the night award goes to Jennifer M. Granholm, the former governor of Michigan.
Consciously or not - and the bet here is consciously - Ms. Granholm in her speech was channeling another governor who gave a speech to a Democratic convention: Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas. That speech, as much as almost anything, established Ms. Richards as a Democratic hero and put her on the national map.
 Ms. Richards's target was another wealthy Republican man, former President George Bush. For Ms. Granholm it was Mr. Romney.
 Ms. Richards and Ms. Granholm sounded at times like the same person as they used mockery, wit and insult to put down their opponents.
 "He was born with a silver foot in his mouth," Ms. Richards, who was state treasurer at the time, said of Mr. Bush at the 1988 convention.
 Cue Ms. Granholm, referring to the Michigan automobile industry. "He loves our cars so much, they have their own elevator," she said of Mr. Romney. " But the people who design, build and sell those cars? Well, in Romney's world, the cars get the elevator; the workers get the shaft."
 Mr. Bush went on to win that election, of course, defeating Michael S. Dukakis. Ms. Richards went on to become governor of Texas.

8:40 P.M. | Crist, Former Republican, Speaks to D.N.C.
No matter how obscure the speaker, a politician's home state usually provides a cheering section. But Charlie Crist, the former Florida governor, may have to wait a few years to get any validation from Sunshine State Democrats after his speech tonight.
Mr. Crist spent his career in politics as a Republican until 2010, when he ran as an Independent for Senate against Marco Rubio (and a Democrat, Kendrick Meek). Now, amid speculation that he will again run for governor in 2014 - as a Democrat - Mr. Crist has endorsed President Obama and was officially added to the Charlotte speaking roster last week. Some of Florida's delegates have threatened to walk out during his remarks.
"If he gets up to speak at the convention, it'll be a good time to go to to the bathroom," one delegate from Palm Beach told The Tampa Bay Times.
While the Obama campaign is hoping Mr. Crist can unite Florida's centrist voters around the incumbent, his shifting party allegiances are uniting the state's partisans in disdain. The Republican Party of Florida has provided "previews" of what Mr. Crist will say, in the form of Web videos with clips of him calling for the repeal of the health care law, praising Sarah Palin and saying he is "about as conservative as you can get." The state G.O.P. has also promised to "live tweet" Mr. Crist's speech from a feed that is already dripping with derision for its erstwhile standard-bearer.

8:31 P.M. | Granholm Touts Obama on Jobs
It is an interesting twist of this election that some of the biggest electoral battlegrounds are actually doing somewhat better than the United States as a whole. Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan, made that point in dramatic fashion, reeling off a list of jobs created during the Obama presidency in virtually every swing state, from Michigan to Ohio to Pennsylvania to North Carolina.
As for Mitt Romney, Ms. Granholm said: "Now, sure, Mitt Romney loves our lakes and our trees. He loves our cars so much they even have their own elevator. The cars get the elevators and the workers get the shaft."
When the auto industry was teetering on the precipice in 2009, she said, "the cavalry arrived" in the person of Mr. Obama. His intervention saved more than a million jobs, not just in Michigan but also in many other states - every one of them, it happens, a swing state.
As the crowd roared - chanting, "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" - Ms. Granholm pumped her arms vigorously.
- 
8:09 P.M. | In Emotional Moment, Giffords Leads Pledge
In an emotional moment, Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona representative seriously wounded in a shooting last year, was escorted to the stage to lead the crowd in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. Giffords, wearing a white jacket and black slacks, walked with a limp but looked stronger than she had in the past. After a robust recitation, Ms. Giffords smiled and waved, as the crowd chanted: "Gabby! Gabby!" Turning to leave, she blew kisses to the crowd, as she was escorted off stage by a friend, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic Party chairwoman.
- 
7:57 P.M. | Hollywood Stars Come Out in Support of Obama
The Hollywood quotient at this last evening of the convention was filled by a pair of actresses: Scarlett Johansson and Kerry Washington. Ms. Washington, known for her performance as the wife of Ray Charles in the biographical film "Ray," delivered a rousing, disciplined speech in support of President Obama - the antithesis of the meandering performance art of Clint Eastwood at the Republican convention a week earlier.
Ms. Johansson, a longtime Obama supporter who broke through in the movie "Lost in Translation," said she spoke "not as a representative of young Hollywood," but as a representative of millions of young Americans, particularly women. She praised Mr. Obama for his commitment to reproductive rights for women. She also delivered a pitch for more young people to vote. 
"Young America," she said, "why are we speaking with only half our voice when so many issues directly affect us?"

7:57 P.M. | Security at the Arena
Delegates, supporters and journalists got a bit more exercise than they bargained for Thursday night, when Secret Service agents and security guards at the Time Warner Cable Arena began to lock down the convention doors just before 7 p.m.
As a group of stragglers approached the convention hall - late by security standards, but still more than three hours before President Obama was set to take the stage - police officers informed them that the doors had just closed, but that there might be one final entrance on the other side of the arena still letting people in.
And so began the mad dash.
Cheryl Richard, of Charlotte, N.C., was off and running, pausing only to rip off her wedge espadrilles and continue on her way, barefoot.
"Time to do some cardio," joked one supporter, wearing a full suit, as he began jogging up a flight of stairs.
Still, arriving sweaty - but safely - in the arena, Ms. Richard said the effort was worth it.
"My husband is already in here, saving us seats," she said with a relieved smile.
- 
7:33 P.M. | Musical Interlude: Foo Fighters
And now for a (somewhat) younger demographic:
Foo Fighters took the stage, playing their 1998 hit "My Hero." Photos of President Obama scrolled up a giant screen behind the band as they sang, "There goes my hero." 
The entertainment portion of this final night of the convention has been far more ambitious than on the first two nights, already featuring James Taylor and Mary J. Blige.
Clearly, the musicians are fervent Obama supporters. They allowed the two O's in Foo to be adapted with the Obama's convention campaign symbol - a blue O with a crowd in silhouette.
- 
7:22 P.M. | Biden Formally Nominated
The undercard of the Democratic ticket was formally set with the nomination, by acclamation, of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a candidate for another term as vice president. Mr. Biden's son, Beau Biden, handled the honors, paying tribute to his father as a leader who keeps his promises, not least to America's military veterans.
The younger Mr. Biden, an Iraq war veteran who is the attorney general of Delaware, recalled telling the last Democratic convention to be there for his father as Beau Biden left for the war. "I can say with certainty: He has been there for us," he said.
The vice president and his wife, Jill, smiled and waved from their seats overlooking the podium.
 The mood was gentle, but a day earlier, Mr. Biden gleefully poked fun at his Republican counterpart, Representative Paul D. Ryan, who admitted misstating his time in a marathon in the early 1990s. Mr. Biden said his mother "could take him."
- 
7:29 P.M. | Focus on Gay Rights 
A little while ago, delegates watched an effusive tribute to gay rights -- and gay marriage, including a glitzy video featuring President Obama speaking in favor of gay marriage.
Next up was Zach Wahls, who introduced himself as "a sixth-generation Iowan, an Eagle Scout, and I was raised by my two moms, Jackie and Terry."
Mr. Wahls took note of the 2004 Republican convention.
"I remember politicians talking about protecting marriage from families like mine," he said. "Now, supporting a view of marriage as between a man and woman isn't radical. For many people, it's a matter of faith. We respect that. Watching that convention on TV, though, I felt confused, frustrated. Why didn't they think my family was a real family?"
The section of the night reinforced a pattern of this convention: a powerful emphasis on social issues - earlier it was abortion and access to contraception - in a way that clearly goes over well in this hall. For the most part, however, these topics have been prominent in the earlier part of the night, before the networks clicked on. One of the interesting questions for tonight is how Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will address those issues in their acceptance speeches.
- 
7:11 P.M. | You Might Recognize Him From Your In-Box
One of the most coveted speaking spots for a party leader is at a political convention, and there is no end to elected officials, former elected officials, party chairman, union leaders - not to mention presidents and vice presidents - who take the stage. But tonight, a rather unusual one added his name to the list: Jim Messina, President Obama's campaign manager.
Since Mr. Messina is running the show, it certainly is within its rights to claim a spot in the spotlight. And judging by his speech, his agenda was not about self-promotion but the latest example of how campaigns, starting with the Clinton campaign, have pushed back-room operatives to the foreground to help rally the grass roots.
E-mails to supporters from Mr. Messina routinely come signed "Messina." So perhaps it shouldn't have been much of a surprise when Mr. Messina - who as a White House aide was known for preferring to stay behind the curtains - came sauntering onto the stage.
Or when he used this platform to thank the volunteers and try to solicit some more.
"Let's hear it for our neighborhood team leaders!" he shouted. "Our volunteers have made 44 million calls and knocked on 3.8 million doors," he said. " We've registered more than a million voters - already more than in 2008."
"Take out your phones. For the first time in history, you can donate by texting. Just text 'give' to 622-62 to donate $10 right now. That's 622-62."

6:32 P.M. | Lewis Warns Delegates of Dangers of New Voter Laws
Representative John Lewis of Georgia told the delegates Thursday that he first came to Charlotte, N.C., on a Freedom Ride in 1961, the year President Obama was born, and warned them that new voting laws passed in several Republican-led states requiring voter IDs and limiting early voting would make it harder for people to vote.
"Too many people struggled, suffered and died to make it possible for every American to exercise their right to vote,'' said Mr. Lewis, whose skull was fractured by a police nightstick in in Alabama when troopers moved in to block a civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery. The day became known as Bloody Sunday.
Republicans say the new voting laws are needed to prevent fraud. Democrats note that such fraud almost never happens and say that the laws are an attempt to suppress the votes of young people and members of minority groups that traditionally vote for Democrats.
A court battle is over whether the state can curtail its early voting hours. A new voter identification law in Pennsylvania - which a top Republican lawmaker said would "allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania" - was upheld in court last month. And last month a federal court struck down a new voter ID law in Texas, ruling that it would hurt turnout among minority voters and impose "strict, unforgiving burdens on the poor."
"Today it is unbelievable that there are Republican officials still trying to stop some people from voting,'' Mr. Lewis said. "They are changing the rules, cutting polling hours and imposing requirements intended to suppress the vote."
The party platforms differ on the issue. The Republican platform says that "we applaud legislation to require photo identification for voting and to prevent election fraud, particularly with regard to registration and absentee ballots." It also says: "We support state laws that require proof of citizenship at the time of voter registration to protect our electoral system against a significant and growing form of voter fraud. Every time that a fraudulent vote is cast, it effectively cancels out a vote of a legitimate voter."
The Democratic platform says, "Democrats know that voter identification laws can disproportionately burden young voters, people of color, low-income families, people with disabilities, and the elderly, and we refuse to allow the use of political pretexts to disenfranchise American citizens."
- 
6:04 P.M. | James Taylor Serenades the Hall
Forget the speeches. This afternoon, James Taylor walked out on the convention floor to sing for a surprisingly full hall, opening with "Carolina in My Mind," to cheers and flashbulb pops. Mr. Taylor was wearing a cowboy hat and a tie: considerably more dressed up than when he appeared here a few hours ago to do a sound check.
He walked out and glanced at the empty chair waiting for him - "Hope that empty chair doesn't make you nervous," Mr. Taylor said in the first Clint Eastwood joke of the night. People spilled out onto the balconies to photograph Mr. Taylor performing.
"I've been watching the coverage and I've got to say, I don't get it: I'm an old white guy. And I love Barack Obama."
From there, it was to "You've Got a Friend."
Music for the younger set is coming up later: the Foo Fighters.
- 
5:41 P.M. | What to Watch For in Obama's Speech
President Obama takes the stage Thursday night competing against a formidable array of convention speakers: Mitt Romney, Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton - and Barack Obama.
Not easy. Still, one thing Mr. Obama has proved over the years is that he can deliver the big speech, particularly when he might be backed into a corner. And Mr. Obama has a big advantage here: He is going last.
Here are a few things to watch out for when Mr. Obama takes the stage. Read more ...

HEADLINE: Visas-for-Dollars Program a Boon to Hotel Developers

BYLINE: JANET MORRISSEY


HIGHLIGHT: A federal program that grants so-called EB-5 visas to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in an American business has become a popular source of cheap financing for hotel companies. 

 BODY:
When Marriott International wanted to open a new hotel in downtown Seattle, the company's developers didn't sell bonds, take out a mortgage or tap other traditional forms of financing for the $88 million project. Instead, it raised the bulk of the money from wealthy immigrants who wanted a green card.
A government program, which grants so-called EB-5 visas to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in an American business, is now a popular source of financing for new Marriott hotels. Since the Seattle deal in 2008, the company has endorsed 14 projects that use EB-5 financing, including the downtown Milwaukee Marriott, a Courtyard Marriott in Midtown Manhattan and a $168 million hotel near the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
"It's created liquidity in a relatively illiquid market," said Anthony Capuano, the chief development officer at Marriott.
The EB-5 program has been around since 1990, but small hotel developers started flocking to it in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. They didn't have much choice. With the economy in tatters and the travel market tanking, many projects stalled or were canceled altogether when financing evaporated. Even now as the industry fundamentals improve and room occupancy rates rise, money is hard to come by - expensive for some, nonexistent for others.
The federal government offers an alternative. Under the Citizenship and Immigration Services' Immigrant Investor Program, foreigners can obtain EB-5 visas - essentially temporary residency status - by investing $1 million, or $500,000 in high unemployment areas, in a commercial venture that generates 10 jobs over two years.
It has proved to be a relatively cheap source of financing. Hotel developers can raise money through the EB-5 program by offering returns of less than 4 percent. In contrast, the interest rates on debt starts at 6 percent, with some riskier forms of financing running at 10 percent or higher. Investors who take an equity stake in a hotel project aim for returns of 20 percent.
"Foreigners are buying visas and are much less concerned about the rate of return they earn on their investment," said David Loeb, a senior analyst at Robert W. Baird.
Despite the potential advantages, big industry players were reticent at first. Many dismissed it as a marginal program for questionable projects that couldn't get financing any other way. They also wondered how developers could round up 200 investors to pay for a $100 million project.
"We would go to conferences and talk about the program, and people just didn't believe it was real - they didn't believe you could raise that much money," said Catherine D. Holmes, partner at the law firm Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell. Once Marriott was in the picture, "people started to take it more seriously," said Ms. Holmes, whose firm is helping clients use EB-5 financing for 40 different hotel projects.
Over the last 18 months, developers for Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt Hotels and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide have turned to EB-5 financing. In July, FelCor Lodging Trust announced plans to raise $45 million through EB-5 financing as part of its planned $230 million redevelopment of the Knickerbocker Hotel in Times Square. Sam Nazarian, the hospitality magnate known for his celebrity-packed hotels, restaurants and nightclubs in Los Angeles, plans to build the first SLS hotel in New York with EB-5 money.
"It's a method of financing that's current, available and very credible," said Craig Mance, Hilton's senior vice president for development for North America "It's helping deals move forward." Hilton has 10 projects relying on EB-5 financing.
EB-5 financing has been a boon to development broadly.
So far this year, the government has issued 3,002 temporary visas through the program, up from 640 in 2008. Most have gone to Chinese immigrants, with a number handed out to investors in Britain, India, the Netherlands and South Korea.
Developers often work with so-called regional centers, federally approved organizations that help them draw up business plans and recruit potential investors.
While the regional center program is slated to end on Sept. 30, the Senate approved a bill to extend it for three years. It is expected to pass Congress, although a date has not been set for the vote in the House.
The program has been a good fit for hotels, which create direct jobs - desk people, housekeepers and managers - as well as indirect employment for the companies providing towels and other supplies. "Hotels are 24-hour-a-day, 365-day businesses," said Mr. Capuano of Marriott. "They're ideal for driving job growth."
Marriott's 377-room hotel under construction in Los Angeles is estimated to generate 4,240 direct and indirect jobs by 2016, above its EB-5 goal of 3,360. The developers benefit in part from the hotel's proximity to the Staples Center, which houses four professional sports teams; Marriott guests are expected to help drive the sales of tickets and team souvenirs. The project even gets a boost from the jumbo electronic billboard outside the hotel, which should lead to jobs for advertising, marketing and leasing the sign.
"The idea is that more money in the economy equates to more jobs," said Henry Liebman, the president of American Life, a regional center that worked with Marriott's developers.
The program has had its share of problems. It was suspended from 1998 to 2003 over complaints of fraud and corruption, according to the government agency that oversees that program. In some cases, a foreign investor would commit money with a promissory note, then never hand over the cash. There were also cases where middlemen would siphon off cash, leaving little for the developers. Other times, developers took the cash but never built the project.
"There were some issues with investors trying to circumvent the capital and job-creation requirements," said Claire Nicholson, a spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Services.
The government has worked to clean up the program. Investors are now required to pay the full amount upfront and any fees to middlemen must be paid separately.
"We're committed to ensuring the program achieves its job creation mission efficiently and effectively," Ms. Nicholson said.
As Marriott and other big hoteliers have jumped on board, they have also helped improve the credibility of the program, according to industry players.
The hotel companies closely analyze each project, whether or not they use EB-5 financing. They want to ensure the hotel meets brand standards and the debt levels are manageable.
"If someone tells me they've got a $10 million project and they've got $10.5 million in debt, that's a project that I'm going to question because it's overleveraged," Mr. Mance of Hilton said. It's up to the developers and the regional centers to ensure the project meets the EB-5 requirements.
Even after traditional financing comes back significantly, Marriott, Hilton and others say they are likely to continue using the EB-5 program. It's relatively cheap and stable, and it complements other financing sources. Said Mr. Mance: "If it works, why not use it again?"

HEADLINE: In Speech, Obama to Plead for Patience

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER and PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama prepared to accept the Democratic nomination to run for a second term on Thursday night, and planned to say that "our problems can be solved," while making a forceful case that in four years he has brought the economy from disaster to a recovery which would be imperiled by a return to Republican stewardship. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C.-President Obama prepared to accept the Democratic nomination to run for a second term on Thursday night, and planned to say that "our problems can be solved," while making a forceful case that in four years he has brought the economy from disaster to a recovery which would be imperiled by a return to Republican stewardship.
According to excerpts released in advance of his speech, Mr. Obama sought to define his fight for re-election as a bald "choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future," Mr. Obama framed the upcoming election as one that will determine the economic futurethat will face generations of Americans.
"On every issue, the choice you face won't just be between two candidates or two parties," Mr. Obama will say, according to the excerpts.
"When all is said and done," Mr. Obama planned to say, "when you pick up that ballot to vote, you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation."
The president will argue that the next few years will bring crucial decisions on the role of government to make better the lives of ordinary Americans, on taxes and deficits, on health care, and on the running battle to lift ordinary Americans.
"I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy," the president will say, according to the excerpts. "You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth."
 The Romney campaign released a reaction to his speech before it was even delivered, assailing Mr. Obama for failing to create enough jobs, cut the deficit in half or increase incomes. "This is a time not for him to start restating new promises, but to report on the promises he made," Mr. Romney said in the statement. "I think he wants a promises reset. We want a report on the promises he made."

HEADLINE: A Theme Change On Opening Night

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
East Rutherford, N.J.
Opening night in the N.F.L. needed a shiny new narrative, and the defending champion Giants were so last season.
The pregame championship celebration featured the four Super Bowl trophies the franchise has won but not nearly enough emotional carry-over from the brief ceremony to ''build a bridge'' -- as Coach Tom Coughlin has been pressing his team to do -- between last winter's six-game sprint to glory and Wednesday night's stumble in the welcome back spotlight.
In front of 82,287 fans, a MetLife Stadium Giants record, and millions of television viewers who make the N.F.L. far more of a unity monolith than either political party, the Giants' 24-17 loss to the Cowboys was a reminder of how a few variables can position a team on either side of the line separating playoff ecstasy and feckless mediocrity. 
Injuries and roster shuffling necessitated by a hard salary cap and strength of schedule can, in other words, be the difference between last season's 9-7 Giants and 8-8 Jets. But forget for a moment the inferior franchise that somehow gets more attention around New York than Coughlin's gallant two-time champions (in five seasons). Wednesday night belonged to the Cowboys, ringless since 1995 but still the headliner in the Giants' division -- not to mention America's most valuable N.F.L. property (appraised by Forbes magazine at more than $2 billion).
''It's mind-boggling to me that we have the kind of interest that we have in our game and the numbers of fans and the ability to play a game like this in prime time and have all that goes with it,'' Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, said, sounding like a convention reveler while basking in the very locker room in which he eulogized his team last season. ''It's great to be part of that and the Cowboys get to contribute to that.''
The rivalry and the drive for redemption made Dallas the logical opponent for the annual champions' unveiling, but don't think that Jones wasn't raising his hand and calling out like the late Ron Palillo's Horshack from ''Welcome Back, Kotter'' when Commissioner Roger Goodell asked for volunteers.
Given Jones's Texas-size ego, along with his Republican leanings, he no doubt preferred a ratings showdown with President Obama in the opening game's normal Thursday night slot. He settled for Wednesday night's featured speaker at the Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton, who just last spring had the ear of N.F.L. owners on a variety of issues at their meeting in Florida.
''I'm a great fan of Bill Clinton's speeches,'' Jones said. ''But we hope we had a good enough plot, story and, if you will, dynamics to have a lot of people tune in to watch this one.''
To begin with, there was tight end Jason Witten suiting up after missing most of the preseason with a lacerated spleen and perhaps moving the national anthem performer, Queen Latifah, to patriotically mimic a broken record when she reached the closing line, ''home of the brave,'' which she sang three times.
Witten caught only 2 passes for 10 yards but considered himself more of a necessary stimulus to a team trying to recover from competitive recession.
''When they saw me put the uniform on, they were getting excited and high-fiving,'' Witten said. ''That's what this game is about.''
Yes, the elements of risk and danger have helped make the N.F.L. the unchallenged dictator of all television programming, unscripted or otherwise.
For dramatic appeal, there was the Cowboy from Queens, Kevin Ogletree, who did much of the damage on the receiving end of Tony Romo's passes. Ogletree had earlier in the day kept vigil with his older brother, Calvin, the survivor of a recent shooting, and proceeded to grab 8 passes for 114 yards and 2 touchdowns, along with a 13-yard reception that allowed Dallas to kill the last two minutes.
A career backup, Ogletree grew up a Knicks fan but wore a Brooklyn Nets cap in the locker room, where he said that his brother's misfortune made him ''look in the mirror and dig deep and find out what I want to be.''
Inspiring stuff, though time will tell if Ogletree's performance foretold a Victor Cruz coming-out season or was more the result of the Giants' battered and vulnerable secondary.
Then there was Romo, the statistically endowed quarterback who had always seemed to make his most glaring mistakes in the worst possible moments but outplayed a shaky Eli Manning by throwing for 307 yards and 3 touchdowns; there was Dez Bryant, the team's deep threat, who caught 4 balls for 85 yards and afterward spoke for the first time since the Cowboys imposed stringent lifestyle rules on him (he had no comment on them).
Finally there was Jones, who pounded the gavel in the buildup to the big show by predicting that the Cowboys would perform a time-honored act with their collective feet in relation to the Giants' posterior.
Mission accomplished, Jones decided: ''I'm not so sure that this was as big a deal to the Giants as it was to us'' -- not that the Giants weren't trying but because the Cowboys, he said, had to ''make amends.''
And what did it mean, beyond the renewal of the visceral contract the league has with America to provide weekly allocations of semicontrolled violence (for now by replacement officials) while Clinton & Co. were reading from their teleprompter?
Beyond the narrow victory Nielsen reported for Clinton over the N.F.L., not much in the grand scheme of the long race ahead.
''We have seen that they can go to the end and then turn it on at the end and win the whole prize,'' Jones said of the Giants.
Bridge or no bridge, the season's narrative has only just begun.

HEADLINE: Common Threads, Uncommon Ties

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Lin Tianmiao, whose derivative, portentously surrealistic sculpture is the subject of ''Bound Unbound'' at Asia Society, is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. It was an epic journey that brought Ms. Lin to this eminence.
Born in Taiyuan, in Shanxi Province, in 1961, she is the daughter of two artists who taught her traditional crafts. Later she became a textile designer and married the video artist Wang Gongxin. Times being politically and economically perilous for artists in China in the 1980s, many left the country thinking they might never return. Ms. Lin and Mr. Wang joined an exodus to New York that included artists who are now famous, like Ai Weiwei and Xu Bing. 
Life for these exiles did not necessarily get much better in New York. There was the isolating language barrier and financial hardship. Artists of considerable reputation in China were ashamed to be reduced to earning money by drawing portraits for tourists on the streets of Manhattan.
Ms. Lin, who found employment as a designer for a textile company, made no art until near the end of her time in New York. But she soaked up ideas, information and influences by attending galleries and museums. In the 1990s it began to seem things were changing for the better back home, so Ms. Lin and her husband and others in their cohort -- Ai Weiwei, again -- went back. She settled in Beijing and only then was able to concentrate on what would become her mature art.
Ms. Lin has been mainly known for two-dimensional works: canvases with soft-focus, photographic images of her naked self, life-size and larger, and with strings and threads extending into three-dimensional space. Some are in this exhibition, but the focus is on installations that have not been widely exhibited. Conspicuously influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton, who in the 1990s made the female body and traditional female occupations hot topics, these productions are not strikingly original, and Ms. Lin's penchant for heavy-handed theatricality and labor-intensive technical refinement is off-putting.
The earliest piece in the show, ''The Proliferation of Thread Winding'' (1995), consists of a metal-framed bed with an oval cut out of its mattress and filled with 20,000 industrial-size needles. Hundreds of lengths of string radiate from the bed to Ping-Pong-size balls of string on the floor. It has an atmosphere of horror and madness that is regrettably muffled in later works.
''Bound and Unbound'' (1997) appears quiescent by comparison. On the floor is an array of more than 500 household objects, each tightly wrapped in heavy white thread. They are like ghosts of the pots, pans, toys and other items they conceal. Meanwhile, on a screen made of hanging threads, a video plays of a hand grasping a pair of shears and cutting through a curtain of threads. The gesture of cutting is ambiguous: it could be an act of liberation or of punitive violence.
Later Ms. Lin began to integrate the human figure using naked body casts of herself and others. ''Chatting'' (2004) is a gathering of six, corpulent, middle-aged women. Instead of a head each has a flat, blank, rectangular face thrust forward on the end of a curved stem. Audio speakers emit the sounds of women's voices as well as their laughter, weeping, muttering and sexual panting. These sounds have a feeling of lively reality that offsets the ponderous weirdness of the tableau.
In an exhibition catalog interview with Melissa Chiu, the museum's director and the show's curator, Ms. Lin explains that feminism is practically unheard-of in China, and that she does not consider herself a feminist artist. She is more interested in psychoanalytic depths than in women's social circumstances.
The most complete realization of that attitude is a walk-in installation called ''Mothers!!!'' (2008). It is an all-white womb of a space with walls, floor and ceiling covered by an allover patchwork of big squares of heavy silk. Within this ethereal environment, half-life-size, headless and otherwise violated and distorted female bodies appear along with hanging tangles of fabric and tumorlike balls. A diminutive body lies with its legs around a grotesquely gnarly tree like one of Hans Bellmer's sadomasochistic sex dolls. Two slender dogs standing guard over a body covered by brocade fabric is like a variation on a scene from ''Sleeping Beauty.''
''Mothers!!!'' casts a spell, but there is an oppressive airlessness about it too. You may wish for some freshening breeze from the real world. Something along those lines can be found in ''Here? Or There?,'' an installation that Ms. Lin created in collaboration with Mr. Wang in 2002. Her contribution is a set of eerie, heavily veiled figurative sculptures like mannequins modeling outfits for a Tim Burton movie. Behind these is a set of six oval screens onto which Mr. Wang's videos are projected: peaceful rural scenes intermittently interrupted by the noise and rushing imagery of big-city traffic. Like the sounds in ''Chatting'' these glimpses of reality are a relief from the overwrought Gothic romance of Ms. Lin's sculptures.
The exhibition's most recent works show Ms. Lin taking an unfortunate turn toward the decorative. ''All the Same'' (2011) has 180 of the 206 bones of a synthetic human skeleton arranged in horizontal row. Each is wrapped in colored thread, and altogether they create a continuous rainbow of color. ''More or Less the Same'' (2011) consists of 80 sculptures on shiny metal stands, each a conjunction of a synthetic human bone and a tool or other object neatly wrapped in silvery gray thread. These pieces could be the works of a clever window-display designer for a high-end department store. In them Ms. Lin risks losing touch with her own imagination of what it is to be a viscerally embodied human being.
''Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao'' continues through Jan. 27 at Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street; (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org.

HEADLINE: The Latest Attempt to Save the Euro

 BODY:
It took a while, but on Thursday Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, explained what he meant last July when he said he would do whatever it takes to save the euro. 
Largely as expected, Mr. Draghi said that the E.C.B. plans to buy government bonds issued by troubled euro zone nations, a strategy to hold down borrowing costs in countries like Spain and Italy and, in the process, buy them time to rebuild their recession-racked economies.
What wasn't fully anticipated was the bleak economic backdrop of the announcement. The E.C.B. revised its projections downward to show a contraction in the euro zone this year of 0.2 percent to 0.6 percent. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also downgraded its assessment, saying that the euro zone recession would worsen in the second half of 2012 while growth in other developed nations, including the United States, would continue to be slow.
Financial markets mostly ignored the pessimistic forecasts, instead rallying on the E.C.B.'s pledge of a new rescue effort. But the broader economic picture underscores the urgency -- and limitations -- of the latest move.
The new program is an improvement over previous central bank interventions. Notably, there will be no preset limit on the bond purchases, reducing worries that the help will not be sustained enough to make a difference. Nor will the E.C.B. insist that it be first in line to be repaid, allaying fears that private creditors would be disadvantaged by its new bond purchases.
And while the governments in trouble will have to ask for aid and, in exchange, agree to undertake economic and fiscal reforms, there is reason to hope that such reforms will not be as backbreaking -- and counterproductive -- as those imposed on Greece and other bailed-out nations. The European Central Bank put forth the new plan over the objection of the German central bank, a big champion of austerity. That could indicate that the bond purchases will not be coupled with the same kind of severe austerity that has characterized rescue efforts so far.
Despite these positive signs, the plan could still be derailed. It is structured to work in tandem with the new permanent European Union bailout fund, which has been held up until at least Wednesday, when a German court will rule on the constitutionality of Germany's participation. Given Germany's economic and political importance, a legal setback would send European officials back to the drawing board in search of solutions.
Even if the E.C.B. plan moves ahead, it cannot by itself cure what ails the euro zone. Deficit hawks have focused on the danger that a rescue by the central bank would remove the incentive for troubled nations to undertake necessary fiscal reforms. A bigger danger is that all of the euro zone's political leaders could be lulled by a successful intervention into letting up on efforts to unify the currency union for the long term, including the creation of Pan-European banking, fiscal and political unions.
The E.C.B. has taken an important step to save the euro. For the euro's survival, and for the health of the global economy, Europe's leaders now have to follow up.

HEADLINE: E.U. Investigates Chinese Solar Panel Dumping Charges

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union began a broad investigation Thursday into whether Chinese companies have exported solar power equipment for less than the cost of making it, in what amounts to history's biggest anti-dumping investigation by value.
The case covers imports from China worth &#x20ac;21 billion, or $26.5 billion, last year, a hefty 6.5 percent of all E.U. imports of Chinese goods. The European case is four or five times larger by value than a similar investigation under way in the United States, because the Union is the biggest export market for Chinese solar panels. 
The European Commission, which is leading the investigation announced Thursday, said the Union accounted for 80 percent of Chinese solar equipment sales worldwide.
After exerting heavy diplomatic pressure for the Union not to start the case, and after veiled threats to retaliate, the initial Chinese response Thursday was comparatively restrained.
Shen Danyang, the Commerce Ministry spokesman, said in a statement that China expressed ''deep regret,'' adding that the trade action would hurt not only Chinese and European industry but also the global development of clean energy.
European leaders including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, wary of retaliation by China, had urged the commission to seek a negotiated solution. China could, in response, impose duties on products it imports from Europe, including polysilicon, one of the main components of solar panels.
Opponents of the trade action warned that it could also undermine European efforts to expand sources of clean, renewable energy to meet its ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The growth of the Chinese solar equipment industry is due in large part to the billions of euros in government subsidies the Union and national governments have put in place to promote installation of solar panels for homes and businesses.
''Free trade was one of the factors that enabled the European solar industry to become a fast-growing sector,'' said Thorsten Preugschas, chief executive of Soventix, a company headquartered in Duisburg, Germany, that builds and operates solar plants worldwide. ''We call on the European Commission to bear in mind the severe damage punitive tariffs would bring to the whole European photovoltaic sector.''
The scope of the European investigation is unusually broad, applying not only to fully assembled solar panels but also to imports of key components like solar cells and solar wafers. If the commission were to apply punitive tariffs on such a broad range of imports, Chinese companies could not avoid them by shipping components to Europe and assembling them into finished panels there.
The commission could impose within nine months so-called provisional duties usually lasting up to six months. Within 15 months, the commission must determine whether to impose so-called definitive measures, or duties lasting up to five years.
The next steps for the European investigators involve sending lengthy questionnaires to producers in Europe and China, and visiting their factories, to gather evidence firsthand.
The case could grow more complicated if, as expected, a coalition of companies assembled by SolarWorld of Germany, which brought the initial complaint to the commission, files a second complaint claiming that the Chinese government illegally subsidizes its solar industry.
On Thursday, that coalition, called EU ProSun, said China had been dumping solar panels on the European market for two years, contributing to the bankruptcy of 20 European manufacturers this year alone.
Milan Nitzschke, the president of EU ProSun and a vice president of SolarWorld, said that prices of Chinese solar equipment sold in Europe would have been 60 percent to 90 percent higher last year had the products not been dumped on the market.
Workers were being laid off ''day by day, week by week,'' said Paolo Gianese, the secretary general of the Industrie Fotovoltaiche Italiane, an Italian industry group. ''We are still in time to save our industry. But you have to act quickly.''
Another German company, Q-Cells, once the biggest maker of solar power cells, became the most prominent European victim of an increasingly competitive market when it filed for insolvency in April.
The E.U. trade case against Chinese solar panels differs from the American case in several ways. The European case is, at least for now, limited to allegations of dumping, not improper government subsidies. But the European case is broader than the U.S. action, which covers solar panels for which either the cell was made in China or cells were assembled into the finished panel in China.
The U.S. Commerce Department in May imposed preliminary anti-dumping tariffs of at least 31 percent on Chinese solar panels, in addition to preliminary anti-subsidy tariffs of 2.9 percent to 4.73 percent that were imposed in March.
The Chinese government has responded by accusing American producers of polysilicon, the main material used in solar panels, of engaging in unfair trade practices and has threatened steep tariffs on the companies.
But Mr. Nitzschke, of EU ProSun, said China would be reluctant to impose steep tariffs on imports of polysilicon from the United States and Europe, which are among the world's largest producers. Ultimately, the brunt of those tariffs would be paid by the Chinese manufacturers that import polysilicon and are already struggling, he said.
Alan Wolff, a trade official in the administrations of three former U.S. presidents and now a prominent trade lawyer, said the Union's anti-dumping case was the world's largest ever, even adjusting for inflation.
Two other trade cases that are not anti-dumping cases may have been larger, depending on how the affected trade is measured and what inflation adjustment is used. Those are a long-running World Trade Organization case involving Airbus and Boeing aircraft, and a so-called ''safeguards'' case in the United States in 1980 against cars from Japan.
But when it comes to anti-dumping cases, nothing matches the case that the Union just filed against Chinese solar companies, said Mr. Wolff, now a senior lawyer in the Washington office of McKenna, Long and Aldridge.
Keith Bradsher reported from Chengdu, China.

HEADLINE: Buoyed by European Commitment to Buy Debt, Markets Soar to a Four-Year High

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Decisive moves by the head of the European Central Bank to preserve the euro zone pushed the benchmark American stock index to a four-year high and fueled hopes that the rally would have staying power.
The markets have greeted several previous efforts to solve Europe's economic woes with euphoria, only to quickly deflate. While there could be some setbacks along the way this time, too, investors suggested that the enthusiasm may not be fleeting. They showed a willingness to dive back into stocks and risky Spanish and Italian bonds and sold safer assets like Treasury bonds. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged nearly 2 percent, surpassing the peak reached earlier this year and hitting a level last seen in January 2008, before the financial crisis. The Nasdaq composite index rose to its highest point since 2000.
Stocks in the United States were also helped by promising data about the American unemployment picture ahead of Friday's highly anticipated jobs report.
A weak employment number could easily derail investor optimism. But on Thursday, investors were captivated by the announcement by the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, that he was ready to start a bond-buying program that would provide what he said was a ''fully effective backstop'' for the struggling euro. 
''The central bank is clearly prepared to tackle the problem head-on,'' said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''I think people will grow more encouraged that we are finally seeing the light at the end of this tunnel.''
The markets have been rallying since Mr. Draghi announced his intention in late July to do ''whatever it takes'' to save the euro zone. Since then, the euro zone's blue-chip index, the Euro Stoxx 50, has risen nearly 10 percent, bringing it up over 20 percent for the summer. The index leapt 3.4 percent on Thursday.
The plan Mr. Draghi announced was not much different from what investors had been expecting. But the full details he provided displayed the breadth of measures he was ready to take.
''It is sufficient to make people think that the E.C.B. has the tools and the willingness to keep all the balls in the air until the political leaders manage to arrive at an agreement,'' said Michael Hood, a market strategy for JPMorgan Chase's asset management division.
Several hurdles, however, could stop the rally in its tracks. Most immediately, a German court is set to rule next week on the constitutionality of the European stability fund that Mr. Draghi built his own strategy around.
If the fund passes muster, Spain and other countries that want to take part will have to agree to take steps to rein in their budget deficits for the E.C.B. to agree to buy their short-term debt in unlimited amounts in the secondary market.
Beyond all of those short-term obstacles, it is not clear that the bond-buying program will help ease basic economicweakness in several Southern European countries.
''This is a good short-term step, but it's not clear that the ultimate results that people want are deliverable by the E.C.B.,'' said Carl Weinberg, the founder of High Frequency Economics.
Spain and Italy are the most likely candidates for the new strategy, and the news helped push down the interest rates on short-dated Spanish and Italian bonds. The yield on the two-year Spanish bond, which rose to nearly 6.5 percent earlier this summer, fell to 2.78 percent, from 2.97 percent.
But the broader optimism in the market was apparent in that investors also bought the longer-term bonds issued by Spain and Italy, pushing the yield on the 30-year Spanish bond down to 6.60 percent from 6.99. Because the E.C.B. will not be targeting these bonds, they are likely to gain in value only if investors gain faith in the economic prospects in those countries.
Mr. Baumohl and other optimists said the central bank program could relieve the pressure on Europe's banks and free them up to make loans that will support economic growth.
''In the final analysis, what the governments and the institutions have to do is convince the private capital markets that it is safe to invest in Europe,'' Mr. Baumohl said.
Leading stock indexes were up 3 percent in France and Germany, while Spain's stock market leapt 5 percent.
If Europe does become less of a concern, it will allow the attention to shift more fully to the American economy. The economy showed signs of weakening earlier this summer, but several recent reports have suggested that it may be strengthening.
On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management said that nonmanufacturing sectors grew faster in August than in July.
Ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report, the Labor Department said Thursday that the number of people filing for jobless benefits last week fell 12,000 from the week before. The payroll company Automatic Data Processing announced that private companies added 201,000 jobs in August.
The employment numbers coming Friday are expected to influence the Federal Open Market Committee when it meets next week. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said last week that more monetary stimulus might be necessary. Investors have been betting on this, but improving economic data could dissuade the Fed from more action.
The S.& P. 500 rose 2 percent, or 28.68 points, to 1,432.12. The last time it was that high was on Jan. 3, 2008. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.9 percent, or 244.52 to 13,292.00, a level last reached in December 2007. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 2.2 percent, or 66.55 points, to 3,135.81.
Interest rates were higher for a third straight session. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 24/32, to 99 17/32, and the yield rose to 1.68 percent from 1.60 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Art Modell, Influential N.F.L. Owner But Not Always Beloved One, Dies at 87

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Art Modell, who helped make professional football more popular than baseball and rich beyond its wildest dreams but who broke Cleveland's heart by killing his money-losing team, the Browns, to give birth to the Baltimore Ravens, died on Thursday in Baltimore. He was 87.
The death, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, was announced on the Ravens' Web site.
Mr. Modell, who lived in Cockeysville, Md., had a history of coronary problems. In a postwar era when pro football was extending its franchises across America and its reach into the fantasies of millions of armchair quarterbacks, Mr. Modell was the hands-on owner of the Browns from 1961 to 1995 and of the Ravens from 1996 to 2003.
He was also a behind-the-scenes visionary. 
For 31 years, from 1962 to 1993, he represented National Football League owners in negotiations with television networks that generated $8.4 billion for the league and gave fans at home a coast-to-coast succession of games, turning Sunday afternoons, Monday nights and eventually Sunday nights into lost weekends for the most ardent fans. An innovative, relentless promoter, Mr. Modell even toyed with Friday night football.
''We made the announcement,'' he recalled, referring to the league, ''and within 72 hours Congress passed a law prohibiting Friday night games until the high school and college seasons ended.''
But Mr. Modell supported a succession of winning ideas -- the expansion of the N.F.L. into many cities; the 1970 merger of the American Football League and the National Football League into competing N.F.L. conferences; preseason games that whetted fans' appetites and brought in more television money; and revenue-sharing plans that balanced risks among the owners, whom he called partners. They elected him president in 1967-69, and he negotiated the league's first collective bargaining agreement with the players, in 1968.
In 1962, he started preseason doubleheaders -- back-to-back exhibition games on a Saturday before the season opener. In 1970, he volunteered his Browns for another experiment: hosting the first nationally televised Monday night football game. They beat the Jets, and another profit center was born.
For nearly 35 years, Cleveland idolized him. His team's overall record was quite good, sprinkled with playoff appearances. The team won only one championship, in 1964. But Browns games sold out regularly and families built traditions around them. He raised money for charities. He won ''Pride of Cleveland'' and ''Super Citizen'' awards, and was elected to the boards of corporations and universities.
But all that came crashing down in 1995 when Mr. Modell announced that, having lost $21 million in the previous two seasons, he would move the Browns to Baltimore for 1996.
Wounded Cleveland shrieked betrayal. There were street protests, an avalanche of hate mail and death threats against Mr. Modell. Sportswriters reviled him. At the final home game, beer bottles and seats torn from their moorings rained down on the field.
He was likened to Walter O'Malley, who moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. (When LeBron James quit the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in 2010, polls showed that the lingering hostility to Mr. Modell was greater.) Fans, advertisers and the city filed lawsuits, arguing futilely that leases and contracts required the Browns to stay in Cleveland.
Mr. Modell left town and never went back, not even when his Baltimore team played there annually or when his old friend the Hall of Fame Browns kicker Lou Groza died in 2000. For the rest of his life Mr. Modell was persona non grata in Cleveland. Baltimore, which had lost its Colts to Indianapolis in 1984 and was hungry for a new team, welcomed him with a free stadium for 1996 and 1997, a new stadium in 1998 and lucrative concessions.
For three years, pro football vanished from Cleveland. But under an N.F.L. agreement, the Browns' name, colors and franchise records were retained in the city, where a new team, called the ''reactivated'' Browns, began playing in 1999.
Mr. Modell kept his team, which was designated an expansion franchise, the Baltimore Ravens. After four poor seasons, it won Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, defeating the Giants. It was the high point of Mr. Modell's career. He sold the team to Steve Bisciotti, completing the $600 million transaction after the 2003 season.
''I've done many deals and made millions and lost millions, but this is the first time in my life I've been economically free,'' Mr. Modell told The New York Times. ''I'm out of the debt and out of that pressure. It's something every man works for, and I worked 43 years for it, to build that for my family.''
Arthur Bertram Modell was born in Brooklyn on June 23, 1925, one of three children of George L. and Kitty Maizman Modell. Arthur's father, a wine sales manager, went bankrupt in 1929 and died when the boy was 14. He dropped out of New Utrecht High School and worked as a railroad oiler to help support his mother and two sisters. In 1943, he enlisted in the Army Air Forces and fought in World War II.
He joined ABC as a producer in 1948 and over the next six years helped to provide the young television network with its first regular daytime programming. In 1954, he joined the New York advertising firm L. H. Hartman, where he specialized in liquor ads for television.
With $250,000 of his own money and loans from banks and friends, he bought the Browns for $4 million in 1961. The team, founded in 1946 in the All-American Football Conference, had joined the N.F.L. in a 1950 league merger. When Mr. Modell took over, there were only 13 N.F.L. teams, but his had Jim Brown, the league's leading rusher, and the renowned coach Paul Brown, who had won seven championships with his namesake team.
Unlike previous owners, Mr. Modell actively managed the Browns, sometimes deciding which players to draft, though he said he did not dictate to coaches on the field. Yet frictions developed, and in 1963 he fired Paul Brown and named Blanton Collier as coach. The controversial change seemed justified a year later when the Browns won the N.F.L. championship. But Modell teams won no more titles in Cleveland.
By 1995, the 49-year-old Browns had hit a rough patch. Player costs and deficits had soared. In six years the team had lost 57 games. Its home field was a ramshackle stadium built in 1931. Mr. Modell did not beg Cleveland for a new stadium, like those being built elsewhere in the league. Instead, he secretly struck a better deal in Baltimore. His team played in Memorial Stadium for two years, then moved into a new stadium adjacent to Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
Heart problems plagued him over the years. In 1983 he had a heart attack and underwent a quadruple bypass operation; in 1990 he had double bypass surgery; and in 2002 he suffered a heart attack and a stroke.
In 1969, Mr. Modell married Patricia Breslin, a television actress, who died last October. He adopted her two children by a previous marriage, David and John, who survive him, as do six grandchildren, the Ravens said.
Mr. Modell was nominated repeatedly for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but was not elected. ''The decision Modell made to move the team has unfortunately overshadowed more than three decades of outstanding service to pro football,'' Mike Freeman wrote in a 1999 commentary in The New York Times. ''Few owners in league history have contributed as much as Modell.''

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'The Amazing Spider-Man' (PG-13, 2:16) Five years after Sam Rami directed his third ''Spider-Man'' installment, Marc Webb returns this lucrative franchise to its origins with Andrew Garfield as the spider-teenager and Emma Stone as the girl. Painless but unnecessary. (Dargis) 
&#x2605; 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' (PG-13, 1:33) A blast of joyful, chaotic emotion from the bayou, Benh Zeitlin's dazzling film is a homegrown magic-realist fable of defiance in the face of hardship. A community in a stretch of coastal Louisiana called the Bathtub is menaced by storms and government benevolence. Their ordeal is narrated by a young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis ), who lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), and who belongs in the tradition of Huck Finn, Scout Finch, Eloise and other indomitable American child heroes. (A. O. Scott)
'Beloved' (No rating, 2:15, in French) Christophe Honoré's musical melodrama follows, over four decades, the complicated love lives of Madeleine (Ludivine Sagnier in the 1960s and '70s, Catherine Deneuve later) and her daughter, Vera (Chiara Mastroianni). Alex Beaupain's clever pop songs offer more commentary than emotion, but the long, meandering story is full of pathos, comedy and surprise. (Scott)
'The Bourne Legacy' (PG-13, 2:05) Less a thrilling franchise reboot than a solid salvage mission, the fourth installment of the ''Bourne'' spy series replaces Matt Damon with a sympathetic Jeremy Renner, who handles the action persuasively even if the fight sequences lack a sense of regret or even sorrow. As viewers are whisked from location to location, it feels as if the director, Tony Gilroy, is trying too hard to match the accelerated tempo of the previous films. (Dargis)
'Brave' (PG, 1:33) After 17 years of feature filmmaking, Pixar has -- ta-da! -- its first female protagonist, Merida, a brave, ginger-mopped princess who wants to chart her own fate. The animation, as might be expected, is beautiful, but the story is filled with dreary gender clichés. Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman directed and helped write the script. (Dargis)
'The Bullet Vanishes' (No rating, 1:48, in Mandarin) This period policier from China -- a 1930s buddy movie -- offers forensic clues, rich production values, a droll script and an easygoing chemistry between its leads (Nicholas Tse and Lau Ching-wan). Dig deeply enough and you may find fleeting references to an uncompassionate government. But enjoy it most as an agreeable entertainment. (Andy Webster)
'The Campaign' (R, 1:25) Two nincompoops run against each other for a seat in Congress. It's not a documentary, but a silly, not very outrageous comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. (Scott)
'Celeste and Jesse Forever' (R, 1:31) This wistful romantic comedy about love, marriage and never wanting to say you're sorry stars the appealing Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg as a couple who've split up without moving on or out. Written by Ms. Jones and Will McCormack, it was directed by Lee Toland Krieger. (Dargis)
'Chicken With Plums' (PG-13, 1:33, in French) Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud follow ''Persepolis,'' their animated adaptation of Ms. Satrapi's autobiographical graphic novel, with a live-action rendering of a piece of her family's history. Mathieu Amalric plays Nasser Ali, a melancholy violinist in mid-20th-century Tehran whose romantic and artistic torment fuels an oddly gentle and contemplative melodrama. The large French-speaking cast includes Maria de Medeiros as Nasser's wife and Golshifteh Farahani as the great lost love of his youth. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Compliance' (R, 1:30) Raising troubling questions about the influence of class and education on our response to authority, Craig Zobel's squirmy psychological horror movie, based on a series of hoaxes at fast-food restaurants nationwide, is a slow-motion punch to the groin. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Cosmopolis' (R, 1:48) David Cronenberg directs this cold, funny adaptation of the 2003 Don DeLillo novel starring Robert Pattinson as a zomboid billionaire, one of the limo riding masters of the universe who, over the course of a long day and night, loses a great deal and, by doing so, becomes human. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
'Ek Tha Tiger' (No rating, 2:13, in Hindi) This Bollywood romance dressed up in espionage clothes has a ''my enemy, myself'' theme that is too tepid to resonate. Starring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif, the movie feels most engaged during its glass-shattering, rooftop-hopping action sequences. (Rachel Saltz)
'The Expendables 2' (R, 1:43) Sylvester Stallone returns with his band of aging action stars and a ridiculous amount of ammunition and explosives, bent on avenging a comrade's death and keeping some plutonium out of evil hands. A brief appearance by Chuck Norris provides the best moment of self-parody in a movie that could have used a few more of them. (Neil Genzlinger)
'For a Good Time, Call ...' (R, 1:26) This potty-mouthed comedy about two Manhattan women who establish a successful phone-sex business to pay the rent doesn't aspire to be more than a broad, sloppy, old-fashioned sitcom with a sexy gimmick, but the bogus dirty talk is often very funny. (Stephen Holden)
'Hit & Run' (R, 1:40) In this weightless, silly car chase movie, Dax Shepard brings some charm to his role of a sweet-natured, shady goofball in the witness protection program. (Holden)
'Hope Springs' (PG-13, 1:32) While this film about a longtime marriage that's gone dry has modest charms to go with its well-matched and practiced pair of wily scene stealers -- Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones working on screen together for the first time -- the industry will have to do better if it wants to persuade boomers that there's something for them at the local multiplex other than cartoons and clichés. (Dargis)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'Lawless' (R, 1:55) A blizzard of gunfire and a riot of Southern accents animate this meandering tale of violent bootleggers in Depression-era Virginia. Tom Hardy croaks like a bullfrog, Shia LaBeouf chatters like a chipmunk and Jessica Chastain pours coffee. (Scott)
'Little White Lies' (No rating, 2:34, in French) Guillaume Canet's disappointing follow-up to his hit noir thriller, ''Tell No One,'' is a two-and-a-half-hour Gallic homage to ''The Big Chill'' and a protracted scolding to a group of self-absorbed overgrown yuppies. The strong ensemble cast includes François Cluzet, Jean Dujardin and Marion Cotillard. (Holden)
'Little Birds' (R, 1:34) Juno Temple and Kay Panabaker play teenage friends living in dysfunctional households on the picturesquely bleak shores of Southern California's Salton Sea in Elgin James's moody, arrestingly shot debut feature. (Scott)
'Marvel's The Avengers' (PG-13, 2:22) Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and a few other mighty Marvel superheroes team up under the supervision of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in this franchise juggernaut, directed by Joss Whedon. The bantering and riffing among the characters provides some fun, but there is not much heart or imagination in the story or the action sequences. Which seems to satisfy the fans just fine. (Scott)
'The Matchmaker' (No rating, 1:52, in Hebrew) In Avi Nesher's film, which won several awards in Israel, a teenager's coming-of-age story of his experience working for a marital maven helps express the hopes and fears of a country awash in unsettling history. (Nicolas Rapold)
&#x2605; 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
'The Odd Life of Timothy Green' (PG, 1:45) In this baffling exercise in maudlin, whimsical surrealism, directed by Peter Hedges, a childless couple (Jennifer Garner and a miserable-looking Joel Edgerton) are visited by a magic plant in the shape of a 10-year-old boy (CJ Adams). Tears are shed and lessons are learned, the main one being that this would have worked better as a horror movie. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'ParaNorman' (PG, 1:33) This beautiful-looking, charmingly heartfelt 3-D stop-motion animation -- from the studio that produced ''Coraline'' -- centers on an 11-year-old boy who can see ghosts and, with frights and laughter, battles a spirit. Directed by Sam Fell and the movie's screenwriter, Chris Butler. (Dargis)
'The Possession' (PG-13, 1:32) Perched somewhere between ''The Exorcist'' and ''The Unborn,'' this eerily enjoyable tale from the Danish director Ole Bornedal gives a malevolent box to a troubled young girl, throws in the Hasidic rap artist Matisyahu, and stands back. (Catsoulis)
&#x2605; 'Premium Rush' (PG-13, 1:31) The director David Koepp provides about all the late summer air-conditioned relief you could hope for in this buoyant dumb-fun, ticking-clock thriller about a bicycle messenger (the dependably appealing Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has to get from here to there without being taken out by cars or a bad cop (a terrific Michael Shannon). (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Queen of Versailles' (PG, 1:40) Lauren Greenfield's documentary follows the shifting fortunes of David and Jackie Siegel, a wealthy Florida couple who dreamed of building the biggest house in America. The movie, which starts out like smirky reality television, turns into something darker and more complex as economic troubles take a toll on the Siegels and the audience becomes better acquainted with them. It's like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our new gilded age. (Scott)
'Red Hook Summer' (R, 2:01) Spike Lee's celebration of African-American resilience in a struggling Brooklyn neighborhood is messy, meandering and bluntly polemical. But it has one crucial element: raw vitality. (Holden)
'Robot & Frank' (PG-13, 1:30) Jake Schreier directed, from a script by Christopher D. Ford, this eager-to-please story set in the near future about an elderly gent (Frank Langella), his robot (voiced by Peter Sarsgaard) and some awkwardly managed truths about old age. Susan Sarandon also stars. (Dargis)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Side by Side' (No rating, 1:39) This timely, fascinating documentary offers a tour -- guided by the affable and thoughtful Keanu Reeves -- of the fast-changing world of digital filmmaking. Informative interviews with prominent directors, cinematographers and editors and glimpses of the latest gadgetry make it a must-see for movie geeks. (Scott)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
'Sparkle' (PG-13, 1:56) It is impossible to watch this ramshackle remake of a 1976 movie and not relate its story to the life of Whitney Houston, who portrays the strict church-lady mother of an aspiring singer in late-1960s Detroit. (Holden)
'Step Up Revolution' (PG-13, 1:39) How to stop a greedy developer from gutting a Miami neighborhood? The power of dance, of course. The fourth film in the ''Step Up'' franchise has some dandy flash-mob-style dance numbers, though like its predecessors it is burdened by a predictable plot and unintentionally laughable dialogue. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voiceover skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg), and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'To Rome With Love' (R, 1:52) Woody Allen's latest is a mild, silly collection of tales set in the Italian capital, where love is complicated and characters -- both Italian and American -- are baffled, neurotic and always articulate. Mr. Allen plays a semi-retired opera promoter, while Jesse Eisenberg plays the younger Woody Allen type, torn between loyalty to his sensible girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) and her wayward, needy friend (Ellen Page). Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz and Roberto Benigni also contribute to this frothy, airy romp through some of Mr. Allen's favorite themes. (Scott)
'Total Recall' (PG-13, 1:58) Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel star in this chaotic and thoroughly unmemorable science-fiction action movie, loosely remade from a 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle and even more loosely based on a story by Philip K. Dick. (Scott)
'2016: Obama's America' (PG, 1:33) Dinesh D'Souza -- the author of the best seller ''The Roots of Obama's Rage'' and a former American Enterprise Institute fellow -- is the host and narrator of this strident documentary, in which Mr. D'Souza enlists a host of interviewees who are almost entirely critical of the president. The film is unlikely to convert supporters of President Obama to an opposite view. (Webster)
'2 Days in New York' (R, 1:36) In this sequel to ''2 Days in Paris,'' Julie Delpy, who wrote and directed, reprises the role of Marion, a French photographer now living with Mingus (Chris Rock), a journalist and radio host. Their hectic, happy bohemian household is thrown into chaos by the arrival of Marion's father (Ms. Delpy's father, Albert), her sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) and Rose's boyfriend, Manu (Alexandre Nahon). The movie is spirited and sometimes hilarious, but turns sloppy and strained when it reaches for deeper emotional insights into its nutty characters. (Scott)
'The Watch' (R, 1:41) Half unfunny potty-mouthed buddy comedy, half spoof of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' this comic washout starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn is larded with crude phallic jokes. (Holden)
Film Series
Capturing the Marvelous: Ukrainian Poetic Cinema (Friday through Thursday) With its penchant for folkloric subjects and extravagant stylistics, Ukrainian cinema managed to maintain much of its identity through the years of Soviet domination, as this brief retrospective suggests. The program includes two films by the father of Ukrainian cinema, Aleksandr Dovzhenko -- the 1927 ''Zvenigora'' (Saturday at 4:30 p.m.) and the 1930 ''Earth'' (Sunday at 4:30 p.m.) -- whose influence is obvious on Sergei Parajanov, whose ''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors,'' perhaps the most celebrated Ukrainian film, will be shown at various times from Friday through Wednesday. And Parajanov left his mark on his cameraman, Yuri Illienko, whose experimental 1965 feature, ''A Spring for the Thirsty,'' screens on Friday at 8:30 p.m. and Monday at 4 p.m. Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.org; $13. (Dave Kehr)
From the Pen of ... (Friday through Thursday) This week this series devoted to celebrating the art of the screenwriter features films based on the work of Elmore Leonard (John Sturges's ''Joe Kidd'' and Richard Fleischer's ''Mr. Majestyk,'' both screening on Friday and Tuesday), Don Carpenter (Daryl Duke's ''Payday'' on Saturday), John Fante (Edward Dmytryk's ''Walk on the Wild Side'' on Sunday and Wednesday), and Joan Didion (Jerry Schatzberg's ''Panic in Needle Park'' on Sunday and Thursday), who wrote the screenplay for that film with John Gregory Dunne.

See It Big (Friday through Sunday) New video restorations of Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 feature, ''The Last Picture Show'' (Friday through Sunday at 7 p.m.), and William Wyler's 1959 whopper, ''Ben-Hur'' (Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m.), are featured this weekend in this series of older films presented on a luxuriantly large screen.

'Swoon' (Thursday) There will be a 20th-anniversary screening of Tom Kalin's 1992 independent feature, one of the founding films -- with Gregg Araki's ''Living End'' and Todd Haynes's ''Poison'' -- in a movement that the critic B. Ruby Rich promptly called New Queer Cinema. A treatment of the Leopold and Loeb murder case, Mr. Kalin's black-and-white film, filled with deliberately anachronistic details, was the first to deal explicitly with the killers' homosexuality, and does so in ways that escape any reductive political reading. The 7:30 p.m. screening will be preceded, at 6:30 p.m., by a pair of short films by Mr. Kalin. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $12. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: Nomura Seeks to Save $1 Billion By Scaling Back Mainly in Europe

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
8:38 p.m. | Updated
TOKYO - Nomura Holdings, the scandal-hit Japanese investment bank, outlined a broad reorganization plan on Thursday that would pare back its business to a shadow of what it held after acquiring parts of Lehman Brothers in 2008. 
Most of the $1 billion in cuts, initially announced last week, will be made abroad. They are driven by a grim outlook for the global economy, Koji Nagai, Nomura's new chief executive, told analysts and investors at the company's headquarters in Tokyo.
Nomura's operations in Europe, which will account for 45 percent of the cost savings, and the Americas, which will account for 21 percent, will take the brunt of the cutbacks, the bank said.
Though Mr. Nagai declined to specify the number of jobs Nomura would eliminate, the company said it would shave $450 million from personnel expenses. Other cuts would come from savings made by optimizing spending on information technology, the bank said.
"We will take stock of the company from the roots upward and rebuild," Mr. Nagai said.
It has been a swift and striking fall for Nomura. For a nominal sum, it bought the Asian and European operations of Lehman Brothers, the American brokerage firm that failed in 2008, and set out to build a global investment franchise.
But that acquisition saddled Nomura with huge personnel costs, and the task of marrying two vastly different corporate cultures undermined efforts to capitalize on Lehman's talent pool.
Many top Lehman executives left Nomura, and it was forced to cut costs and try to end the hemorrhaging of money in its wholesale operations, which include equities, fixed income and investment banking. Nomura's foreign operations have lost money for nine consecutive quarters.
One of the last Lehman executives at Nomura, William Vereker, stepped down this week as joint head of investment banking. He is widely expected to leave the company soon.
Compounding the problems, an insider trading scandal in Japan this year led Nomura to replace its chief executive, Kenichi Watanabe, who had handled the bank's takeover of Lehman and had pushed for global expansion. His successor, Mr. Nagai, had been head of the Japanese domestic securities unit.
Under Mr. Nagai, the bank is narrowing its global aspirations and will focus closer to home in Asia, where it can better leverage its dominant position in Japan, senior executives said.
"When the global economy comes back, the recovery will start in Asia," Atsushi Yoshikawa, Nomura's new chief operations officer, said, "so we place great weight on Asia. But we have no plans to make aggressive investments like the kind we've made in America over the past three years. We intend to make good with what we have."
The latest retrenchment comes on top of a $1.2 billion cost-cutting Nomura struggled through last year. That effort eliminated 1,000 jobs.
The company plans to scrutinize sectors or businesses that perform poorly for two years in a row. Nomura's electronic brokerage unit Instinet, which it bought in 2006, will handle most equities execution outside Japan.
Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Previews and Openings
'The Anderson Twins Play the Fabulous Dorseys!' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Sept. 16) Pete and Will Anderson have each logged time with some of the city's elite jazz and big-band orchestras. Now the two team up, sextet in tow, to bring to life another pair of band-leading brothers: Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. Expect sibling rivalry, clips of the Dorseys' 1947 biopic and the tunes that helped introduce to the world the likes of Bing Crosby and Glenn Miller. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Eric Grode) 
'Chaplin: The Musical' (in previews; opens on Monday) Silent film has spawned its share of enticing musical theater, including ''Singin' in the Rain,'' ''Mack and Mabel'' and Jerome Robbins's unforgettable Keystone Cops ballet for ''High Button Shoes.'' Now it's the Little Tramp's turn. After being picked to step into Chaplin's oversize shoes for the show's premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, Rob McClure, who starred in ''Avenue Q,'' reprises his role as the title character. Christopher Curtis makes his Broadway debut as composer, lyricist and -- with the veteran Thomas Meehan (''Annie,'' ''The Producers'') -- bookwriter. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Detroit' (in previews; opens on Sept. 18) Lisa D'Amour's savage comedy (a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize) about the uneasy friendship between two couples just barely on opposite sides of the have-and-have-not divide had been rumored for Broadway following acclaimed runs in Chicago and London. (After seeing the play in Chicago, Charles Isherwood hailed Ms. D'Amour as ''a potentially important new voice.'') Instead it opens Playwright Horizons' new season in a new production featuring Amy Ryan and David Schwimmer as the suburban couple slipping down the socioeconomic ladder. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'An Enemy of the People' (in previews; opens on Sept. 27) For the last 60 years, Henrik Ibsen's one-man-against-the-world social drama has had a perfectly good English-language adaptation by someone who knew a thing or two about standing on principle: Arthur Miller. Now Doug Hughes directs a new adaptation of the 1882 classic by the rising British playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz; Mr. Hughes's cast is led by Richard Thomas and, as the medical officer in possession of some inconvenient truth, Boyd Gaines. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, mtc-nyc.org, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'The Eyes of Others' (in previews; opens on Saturday) What's this? No Bulgarian play has ever received a major New York production? That's what the New Ohio Theater claims, and they're looking to rectify that with this world premiere by Ivan Dimitrov. This absurdist piece, which follows the one-upmanship between two office drones, looks to mesh Vaclav Havel-style paranoia with the deadpan mirth of ''The Office.'' New Ohio Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444, newohiotheatre.org. (Grode)
'Grace' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Oct. 4) Craig Wright has written Michael Shannon everything from comic tours de force (''Mistakes Were Made'') to downbeat ensemble dramas (''Lady''). Where will Mr. Wright's latest play, about a young couple's benighted plan to open a chain of Bible-themed motels, fall on that continuum? Depending on their ages, audiences may be too busy basking in the presence of either Paul Rudd or Ed Asner to notice. Directed by Dexter Bullard (''Bug,'' ''Killer Joe''). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' (in previews; opens on Sept. 20) For many, the main draw for this new comedy will be the American stage debut of Jake Gyllenhaal. But Nick Payne's plays have been generating a wave of buzz in London -- his ''Constellations'' received rapturous notices earlier this year -- and among Mr. Gyllenhaal's co-stars in this one is the always welcome Brian F. O'Byrne (''Doubt,'' ''The Coast of Utopia''). It's about an overweight teenager whose troubles at school come to a head when her drifter uncle shows up for a visit. Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Grode)
'Job' (in previews; opens on Sept. 19) Thomas Bradshaw's unsparing, envelope-pushing dramas (''Burning,'' ''Southern Promises'') rely on some pretty game actors, and this time Mr. Bradshaw has found a semi-captive talent pool in the Bats, the resident acting company of the Flea Theater. There's also his new antagonist: God. That's right, this is a new adaptation of the biblical book of Job. Brace yourselves, Bats. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Grode)
'Marry Me a Little' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Oct. 2) Back in 1980 this two-character revue served as an introduction to a batch of lesser-known Stephen Sondheim songs. Now that several of them have entered the mainstream (the title song is now a permanent addition to ''Company''), the time is right for the Keen Company to revive it. True to form, two Sondheim compositions will be heard for the first time: a discard from ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and a song written for the unproduced film version of ''Into the Woods.'' Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Mary Broome' (in previews; opens on Monday) It's been more than 90 years since New York has seen this 1911 Allan Monkhouse comedy about a fateful dalliance between a wealthy young rotter and the family's live-in housemaid. The young cad has been described as the bastard forebear of the Angry Young Men that engulfed the London stage 50 years later; New York audiences can judge for themselves, courtesy of the Mint Theater's latest excavation. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)
'Moo' (performances start on Saturday) More Howard Zinn than Barnum & Bailey, the one-ring traveling circus known as Circus Amok has been juggling politics and pratfalls for more than 20 years. It brings its latest creation, in which not even the big top is immune to Great Recession-era money troubles, to four of the five boroughs, complete with tightrope walkers, clowns and acrobats to go with its agitprop. At various locations; a full schedule is at circusamok.org. (Grode)
'Open Up, Hadrian' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Thursday) What do you put in a 20,000-square-foot warehouse space in Sunset Park, Brooklyn? An ''immersive promenade'' about the first celebrity gay couple, of course. Javierantonio González's script looks back to the second century, when the title character was the emperor of Rome. And, yes, Hadrian's wall will make an appearance. Will 20,000 square feet be enough? Magic Futurebox, 55 33rd Street, fourth floor, Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn, magicfuturebox.com. (Grode)
'Red Dog Howls' (in previews; opens on Sept. 24) What an odd career Alexander Dinelaris has cobbled for himself: spiky romantic dramas (''Still Life''), campy musicals (''Zanna Don't!'') and now a generation-hopping exploration of the Armenian genocide. Joining him this time are the inventive director Ken Rus Schmoll and Kathleen Chalfant, whose own career choices have made her the go-to actress for socially conscious drama (''Wit,'' ''Guantánamo''). As for Mr. Dinelaris? It's off to London to work on the stage adaptation of the Kevin Costner-Whitney Houston opus ''The Bodyguard.'' New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Red-Handed Otter' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Sept. 20) For many theatergoers, Ethan Lipton burst onto the scene in March with his Obie Award-winning cycle of economic woes, ''No Place to Go.'' But he has been plugging away as a gimlet-eyed playwright for years, and he follows last spring's ''Luther'' with this offbeat comedy for Playwrights Realm about a dead house cat and the upheaval it causes among a group of overnight security guards. Quincy Tyler Bernstine (''Ruined'') and Matthew Maher (Soho Rep's ''Uncle Vanya'') are part of the five-member cast. Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 532-3101, redhandedotter.com. (Grode)
'Strange Tales of Liaozhai' (in previews; opens on Sunday) The title sounds accurate, seeing as one of the two 18th-century Chinese folk tales on display involves magic pigeons and the whole thing is being conjured by the puppeteer Hanne Tierney and her counterweight system of more than 100 strings. And that's not even taking into consideration the original score, written for toy pianos, double bass and ''self-constructed Asian Space Plates.'' Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Grode)
'Through the Yellow Hour' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Sept. 27) In his continuing attempt to make Joyce Carol Oates look like a slacker and a cockeyed optimist, the ever-present Adam Rapp has written and directed another dystopian drama. Last seen at the Rattlestick inflicting the bubonic plague and cholera on a single character (in ''The Hallway Trilogy''), Mr. Rapp this time focuses on a woman struggling to stay alive after a cataclysmic attack on the United States. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, rattlestick.org. (Grode)
'The Train Driver' (in previews; opens on Monday) The Signature Theater's Athol Fugard season ends the way it began: with Mr. Fugard himself directing a story about the tensions and commonalities between a white man and a black man. First came his 1961 masterwork ''Blood Knot,'' and now it moves a half-century forward to Mr. Fugard's most recent play, in which the title character (Ritchie Coster) enlists the help of a gravedigger (Leon Addison Brown) to help expunge his guilt over a tragedy. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'The Why Overhead' (in previews; opens on Sunday) New plays by Adam Szymkowicz have become a common but no less welcome occurrence in recent years. His latest, courtesy of Zootopia Theater Company, is a workplace comedy that involves a dozen friends, lovers, frenemies and others, all of whom become even less inhibited than usual when their boss vanishes. Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, fourth floor, TriBeCa, (800) 838-3006, zootopiatheatre.org, brownpapertickets.com. (Grode)
Broadway
'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' As the fatally conflicted Bess, the extraordinary Audra McDonald is a gale force of emotion in Diane Paulus's slimmed-down adaptation of the landmark 1935 opera. Otherwise, despite a likable performance from Norm Lewis as Porgy, this production feels cloudy and mild, only rarely acquiring the majesty of the opera that inspired it (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
'Brontë: A Portrait of Charlotte' This one-woman show written by William Luce and starring Maxine Linehan is intelligent and well acted, but it rarely sparks the imagination. The show is missing the one thing it needs: a sense of the genius of Charlotte Brontë (1:55). Actors' Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Manhattan; (212) 489-9800, alloytheater.org. (Rachel Saltz)
'Bullet for Adolf' Woody Harrelson and Frankie Hyman's muddled play about one hot, hedonistic Houston summer in the 1980s has the feeling of a series of oft-recited anecdotes swapped, excitedly and incoherently, over the din of a jukebox in a crowded bar. These guys hit Memory Lane packing megaphones. Bring ear plugs (2:20). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Closer Than Ever' Can it be? Intelligent, tuneful material written by and for men and women whose ingénue years were in the 20th century? Four rock-solid singers give Richard Maltby Jr. and David Shire's winning 1989 revue a polished revival (1:30). York Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Grode)
&#x2605; 'Cockfight Play' Though that's not the real (unprintable) title of Mike Bartlett's tense, terrific new comedy, it captures the spirit of this feisty, hypnotic and oddly energizing exercise in emotional carnage, directed by James Macdonald. The four-member cast -- Jason Butler Harner, Amanda Quaid, Cotter Smith and Cory Michael Smith -- superbly embodies degrees of sexual ambivalence (1:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Brantley)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; 'Harrison, TX: Three Plays by Horton Foote' Three short, piquant plays by Horton Foote that enjoyably consider the gracious art and limitations of Southern conversation. For these characters, conversation is sacred, something to put your faith in along with God and country, which doesn't mean that words don't fail them. Pam MacKinnon directs a cast that includes the extraordinary Hallie Foote (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Brantley)
'Heartless' In his murky new play, Sam Shepard revisits themes of identity and rootlessness that he has addressed with more urgency -- and clarity -- elsewhere. The splendid Lois Smith, as a Gorgon-like matriarch, gives this production what life force it has. And Jenny Bacon is hilarious as her aggrieved daughter. Daniel Aukin directs, with lots of air-devouring pauses (2:00). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Brantley)
'New Girl in Town' This 1957 musical adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie'' assembled an illustrious team of showmen in the producer Harold Prince, the book writer and original director George Abbott, the composer and lyricist Bob Merrill, and the choreographer Bob Fosse. While Gwen Verdon and Thelma Ritter shared a lead actress Tony Award for their roles in that original production, the show has since remained virtually unseen in New York. Charlotte Moore's staging for the Irish Rep makes a viable case for Merrill's tuneful score, without ever fully convincing that the perky musical treatment has any connection to the roiling emotions of O'Neill's play. It's less a forgotten jewel than an intermittently charming curio from the golden-age vaults (1:50). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (David Rooney)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Probation' This work by the Cuban-born playwright-director Yoshvani Medina, about recent Cuban immigrants under the sway of a crooked mentor in Miami, offers a kind of dialectic between pro-American and pro-Cuban sentiments. Though it verges on the didactic at times, the production benefits from the appeal of its cast and the searching integrity of its script (1:40). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9999, repertorio.org. (Webster)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). Elektra Theater, 674 Eighth Avenue at 42nd Street; (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
Off Off Broadway
'Color Between the Lines' Rock-musical vignettes introduce audiences to many of Brooklyn's abolitionist heroes, including James Pennington, Henry Ward Beecher and a rescued slave named Pinky. Individually, each of these figures is courageous and compelling. But paraded one after another, the stories become repetitive and almost interchangeable, dissolving into a cacophonous set of musicalized book reports. That said, the cast is energetic and impassioned about sharing their reports with the audience (1:30). At various sites in Brooklyn as part of the Brooklyn Beat Festival. For a full schedule, call (347) 762-3281 or visit beatbrooklyn.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Dreamgirls' The Harlem Repertory Theater's chamber production of this vintage musical about a Supremes-like 1960s singing group is intimate, inviting and strongly staged. The mostly black and Latino cast members' abilities range from powerhouse to shaky, but the story comes through clearly and Dion Millington's rendition of ''I Am Telling You I'm Not Going'' is a knockout (2:30). 133rd Street Arts Center, 308 West 133rd Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444, harlemrepertorytheatre.com.

Last Chance
'Gore Vidal's The Best Man' (closes on Sunday) James Earl Jones gives a ripe, funny and moving performance as an ex-president and kingmaker in this starry revival of Mr. Vidal's once-prescient comedy-drama about American politics, which now feels dated and obvious. John Stamos, John Larroquette, Kristin Davis and Elizabeth Ashley round out the cast (2:30). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Rent' (closes on Sunday) Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Tender Napalm' (closes on Sunday) A fierce, transfixing and ultimately very moving pas de deux by Philip Ridley, in which a man and a woman (the ferociously focused Blake Ellis and Amelia Workman) create, destroy and recreate their own private universe.

HEADLINE: Collaborative and Solo, With a Certain Feminist Bent

BYLINE: By MARTHA SCHWENDENER

 BODY:
Collaboration is one of the hallmarks of feminist art and scholarship. The art system doesn't really accommodate this, however. Instead, criticism, art history and institutions are set up to canonize (historically male) individual artists. And for curators, it's considerably easier to work with one artist than a hundred.
Even the Brooklyn Museum's showcase feminist work, ''The Dinner Party'' (1974-79), has a complicated attribution: it was made collaboratively, although the museum stresses that Judy Chicago ''began it alone.'' Hundreds of volunteers helped create the piece, but only 129 are acknowledged in a series of photographic panels, which are not displayed along with the work. 
In many ways the current project on view at the museum by Ulrike Müller, an Austrian-born artist based in Sunset Park, Brooklyn -- she is also a co-editor of LTTR, a self-described ''independent gender queer feminist art journal'' -- serves as an update, rejoinder and response to Ms. Chicago's landmark work. Spearheaded by one woman, it is nevertheless collaborative. And like ''The Dinner Party,'' with its use of mediums like ceramics and textiles, it celebrates what have often been considered ''minor'' arts in the West, even as it also strives for a level of transparency and egalitarianism around authorship and a formal simplicity that is somewhat lacking in Ms. Chicago's theatrical and bombastic installation.
To make the work Ms. Müller provided written descriptions of T-shirts collected by the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Park Slope and distributed them to feminists, queer artists and ''other interested New Yorkers'' (according to a news release). The participants then created two-dimensional objects based on these descriptions. The results are hung on the walls just off the elevator on four different floors.
The responses range from poignant to political, hilarious to heartbreaking. A wonderful drawing made by Ginger Brooks Takahashi and Dana Bishop-Root from the description ''A graphic of the island of Lesbos with icons depicting different sites and tourists activities'' includes a lovely truncated quote from Sappho, the bard of Lesbos: ''Let me tell you this, someone in some future time will think of us.''
A more contentious relationship between object and description can be seen in Fox Hysen's rendition of ''Ronald Reagan with Day-Glo shocking pink eyes'' on a ''chartreuse background.'' For the work Ms. Hysen simply wrote the words ''Elizabeth Warren'' in dark-pink cursive, replacing the Republican president with the Democratic Senate candidate from Massachusetts and critic of his economic policies.
Many of the works demonstrate a similar logic, reducing or transforming the description into a completely abstract representation. The effect is to assert the agency of the artist and suggest that it is the mandate of feminists to break the rules of patriarchy -- or any authoritarian system (even a description provided by another artist). Works by Keltie Ferris, Linda Stillman, J D Samson, Lee Maida, Mitra Wakil and Jonah Groeneboer have translated their descriptions into spare geometric abstractions. This is true too of Ms. Müller's own submission, ''Abstract design with clitoris in the center,'' which consists of black, white and red concentric circles with a bright red circle at the center.
Some of the works include editorial statements, like Mariah Garnett's pencil-drawn rendition of ''A caricature of a woman with large breasts and wild hair inside a circle with words,'' which states that she found the image too depressing to complete. Moyra Davey's ''vase with dead flowers'' has a note addressed to Ms. Müller on its lower left-hand corner, explaining that she ''gave up'' on drawing the image with make up and took a photograph instead.
Among the 100 collaborators are many well-known artists: Louise Fishman, Amy Sillman, Marlene McCarty, Zoe Leonard, Nicole Eisenman, Sadie Benning, Faith Wilding, R. H. Quaytman, Emily Roysdon, A. L. Steiner, Gregg Bordowitz, Robert Bordo -- as well as participants better known through music channels, like Kathleen Hanna and J D Samson. It feels sacrilegious to single them out, because this goes against the tenor of the project, which is to display the works next to one another without privilege or advantage. At the same time the participation of ''bigger'' artists in this collective project shows the advances feminist art has made within the current system since Ms. Chicago's moment.
Along with the work created for ''Raw/Cooked'' -- as the museum's series showcasing contemporary Brooklyn artists is called -- Ms. Müller has selected objects from the museum's collection that illustrate words and concepts significant within feminist and lesbian traditions: flower, hand, rainbow, triangle, ax. It is interesting to see Elsa Tennhardt's 1928 silver-plated pepper shakers within the context of the triangle, or a pair of tiny American Indian (possibly Osage) baskets made of bark. Their presence here suggests a world of objects overlooked in the greater scope of a museum collection.
But the best part of the project is the living, breathing collaboration on the walls -- and that it began with T-shirts, which, despite their ubiquity and visual power, rarely make it into any museum at all.

HEADLINE: A President's Brief Respite

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Allison Kopicki and Mark Landler contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Presidential candidates can usually count on luxuriating in a few days of warm feelings from their convention as they ride the high generated by impassioned supporters and cross their fingers for rising poll numbers.
But for President Obama, the party could come to an abrupt halt even before he breaks camp here Friday morning when the government releases its employment report for August, a blunt reminder of the forces working against him.
The Democrats inside the hall here on Thursday night as Mr. Obama accepted his party's nomination for a second term defined the race as a fundamental clash of visions between Republicans who want an every-man-for-himself society and Democrats who want to ensure that the middle class gets a fair shake -- what Mr. Obama called ''the clearest choice of any time in a generation.''
But that message of promise for the future is up against the immediacy of persistently high unemployment, which, no matter what Friday's report shows, is unlikely to drop so much before Election Day that it will recede as an issue. 
So the biggest question for Mr. Obama as he heads into the home stretch against Mitt Romney and the Republicans is whether he can make the race about sufficiently big and compelling issues, and draw a sharp enough contrast between what his policies and Mr. Romney's would mean for the middle class in the years ahead, to keep the outcome from being swayed by constant reminders of the shaky state of the economy.
The answer, and the result in November, will turn in large part on which is more potent: Mr. Obama's argument that he offers a way toward ''a better place'' for struggling middle class voters whom Democrats say Mr. Romney does not understand, or the more troublesome reality of the moment for voters as they ponder Mr. Romney's question about whether they are better off than four years ago.
From the start, Mr. Obama's campaign aides acknowledged that they were attempting something of a Houdini act in seeking to push the focus of the election ''Forward,'' as their slogan goes, beyond the ''now'' that is harder to pretty up.
Now leaving the cloister of his national convention, and the free network airtime it gave him to put forward his strongest case unopposed, Mr. Obama will be in an environment in which Mr. Romney can use his well-financed general election bank account to outspend him on advertising and hammer home the message that Mr. Obama had his chance and failed.
Obama campaign officials are also mindful that any major economic disruption in the next two months could impede their efforts to focus on the future. They are tracking oil futures so they have a handle on possible gasoline price increases and watching developments in Europe to be on top of any possible financial crisis as much as they are analyzing Gallup tracking polls.
Even before Mr. Obama gave his acceptance speech here, Mr. Romney's aides were pointing to the statistics that went unmentioned in the progression of feel-good speeches that at times made the Time Warner Cable Arena feel like a hermetically sealed Democratic Happyland.
''The middle class has been crushed these past four years, and all the president is offering is more negative commercials and stale ideas,'' said Stuart Stevens, Mr. Romney's strategist. ''As Governor Romney said, 'It's still the economy and we're not stupid.' ''
Democrats, who play down the prospects of any major polling lift for Mr. Obama, acknowledge that they do not have an easy case to make. ''It's hard,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. ''But don't forget this: If people can be given an explanation of the past, they want to believe in the future.''
Mr. Schumer argued that former President Bill Clinton had managed to do that here on Wednesday night with his point-by-point look at the historically grim economy Mr. Obama inherited and the 4.5 million private jobs created during his term -- not enough to cover all the damage from the recession, which Mr. Clinton said he could not have fixed in one term himself.
Mr. Obama's aides say they are convinced that voters are more likely to base their choice for president more on what they think will be best for them in the next four years than on what transpired in the last four.
They are taking comfort in the idea that they have succeeded in turning the race into ''a choice between two different paths,'' as Mr. Obama put it on Thursday night -- beating back Mr. Romney's attempts to define the election as a referendum on Mr. Obama's tenure. Any doubt that he wanted that message to get through was dispelled when it used the word ''choice'' some 20 times in his 38-minute speech.
Democrats say Mr. Romney, who is running close to Mr. Obama in national polls, helped along the process of making the election a choice by picking as his running mate Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, whose conservative budget proposals make the policy differences between the parties that much clearer.
They are battling history as much as the current reality. Polls are full of the sort of numbers that have ended presidencies in the past, with frequent poor marks on his handling of the economy and a sense that the country is moving in the wrong direction.
But Mr. Obama's aides are counting on the notion that each election is unique, not fated by history. And they have other poll numbers that give them heart, including those showing that majorities agree that the wealthy do not pay their fair share of taxes, that job creation is helped along by spending on public projects, and that blame for the economic situation rests more with his predecessor than with him.
''We put the last four years in perspective last night about what the situation was when we took office,'' Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, said Thursday, ''and how we're on the right path.''
That made the delegates and lawmakers in the arena here feel better. ''A lot of people came in feeling sort of nervous after the Republican convention,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont. ''I feel a lot more optimism than I did before I came,'' he said.
Whether that optimism will prove justified will likely depend upon not only Friday's jobs report but on the one after that, the one after that and on Mr. Obama's ability to keep the focus beyond them.

HEADLINE: Character, Not Audacity

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Charlotte, N.C.
As I listened to President Obama on stage in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday night, I thought back to the days more than four years ago, when he spoke at a Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa, or on the night he won the caucuses of that state. There was his romantic vision, the possibility of transformational change.
I don't know if we are worse off now than we were back then, but we were certainly worse off then than we knew. The financial crisis of the past years has exposed debilitating flaws in our way of life. It's exposed the crushing burden of debt and the unsustainability of our entitlement system. It's exposed flaws in our style of capitalism -- the overreliance on finance, the concentration of power. It exposed a widening education gap; the educated have recovered from the recession while the unskilled fall further behind. It exposed even deeper dysfunctions in our political system. 
Obama was rhetorically grand back then, but many of us have spent this year looking for even bigger strategies and policies.
The Republicans understand the severity of our economic problems, but they put too much faith in tax cuts. The Republicans understand that unless Medicare is reformed, it will swallow everything else, though judging from their convention, they are too timid to explain the problem or champion their own plan.
So, as I looked to President Obama's speech Thursday night, I was looking to see if he was capable of a new burst of change.
There were parts of his speech that raised the old expectations. I liked the emphasis he put not on himself but on the word ''you'' -- the idea that change comes organically from the bottom up. I liked his extraordinary self-awareness, his willingness to admit that often life on the campaign trail requires candidates to do silly things. I liked the sense of citizenship that pervaded his address, the sense of mutual obligation.
But what I was mostly looking for were big proposals, big as health care was four years ago. I had spent the three previous days watching more than 80 convention speeches without hearing a single major policy proposal in any of them. I asked governors, mayors and legislators to name a significant law that they'd like to see President Obama pass in a second term. Not one could. At its base, this is a party with a protective agenda, not a change agenda -- dedicated to defending government in all its forms.
The Obama speech offered some important if familiar hints of big policy ideas. There was a vague hint of a major tax reform. There was a vague promise to accept an agreement based on the principle of the Simpson-Bowles committee on deficit reduction. But it's hard to be enthusiastic about President Obama truly championing initiatives that get no more than a sentence or a clause.
Over all, the speech had a fierce opposition toward the Republicans and a desire for incremental continuity about what the Democrats themselves would offer. Worse, the speech was dominated by unexplained goals that were often worthy, but also familiar, modest and incommensurate with the problems at hand. The government should help more students attend community colleges. It should recruit more math and science teachers. These are good existing programs, but these are not policies to pinion a presidency around.
It would be nice if exports doubled. It would be nice if deficits came down gradually over the next 10 years. But the goals President Obama set in these spheres will probably be met if everybody in Washington carried on the status quo. They do not entail big change.
President Obama offered other small and worthy ideas, familiar to him since his days in the Senate, that would make America better -- more long-lasting batteries, more trade agreements. But these are improvements fit for countries that are already firmly on the right track.
The country that exists is not on the right track. It has a completely dysfunctional political system. What was there in this speech that will make us think the next few years will be any different? America will only be governable again if there is a leader who breaks the mold and reframes the debate. Romney is unlikely to do that, and Obama's speech didn't offer much either.
In short, change is still the issue, and the focus of his solid but not extraordinary speech was incremental improvement. The next president has to do three big things, which are in tension with one another: increase growth, reduce debt and increase social equity. President Obama has the intelligence, the dexterity and the sense of balance to navigate these crosscutting challenges. But he apparently lacks the creativity to break out of the partisan categories, the trench warfare gridlock.
Thursday night's speech showed the character and his potential. It didn't show audacity and the fulfillment of that potential.

HEADLINE: Singaporean Tells China U.S. Is Not in Decline

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
BEIJING -- In an unusual public airing of strategic problems surrounding China's rise, the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, warned China on Thursday that it should view the United States not as a declining power, but as a nation with the ability to innovate and bounce back.
Speaking at the Central Party School, the prestigious training ground for officials of the Communist Party, Mr. Lee also suggested that China try to solve its maritime disputes in the South China Sea regionally, through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as Asean, rather than country by country. 
Mr. Lee is the son of Lee Kuan Yew, the longtime leader of Singapore who forged strong relations with China and the United States and successfully balanced his small city-state between the two, and his views carry considerable weight among the Chinese elite. By choosing to make his pointed remarks in a prime setting like the Central Party School, the prime minister was ensuring that they carried extra heft. The president of the school is Vice President Xi Jinping, expected to be the next leader of China.
Mr. Lee addressed the question of America's standing in the world, a subject that fascinates Chinese academics and writers in the state-run news media, many of whom have written caustically in recent months about Washington's budget difficulties, political gridlock and what they see as a crisis of confidence.
''It is currently facing some very difficult problems, but it is not a nation in decline,'' Mr. Lee said of the United States. ''The U.S. is an enormously resilient and creative society, which attracts and absorbs talent from all over the world, including many from China and the rest of Asia.''
In a subtle jab at China, Mr. Lee noted, ''All eight Nobel Prize winners in science who are of Chinese descent either were or subsequently became American citizens.''
''We should never underestimate the U.S. capacity to reinvigorate and reinvent itself,'' he said.
Singapore is considered an important post for the United States military presence in Asia. American aircraft carriers and other warships use Singapore's port, which sits astride the South China Sea. Last year, Singapore agreed to an American request to allow four new littoral combat ships, a new category of fast warship, to use its facilities.
At the same time, Singapore maintains a strong relationship with Beijing, which began when Deng Xiaoping visited the country in 1978 and was impressed that Lee Kuan Yew's stern governance was accompanied by economic prosperity.
Mr. Lee's appearance at the Communist Party school came after China effectively shattered Southeast Asian unity on how to deal with disputes in the South China Sea, a tactic that shocked Washington and Singapore alike.
At a meeting in Cambodia in July that was attended by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, China managed to quash an agreement on the South China Sea among members of Asean. Some Southeast Asian officials said they believed that China was emboldened by a belief that the United States was a waning power that lacked the clout to keep Asean unified.
In his speech, Mr. Lee said Asean ''has to take and state a position which is neutral, forward-looking and encourages the peaceful resolution of issues.''
''For Asean not to address it would severely damage its credibility,'' he continued. Moreover, Asean and China should soon start talks on a code of conduct designed to help resolve conflicts, he said.
This was a position put forward by Mrs. Clinton during her visit to Beijing this week, which so far the Chinese have resisted.
Lee Kuan Yew wrote in his memoirs that he told the Chinese leader, Mr. Deng, that the countries of Asia were more afraid of the ''China dragon'' than the ''Russian bear.'' His son appeared to be beaming, indirectly, a variant of that message to his Chinese audience on Thursday.
The prime minister closed his speech by saying he believed that ''the Chinese government and people are determined to overcome its various challenges.'' But without being explicit, Mr. Lee seemed to be echoing his father, and suggesting that in Asia, China was more feared than the United States.

HEADLINE: Cuomo, in Brief Visit to Convention City, Gives a Spirited Speech From a Small Stage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Giant clusters of red, white and blue balloons hung overhead and an imposing black rope line stretched across the room. Campaign-style bunting festooned the podium and Bon Jovi's "Working for the Working Man" blared through loudspeakers. A seasoned political spouse leapt to her feet at applause lines, and the candidate shouted to be heard over an adoring crowd.
As Democrats assembled for their convention this week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo steadfastly refused to appear on his party's biggest stage. 
Instead, he set up his own inside a white banquet tent on the asphalt parking lot of a Doubletree Hotel on the outskirts of the city.
The scene at the Cuomo Convention on Thursday may have lacked TV-ready glamour (those balloons aside), but the result was no less splashy: the governor of New York delivered a stemwinder of a speech - filled with tart-tongued denunciations of Republican economic policies and praise for New York as a progressive ideal for the country - that intensified speculation about his White House ambitions for 2016.
With its conflicting message and goal, the site seemed to perfectly encapsulate Mr. Cuomo himself at the moment, at once wanting to be a Big Deal but worried about becoming a Big Deal.
Since taking office last January, Mr. Cuomo has all but penned himself into the state, avoiding any out-of-town travel and high-profile speaking engagements that might expose him to the unforgiving scrutiny of the national political press.
Here in Charlotte, that reluctance seemed magnified. The governor waited until Thursday morning to fly in from New York, skipping the first two days of his party's gathering and the parties that surround it. To avoid unwanted headlines, he canceled a fund-raiser with top Democratic donors.
And yet.
On Thursday, inside the tent, he sounded unmistakably like a man with ambitions well beyond Albany.In a speech by turns stirring and scathing, he drew on his experience in Albany - and legislative achievements on taxes, education and same-sex marriage - as a blueprint for how Democrats can govern nationally.
It was clear that, despite the out-of-the-way location, his remarks were more tailored to the national audience in the convention hall, as he slipped between addressing his audience as "New Yorkers" and "America."
He called on the country to embrace his vision of progressivism, describing the choice between President Obama and Mitt Romney as a "gut-check election" and the "truest test of who we are."
"Do you believe in interconnection and interrelation and, do you believe that I am connected to you, to you and to you?" he asked, pointing to people in the crowd, his voice rising to a full shout as audience members stood and clapped madly.
"And there is a chord that connects us all. And that chord weaves a fabric. And when one of us is raised, we are all raised. And when one of us is lowered, we are all lowered. Do you believe that the sweetest success is shared success, when we all do well?"
Mr. Cuomo rarely engages in partisan broadsides, emphasizing his across-the-aisle diplomacy with members of the New York Legislature.
But on Thursday he starkly departed from that script, variously deriding the speeches and policies articulated at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., last week as "absurd" and "obnoxious."
"I found it amusing. It was great theater - it was theater," he said, smiling. "That's why the actors felt so at home."
He reserved his deepest disdain for the claim, made by Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, that cutting taxes for the nation's wealthiest will, as Mr. Cuomo put it, "unleash the American entrepreneurial spirit."
In an extended riff, he mocked this "American spirit they talk about all the time."
"That great mystic spirit will come out," he continued. "The American spirit has a special wand and he will wave the wand. And everything will be O.K."
"No," Mr. Cuomo added. "When you cut taxes on the rich, there is no spirit that appears. The rich people get more money."
Like Mr. Cuomo himself these days, the event toggled between local and national, polished and rough, big and small. The Syracuse mayor made self-deprecating jokes as Mr.
Cuomo's glamorous girlfriend, the Food Network personality Sandra Lee, turned heads among the wait staff.
As the governor sat onstage, waiting to speak, a state senator and local union official received the state Democratic Party's highest honor: the "Progressive Tax Reform Achievement Award." (Mr. Cuomo posed for photos with both.)
But in the moments after he finished speaking, the normally voluble and friendly governor, who is known for mingling with reporters, suddenly seemed more like a national candidate, quickly dashing out through a side door and hopping into a waiting S.U.V., which whisked him away.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: From Convention Floor, Delegates Give Obama Benefit of Their Doubts

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Will Storey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- In a perfect world, Sara Riley, a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, would have preferred that President Obama had done more to fulfill what the party saw as the transformative nature of the 2008 campaign and election.
''Would I have liked to seen Gitmo closed? Yes,'' said Ms. Riley, a personal injury lawyer, referring to the detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. ''However, the Senate and House, Republicans and Democrats alike, voted not to allow funding. How is he going to close Gitmo if he doesn't have the money? 
''He has done a lot,'' Ms. Riley said as the convention swirled around her at the Time Warner Cable Arena. ''He hasn't done everything.''
As they prepared to leave their party's convention after three speech-filled nights here, Ms. Riley and the hundreds of grass-roots activists, union members, local government officials, educators and other Democrats who served as delegates acknowledged that the president had fallen short in some areas. The tone in Washington remains sharply partisan, powerful special interests wield tremendous influence, the economy is sluggish, climate change legislation has stalled and the health care law was largely a purely Democratic product.
But in about two dozen interviews, they said the president had earned a second term to finish what he started. The delegates blame not Mr. Obama, but his determined opponents -- as well as the scope of the problems he inherited -- for any work left undone.
''We have to face the reality of 2008 and what we were facing as a country,'' said Janet Payne, a retired school administrator from Fredericksburg, Va., who saw her savings dwindle in the economic collapse. ''I don't think anybody else could have done what he did.''
''We know when we started this in '08 there were major, major problems,'' said Renee Watson, a delegate and economic development officer from San Antonio. ''America was hurting.''
She and other delegates echoed a message that was also reinforced from the podium: If Mr. Obama has not turned the nation completely around, it is because he faced a confluence of threatening events that defied precedent and quick solution.
''I want to nominate a man who ran for president to change the course of an already weak economy and then just six weeks before his election saw it suffer the biggest collapse since the Great Depression, a man who stopped the slide into depression and put us on the long road to recovery,'' former President Bill Clinton said Wednesday night in sentiments expressed repeatedly in Charlotte.
''He had a long way to go,'' said Alice Boyd, a delegate and retired teacher from Des Moines. ''We had all been in a very deep hole, and he has been providing us shovels to get out. He had a tough four years, but he had a long way to go.''
While some elements of the party may have been angry at Mr. Obama during points in his term, given his refusal to embrace a government-run plan as part of the new health care law or what they saw as foot-dragging on Iraq and Afghanistan, the delegates in Charlotte were not looking back.
''My God, the man got more than any human being could have gotten when he became president,'' said Rosalind Wyman, 81, a retiree from Los Angeles who has attended every Democratic convention since 1952. ''He's moved us along, we're not in a depression, the stock market is up, we've had jobs for 29 months. What do you want?''
The delegates on the floor, like many of the convention speakers, aimed much of their fire at Congressional Republicans, accusing them of purposefully standing in the president's way to build their own political power and of thwarting efforts that could have accelerated the economic recovery.
''He spent a lot of time trying to build consensus and buy-in from both sides; I almost wonder if that backfired,'' said Sabrina Sanders of Long Beach, Calif. ''He was so undermined from the other side, I feel like we lost a sense of civility from the Republican Party.''
''This has been a huge mountain to climb, and Barack Obama has made incredible progress in the face of obstacles that the Republicans joyfully put up,'' said Ed O'Shea, a delegate from New York.
John P. Gulino, a lawyer from Staten Island, compared the president's task to restoring a failing business. ''As a lawyer and as a businessman, I understand the concept of taking over a defunct business, if you want to call it that, and bringing it back,'' he said. ''It's not that easy; it can't be done in four years.''
Others argued that Mr. Obama's full set of accomplishments was not being recognized and that the campaign needed to do more to remind voters of what had been done.
''Look at the record,'' said Tony Alexander, a union activist and delegate from San Jose, Calif. ''Two Supreme Court judges; the National Labor Relations Board, incredible; passing affordable health care, incredible. Look back, look over your shoulder and see where we were 8, 12 years ago and where we are now. We are moving forward. Forward, not back.''

HEADLINE: Obama Makes Case for 2nd Term: 'Harder' Path to 'Better Place'

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and PETER BAKER

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- President Obama accepted the Democratic nomination for a second term on Thursday night, making a forceful argument that he had rescued the economy from disaster and ushered in a recovery that would be imperiled by a return to Republican stewardship.
Describing himself as ''mindful of my own failings,'' Mr. Obama conceded the country's continuing difficulties while defending his record and pleading for more time to carry out his agenda. He laid out a long-term blueprint for revival in an era obsessed with short-term expectations.
''I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy; I never have,'' Mr. Obama told a packed arena of 20,000 party leaders and activists. ''You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades.''
He added: ''But know this, America: Our problems can be solved. Our challenges can be met. The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And I'm asking you to choose that future.'' 
The president's appearance at the Time Warner Cable Arena underscored the tumultuous journey he and the country have been on since his first nomination in Denver. Four years after fireworks consecrated his storybook campaign to become the nation's first black president, Mr. Obama took the stage on Thursday as a politician who had come down to earth and was locked in the fight of his life against the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.
The stirring outsider's message had become a policy-laden appeal for continuity; the mantra of reform was now a vigorous defense of his current course. The ''Change'' signs waved in the audience in 2008 had been replaced with placards saying ''Forward.'' The word ''promise,'' which he used 32 times in his acceptance speech in 2008, came up just 7 times on Thursday night. Even the traditional balloon drop was missing since a last-minute site change made it impossible.
Mr. Obama issued a string of promises, including one million new manufacturing jobs and $4 trillion in deficit reductions. But he was largely making the case that he had put in place the foundation for a revived country if voters only give it enough time to work. If at times it had the feel of a State of the Union address, that was an intentional effort to jab at Mr. Romney to be more specific about how he would carry out his promises, maximizing the gulf between the parties.
''They want your vote, but they don't want you to know their plan,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And that's because all they have to offer is the same prescription they've had for the last 30 years.''
Mr. Obama's speech punctuated back-to-back political conventions in which the two parties, if nothing else, delivered radically different visions for how to end the economic malaise that has afflicted the country since 2008, and framed the two-month spring to Election Day.
A week after Mr. Romney sought to appeal to American disappointment with Mr. Obama, the president pressed his case that the Republican candidate is so disconnected from the struggles of the middle class that he has no idea how to address them. In sharp language, he linked Mr. Romney and his running mate, Paul D. Ryan, to what he long described as failed trickle-down economic policies that favor the wealthy, reflecting what has become a central theme.
''On every issue, the choice you face won't just be between two candidates or two parties,'' Mr. Obama said. ''When all is said and done, when you pick up that ballot to vote, you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation.''
The Romney campaign released a reaction to the president's speech before it was even delivered, assailing Mr. Obama as having failed to create enough jobs, cut the deficit in half or increase incomes. ''This is a time not for him to start restating new promises, but to report on the promises he made,'' Mr. Romney said in the taped statement. ''I think he wants a promises reset. We want a report on the promises he made.''
Introducing Mr. Obama on Thursday night was Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who offered testimony to the president's leadership on everything from the economy to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. ''Bravery resides in the heart of Barack Obama,'' he said. ''This man has courage in his soul, compassion in his heart and steel in his spine.''
Mr. Biden was left to take the tougher shots at Mr. Romney, the former head of the private equity firm Bain Capital and former governor of Massachusetts. Noting that Mr. Romney had promised to take a jobs tour, Mr. Biden said, ''Well, with his support for outsourcing, it's going to have to be a foreign trip.''
He went on to note that Mr. Romney opposed the federal bailout of the auto industry. ''I think he saw it the Bain way,'' Mr. Biden said, adding: ''The Bain way may bring your firm the highest profits. But it's not the way to lead our country from the highest office.''
Mr. Biden's nomination for a second term as vice president was approved by the convention by acclamation after his son Beau, the attorney general of Delaware, put his name up for consideration in a speech that left the vice president teary-eyed for the second consecutive night.
The emotion in the packed hall crested early, when former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, her step faltering, walked tentatively onto the stage in a surprise appearance to lead the pledge of allegiance. Mrs. Giffords, who was shot in the head by a would-be assassin in Tucson, is still recovering, and she stumbled over the word ''indivisible.'' But she got through the pledge in her first real public speaking since the shooting, and blew kisses to the crowd, which surged to its feet in ovation, chanting ''Gabby! Gabby!''
Given that Mr. Romney spent little time on foreign policy during his acceptance speech, it was a foregone conclusion that Mr. Obama would devote time to national security, an area where Democrats believe they have carved out a surprising advantage. They paraded a host of war veterans across the stage, some of whom chided the Republicans as taking little notice of them in Tampa last week.
''Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago,'' Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said, turning a Republican line critical of the president into an argument for his re-election.
Mr. Obama said Republicans ''want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly,'' and Mr. Biden appeared to choke up reciting the numbers of war dead and wounded.
Still, the heart of the argument between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney is about the role of government. ''This is what the election comes down to,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Over and over, we've been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way, that since government can't do everything, it should do almost nothing.''
Highlighting Medicare, which Mr. Ryan has proposed overhauling, the president said, ''No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies.''
The president's speech culminated a three-day convention that included a retinue of Hollywood celebrities and even a former Republican governor, Charlie Crist of Florida, plus a strong focus on social issues like same-sex marriage.
But like its Republican equivalent last week, it did not always go according to script, including an embarrassing floor fight over Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and a late decision to move the president's speech to the Time Warner Cable Arena from the Bank of America Stadium because of inclement weather.
With thunder, lightning and rain forecast -- convention goers huddled under plastic sheets as they darted between sites -- organizers were left with some 65,000 supporters -- many of them traveling from all over the country -- without the chance to see the president in person.
The president's aides understood they could never re-create the power of the past but hoped to convince voters that more has been done than commonly recognized. The ''promises kept'' theme was intended to address the same swing voters Mr. Romney sought last week to win over.
Mr. Obama directly acknowledged the disappointments. ''While I'm proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings,'' he said. But he added, ''I have never been more hopeful about America, not because I think I have all the answers, not because I'm naïve about the magnitude of our challenges. I'm hopeful because of you.''
The president appeared to become emotional toward the end of his speech as he spoke of wounded veterans who somehow managed to walk and run and bike on prosthetic legs. He said he did not know if they would vote for him, but added that they nonetheless gave him hope that difficulties could be overcome.
His voice started to break. ''If you share that faith with me, if you share that hope with me, I ask you tonight for your vote,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Not by Design, Another Clinton Watches a Convention From Afar

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei -- When Michelle Obama addressed the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night in Charlotte, N.C., it was already Wednesday morning in Beijing, and Hillary Rodham Clinton was meeting with China's president in the Great Hall of the People.
When her husband, former President Bill Clinton, spoke the following night, she was meeting with East Timor's foreign minister after touring an American-financed coffee cooperative in Dili, the capital of the young island nation between the Banda and Timor Seas. 
When President Obama accepts the Democratic nomination for a second term on Thursday night, she will be here in Brunei, half a world away from a quadrennial exercise she has not missed since Hubert H. Humphrey Jr. won the nod in her hometown, Chicago, in 1968.
Mrs. Clinton -- once and, some fervently hope, a future standard-bearer for the Democratic Party -- has spent the past week doing what she has done ever since Mr. Obama chose her as his secretary of state nearly four years ago: forswearing partisan politics in favor of foreign policy.
She has traveled the world -- Brunei is the 110th country she has visited as secretary -- and stayed out of the political fray, if not the spotlight.
''It didn't start in Charlotte,'' her longtime adviser Philippe Reines said in an interview during her flight this week to China from Indonesia. He noted that Mrs. Clinton had stopped raising money, making endorsements or, for the most part, inveighing on political debates. ''She's had to miss everything on that front ever since January 2009.''
Her trip, contrary to speculation, was not an intentional effort to stay away from the convention -- far, far away. By law, as secretary of state, she would not have attended anyway, even if she were home.
Rather, it had to do with the coincidental timing of the annual summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum this week in Vladivostok, Russia, which Mr. Obama could not attend for what Mr. Reines called ''the obvious reasons.'' (Mr. Obama's long-planned absence may have prompted Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, to skip a summit meeting of the Group of 8 nations that Mr. Obama hosted at Camp David in May.) Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to arrive in Russia on Friday as the confetti and balloons are being cleared in Charlotte, wrapping up a swing through Asia that began last Thursday, the day Mitt Romney accepted the Republican nomination in Tampa, Fla.
''Officially, let me say that for decades secretaries of state have not attended political conventions because of the nonpartisan nature of our foreign policy,'' she said at the Foreign Ministry in Dili on Thursday in her first public remarks on either party's convention.
Whether foreign policy remains ''nonpartisan'' is increasingly a matter of debate at home, but she said: ''I think it's a good rule. It's one that I certainly accepted.''
Even so, her absence in Charlotte reflected a significant milestone in her political life, and perhaps the end of it.
Mrs. Clinton, who turns 65 in October, has said she would serve for the remainder of Mr. Obama's first term and then step down, regardless of the outcome of the election. She has repeatedly said she is done with politics -- and her closest advisers say they believe her, though they note that things could change if Mr. Romney wins and the Democrats begin searching for a new challenger.
Mr. Reines expressed some satisfaction that speculation about Mrs. Clinton taking another post -- heading the World Bank, or replacing Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the vice-presidential nominee -- had now been proved false, as he had insisted all along, saying she remained focused only on her current job.
None of this is to suggest that Mrs. Clinton does not have a rooting interest in events in Charlotte -- and a personal one.
Mr. Clinton, she said, had read parts of his speech to her over the past few days, and at the Foreign Ministry in East Timor she held up a copy of his remarks ''as prepared for delivery,'' in Washington parlance. She did not divulge what, if any, editing advice she had given.
''It's a great honor for him to be nominating the president,'' she said, even as Mr. Clinton was concluding his remarks in Charlotte. Then, using the official name for the former Portuguese colony, she added, ''And I'm delighted to be here in Timor-Leste on behalf of the United States in furtherance of our shared values, interests and security.''
As usual on any overseas visit, Mrs. Clinton returned for a final stop at the American Embassy in Dili to meet briefly with the American and Timorese staff. But her expected departure was, inexplicably at first, delayed.
While the traveling press corps waited unknowingly outside by the embassy pool, she and her senior staff had retreated inside the ambassador's residence to huddle around a computer streaming a recording of her husband's speech, which included a shout-out to her. ''I am very proud of her,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''I am proud of the job she and the national security team have done for America.''
As she boarded the plane -- nearly an hour behind schedule -- the woman who lost her party's nomination to Mr. Obama four years ago and could, just conceivably, run again in 2016 indulged in a little partisanship of her own. ''It was great,'' she said of Mr. Clinton's speech. She then telephoned her husband as her motorcade drove back to the airport, and from there she flew here for meetings and a dinner with the sultan of Brunei.

HEADLINE: A Night of Speeches Under a Magnifying Glass

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY, JOHN M. BRODER, MICHAEL COOPER and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke about the economy, energy policy, Medicare and Afghanistan on Thursday night as they accepted their nominations at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. Here is a closer look at some of their assertions:
Manufacturing 
Mr. Obama, in his acceptance speech, said, ''We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports, and if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years.''
Looking at current trends, it is certainly possible: the nation has added about 222,000 manufacturing jobs in the past year. Moreover, the Obama campaign has several proposals to encourage manufacturers to add workers.
But there is a bigger economic story behind the gains in manufacturing.
For three decades, manufacturers had cut jobs, and then when the recession hit, they slashed hundreds of thousands more. Now, some economists say, they might be adding workers to simply regain some lost capacity.
American workers' wages have also been stagnant for more than a decade, and in many cases have declined during the recession. Over the same period, pay climbed in many other countries, making American workers' wages more competitive. Strong blue-collar wage growth here or lower wages in foreign countries would send more jobs back overseas, economists say.
Mr. Obama also repeated his promise to double exports, to about $3.2 trillion a year in 2014 from about $1.6 trillion in 2009. He is roughly on track to meet that goal, with exports running at an annual pace of $2.2 trillion, judging by data from the first half of the year.
But Mr. Obama got help by starting the clock during the depths of the recession in 2009, when global trade dipped and American exports fell. And the strength of the dollar against other currencies -- a factor almost entirely outside of American politicians' control -- will mainly determine export growth in the short term, economists argue. ANNIE LOWREY
Energy
Mr. Obama, seeking to capitalize on energy trends for which his administration is only partly responsible, announced that he was setting a goal of cutting ''our oil imports in half by 2020, and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone.''
He intends to achieve that goal by increasing domestic oil and gas production, mandating increases in autos' and trucks' fuel economy, substituting ethanol and other alternative fuels for gasoline, streamlining regulation and converting trucks and buses to run on natural gas.
But the campaign said that the administration would continue to lease public lands and offshore areas for drilling, including in the Arctic Ocean off Alaska. Industry groups contend that the administration has held back oil development on public lands and that most of the increased production is coming from private property.
A campaign document says that the president is using 2008 as a baseline for the reduction in imports, allowing him to claim credit for several years of declining demand for fuel because of the recession and leasing and production decisions made by President George W. Bush's administration.
The president's projections are in line with those of government and independent analysts, who say that if current trends continue, imports will decline to levels not seen for decades, even without additional policy changes. JOHN M. BRODER
Medicare
Mr. Biden criticized the Romney campaign on Medicare, saying, ''What they didn't tell you is what they're proposing would cause Medicare to go bankrupt by 2016.'' But the actions he described would not end Medicare in four years.
At issue is the Medicare trust fund, which is fed by payroll taxes, and what would happen to it if President Obama's health care law were to be repealed, as the Republicans have vowed to do.
The solvency of the trust fund has long been in question. Mr. Obama's health care law extended its solvency by curbing the growth of projected spending -- the $716 billion Medicare cut that has been debated in the campaign -- and by raising some revenues. As the 2011 annual report of the Medicare trustees put it, the financial status of the ''trust fund is substantially improved by the lower expenditures and additional tax revenues instituted by the Affordable Care Act.'' Absent those savings, the trust fund will be exhausted sooner.
What would happen then? The most recent report states: ''If assets were exhausted, Medicare could pay health plans and providers only to the extent allowed by ongoing tax revenues -- and these revenues would be inadequate to fully cover costs. Beneficiary access to health care services would rapidly be curtailed.'' But it adds that, in practice, Congress has never allowed the trust fund to become depleted. MICHAEL COOPER
Afghanistan
''In 2014, our longest war will be over.'' That is what President Obama said tonight about Afghanistan.
Well, maybe. That is the deadline for pulling out all American and other foreign troops. But the White House has said that it envisions an ''enduring force'' in Afghanistan for years to come that could amount to 10,000 to 15,000 troops. They would not be in combat, but they would be there to stop the Taliban from overtaking Kabul, the capital, and to keep Pakistan from losing control of its 100 or so nuclear weapons. The United States' combat role may soon be over; it is less likely the war will be. DAVID E. SANGER

HEADLINE: Forging Ahead in Europe

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Even during the American auto industry's collapse three years ago, the Ford Motor Company kept investing heavily in new products for the future. As American auto sales recovered, so did Ford's revenue and profit in what previously had been its most troubled market.
Now Ford is gambling the same strategy will work in Europe, where economic conditions are deteriorating and car sales are at their lowest point in 15 years. 
The company on Thursday said it would introduce several new or refreshed models to bolster its struggling European division, including stalwarts from its American lineup like the Edge sport utility vehicle and the Mustang sports car.
''Just like in the U.S., we are going to invest in the worst of times because it will allow us to grow,'' Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in an interview from Amsterdam, where Ford announced its product plans at an event attended by 2,500 of its European dealers.
Raising the bet in Europe is a daring move for Ford, which expects to lose more than $1 billion in Europe this year.
The European auto industry is in crisis. Saddled with high costs and too much production capacity, the region's automakers must also contend with deep recessions in prime markets like Italy and Spain, where consumers have sharply curtailed car purchases.
Analysts say that many of the automakers in the region, including Ford, need to close factories and produce fewer cars.
In some cases, more radical action might be necessary. One top auto analyst recommended on Thursday that General Motors, which has lost money in Europe for 12 straight years, sell or even close down its European operations before they undermine the company's overall comeback from its government bailout and bankruptcy.
''One of the worst things in the auto industry is owning a cash burning, resource consuming business,'' the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a lengthy research report about G.M.'s Opel unit. ''One of the best things is getting rid of that business.''
G.M. had no immediate comment on the Morgan Stanley report. But the company has replaced top management at its Opel unit and G.M.'s chief executive, Daniel Akerson, has consistently said his goal is to fix Opel and use its product expertise on global platforms.
Mr. Mulally of Ford said he was confident his company can survive the crisis in Europe and emerge as a more formidable competitor when the economy revives. The company is willing to be patient for a recovery that even Mr. Mulally concedes may be years away.
''We really don't know,'' he said. ''Nobody knows.''
One analyst said all automakers in Europe are wrestling with investment plans in a region where sales in some countries have dropped more than 20 percent this year.
''Europe might not fully recover until 2016,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the research firm IHS Automotive. ''Ford has to walk a fine line to keep the product fresh and hope demand returns at the same time.''
Like other automakers, Ford is trying to stabilize its business in Europe. The company lost $404 million in Europe in the second quarter of this year, and has said its troubles there will cause its overall 2012 operating profits to fall from last year's results.
Its aggressive product strategy, which includes new passenger cars, S.U.V.'s and commercial vehicles, is intended both to reverse sagging sales and demonstrate its commitment to the region.
''Even with the near-term business environment, Europe represents a significant opportunity for profitable growth,'' Mr. Mulally said.
Over all, the company will have 15 of its global vehicles on sale in Europe within five years, and will also introduce its fuel-efficient EcoBoost engines to the market.
Ford executives, including its European chief, Stephen Odell, also showed new versions of some of its biggest sellers on the continent, including the Fiesta compact car, the Kuga sport utility, and Mondeo sedan.
Ford did not put a price tag on its investment in the new models, nor did it discuss any moves to reduce its manufacturing capacity or employment levels in Europe. The company is expected to unveil a restructuring plan later this year to possibly cut employment and costs in the region.
The product blitz underscores the increasingly competitive environment in the European industry. Volkswagen, which has the region's biggest market share, is also ramping up its new products to gain share from weaker rivals such as G.M. and PSA Peugeot Citroën.
Mr. Jonas, the Morgan Stanley analyst, said it might be time for G.M. to simply call it quits and divest its European operations, just as the German automaker Daimler sold Chrysler in 2007.
He suggested it would cost G.M. between $7 billion and $13 billion to separate from Opel. But getting rid of it, he said, would increase the company's depressed stock price and free up its leadership to improve the overall company.
''If the performance and repositioning of the 'new G.M.' continues to be harmed by Opel, we believe the damage could be lasting and difficult to repair,'' Mr. Jonas wrote.
As for Ford's European operations, ''the underlying business in terms of product portfolio and brand positioning is sound,'' he said in a separate e-mail.

HEADLINE: President Obama's Second Chance

 BODY:
President Obama's dilemma has always been that he has been far more successful a president than his opponents claim, but far less successful than he needs to be at making voters see that. Powerful speeches by former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and others did a lot to fix that impression during the convention. But it was up to Mr. Obama to make the case for another term, with a speech that was every bit as fraught with uncertainty and risk as his 2008 convention address.
Just as he did then, Mr. Obama rose to the occasion. 
He could have sold some of his best lines with more passion, but gone was the maddening coyness of recent years in which he has avoided candidly talking about the mess that President George W. Bush dumped into his lap and shied away from the rumble of politics. He didn't hesitate to go after Mitt Romney. ''You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally,'' he said.
And he clearly laid out a vision for governing squarely at odds with the one that Mr. Romney has, but was hidden from view at last week's Republican convention in Tampa, Fla. He promised deficit reduction ''without sticking it to the middle class''; to enact a reformed tax code that raises rates on income above $250,000 to where it was under Mr. Clinton; to preserve middle-class deductions; to ''never turn Medicare into a voucher.''
Mr. Obama explicitly shifted from his 2008 appeal of hope and change to talk of tough choices and tough paths. ''You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear,'' he said. ''You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades.''
Mr. Obama went into this convention with an actual record at governing -- not just the Republican posture of saying ''No'' to everything. He has far better ideas about how to create jobs, make Americans' tax burdens more equitable and improve ordinary Americans' economic prospects than the tired, failed trickle-down fantasies served up by Mitt Romney and the Republican Party.
He ended the war in Iraq, tried to rescue the Afghan war that Mr. Bush bungled, stepped up the offensive on terrorists far beyond Mr. Bush's vision and rallied the world to ratchet up pressure on Iran.
He blunted the extreme message of the Tea Party by offering an alternative vision of government's obligation to help the neediest, provide everyone with the basic structures of society and the economy and end unconscionable discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans. He has protected women's constitutional rights and liberties, despite his own misgivings about abortion. He ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden -- an act that was mentioned repeatedly on the last night of the convention.
But, after he was elected, Mr. Obama allowed himself to believe in his own legend, cheered on by the hundreds of thousands of adoring supporters who thronged his inauguration, by the sheer magnificence of the swearing-in of an African-American president. It was as though he concluded that his election by itself changed the world and had fulfilled his promise of a postpartisan era.
The president and his tight inner circle were oblivious to the Republicans' explicit warning that he would not get the slightest cooperation from a party and a Congressional caucus driven by an implacable hatred of Mr. Obama that is mostly ideological but also fueled by his race. It took nearly three years for the Obama team to recognize that central fact.
Mr. Obama won passage of an economic recovery bill that not only warded off depression, but actually created jobs, and of a health care reform law that is essential to the long-term economic health of the country. But he ceded the details of lawmaking to Congress, where leaders of his own party did not fully step up to the moment and Republicans stood in stonewall opposition.
And he ceded the national debate on central issues to those same Republicans, mired in his belief that the force of his intellect could melt their obstructionism, that one eloquent speech could change his political fortunes. Mr. Obama allowed his opponents to define the argument and so define him.
Mr. Clinton showed Mr. Obama the antidote. On Wednesday night, Mr. Clinton fought back against the Republicans on Medicaid and Medicare, two areas where the Obama campaign has failed to get real traction. He made the argument for health care reform, financial re-regulation and fair taxation, all while firing up the crowd.
Mr. Obama did not quite match that bravura performance on Thursday. But he met his challenge in Charlotte.

HEADLINE: Where Is American Leadership?

 BODY:
Regarding ''Made in the U.S.A.'' (Views, Aug. 31): In echoing the flimsy fabric of the Republican convention to nominate Mitt Romney for president, Roger Cohen is right to be worried and angry. While Europe wallows in one economic crisis after another, Russia and China luxuriate in U.N. Security Council vetoes as Syria burns and leaders in the Middle East spend their time fulminating about Armageddon, where is the leadership of America, a country that only a few decades ago boasted having three-quarters of the world's investment capital and two-thirds of all industrial capacity?

HEADLINE: For Obama, the Deal Is Truly New

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- If there had been an empty chair at the Democratic convention this week, its ghostly occupant would have been Ronald Reagan.
Barack Obama admiringly referred to Reagan's transformational presidency during the 2008 election campaign. That enraged the Clintonites, but then-Senator Obama's take on the historical shifts in American politics was absolutely right. If you doubt that, just think back one week to the Republican convention, which was above all a coming-out party for Reagan's 21st-century heirs.
Reagan's legacy is so powerful because he identified the state as the central issue in American politics. That is still true today. Both in Tampa, Florida, where the Republican promise was to shrink the state, and in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the Democrats' promise is to transform the state into a more effective servant of the middle class, the big question is what government should do, and how big it should be. 
In 2008, Mr. Obama identified the force of Reagan's leadership because he aspired to have the same impact. But the problem for him -- and for American liberals in this century more broadly -- is that the task they have set for themselves is both harder to do and, crucially, harder to explain.
That argument is made eloquently in a newly published essay on the Obama presidency by Theda Skocpol, a Harvard professor and one of the country's foremost political theorists. If you read only one book about Mr. Obama this electoral season, read ''Obama and America's Political Future,'' the slim volume that includes Dr. Skocpol's essay and three smart responses. Together, they rise above the tick-tocks and polemics that characterize too much of the United States' political writing.
Dr. Skocpol's starting point is the comparisons between Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and Mr. Obama's ambitious plans -- often described as a New New Deal -- that were often made at the beginning of his administration. But that parallel, which was drawn by insiders as readily as by outsiders, misses one crucial historical difference: F.D.R. built the state from scratch, while Mr. Obama is trying to overhaul a massive state machine that has existed for decades.
''The things that happened in the 1930s were unprecedented in peacetime,'' Dr. Skocpol told me. ''That was hard, but citizens could get a sense that something new was happening. What is different for Obama is that there is a very elaborated federal apparatus that already exists.''
It is the difference between a start-up and turning around a big, troubled company, or, to use a more domestic metaphor, between building a brand-new house and renovating an old one.
''We know from economic and technology history -- it is easier to fill a space for the first time,'' Dr. Skocpol said. ''This is the same principle.''
Dr. Skocpol, who describes the Obama effort as ''redirecting'' the state, believes that task is difficult for many reasons. One is that change usually antagonizes vested interests; another is that, as the Obama administration has certainly shown, it often increases complexity.
When it comes to Election Day, renovation has a further, powerful disadvantage, compared with starting from scratch. When you build on a greenfield site, it is easy to show what you are doing and to explain how it is new. When you are working on a brownfield site, it is a lot harder to demonstrate what you've actually accomplished.
In the United States, the job of redirecting the state is further complicated by a phenomenon the author of another essay in this volume describes as the ''submerged state.'' Suzanne Mettler, a political science professor at Cornell University in New York State, coined the term to describe ''a whole number of public policies in the United States that are hard for people to perceive as such because of their design.''
The submerged state lurks most massively in tax policy, which provides huge benefits, but ones that are largely invisible to their recipients. The result is the familiar American paradox of beneficiaries of government largess who passionately call for a shrinking of the state.
''A lot of people derive a lot of benefits from public policy, but they don't recognize that the government is assisting them, so they are less likely to support government,'' Dr. Mettler told me. She cited a survey she did in which only 43 percent of respondents admitted to ever getting help from the government. When asked about specific programs, though, 96 percent turned out to have benefited from state largess.
When it comes to the campaign trail, the easiest platform is a start-up -- Americans love the shiny new thing. Next best is demolishing something that's old and rotten -- the appeal of Representative Paul D. Ryan's radical rhetoric is no accident.
Hardest of all is to promote a painstaking, time-consuming renovation -- which is exactly what U.S. government needs and what Mr. Obama, at his best, has promised to accomplish. To succeed, he needs to understand how different his new deal is from F.D.R.'s and why his transformation is a harder sell than Reagan's was. He needs the courage to remove the cloak of invisibility from America's submerged state. And when it is revealed to Americans in all of its complex and inefficient glory, he needs to come up with a clear plan not to make it bigger, but to make it better.

1912 Society Women Poor Insurance Risks
NEW YORK -- Society women are poor risks for insurance, according to the delegates at the annual Congress of American Life Insurance Companies at Chicago. Mr. Gold, the president of the congress, expressed this judgment, declaring: ''Women who live the so-called 'high-society' life have a hard time in getting insurances effected on their lives. The companies do not want to take them. They eat such indigestible foods and drink so many harmful beverages that their systems are soon wrecked, and they go by a quick route to the grave.'' On the other hand, other women are approaching such social, economic and financial independence that they are considered equally good risks as men, while self-supporting women are safer risks than most men because they are more temperate and their death-rate is lower. 
1937 Church Row Overshadows Birthday
BELGRADE -- The quarrel between the government and the Serbian Orthodox Church over the question of the Concordat with the Vatican created a difficult situation today [Sept. 6] when the fifteenth birthday of young King Peter was celebrated. It is customary that the members of the government attend the official mass in the main church of Belgrade on this day, but as the Patriarchate suspended the Orthodox Cabinet Ministers and those Deputies who voted for the Concordat from the rites of the Church it was not easy to find a compromise between tradition and the political tensions of the moment. Prince Regent Paul solved the problem by inviting Prime Minister Milan Stoyadinovitch and his Cabinet to the service in the chapel of the Royal Castle, whose chaplain could not refuse their admission.
1962 Fugitive Spy Avoids Plane To U.S.
LONDON -- Dr. Robert A. Soblen poisoned himself today [Sept. 6] and fell unconscious minutes before his scheduled deportation by plane to serve a life sentence in a United States prison. The fugitive spy was rushed to a hospital and doctors once again fought to keep him alive. Dr. Soblen swallowed a massive dose of barbiturates and became ill in an ambulance at the gates of London Airport, where a Pan American jet liner was waiting to take him to New York. The Home Office, which had ordered Dr. Soblen deported after his long, unsuccessful battle in the courts to be allowed political asylum, launched an investigation of how Dr. Soblen got the drugs and how he was able to swallow them unobserved. Dr. Soblen maintains that he is innocent and hopes President Kennedy will review his case.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Up The Economy

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention was a remarkable combination of pretty serious wonkishness -- has there ever been a convention speech with that much policy detail? -- and memorable zingers. Perhaps the best of those zingers was his sarcastic summary of the Republican case for denying President Obama re-election: ''We left him a total mess. He hasn't cleaned it up fast enough. So fire him and put us back in.''
Great line. But is the mess really getting cleaned up? 
The answer, I would argue, is yes. The next four years are likely to be much better than the last four years -- unless misguided policies create another mess.
In saying this, I'm not making excuses for the past. Job growth has been much slower and unemployment much higher than it should have been, even given the mess Mr. Obama inherited. More on that later. But, first, let's look at what has been accomplished.
On Inauguration Day 2009, the U.S. economy faced three main problems. First, and most pressing, there was a crisis in the financial system, with many of the crucial channels of credit frozen; we were, in effect, suffering the 21st-century version of the bank runs that brought on the Great Depression. Second, the economy was taking a major hit from the collapse of a gigantic housing bubble. Third, consumer spending was being held down by high levels of household debt, much of which had been run up during the Bush-era bubble.
The first of these problems was resolved quite quickly, thanks both to lots of emergency lending by the Federal Reserve and, yes, the much maligned bank bailouts. By late 2009, measures of financial stress were more or less back to normal.
This return to financial normalcy did not, however, produce a robust recovery. Fast recoveries are almost always led by a housing boom -- and given the excess home construction that took place during the bubble, that just wasn't going to happen. Meanwhile, households were trying (or being forced by creditors) to pay down debt, which meant depressed demand. So the economy's free fall ended, but recovery remained sluggish.
Now, you may have noticed that in telling this story about a disappointing recovery I didn't mention any of the things that Republicans talked about last week in Tampa, Fla. -- the effects of high taxes and regulation, the lack of confidence supposedly created by Mr. Obama's failure to lavish enough praise on ''job creators'' (what I call the ''Ma, he's looking at me funny!'' theory of our economic problems). Why the omission? Because there's not a shred of evidence for the G.O.P. theory of what ails our economy, while there's a lot of hard evidence for the view that a lack of demand, largely because of excessive household debt, is the real problem.
And here's the good news: The forces that have been holding the economy back seem likely to fade away in the years ahead. Housing starts have been at extremely low levels for years, so the overhang of excess construction from the bubble years is long past -- and it looks as if a housing recovery has already begun. Household debt is still high by historical standards, but the ratio of debt to G.D.P. is way down from its peak, setting the stage for stronger consumer demand looking forward.
And what about business investment? It has actually been recovering rapidly since late 2009, and there's every reason to expect it to keep rising as businesses see rising demand for their products.
So, as I said, the odds are that barring major mistakes, the next four years will be much better than the past four years.
Does this mean that U.S. economic policy has done a good job? Not at all.
Bill Clinton said of the problems Mr. Obama confronted on taking office, ''No one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years.'' If, by that, he meant the overhang of debt, that's very much the case. But we should have had strong policies to mitigate the pain while households worked down their debt, as well as policies to help reduce the debt -- above all, relief for underwater homeowners.
The policies we actually got were far from adequate. Debt relief, in particular, has been a bust -- and you can argue that this was, in large part, because the Obama administration never took it seriously.
But, that said, Mr. Obama did push through policies -- the auto bailout and the Recovery Act -- that made the slump a lot less awful than it might have been. And despite Mitt Romney's attempt to rewrite history on the bailout, the fact is that Republicans bitterly opposed both measures, as well as everything else the president has proposed.
So Bill Clinton basically had it right: For all the pain America has suffered on his watch, Mr. Obama can fairly claim to have helped the country get through a very bad patch, from which it is starting to emerge.

HEADLINE: Obama Reaches Out, Vowing a Rain Check

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Times are tough for the Obama campaign. It has resorted to commandeering bowling alleys and borrowing restaurants.
When ominous weather forced the campaign to move the president's nomination speech from Bank of America Stadium (capacity: 65,000) to the smaller Time Warner Cable Arena (capacity: closer to 20,000), the nation's most famous community organizer confronted a most unwelcome organizing test.
He suddenly had to mollify tens of thousands of disappointed supporters, who were out of a coveted ticket to hear him speak Thursday night. 
Aides quickly dusted off contingency plans, dismantling the stadium setup and its eight giant screens -- folding up the beige chairs that lined the floor, breaking down the gray and blue steps that led to the stage -- and reassembling their planned magic touches at the convention hall a mile away.
They braced for blowback. Mr. Obama himself picked up the phone, trying to buck up his demoralized supporters on a conference call: ''We can't let a little thunder and lightning get us down. We're going to roll with it.''
But in the end, they relied on that old, homespun (and cheap) standby: the watch party.
Though there were already more than 6,000 speech-watching parties set up across the country, the campaign scrambled -- using e-mail, text messages and Twitter -- to set up scores more in the Charlotte area. (A popular option: movie theaters.)
By the time the national anthem blared through the hall on Thursday night, 183 watch parties were already under way in North Carolina.
The campaign promised a rain check, saying that Mr. Obama would try to return here to give ticketless ticketholders a chance to see him up close.
Of course, not everyone was satisfied, and some fans headed to the airport a day early to try to beat the crush.
''Most of the people weren't really negative about it,'' said Paul Lowe-Chin, a shift manager at US Airways, who said he had seen a steady trickle of people Thursday taking advantage of the airline's policy allowing people to change their flights, no charge, to fly out early. ''They're disappointed, but they're not negative.''
Think of Something Good
They despise his economic policies, dislike his social views and dismiss his career in private equity.
But what, exactly, do the die-hard Democratic delegates here actually like about Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee?
We wanted to find out, scouring a sea of blue for a flash of bipartisan generosity.
It was in short supply.
Emma Gayle, a delegate from Pennsylvania, held her head in her hand, like a student struggling with an impossibly tough SAT question.
''I don't know. That's a stumper,'' she said. She thought about it for a few moments. ''He was good-looking growing up. That's all he's got in my book.''
Chet Whye, a delegate from New York, settled on this: ''He's tall.''
Leroy Brooks, of Mississippi, said, ''He looks presidential.''
Sheila Healy, from New York, was equally effusive: ''His wife is pretty.''
That's it, we wondered? She thought about it some more. ''When he was head of the Mormon church in Boston, he took care of his flock,'' she allowed, before finding fault. ''The question is whether he would help people who are not Mormon. I don't think so.''
Praise, when it came, was frequently of the backhanded variety. ''He was pro-choice at one time -- I like that,'' said Judy Calhoun, from Oklahoma.
Just when we had lost hope of discovering unqualified admiration for the opposition, we met Jeffrey Richardson, from Washington, who found something to like. ''Does he love America?'' he asked of Mr. Romney. ''Yes, he loves America.''

HEADLINE: Putin Says Missile Deal Is More Likely With Obama

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sauntered into American presidential politics on Thursday, praising President Obama as ''a very honest man'' and chastising the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, for describing Russia as ''without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.''
Mr. Putin was asked about the presidential race during an interview with the state-controlled television network RT. The interview was recorded earlier this week but broadcast on Thursday to coincide with Mr. Putin's arrival in Vladivostok for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit conference, which is being held in Russia for the first time. 
Mr. Putin said he believed that if Mr. Obama is re-elected in November, a compromise could be reached on the contentious issue of American plans for a missile defense system in Europe, which Russia has strongly opposed.
On the other hand, Mr. Putin said, if Mr. Romney becomes president, Moscow's fears about the missile system -- that it is, despite American assurances, actually directed against Russia -- would almost certainly prove true.
''Is it possible to find a solution to the problem, if current President Obama is re-elected for a second term? Theoretically, yes,'' Mr. Putin said, according to the official transcript posted on the Kremlin's Web site. ''But this isn't just about President Obama.
''For all I know, his desire to work out a solution is quite sincere,'' Mr. Putin continued. ''I met him recently on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, where we had a chance to talk. And though we talked mostly about Syria, I could still take stock of my counterpart. My feeling is that he is a very honest man, and that he sincerely wants to make many good changes. But can he do it? Will they let him do it?''
Mr. Putin mentioned the American military establishment and the State Department as obstacles to a compromise, and he said he faced similar challenges working with Russia's own generals and career diplomats.
With a reminder of Mr. Romney's remark about Russia, Mr. Putin was asked if he could work with a Romney administration.
''Yes, we can,'' he said. ''We'll work with whichever president gets elected by the American people. But our effort will only be as efficient as our partners will want it to be.''
He added a sharp rebuke, accusing Mr. Romney of using inflamed language for political gain.
That criticism might seem curious coming from Mr. Putin. His own campaign for office made use of some pointed anti-American talk, including criticism of the missile plan, claims that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had sent ''a signal'' to prompt antigovernment demonstrations after a disputed parliamentary election, and accusations that the American ambassador, Michael A. McFaul, was meddling in Russian domestic affairs.
''As for Mr. Romney's position, we understand that this is to a certain extent motivated by the election race,'' Mr. Putin said in the televised interview. ''But I also think that he was obviously wrong, because such behavior on the international arena is the same as using nationalism and segregation as tools of U.S. domestic policy. It has the same effect on the international arena when a politician, a person who aspires to lead a nation, especially a superpower like the U.S., proclaims someone to be an enemy.''
He then circled back to Russia's concerns about the missile defense program. ''Our American partners keep telling us, 'This is not directed against you.' But what happens if Mr. Romney, who believes us to be America's No. 1 foe, gets elected as president of the United States? In that case, the system will definitely be directed against Russia, as its infrastructure looks to be configured exactly for this purpose.
''And you also have to think about its strategic character -- it's built not for a year or even a decade -- and the chances that a man with Romney's views could come to power are quite high. So what are we supposed to do to ensure our security?''

HEADLINE: Putin's Ambitions Turn to the Far East

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is seizing on the Asia-Pacific economic summit conference being held here this weekend to turn assertively to the Far East, hoping to strengthen ties with the Pacific Rim and pursuing ambitious development in Russia itself, starting with this formerly secret naval fortress turned shipping hub on the Sea of Japan.
His timing could hardly seem better.
With major economies shaky in the European Union -- collectively Russia's largest trading partner -- and Japan's needing to buy vast new supplies of energy abroad, Russia, rich in gas and oil, is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in Asia as a hedge against any contraction of its business in the West. 
Mr. Putin's look eastward also has political dimensions, as he aims to strengthen ties, particularly with Beijing. For instance, Russia and China have used their alliance at the United Nations Security Council to veto more aggressive intervention in Syria sought by other powers, including the United States.
''Presently, the Russian-Chinese relations are at an unprecedented high level, and we have a lot of mutual trust both in politics and economy,'' Mr. Putin said in an interview with the state-controlled television channel, Russia Today, broadcast Thursday to coincide with his arrival in Vladivostok for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.
This is the first time that the annual economic summit meeting is taking place in Russia, and the government has spent more than $20 billion to upgrade the city's badly deteriorated infrastructure, with improvements that include a new airport, hundreds of miles of rebuilt roads and three new bridges.
One, the Russky Bridge, spanning two miles across the Eastern Bosporus to the sparsely populated island where the conference is being held, is now the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world.
There is a chance, despite Mr. Putin's ambitions, that his economic and policy goals will amount to wishful thinking, given the long history of mistrust and unease between Russia and its Asian neighbors. On the domestic front, critics say the infrastructure spending, particularly on the big bridge, which alone cost more than $1 billion, is the latest boondoggle in a country so troubled by corruption and mismanagement that projects typically run double the cost elsewhere.
By this view, the corruption is a sign of a broader lack of rule of law that makes investing in Russia a risky venture.
Despite those endemic concerns, there are signs that timing is on the Kremlin's side, if only by happenstance.
A blockbuster deal to sell liquefied natural gas to Japan, including construction of a $13 billion shipping terminal in Vladivostok, will be part of Mr. Putin's discussions this weekend with that country's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda.
Russia already sells liquefied natural gas to Japan from a port on Sakhalin Island managed by Gazprom, Shell and two Japanese investment companies, Mitsui and Mitsubishi. And though there have long been talks of another big gas deal, the virtual shuttering of Japan's nuclear power industry has left it with little choice but to increase energy imports.
The discussions will take place as European regulators have announced they are pursuing an antitrust investigation of Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled gas monopoly, which provides about one-quarter of the Continent's natural gas supply and is suspected of price fixing.
Given the rise in global energy demands, the Kremlin has maneuvered strategically to be able to redirect its gas sales to Asia should it encounter difficulties in Europe. It has also shown few qualms about using its dominant role in the energy sector for political aims, as it did when it limited gas supplies to Europe to punish Ukraine in 2006 and 2009, inadvertently shutting off supplies to several southeastern European nations.
Russia is also nearing completion of the second phase of a trans-Siberian oil pipeline, which already reaches the Chinese border and will soon stretch to the port of Kozmino, near Japan, increasing capacity and speeding shipments to Asian customers.
''Two-thirds of Russian territory is located in Asia, and yet the bulk of our foreign trade -- more than 50 percent -- comes from Europe, whereas Asia only accounts for 24 percent,'' Mr. Putin said in the interview with Russia Today, predicting huge growth.
Although energy is Russia's largest sector, it is not the only area of opportunity in Asia. As host, Russia set the meeting agenda, and Mr. Putin chose food security as a top issue -- a recognition of Russia's large, and growing, role in feeding the developing world with grain exports, and wider concerns about price spikes and social unrest.
Food exports also represent a potential windfall and closer bonds with Asia. ''Russian agriculture is the opportunity of the century,'' said Charles Robertson, global chief economist of Renaissance Capital, an investment bank that focuses on Russia.
With President Obama focused on his re-election campaign and the Democratic National Convention, he is not attending the conference this year, and American goals are more limited, focused largely on making progress on efforts begun at last year's meeting in Hawaii. The conference gathered representatives of 21 economies bordering the Pacific Ocean.
In Vladivostok, a city of just under 600,000 people that had been shrinking in population until recently, local officials are reveling in the attention from Moscow, including the creation of a new federal agency focused on the Far East, and the huge bounty of federal spending.
There is a new sewage treatment plant and a new campus for Far Eastern Federal University, on Russky Island, the site of the economic conference. Many roads and bridges are so new they do not appear on maps. ''It means quite a new life for the city,'' Roman V. Karmanov, a deputy mayor who has helped with the preparations, said of the improvements.
But not everything has gone smoothly.
Two new luxury hotels and a new opera house could not be finished in time for the conference. Part of the road leading to the big new bridge collapsed after a light rain this year and had to be rebuilt.
But others said the Russian Far East and Russia's relations with the Far East were ready to bloom, thanks to public and private investment. Sergei Sidirov, a vice governor of the Primorsky Krai region, said Moscow's commitment was unmistakable. ''You can feel that the federal government really cares about what is going on in the Far East,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Ryan, Perks Of Joining Ticket Can Be Weighty

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
COLORADO SPRINGS -- Flying high above the Rocky Mountains on Wednesday, Representative Paul D. Ryan and his brother Tobin jogged their memories to complete a list of the 14,000-foot summits below them that the vice-presidential nominee had climbed.
''We did that one; we did that one,'' they said, consulting a list of Colorado's famed ''Fourteeners.''
It was not an idle pursuit. After Mr. Ryan walked back a claim to have run an exceptionally fast marathon, scrutiny has fallen on his other sporting pursuits, including whether he might have exaggerated his mountain climbing prowess. In this case, the brothers figured that over two decades of visits to Colorado, he had climbed above 14,000 feet ''probably 38, 39 times'' -- potential ammunition against the doubters.
Four weeks ago, no one would have questioned such a detail of Mr. Ryan's résumé. But since he joined the Republican ticket, every scintilla of his life, every statement he has uttered has been open to inspection. His marathon claim was debunked by Runner's World, hardly known for political investigations. 
There is perhaps no faster escalator to political superstardom in America than to be plucked as a vice-presidential candidate. Mitt Romney has spent six years in the national spotlight seeking the presidency, but for Mr. Ryan, the overnight ascension and all its trappings -- speaking to millions in prime time at the Republican National Convention, a motorcade that stops traffic, imprisonment in a Secret Service bubble -- has brought little time to adjust.
''It's almost an out-of-body experience,'' said a senior adviser to Mr. Ryan. ''He's perplexed about it. 'Is all this for me?' He can't believe all this is going on around him.''
Longtime aides and family members say he is the same person they have always known and has risen to the challenge, even though the cumulative impact on the ticket of some recent stumbles has yet to be measured.
''People were kind of afraid for us and for Paul, thinking this is going to be overwhelming,'' Tobin Ryan, his older brother by five years, said. ''It's been the opposite. I see my brother; it amazes me day after day he rises to another level and wants to do more.''
Andy Speth, the congressman's Wisconsin-based chief of staff, said Mr. Ryan keeps grounded by sticking to routines from before his selection: having the same breakfast of Greek yogurt, berries and granola; performing his grueling P90X workout daily; speaking to his wife, Janna, each night when he arrives at his hotel.
''In some ways the routine's better,'' Mr. Speth said. ''As opposed to pulling out his cot and sleeping in that in his D.C. office, he's actually getting a real bed each night.''
Tobin Ryan remained on the campaign trail when the nominee's wife and their children peeled off after the convention. They sit together at the front of the chartered DC-9 campaign jet. When the ever-present campaign photographer, Kimberlee Hewitt, shot them the other day, Tobin sneaked out his arm and added bunny ears to his brother's head.
After delivering a speech, Mr. Ryan immediately seeks his brother's eye for feedback. ''We can read each other so well,'' Tobin said. ''All I have to do is glance back and he knows that he did it well.''
Other times the feedback is not so positive. ''I'll take notes,'' Tobin said. ''I'll say, here are three things.'' Tobin dinged his brother the other day for saying ''most free-est.''
Other slip-ups have been less innocent. In North Carolina this week, Mr. Ryan accused President Obama of having failed to revive the economy, but conflated a statistic for business bankruptcies with much more numerous personal bankruptcies.
The first time he accused the president of having failed to rescue a Wisconsin auto plant, three weeks ago, he implied that high gasoline prices caused by Mr. Obama led to the plant's shutdown, even though President George W. Bush controlled federal energy policy at the time.
In each case, after making the faulty assertion, Mr. Ryan quickly adjusted his talking points.
''He very much wanted to use the same statistic and get it right the next day,'' Michael Steel, Mr. Ryan's traveling spokesman, said of the bankruptcy figure. ''He cares about the facts; he cares about getting it right.''
The campaign rejected the notion that Mr. Ryan's backtracking some details is evidence of a pattern of inaccuracies, which some independent fact-checkers and the Obama campaign seized on after Mr. Ryan's convention speech. This week, Mr. Ryan emphatically denied that he had misled with statements about Medicare, the auto plant or a bipartisan debt commission.
But his assertion in a radio interview that he once ran ''a two-hour and 50-something'' marathon, a time revealed to be off by more than an hour, reinforced critics' notions that Mr. Ryan chose facts at his convenience.
Tobin Ryan said the race, which Paul ran in 1990 as a college student with the third Ryan brother, Stan, was so long ago it was easy to forget the exact time. ''I think they trained for three weeks,'' he said. ''They ran it on a whim.''
Skepticism over the marathon misstatement then led some to wonder if Mr. Ryan had exaggerated his mountain climbing. Last month, The Denver Post reported that Ryan Call, the chairman of the state Republican Party, said Mr. Ryan told him he had climbed nearly 40 of the state's 53 peaks over 14,000 feet.
Democrats in Colorado mocked that as implausible.
In an interview Thursday, Mr. Call said Mr. Ryan had stated only that he climbed ''a number of peaks,'' and that he had inferred the total from a 2009 article in The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. But that article said only that Mr. Ryan ''has made close to 40 climbs,'' not specifying the number of separate peaks.
After the Ryan brothers' in-flight calculations, the campaign issued a statement to The Post on Wednesday:
''Your article says he 'climbed 40 of Colorado's Fourteeners.' I'm not sure what the source for that is, but we wanted to add a little nuance. Paul Ryan has made nearly 40 climbs on 28 different peaks. We wanted to clear up any confusion. Thanks!''

HEADLINE: As Levees Hold Up, Outsiders Want In

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Campbell Robertson reported from LaPlace, La., and John Schwartz from New York.

 BODY:
LaPLACE, La. -- As the motorcade swept through waterlogged stretches of St. John the Baptist Parish earlier this week, Natalie Robottom, the parish president, made her case to President Obama. Using maps and force of will, she told him that while a new ring of levees had saved New Orleans from the waters of Hurricane Isaac, LaPlace and other communities in St. John, west of the city, were still unprotected despite years of study and discussion.
''I don't want more study,'' she said. ''Isaac studied it for us.''
New Orleans' old levees and flood walls failed catastrophically during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But with Isaac, the $14.5 billion system that has sprung up since then passed its first test. Naturally, those living outside the ring who found themselves flooded -- in Plaquemines Parish to the south, St. Tammany to the north and St. John to the west -- want the federal government to erect walls for them too, and on the same accelerated clock. 
Major financing is not likely, however, for reasons having to do with the nation's purse, its priorities and its methods of subjecting such projects to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
''There's a lot of competition for limited dollars,'' said Steven L. Stockton, the director of civil works for the Army Corps of Engineers. ''We have a backlog of $60 billion in authorized projects that we chip away at about $2 billion a year.''
Many communities in the region say they have waited decades for their federally built defenses against storms, while the corps studied seemingly without end and local officials insisted on their own proposals. Even when projects can move forward, Congress must decide whether to approve them and appropriate the funds.
The cost of damage to the region -- Louisiana has spent nearly $130 million so far responding to Isaac, with much of the money to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- and the economic importance of the energy and seafood industries make extending protection logical, said Garret Graves, the senior adviser on coastal issues to Gov. Bobby Jindal. ''You can't afford to not do this -- you are going to pay one way or another.''
The people of LaPlace say they have paid plenty already. Throughout St. John the Baptist Parish, nearly 7,000 homes were flooded, many of which had never flooded before -- not in Katrina and not even in Betsy in 1965. ''I've never heard of this area flooding,'' said Margaret Scott, a government worker who pointed to a mark two-thirds up her front door where the water had reached.
Mr. Graves said the areas of southeastern Louisiana that suffered the most in Isaac have been waiting on projects that have been studied as far back as 1971. The corps, he noted, has not strengthened Plaquemines' levees even though Congress has appropriated the money.
Col. Edward Fleming, the commander for the New Orleans district of the corps, said that some progress was being made and that the report on protection for Ms. Robottom's constituents should be completed by the end of the year. That could begin the process of moving the project through the executive and legislative branches. As for Plaquemines, he said, ''we're turning dirt'' on preliminary projects to strengthen the local levees.
After Katrina, the corps revised its protection standards, making defenses more effective but also far more expensive. ''Unless you have a large population at risk and great economic assets at risk, it's difficult nowadays to get those kinds of projects authorized and funded through the federal government,'' said Robert A. Turner Jr., the regional director for the levee board that covers much of greater New Orleans. ''That leaves it to the local and state governments to provide flood protection in some of those areas.''
The state is trying to step up. This year, Louisiana officials released a 50-year, $50 billion coastal master plan that calls for restoration projects for the rapidly disappearing wetlands, and includes $10.9 billion for structural protection measures. The state's plan proposes an $870 million ring levee around the small bayou town of Lafitte, even though the corps deemed a levee project covering Lafitte and several other communities in the area financially unjustifiable. The state plans to pay for the project from, among other sources, penalties and fines from the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and in revenue-sharing dollars from oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Gulf.
One of the most popular and ambitious elements of that master plan is a proposed multibillion-dollar barrier to block storm surge from Lake Pontchartrain, first proposed in the 1970s but abandoned by the corps in the face of opposition by environmental groups. By limiting the amount of water coming into the lake during storms, it could bring greater protection to several lakeside communities like LaPlace.
But the barrier is not ''some panacea,'' said Colonel Fleming of the corps, because Lake Pontchartrain is so large that storm winds alone can build up significant surge within the lake. It is also not clear whether cutting off such large bodies of water during a storm might shift the surge up the coast into Mississippi, whose residents are wary of the campaign to erect a barrier.
''They can't push water on another state,'' said Lisa Cowand, the president of the board of supervisors for Hancock County, just over the border. ''You can't just arbitrarily give someone else your trouble.'' She said that coastal Mississippi needs new levees of its own as well.
Similar concerns are being voiced all around Lake Pontchartrain, where many people believe that New Orleans' storm barriers actually shifted the flooding to them.
The corps has said it will study the matter, and Governor Jindal has called for ''an independent evaluation'' from an outside organization.
Mr. Turner, the levee board official, suggested that the likelier cause of the flooding was the fact that Isaac was a large, slow-moving storm, which pushed water into and across Lake Pontchartrain. ''Had the surge barrier not been there, you could potentially have had more water in Lake Pontchartrain'' coming into the lake through the city's navigation canal.
Even if everyone who wants a new levee were to get one, said Tim Doody, the president of the New Orleans-area levee board, no one should feel completely safe in a place where the land is rapidly sinking while the sea level is rising, and where destructive hurricanes are becoming all too frequent. ''No matter what we build,'' he said, ''Mother Nature is going to send us something that will test it.''

HEADLINE: New Book Details Struggle Behind Failed Deficit Talks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jennifer Steinhauer, Annie Lowrey and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A new book by the journalist Bob Woodward chronicles the descent of Barack Obama's Washington into partisan trench warfare and mines the minutiae of the largely failed negotiations between House Republicans and the White House to tame the nation's deficit problem over the last two years.
In details down to the gum chewed by President Obama (Nicorette) and the wine sipped by the House Speaker John A. Boehner (merlot), ''The Price of Politics'' paints a portrait of dysfunction that began even before Mr. Obama was inaugurated and has only grown worse. 
The book highlights problems that are well known in Washington, but Mr. Woodward manages to get the president, Mr. Boehner and their inner circles to talk about them. Mr. Boehner criticizes the rudderless leadership of the White House staff while President Obama maintains that the speaker never really wanted to cut a deal last summer when the two tried to negotiate a ''grand bargain'' to lower spending, raise revenue and increase the nation's debt limit.
The book goes on sale next Tuesday, but The New York Times was able to buy a copy on Thursday from a retailer.
With the presidential election weeks away, the book will do little to reshape Mr. Obama's image as a powerful man steering the government forward, but it is also unlikely to engender much support for Republican leaders in Congress who seem unable to control their members.
The book makes clear that any hope of bipartisanship after Mr. Obama's 2008 victory evaporated even before his inauguration. It paints negotiations between the Obama White House and Congressional Republican leaders as talks between camps speaking different languages.
During his transition, Mr. Woodward recounts, Mr. Obama convened a meeting with Republicans to map out an economic stimulus bill. From the start, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia and now the majority leader, is painted as the biggest obstructionist.
Mr. Woodward demonstrates early on a desire by Mr. Cantor to reduce programs for the poor, including eliminating nutrition and education financing, increasing work requirements for those on food stamps and cutting certain job training programs. Those efforts underlie the fight over legislation to this day.
The interactions between Mr. Obama and Ivan Seidenberg, then the chief executive of Verizon, which Mr. Woodward uses to illustrate Mr. Obama's often frosty relations with business, read like the meeting of men from different planets. Mr. Seidenberg lectures the president on business and the importance of private enterprise. Mr. Obama reacts indignantly to what White House officials see as disrespect.
''With all due respect, we will be here when you're gone,'' Mr. Seidenberg is quoted as telling Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser and Obama confidante. Mr. Woodward also asserts that the current plan to reduce the deficit by making larger cuts to both military and general spending next year originated with the White House. Mr. Obama's aides, the book says, used a 1985 law as the model for the trigger, or ''the fiscal cliff,'' to help come to a deal.
Last summer's bitter budget negotiations have been hashed over in several lengthy news accounts and Mr. Woodward's is the most exhaustive, although it is not clear how much new information, if any, he has uncovered.
He does make it clear they came tantalizingly close to a deal: ''As other accounts have noted, a separate, bipartisan Senate proposal rocked the negotiations. There were signs of fractiousness in both the Democratic and Republican caucuses. Even if Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner made a deal, it was not clear that Congress would pass it.
The ultimate problem, the book suggests, was a lack of leadership by both Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama.
Mr. Boehner said that none of Mr. Obama's staff -- including William M. Daley, then his chief of staff -- were ''steering the ship underneath him.''
''They never had their act together,'' Mr. Boehner tells Mr. Woodward. He added: ''It's not that they're bad people. But there's no structure.''
High-ranking White House officials laughed off Mr. Boehner's criticism, saying that Mr. Boehner was the one who did not steer his own ship, a view Mr. Obama also seemed to ascribe to.
''I think John wanted to get a deal,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview with Mr. Woodward. ''And I think that, had he had more control of his caucus, we could have gotten a deal done a month earlier.''

HEADLINE: An Ex-President Back in the Limelight

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term'' (front page, Sept. 6):
No one in modern political history can command a stage or fill an arena with emotion better than William Jefferson Clinton. His impassioned speech Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention was undeniably a masterful combination of powerful word and images delivered with an ''I feel your pain'' emotional tone.
Already heralded as one of the greatest convention speeches ever by the political pundits (of both parties), it may have snared enough undecided voters over to the Obama column to swing an election. 
KEN DEROW Swarthmore, Pa., Sept. 6, 2012
To the Editor:
Your editorial about muted Democrats (''Words Not Spoken,'' Sept. 5) applies especially to Congressional Democrats who risk loss of control of both chambers.
With the Republican Party and ticket in the hammerlock of the far right -- climate change is a hoax, abortion is murder, regulations impose only costs, never benefits -- Democrats should never be defensive or defeatist.
Since wars are won not by Dunkirks but by Normandys, party leaders should show leadership in two ways:
¶Let's vividly reframe issues so that G.O.P. platitudes and metaphors -- states' rights! overreach! speech for corporations! -- don't pass for analysis. Democratic Party leaders need to declare that the issue in 2012 isn't the size of government but its common purpose: democracy, prosperity and security. In America, you can't love your country and hate your government, since we are the government.
¶Among the things that make Democrats exceptional is Franklin D. Roosevelt's axiom that we pursue ''bold, persistent experimentation.'' Where are the successors to Social Security and the G.I. Bill to help Democrats both win and govern? What are they for?
Among other ideas: a living wage, a carbon tax, a Mortgage Refinancing Trust agency, progressive tax reform, real immigration reform, filibuster reform, public funding for public elections, universal voter enrollment.
It's time for Congressional Democrats to expose an extreme pretending to be mainstream and to propose a ''progressive patriotism'' that lives up to Walt Whitman's promise that ''America is always becoming.''
MARK GREEN GARY HART New York, Sept. 5, 2012

To the Editor:
The biggest contrast between the Democratic and Republican conventions was the decision to have the last Democratic president nominate the party's candidate. The Republicans, for their part, did their best to pretend that George W. Bush never held office.
The reasons behind the Republicans' tactical decision are the strongest arguments for re-electing President Obama.
The Republican Party leadership understands that even a cameo by Mr. Bush would remind voters that a vote for the Republican Party is a vote for a return to his deeply and justifiably unpopular policies.

HEADLINE: The Ad Campaign: Recalling a Less Friendly Time

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
3:12 p.m. | Updated Bill Clinton proved Wednesday night to be one of President Obama's most forceful and substantive surrogates, but he has hardly been the most consistent. In fact, in a new ad, Mitt Romney's campaign is reminding voters that Mr. Clinton was once a sharp critic of Mr. Obama, in 2008. 
"Give me a break," Mr. Clinton said in New Hampshire on the eve of that state's primary more than four years ago, when Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Obama were in a tight race for the Democratic nomination. "This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen," he said of Mr. Obama's position on the Iraq war.
Mr. Clinton's words drew immediate criticism from Democrats, especially African-Americans.
The ad notes that Mr. Clinton is sounding a different tune today, though it casts him as "a good soldier, helping his party's president" after being called upon to support a "failing campaign."
The narrator then recites recent unemployment figures and says that the middle class is falling "further behind" before the "Give me a break" clip rolls a second time.
The Romney camp has spoken well of Mr. Clinton's presidency. Stumping in Iowa on Wednesday, Representative Paul D. Ryan, the vice-presidential nominee, noted Mr. Clinton's economic successes and said that Mr. Romney would save the welfare reforms that the 42nd president enacted.
The Romney campaign declined to provide any details about where the ad was running, its standard practice. But after Mr. Clinton's 48-minute convention speech, one thing is clearly better off than it was four years ago: the Clinton-Obama relationship.
Update: A statement from Lis Smith, an Obama spokeswoman, echoed Mr. Clinton's words from Wednesday night: "It takes a lot of brass for Mitt Romney to cite President Clinton, who last night dismantled the falsehoods upon which Mitt Romney's entire campaign is based. As President Clinton said, President Obama 'inherited a deeply damaged economy, put a floor under the crash, began the long hard road to recovery,' and because of his leadership, we're moving forward. But Mitt Romney and Congressman Ryan would make things worse and take us back to the same failed trickle-down policies that caused the crash and devastated the middle class in the first place. The Romney campaign's too cute by half ads can't change that simple fact."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Out Of the Shadows: A Speech Makes History

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Benita Veliz was only at the lectern at the Democratic convention for a few minutes on Wednesday night. CNN did not even turn its cameras on the stage during her brief speech. But for many Latinos in the hall, her moment under the lights was a stunning surprise.
Ms. Veliz, 27, who is from San Antonio, is a leader of a group of young undocumented immigrants who call themselves Dreamers, because they would be eligible for legal status under a bill, long stalled in Congress, called the Dream Act. Her speech was the highest profile public appearance to date by an immigrant from that movement, and it was a measure of how young people have emerged from the shadows despite their illegal status. 
Like Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, a Latino who gave the convention's keynote address on Tuesday, Ms. Veliz narrated an immigration story.
"I was brought here as a child. I've been here ever since," she said. "I graduated as valedictorian of my class at the age of 16 and earned a double major at the age of 20. I know I have something to contribute to my economy and my country."
But Ms. Veliz's story had a catch: "I've had to live almost my entire life knowing I could be deported just because of the way I came here," she said.
She praised President Obama for an executive action he took in June to suspend the deportation of undocumented students and give them work permits. As many as 1.7 million young immigrants could be eligible, and in an interview after her speech, Ms. Veliz said she was one of them and was preparing her application.
Until recently Latinos were showing signs of disappointment with Mr. Obama, because he failed to keep a promise to pass an immigration overhaul and deported large numbers of immigrants. But to many Latino and immigrant advocates, Ms. Veliz's time on the stage was a sign that the Obama campaign will not shy away from the thorny issue of illegal immigration, but will work to rally Latino voters with pledges to pass the Dream Act in a second term.
"It was a sign of acceptance for Dreamers at the highest political levels that would have been unthinkable even three years ago," said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, which advocates for legislation to give legal status to illegal immigrants. "The president leaned in to the issue instead of steering clear of it, and it is putting a lot of pressure on Republicans who labeled these immigrants as criminals in their platform."
Not everyone in the Dreamer movement is so enthusiastic. On Tuesday, 10 undocumented immigrants were arrested as they blocked traffic near the convention center in protest. They came to Charlotte after a two-month journey on a bus from Phoenix to demand that Mr. Obama do more to help those immigrants gain a legal foothold in this country. They came straight to the Democratic convention without stopping at the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., saying they held no hope for help from Republicans.
The Republicans said little on illegal immigration during their convention, since it has been divisive for them and statements by the candidates during the nominating fight distanced the party from Latino voters who could be a major factor in several swing states in November.
Dan Stein, the president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that favors many tough curbs on illegal immigration that Republicans have endorsed, said Ms. Veliz's appearance at the Democratic convention was "nothing more than a celebration of lawlessness."

HEADLINE: The Tourist Tax Trap

BYLINE: DANIEL POLITI


HIGHLIGHT: Argentina's new tax on credit-card purchases abroad is an excuse for the government to scrutinize travelers' financial records. 

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES - In its protracted battle to close off access to the foreign exchange market in this dollar-crazy country, the Argentine government is now picking a fight with credit card users.
Stringent restrictions on foreign currency have led to soaring credit-card use abroad: Paying by plastic is one of the few ways Argentine travelers have of avoiding the black market premium on dollar bills, currently 36 percent.
No longer. Starting in October, Argentine banks will automatically apply a 15 percent fee on all purchases made with credit or debit cards abroad.
Argentina isn't the first country to tax foreign purchases: Brazil does, too (at 6 percent). But the way the government announced the measure - first insisting the fee would only apply to credit cards, then extending it to debit cards and purchases on foreign Web sites - reveals a make-it-up-as-you-go approach to patching up problems of its own creation.
Officials describe the new fee as a way of encouraging domestic tourism and combating capital flight. That might seem innocuous enough, but when Ricardo Echegaray, head of the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos, the national tax agency, said last Friday, "We prefer that people stay and spend their summers inside the country," he set Argentines on edge with fears of state-mandated vacation destinations.
On Monday he tried to backpedal - only to make matters worse. "Those who are current with their taxes can travel," he said. "Wherever and whenever they want." The implication was clear: The government wants to crack down on tax cheats and will use the new measure to scrutinize travelers' financial records.
In fact, along with the 15 percent surcharge, the government will also require banks to hand over to the AFIP detailed data of all their customers' purchases. The agency has vowed that, armed with this data, it will make sure travelers pay the officially required but usually ignored 50-percent customs duty on goods worth more than $300.
This raises a number of questions. How can the AFIP know that if I bought an iPad in New York, I didn't give it to someone else before returning to Argentina? Short of catching buyers in flagrante at the border or searching their homes, it seems impossible to prove that they brought something into the country at all.
Officials insist that the surcharge isn't a tax but a credit that Argentines can use to offset income and personal-wealth taxes; come tax time, the government says, it will refund those who have paid more than they owe. But with inflation running at 25 percent, much of the refunds' value will have been eaten up before they are even handed out.
What's more, demanding reimbursement seems like asking for trouble: It's like begging tax inspectors to take a closer look at your records. Tax evasion is rampant in Argentina. People don't just try to slip a new laptop by customs, they pay for an apartment in cash so they can declare it costs less than it really does. Many, particularly the self-employed, keep much of their earnings off the books. To bypass taxes is celebrated as a mark of cunning.
It's cunning that costs the government, of course. Some experts say the state receives only half the income taxes it could be collecting. 
So, yes, more control is necessary. But not this kind. What Argentina really needs is a top-down fiscal reform that would make paying taxes feel less like being taken for a fool. Yet in almost a decade in power, the self-described populist governments of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and of her late husband Néstor before her, have failed to pass no-brainer measures, like extending capital-gains tax to financial transactions.
Tax reform, which is always controversial, is best carried out when the economy is booming. With Argentina's economy slumping, the president's approval ratings dropping and a critical midterm election next year, only piecemeal measures should be expected.
And we know what those look like. Answering questions about the new 15 percent surcharge this week, Echegaray said Argentines who pay in pesos for packaged tours to go abroad wouldn't have to pay the fee "yet."
To be continued.

HEADLINE: Will 6 Species Perish? Asia's Conservation Crossroads

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: Will threatened species go the way of the passenger pigeon? Asian nations are reminded of the turning point the United States faced a century ago. 

 BODY:
On Sept. 1, 1914, the last passenger pigeon on earth died in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo. The species, once numbering in the billions, had been hunted to extinction.
Around the same time, another iconic North American species, the bison, was also being hunted past the point of no return. But the bison didn't die off steadily until the last one perished in an enclosure. The species rebounded, and today shaggy herds meander through Yellowstone National Park, blissfully unaware of how close they came to being wiped out.
This week, the story of the passenger pigeon and the bison is being highlighted halfway across the globe, at a conference organized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Jeju, South Korea. The Wildlife Conservation Society has circulated a list of Asian species that are at a "conservation crossroads" and are desperately in need of the sort of concerted effort that prevented the bison from going the way of the passenger pigeon. 
The list includes the tiger, orangutans, Mekong giant catfish, Asian rhinos, Asian giant river turtles, and Asian vultures. Some of the biggest threats to those species are the conversion of land to palm oil plantations and poaching for the illegal wildlife trade.

Joe Walston, executive director of Asia programs for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the conference comes at a critical moment for the region. "Asia is going through many of the changes that took place in North America a century ago and is fast becoming a global economic powerhouse," he said. "But along with that comes the impacts of development." 
Action by governments will be critical to success, he added. "As a region, Asia now really has total control over what happens to the species in the area. Governments finally have the capacity and financial means to turn the tide on extinctions, if they choose to accept the responsibility," he said.
India is receiving recognition at the conference for an explicit high-profile commitment that it made in 1972 to protect wild tigers within its borders. "India took full responsibility for the fate of its wild tigers," Dr. Walston said. "As a result, India is now the global center of tiger conservation."
What conservation officials long for are parallel commitments from other countries in the region, including tough crackdowns on the illegal wildlife trade. 
"Currently, Asia is one of the leading consumers of wildlife and wildlife products," Dr. Walston said. "Asia will thus define not only the destiny of local species but species from around the world."

HEADLINE: Share of Men in Labor Force at All-Time Low

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Just 69.8 percent of all men over age 16 were either working or looking for work in August. 

 BODY:
Friday's jobs report for August was chock full of all sorts of bad news. Among the most distressing: The share of men actively participating in the labor force -- that is, working or looking for work -- was at an all-time low.
Just 69.8 percent of all men over age 16 were in the labor force in August, compared to a long-term average of 78.3 percent since the Labor Department began tracking these data in 1948. The share has been falling pretty steadily over the last six decades but has declined sharply in the last few years.
Some of this could be attributed to the fact that the country has been aging, so more people are of retirement age. But the participation rate has also fallen dramatically for men of prime working age, 25-54:
There are many competing (or in some cases complementary) arguments for why the share of men in the labor force has been declining. 
For example, a lot of traditionally male jobs, in industries like manufacturing and construction, have disappeared, and many of the men who were displaced gave up looking for work when they couldn't find similar jobs.
The federal disability rolls have also skyrocketed, and when people go on disability, they rarely return to the labor force:
Additionally, the share of women in the labor force rose steadily from the 1940s to the late 1990s. There is some debate about what effect this had on men's employment. Most economists I've spoken with have argued that women were not "taking" men's jobs, especially since for a long time "women's work" was distinctly different from "men's work" and the total employment pie was growing. At the very least, though, the entrance of more women into the job market theoretically made it less essential for married men to work, even if women tend to be in much lower-paying jobs.
What say you, readers? Why do you think the share of men working has fallen so dramatically?

HEADLINE: Not Looking, but Still Wanting to Work

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The share of people who are not in the labor force but say they still want a job has generally been rising since the recession began almost five years ago. 

 BODY:
The number of people not in the labor force -- that is, neither working nor looking for work -- rose by almost 600,000 in August.
Most of the Americans who are "not in the labor force" are categorized as such because they are retired, stay-at-home parents or otherwise not interested in holding a job. But there are also a lot of people who really want to work but have decided not to bother looking for jobs because they think the job market is too discouraging or because they are too busy with training, family responsibilities and so forth.
This group of people who want to work but aren't looking are sometimes referred to as the shadow unemployed. Their share of the not-in-labor-force population has generally been rising since the recession began almost five years ago: 
In December 2007, when the recession officially started, 5.9 percent of people counted as "not in labor force" said they wished they were working. As of last month, that share was 7.8 percent.
Surprisingly, the share of people who weren't in the labor force but still wanted jobs was actually higher in the mid-1990s, when the Labor Department first started collecting these numbers. In January 1994, 10.3 percent of the people who were not actively looking for a job said they actually wished they were working.
I'm not sure why that's the case; given how poor the job market is today, you'd think an especially high share of people who have dropped out of the labor force did so because they were discouraged, not because they stopped wanting a job.
One possible reason the share of people out of the labor force who want work isn't higher is that school enrollment has risen sharply since the 1990s. A lot of out-of-the-labor-force Americans -- particularly young people, and particularly young women -- have resigned themselves to not finding a job anytime soon and have decided instead to invest in improving their skills while they wait for the economy to improve.

HEADLINE: What Ails the U.S.?

BYLINE: ANAND GIRIDHARADAS


HIGHLIGHT: People across the political spectrum are peddling the notion that America is in big trouble. And their diagnoses vary. It's the schools! The high taxes! The low taxes! The unions! The corporations! The greed of the rich! The sloth of the poor! What do you think most ails the United States today? 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - Like hawkers on a crowded street, observers of all persuasions are busy peddling the notion that America is in big trouble.
The diagnoses vary. It's the schools! The high taxes! The low taxes! The unions! The corporations! The greed of the rich! The sloth of the poor! It's all about culture! It's all about economics!
In this week's Currents column, I examine two of the more common (and bipartisan) diagnoses: that America's elites are seceding from the rest of society; and that the promise of the American Dream - that one's future can be made different from the past, with effort and some luck - no longer holds true for many millions.
What these diagnoses, made by various people of various backgrounds, have in common is this: They identify problems more commonly associated with the third world than the first.

What do you think most ails the United States today? What is your own diagnosis?
And what do you make of the idea that America is losing its common culture and becoming something of a caste society? Or that "future preference," which once seemed to define the United States, is yielding to something more like fatalism and resentment?

HEADLINE: Life Without Indian Point, Redux

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A study sponsored by Westchester County business coalitions disputes the notion that shutting down the Indian Point nuclear plant would cause no significant problems. 

 BODY:
The consequences of running the Indian Point nuclear reactors or shutting them down run from easy-to-spot to hard-to-calculate. 
Is a serious accident plausible? Would retiring the reactors open the way for alternative sources of electricity that pose a lower safety risk? Or simply ensure an economic blow? 
Two Westchester County business groups have sponsored a study, released on Friday, that takes the latter view -- a counterpoint a 2011 study by opponents that argued that there was nothing indispensable about the reactors. 
The new report, by Howard J. Axelrod, a longtime economics consultant, predicts payroll and tax payment losses (which seem pretty certain) and takes a stab at predicting electricity rate increases and a general decline in economic activity. The study was sponsored by the Business Council of Westchester (of which Entergy, Indian Point's owner, is a member), and the Westchester Business Alliance 
The report updates a version commissioned by Westchester business interests four years ago. 
 Some of the numbers are straightforward. Indian Point has 1,200 employees and uses another 200 contractors. The employee payroll is $130 million, and the plant pays $75 million in property taxes plus additional taxes to New York State. 
The study quotes an earlier estimate that the plant contributes $363 million to local purchases. (Some fraction of the payroll and property taxes would continue during the decommissioning of the plant's reactors.) A high-efficiency natural gas plant of the same capacity might employ only 20 workers, the study said. 
It's a little harder to estimate the effect on electric rates.

New York State's electricity system relies on a complicated auction method whereby utilities like Con Edison say how much electricity they think they will need and generating companies say what price they need to produce electricity. 
A computer tallies up the demand and ranks the suppliers by price, from lowest to highest. It then decides which generators will run, beginning with the lowest-priced and continuing until demand is met, with the last megawatt-hour being the priciest. Yet all generators get paid the price demanded by the last supplier. 
Indian Point is a relatively low-cost supplier. If it disappears, the computer will have to reach higher into the stack of generation offers to match supply to demand, and that last megawatt-hour will be more expensive. So all generators will receive more income, and all consumers will pay more. 
Mr. Axelrod's study puts Indian Point's energy costs at $44 to $53 per megawatt-hour. He says that the least costly alternative would be a plant burning natural gas at high efficiency, which would cost $76 to $109 per megawatt-hour. He estimates an increase in electricity rates of 6.3 percent, or $374 million a year. 
Of the two functioning Indian Point reactors (Unit 1 closed down in 1974), Unit 2's license expires in 2013, and Unit 3's in 2015. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has yet to turn down a request for a license extension, although it wants some steps to be taken on safety at the plant. 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants the plant retired, and while the state has no jurisdiction over safety, it is trying to deny a vital water-use permit. Under the commission's rules, the plant's existing licenses are valid beyond their expiration dates if an application for a renewal is still under consideration. 
The debate over the effects of shutting down the plant will surely drag on.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Numbers: Complaints on a Much Anticipated Jobs Report

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: With the importance of jobs to Americans, many of whom have long been out of work, it's no wonder the monthly jobs report gets so much weight. But some experts, and some readers, think it gets too much emphasis, or the wrong kind. 

 BODY:
There's a drumroll beforehand and a great crashing of cymbals as it happens. It's the federal government's monthly report on the nation's employment - a matter that's given huge political weight in the current presidential campaign, as Jim Rutenberg's news analysis on today's front page makes clear. The Wall Street Journal and many other news organizations also gave it front-page treatment, before the fact.
It's also a matter that is open to all kinds of interpretation.
The Times gave the report major display on its home page this morning in a story by Nelson D. Schwartz, beginning with a headline that emphasized both the positive and the negative: Hiring Slowed in August; Jobless Rate Fell to 8.1%. Later, the political element was added in a revised headline: Hiring Slows in August, Adding to Pressure on Fed and Obama.
With the importance of jobs to Americans, many of whom have been out of work for long months and years, it's no wonder this report gets so much weight. But some experts, and some readers, think it gets too much emphasis, or the wrong kind.
Betsey Stevenson, former chief economist at the Department of Labor and now an academic economist at the University of Michigan, put it this way when I asked her about it this morning, having seen one of her Twitter messages on the subject.
The media tends to overreact and overinterpret the employment number. For instance, the (Times's) first line said, "Job growth slowed substantially." Given that it isn't a statistically significant change, it's pretty hyperbolic to say "substantially." If the number is revised up 40K when revisions are released next month, will The Times lead with the statement "August job growth was revised up substantially"? I don't think so.
I'm not trying to downplay today's disappointing number, but we are measuring change on a base of 133 million jobs and telling the difference between a change of 96K versus 141K is a small change which may reflect measurement error or a slowdown. Since we can't tell the difference yet, calling it a substantial slowdown is wrong.
I asked Deputy Business Editor Winnie O'Kelley to respond. One can quibble with the wording, she said, "but we try to get the tone and tenor right, and I think we did." There is little question, she said, "that the picture is disappointing." She noted, too, that later versions of the story on the Web, and in Saturday's paper, would delve into the numbers more deeply.
But she rejects the notion that the numbers are overemphasized. "This was the most important jobs report of the year - not just politically, but because the Fed meets next week and will make decisions based on it about stimulating the economy," she said.
For the average American, Ms. O'Kelley says, "it's an important barometer."
A Times reader, Alex Dering, has strong feelings on the subject, for different reasons.
In an e-mail today, he wrote to me about what he considers an important missing element:
Although Mr. Schwartz's article makes very clear that the drop in unemployment is simply a mathematical sleight-of-hand as more people simply cross into the gray zone of no longer counting as a statistic, The New York Times still resists even a hint of a whisper of a murmur of the U-6 statistic, which puts the number of people who are not employed or who are underemployed -- underemployed is a technical term meaning "starving to death more slowly than the unemployed" -- at 14.6%: One in seven.
Unemployment -- in the genuine, I-can't-pay-the-rent sense of the term -- is very high. Media complacency (or complicity) in selectively presenting only some of the facts allows politicians to either ignore the issue outright or manipulate it to divisive ends as an endless parade of stats are presented to shore up both, contradictory, positions on the issue.
Why won't The Times clearly state the U-6 figure on a regular basis? This isn't a partisan issue; millions of people of all political stripes are going to the poorhouse, and The Times stands there like Officer Barbrady -- "Move along, nothing to see here. Move along." Unless someone with the authority and clout to do so starts shaming our elected officials into addressing the issue, it will simply go around and around while what's left of the middle class disappears.
Ms. O'Kelley responded that she and her staff were well aware of the U-6 number, and that "we do look at it," whenever The Times is reporting on unemployment.
However, "continuity over time is important. We use the official number of unemployed as the benchmark."
It's a number people understand as a basis for comparison, she said. "Generally speaking, the trends are similar."
In the case of both of these issues, context is important. We're likely to see more of that - and the more the better -- in the in-depth treatment of the Friday's jobs report in Saturday's paper.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $6.3 Million

BYLINE: ROBIN FINN


HIGHLIGHT: A four-bedroom triplex condo, with high ceilings and dramatic skylights, was owned by Thomas Krens, the former Guggenheim director. 

 BODY:
A luminous TriBeCa penthouse at 45-47 Warren Street, acquired in 1999 by Thomas Krens during his provocative tenure as the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York, sold for $6.3 million and was the most expensive residential sale of the week, according to city records.
The centerpiece of the four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath triplex condominium, which had been listed at $7 million with Amalia Ferrante, a broker at the Corcoran Group, is a 50-foot-wide living room with 22-foot ceilings, dramatic skylights and a wood-burning fireplace. The commodious dining room, also brightened by skylights, was populated by 20 dining room chairs designed by Frank Gehry (Mr. Krens has a fondness for functional artwork), and the studio on the third level is embraced by a 900-square-foot terrace. 
The five-story marble-faced, Italianate-style building, built circa 1854 on land leased from Trinity Church, holds just four residential lofts above its commercial storefront. Long before its conversion to multimillion-dollar lofts for discriminating downtown buyers, 45-47 Warren Street began its mercantile life as headquarters for Sutton, Beach & Company, a purveyor of cloth, cashmere and vestments.
Mr. Krens, whose notion of a neat vacation is racing motorcycles across Russia in the company of Dennis Hopper and Jeremy Irons, and whose idea of an edgy museum exhibition was "The Art of the Motorcycle," paid $2.35 million for the penthouse and briefly listed it for sale for $5.5 million with Ms. Ferrante in the summer of 2005. Rumors regarding his impending exit from the helm of the Guggenheim started then but weren't confirmed until he stepped aside in 2008. His current Guggenheim role is as a senior adviser for international affairs.
According to The Chronicle of Philanthropy, Mr. Krens bought the penthouse with the assistance of a $500,000 interest-free loan from the Guggenheim Foundation despite his having already borrowed $1 million a decade earlier to buy a cozy domicile on Fifth Avenue: he convinced the foundation that the penthouse was essential for grand scale, statement-making entertainment of potential museum donors.
Presumably the buyers of the penthouse, Andrew and Allison Isaacs, represented by Richard Orenstein of Halstead Property, also have a knack for hosting parties.

HEADLINE: Garda Security Gets $1.1 Billion Buyout Offer

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: The founder of Garda World Security, an armored car and security company based in Montreal, has joined with the private equity firm Apax Partners to make a $1.1 billion offer to take the company private. 

 BODY:
QUEBEC CITY _ The founder, chairman and chief executive of Garda World Security, an armored car and security company based in Montreal, joined forces with a private equity fund to make a $1.1 billion offer to take the company private on Friday.
In league with the chief executive, Stéphan Crétier, is Apax Partners, the London-based private equity. The consortium's $12-a-share offer includes the assumption of $625 million in debt.
Garda was founded in 1995 by Mr. Crétier with an investment of $25,000. The company went on a largely debt financed shopping spree during the 2000s, which made it the second largest cash handling company in the United States after Brink's. But the financial crisis in 2008 and problems with its acquisition of ATI Systems International caused to the company to violate the terms of some loan agreements. And its stock price plummeted.
 The company eventually refinanced its debt and its operations have recovered along with the financial services sector. But the company's relatively high debt had depressed its share price.
The consortium's offer is 30 percent higher than Thursday's closing share price on the Toronto stock exchange. Following the recommendation of a committee of independent directors, Garda's board has unanimously endorsed the offer. Mr. Crétier abstained from that process.
In a statement, Mr. Crétier suggested that Garda would be able to acquire additional companies more easily once it stops being publicly traded.
"We intend to continue to pursue our growth strategy both organically and through acquisitions, which we can more efficiently accomplish as a private company," Mr. Crétier said.
The company separately announced on Friday that it had earned $4.9 million in its second quarter, up from $3.8 million during the same period last year. Revenue rose 13.7 percent, to $337 million during the quarter.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Office Shines Spotlight on Broadway

BYLINE: SCOTT HELLER


HIGHLIGHT: The first winners of annual awards celebrating Broadway include Chita Rivera and Tommy Tune. 

 BODY:
As part of an effort to celebrate Broadway, which contributes $11 billion to the New York economy, the mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment has named its first annual Spotlight Award winners. Among them are Chita Rivera, the actress and dancer; Charles Strouse, the composer of "Bye Bye Birdie" and "Annie"; Arlene Dahl, the actress and author; and Tommy Tune, the actor, director and choreographer.
The awards, which "recognize and honor individuals in the theatrical community who have made a significant contribution to Broadway over a 10 year period," will be announced on Sunday as part of Broadway on Broadway, a free concert in which cast members from new and continuing shows perform in Times Square.
The other winners are better known inside the industry than to the general public. They are Nick Wyman, the president of Actors' Equity Association; Matthew D. Loeb, the president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees; James D. Nederlander, the chairman of the Nederlander Organization; and Nina Lannan, a veteran general manager and tour manager for Broadway shows.
Along with the awards, the mayor's office and the Broadway League, a trade association of theater owners and producers, are underwriting a series of videos that trace the history of each of Broadway's 40 theaters.The first set will be viewable on Sunday at SpotlightOnBroadway.com.

HEADLINE: Sept. 6: A Referendum or a Choice?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Do voters in a presidential election decide based on an incumbent's record, or who will do a better job the next four years? A good campaign must be prepared to argue its case under both paradigms. 

 BODY:
The two competing models for understanding presidential elections are the referendum paradigm and the choice paradigm. 
In the referendum paradigm, the election comes down mostly to the performance of the incumbent, especially on economic matters. The identity of the opposition candidate matters relatively little: voters are choosing between "the incumbent" and "not the incumbent," and if things get bad enough, anyone else will do. 
In the choice paradigm, voters are more prospective than retrospective, making a decision on who will make the best president over the next four years. They may weigh the policy preferences of the candidates fairly heavily, along with their perceived ideological dispositions. And personality can play a role as well: the "who would you rather have a beer with" view of elections comes out of the choice school.
This is, of course, something of a false dichotomy. The economy plays an essential role in presidential elections - but there have also been years when the voters' verdict went against what the economic scorecard would seem to predict. (Most recently, in 2000, when Al Gore lost to George W. Bush despite Bill Clinton's strong economic record.) Approval ratings, which occupy a central role in the referendum paradigm since they represent an up-or-down "vote" on the incumbent, correlate very strongly with election outcomes - but so do personal favorability ratings. The party nomination process generally produces competent presidential candidates, but those who hold extremely liberal or extremely conservative views tend to underperform the economic numbers.
A good campaign, therefore, must be prepared to argue its case under both paradigms while at the same time trying to steer the race in the direction that is most favorable to it.
In his speech in Charlotte, N.C. on Thursday night, President Obama was fairly explicit in invoking the choice paradigm. He used the words 'choice' or 'choose' 21 times in his acceptance address - emphasizing voters' forward-looking decision rather than what happened during the past four years.
Mitt Romney, by comparison, used 'choice' or 'choose' just five times during his speech in Tampa, Fla. Instead, he tried to brand himself as a 'generic' Republican, taking personality and policy out of the race, while critiquing Mr. Obama's record. It was right out of Politics 101.
But to the extent that both ways of looking at the election have some grounding in reality, it might be worth asking: which party did a better job at playing its hand? 
That is, did Mr. Obama and the Democrats do more to advance their standing under the referendum paradigm? Did they develop their argument for why their record is good enough to deserve re-election? 
Or did Mr. Romney and the Republicans do more to help themselves under the choice paradigm? Did they do a good job of explaining why they had better ideas?
From my vantage point, the Democrats did a somewhat better job by this test. Bill Clinton is most of the reason. In his speech on Wednesday, he offered a skillful and detailed (if occasionally long-winded) argument for why Mr. Obama deserved to win on his record. On Thursday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. offered such an argument on behalf of Mr. Obama as well, although it was much more bluntly framed, with a focus on two of Mr. Obama's more popular accomplishments: the mission he authorized to kill Osama bin Laden, and his approval of the auto bailout. 
As for Mr. Obama himself, I thought his speech on Thursday night was not as effective as the ones that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Biden offered, in part because his defense of his accomplishments was much less assertive. But he did describe his foreign policy achievements at some length, if he was extremely circumspect about his domestic record.
Mr. Romney, however, offered exceptionally little detail in terms of policy in his acceptance speech last week. Nor did most of the Republicans' other prime-time speakers, like Chris Christie and Marco Rubio. Even Paul D. Ryan, who has a reputation for being a policy wonk, spent most of his time attacking Mr. Obama's record in his speech, rather than advancing his own plans. 
To be clear, it was probably the right strategy for Republicans to spend of their time critiquing Mr. Obama's record. But they may not have helped themselves very much with voters who do see the election as a choice.
Republicans spent some time trying to remedy Mr. Romney's mediocre favorability ratings. The strong speech by Ann Romney, and the portions of Mr. Romney's speech about his family, may have had a humanizing effect.
Even here, however, the intent seemed more to neutralize Mr. Romney's perceived personal weaknesses - to make him an acceptable alternative under the referendum paradigm - than to offer an affirmative case for why Mr. Romney should be president under the choice paradigm. 
If the somewhat disappointing bounce that Mr. Romney received in the polls after Tampa in fact reflected a mediocre convention rather than structural factors, this may have been the reason. Voters weren't hearing much of the case Mr. Romney as president, even if they got plenty of the case against Mr. Obama.
But this hypothesis won't look very wise if Mr. Obama receives a similarly small bounce; we'll have to wait a few days to see how the polls shake out.
Better Economic News in Advance of Jobs Report
In the meantime, Mr. Obama has been seeing somewhat stronger economic news lately, making his case a bit stronger under the referendum paradigm.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average was up almost 250 points, closing at its highest point since 2008, on an encouraging report about private-sector employment, and a pledge by European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, to move toward slacker monetary policy. 
The FiveThirtyEight economic index, which uses stock market prices as one of its components, was at its highest level of the election cycle on Thursday. This helped Mr. Obama toward his strongest chance to date of winning the Electoral College in the forecast, 77.3 percent.
The news over the next week is likely to be much more informative about the ultimate outcome of the election, however, starting with Friday morning's jobs report. The forecast model has begun to show rather optimistic numbers for Mr. Obama, but that also means the standards will be higher for him to maintain.

HEADLINE: Its Own Reason for Being

BYLINE: ERIC WILSON


HIGHLIGHT: At Fashion's Night Out, there was a line around the block to get into Diane von Furstenberg's store for a sighting of Allison Williams, who appears in "Girls," and who (like everyone else) was dressed for the occasion. 

 BODY:
OSCAR DE LA RENTA was singing in his Madison Avenue boutique. Lines of people waited behind barricades to get into Bergdorf Goodman. Most of SoHo and the meatpacking district looked like a police state for fashion victims.
All in all, Fashion's Night Out, now in its fourth year, looked much the same as in years past, with the exception, perhaps, that the big crowds stayed mostly downtown. The Calvin Klein store at 654 Madison Avenue, where Dwyane Wade was signing autographs, was hopping, but north of that looked pretty ordinary, though others would probably disagree.
"Just getting down the street was a chore," said Leba Sedaka, who was browsing in the Dennis Basso store with her husband, Neil. Yes, that one. "There are people dancing in the windows."
Outside, sure enough, there were ballet dancers twirling in the windows of J. Mendel, and three doors down, at Soigne K, two women in red bikinis and red capes who could have been either belly dancers or strippers.
There were reports that the event, originally organized by Vogue to help get people excited about shopping during the recession, has outlasted its need. And indeed, many stores on Madison Avenue already had their gates down by 7 p.m.
But the party goes on. Right at that moment, actually, Ryan Lochte, who seems to be everywhere these days, was plastered against the front window of Calvin Klein, pinned there by several dozen fans, until a handler plucked him free. Inside, Karen Elson recalled meeting the swimmer just moments before.
"I think he looked at me and thought, 'Who is this weird looking redhead?' " she said. "I know what to say to Karl Lagerfeld. I don't know what to say to Ryan Lochte."
Moving on, in the lobby of Bergdorf, Lady Bunny commanded the D.J. booth atop a platform in front of the Goyard luggage as potential customers ogled $25 T-shirts.
"No tax," a saleswoman pointed out. Probably for the first time at Bergdorf Goodman.
"I have a tough time finding women's clothes in my size," Ms. Bunny said. "My fashion went out years ago."
Downtown was tough, even ripe for agoraphobia. People pushed and elbowed their way to get a glimpse of the band St. Lucia, performing on Washington Street near Scoop, where the line was even longer for tequila shots served in plastic cups. There was a line around the block to get into Diane von Furstenberg's store for a sighting of Allison Williams, who appears in "Girls," and who (like everyone else) was dressed for the occasion.
"Last year, I killed myself running around town in heels," Ms. Williams said.
But this is Fashion Week, so Ms. Williams was wearing satin stilettos. But smartly, she remained in one spot.

HEADLINE: Effect of Jobs Numbers on Presidential Race Is Uncertain

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Politically, it is not certain that the report is going to matter that much. The unemployment rate declined for superficial reasons, which makes for a gentler headline for President Obama. 

 BODY:
Friday's jobs report was a weak one - with August's job growth more in line with the tepid growth of the spring than the stronger numbers in July or over the winter months.
Furthermore, job-growth numbers for May and June were revised downward slightly, and manufacturing jobs - a measure that Democrats touted at various points during their convention this week in Charlotte, N.C. - fell by 15,000.
Politically, however, it is less certain that the report is going to matter that much. The unemployment rate declined for superficial reasons, which makes for a gentler headline for President Obama.
Perhaps more important, the report did not change the basic story of an economy that is experiencing subpar growth but is in recovery rather than recession.
The jobs numbers are subject to a fair amount of statistical noise; on average, the monthly job-growth number misses the market's expectation by about 70,000 jobs. As a rough rule, the jobs numbers might have to be off about that much in one direction or another to tell a substantially different economic story, which in this case would have meant fewer than about 60,000 jobs being created or more than about 190,000.
Instead, the government reported that 96,000 jobs were added in August, weaker than consensus expectations that about 135,000 jobs would be created.
The degree of uncertainty in measuring jobs is underscored by the difference between the government's report, which showed that 103,000 private-sector jobs were created July, and a separate report released on Thursday by the firm ADP Employer Services, which had 201,000 private-sector jobs added instead.
Interpretation of the report is further complicated by the fact that it could increase the likelihood of a renewed round of quantitative easing programs from the Federal Reserve. For this reason, investors saw the report as more of a wash, with stock prices little changed early on Friday.
In certain respects, the August report represented the alter ego of the July jobs report, in which payrolls grew somewhat faster than expected, but the unemployment rate ticked upward. In August, the unemployment rate, which is calculated through a separate government survey than the survey of business that produces the job-growth numbers, fell to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent. The decline in the unemployment rate occurred because of a decline in labor-force participation, not because of a decline in the number of unemployed.
The July report did not seem to have much impact on the polls, despite being better than expected.
However, this report had been even more highly anticipated than usual because of its timing immediately after the Democratic convention. To the extent that it affects the way that the conventions are perceived and portrayed by the news media, it could reduce some of Mr. Obama's post-convention buzz. Democrats seemed to be at a high point following Bill Clinton's speech on Wednesday night; this will be a bit of a comedown for them.

HEADLINE: Obama Counterpunches on Climate Change

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: A week after Mitt Romney ridiculed concern about rising seas, President Obama declares that climate change is real and a threat to future generations. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, took a not-too-subtle jab at President Obama in his convention speech last week, mocking Mr. Obama's soaring 2008 campaign language about rolling back the rising seas and healing the planet. Mr. Romney's gibe drew thunderous applause from the Republican delegates, many of whom express doubt about the existence of climate change.
Mr. Obama jabbed back on Thursday night in his acceptance speech while detailing his energy program, which includes increased investment in renewable energy and higher mileage standards for vehicles.
"And, yes," the president said, "my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet - because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future. And in this election you can do something about it."
That brought cheers from the Democratic onlookers, many of whom had been waiting for Mr. Obama to address an issue that so far has been largely absent from this campaign and the party platforms.

Mr. Obama, who won broad support from environmentally minded voters in 2008 with his promise to tackle climate change with a nationwide cap and trade system, has disillusioned many of those supporters as president. He backed away from cap and trade after it became clear that the Senate would not support it and has largely been silent on the topic for the last two years even as extreme weather, increasingly associated with the warming of the planet, have devastated communities across the country.
Many advocates and donors have been pressing the campaign for a more full-throated statement on climate change from the president - and perhaps even some concrete plans to address it - and on Thursday night he delivered, at least on the rhetorical front.
Environmentalists were pleased.
"By reaffirming his commitment to tackling global warming," said Nathan Willcox, global warming program director at the advocacy group Environment America, "the president demonstrated that he intends to build on the historic steps his administration has already taken to cut dangerous carbon emissions, for the sake of our environment, our health and our families' future. While Mitt Romney used his convention acceptance speech to mock the problem and the urgency of tackling global warming, President Barack Obama laid out a plan to increase the nation's reliance on clean renewable energy, reduce dangerous air pollution and tackle global warming."
"President Obama has demonstrated real results in his first term," Mr. Willcox added. "His speech tonight clearly shows that he is the right choice for our environment and our health going forward."

HEADLINE: After a Disappointing Jobs Report, Romney Attacks Obama

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney questioned on Friday whether President Obama "knows what he's doing" when it comes to fixing the economy. 

 BODY:
SIOUX CITY, Iowa - Seizing on a disappointing jobs report, Mitt Romney questioned on Friday whether President Obama "knows what he's doing" when it came to fixing the economy.
"There's almost nothing the president has done in the past three and a half, four years that gives the American people confidence that he knows what he's doing when it comes to jobs and the economy," Mr. Romney told reporters as he stopped here for a campaign rally.
In Mr. Romney's first remarks since the Democratic National Convention wrapped up on Thursday night, the Republican nominee said Mr. Obama had offered little more than empty promises. The employment report released on Friday morning showed that the economy added 96,000 jobs in August, down from a revised figure of 141,000 in July and well below the 125,000 level economists had been expecting. 
"What is he going to do to get this economy going?" Mr. Romney said. "And all he said last night was the same as what he said four years ago -- which, by the way, he made a lot of promises four years ago. Can you think of any of those promises that was met? I mean, he was going to create jobs. We haven't. Lower unemployment? He hasn't. Rising take-home pay? It's gone down."
His appearance in Iowa came as the Romney campaign was ramping up activity on another front. It announced on Friday a major advertising campaign in eight swing states. The commercials - 15 in all - are specifically tailored to resonate with voters in each of those states.
In Florida, for example, people will see commercials about falling real estate values and high foreclosure rates. In Colorado, where the military and defense contractors are large employers, people will hear how the president's budget cuts could cost 20,000 military jobs there.
And here in Iowa, they will hear how "excessive government regulations are crushing small businesses and family farms."

HEADLINE: Jobs Numbers Prompt Obama to Account for Anemic Recovery

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER and JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: His convention speech was only hours old when President Obama, confronted by a dismal new jobs report, found himself having to use precious time on his campaign trail to account for the country's continued anemic economic recovery. 

 BODY:
IOWA CITY - His convention speech was only hours old when President Obama, confronted by a weak new jobs report, found himself Friday having to use precious time on the campaign trail to account for the country's continued anemic economic recovery.
As he has been forced to month after month, the president responded by shifting the blame to Congressional Republicans, calling on lawmakers to pass the jobs bill he proposed last year and that has been languishing since.
"Today we learned that after losing around 800,000 jobs a month when I took office, businesses added private-sector jobs for the 30th month in a row," Mr. Obama told a campaign rally in Portsmouth, N.H. He did not mention that the actual number of new jobs reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier in the morning, a figure that was lower than expected.
"But that's not good enough," Mr. Obama said. "We know it's not good enough." 
The president called on Congress to commit to extending middle-class tax cuts. "If Republicans are serious about getting rid of joblessness, they can create one million new jobs if Congress passes the jobs plan I sent them," he said.
Mr. Obama is on a post-convention campaign trip through crucial swing states, starting in New Hampshire on Friday morning before heading to Iowa City and then ending in St. Petersburg, Fla. There he will begin a bus tour over the weekend through Florida, a perennial battleground.
He was joined by his full ticket: The first lady, Michelle Obama (who the president called "amazing" at the convention), Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill Biden.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, wasted no time in jumping on the jobs report Friday. On his way to a campaign stop near Sioux City, Iowa, Mr. Romney told reporters that the latest employment report was a fresh reminder that Mr. Obama's leadership has left Americans with little more than broken promises and empty hope.
"There's almost nothing the president has done in the past three and a half, four years that gives the American people confidence that he knows what he's doing when it comes to jobs and the economy," Mr. Romney said, adding that the president's speech Thursday to the Democratic National Convention contained even more promises that will go unfulfilled.
"What is he going to do to get this economy going?" Mr. Romney said. "All he said last night was the same as what he said four years ago, which by the way, he made a lot of promises four years ago. Can you think of any of those promises that was met? I mean, he was going to create jobs. We haven't. Lower unemployment? He hasn't. Rising take home pay? It's gone down."
His appearance in Iowa came as the Romney campaign was ramping up activity on another front. It announced on Friday a major advertising campaign in eight swing states. The commercials - 15 in all - are specifically tailored to resonate with voters in each of those states.
In Florida, for example, people will see commercials about falling real estate values and high foreclosure rates. In Colorado, where the military and defense contracting is a large employer, people will hear how the president's budget cuts could cost 20,000 military jobs there.
And here in Iowa, they will hear how "excessive government regulations are crushing small businesses and family farms." 
The president, meanwhile, got in some licks of his own. During his speech, Mr. Obama tried out a new attack line against the Republican push for tax cuts, deriding the Republicans as running to tax cuts as the solution for every problem.
On Friday morning, as is his wont when he finds a line he likes, Mr. Obama was ready to expand. Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Obama said, view tax cuts as a miracle cure. "Tax cuts to help you lose a few pounds! Tax cuts to help improve your love life!" Then he grinned.

HEADLINE: Fire This Guy?

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The haters will never budge. President Obama's speech wasn't intended for them anyway. It was pitched to the grumpy undecided. 

 BODY:
Get rid of him. Hit the road, Barack. Epic fail. You're fired. 
Safe to say, a sizable amount of voters who watched President Obama's plea for a second term Thursday night were mulling over some combination of those words. In a survey published by The Hill earlier this week, 54 percent of respondents said the president does not deserve to be re-elected. 
By Thursday night, the Geography of Hope had shrunk to a perilous perch. Obama entered the arena in Charlotte, N.C., with a confident stride, but he was walking up to a cliff. And he had history running against him: only one other Democrat, the unsinkable Bill Clinton, has been elected president twice since Franklin D. Roosevelt first turned the trick 76 years ago. 
So close to peril, Obama delivered an acceptance speech full of punch, muscle and pop - the Democratic Party showing some rare brawn on their closing day and no small amount of testosterone. It was not a night for poetry. On foreign foes, dead and alive, on veterans, active and retired, on American economic nationalism - even down to the U.S.A chants - Obama's Democrats occupied the old space once held by mainstream Republicans. It's empty, after all: why not seize that ground? 
Last week, Romney offered platitudes and mush. Many Obama fence straddlers were afraid the president would do the same. He certainly didn't offer enough specifics to satisfy all, nor enough to break the race open. But he laid down some markers, and they're durable enough to carry him through to November. 
"It's time to do some nation-building right here at home," he said. 
"I will never turn Medicare into a voucher."
"Climate change is not a hoax."
"We don't think government can solve all of our problems. But we don't think the government is the source of all our problems."
On the Republican tax cut panacea? "If you feel a cold coming on, take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations and call us in the morning."
On the Republican view of health care? "If you can't afford health insurance, hope you don't get sick."
He had help, this president, with some luck in the timing, that can be traced to the part of his heritage that's Irish. The stock market hit five-year highs on the same day he accepted the nomination of a party supposedly run by socialists.
Obama saved capitalism, what was left of it, when the masters of Wall Street predation walked away from a broken game. A nation that was bleeding jobs - almost 800,000 in the month Obama took office - has gained 4.5 million new private sector jobs in the last 29 months. As a bottom line, if you invested $10,000 in the stock market in March of 2009, it would be worth almost $20,000 today. On this record, and health care, among other things, Obama has been a terrible communicator. 
 
But real income is down for most Americans. The Great Recession left lasting casualties. The good numbers are not enough, of course. And so, back to the question: Fire this guy?
Over the last week, the usual order of this world-shaking choice was reversed. First, we got the man who wants to replace Obama. The lack of a bounce in the polls showed that a majority was not yet ready to hire Mitt Romney. 
Then we got the defense brief. And the lead-up to the finale was as good, if not better in places, than the closing argument. Bill Clinton went right to the firing argument in his summary of the Republican view: "We left him a total mess, he didn't clean it up fast enough, so fire him and put us back in."
Clinton, reaching for the high notes, "The Natural" of boomer politicians at an age when he feels the press of time, framed it well: "We believe that we're all in it together is a better philosophy than you're on your own." This sentiment was nicely bracketed at the end of Obama's speech with the Bruce Springsteen song, "We Take Care of Our Own."
Clinton has been to a scarier brink than Obama. In the first year of his presidency, his approval ratings were abysmal, lower than Obama's. When he pushed through a budget in 1993 that raised taxes on the rich, not a single Republican voted for it. They predicted an economic apocalypse. And 23 million new jobs later, the Big Dog got the last laugh. His tally of Republican versus Democratic job totals - with the Dems running up the score - brought the kind of delight to Clinton's face that anticipation of a cheeseburger used to.
John Kerry, a muscle man of his own on Thursday night, gave the best answer to a tired question: "Ask Osama bin Laden if he's better off than he was four years ago."
The haters will never budge. This speech was not for them. It is just a few thousand voters, in perhaps no more than a half-dozen states - the grumpy undecideds, those lucky, much-stroked tough nuts - who had to be moved one way or the other Thursday night. In choosing a meaty framing of the issues, rather than a soaring reach for tears and ahhs, Obama won enough begrudging approval from the select independents to live for another day and probably another term.

HEADLINE: Henry Herx, 79, Film Critic for Catholics

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Henry Herx, who over three decades wrote thousands of movie reviews for Roman Catholic publications, assessing the moral complexities raised on screen through the prism of church tenets, died on Aug. 15 at his home in Ramsey, N.J. He was 79.
The cause was complications of liver cancer, said his son, Joseph. 
Mr. Herx was chief critic for what was originally called the National Legion of Decency, later became the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures and is now the Media Review Office of the Catholic News Service. His reviews, written from 1964 to 1999, were distributed to hundreds of publications around the country.
Of ''Schindler's List,'' Steven Spielberg's harrowing 1993 film about Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist who set out to profit from the misfortunes of persecuted Polish Jews during World War II but became the rescuer of more than 1,000, he wrote: ''The viewer is left to consider the man's latent Christianity as a possible reason for his transformation, or perhaps simply his common sense that killing people was bad for business or, even more likely given his character, the fear of Allied retribution for enriching himself on slave labor.''
Reviewing a 1991 British comedy, ''The Pope Must Die'' (the last word in the title was later changed to ''Diet'' when some newspapers and television networks refused to run advertisements for the film), Mr. Herx wrote, ''The title alone is all one needs to know of the bad comic taste of those who concocted this flaccid little farce about a bumbling country priest who is mistakenly elected pope due to a clerical error.'' Mr. Herx gave the movie a rating of A-4 -- adults, with reservations.
''His one-sentence paragraphs pulled few punches in informing readers not only of the moral quality of a film, but whether it was worth seeing by any audience,'' said Mark Pattison, the media editor for the Catholic News Service. ''People looked to his reviews as a guide -- perhaps the guide -- as to what to let their kids see.''
But Mr. Herx was not dogmatic. ''Henry understood Hollywood, and his judgment was impeccable,'' Sister Mary Ann Walsh, who was Mr. Herx's boss for several years, told The Record of New Jersey.
Sister Mary Ann cited his review of ''The Full Monty,'' the Ö1997 British movie about six unemployed men who struggle with their decision to earn money by becoming a striptease act. ''He recognized the movie was about, among other things, modesty,'' she said. ''He didn't give it a knee-jerk reaction.''
''The Full Monty'' also received an A-4 rating. The film office has five ratings, from A-1 (for general audiences) to 0 (morally offensive).
Since its founding in 1933 as the Legion of Decency, urging ''the purification of the cinema'' and issuing lists of movies that Catholics should not see, the office has evolved. ''We take a much more positive and constructive approach today, stressing what is good in popular culture,'' Mr. Herx told The New York Times in 1989.
Henry William Herx was born in Chicago on June 29, 1933, one of five children of Fred and Beatrice Herx. His father was a telephone lineman. After earning his bachelor's and master's degrees in history from Loyola University Chicago and serving in the Army, Mr. Herx became a public-school teacher in Chicago.
Mr. Herx became fascinated by films in childhood, and in 1962, with a friend who was also a cinephile, the Rev. Ronald Holloway, he founded the Chicago Center for Film Study as part of the Archdiocese of Chicago's adult education program. Their mission was to bring a more positive approach to reviewing movies, a shift from the Legion of Decency's policy of listing offensive films. Two years later, the executive secretary of the Legion, Msgr. Thomas Little, recruited the film center to take over the role of critiquing movies. The office's chief critic is now John Mulderig.
''Henry embodied the church's efforts to engage with contemporary culture in an open yet discerning way,'' Mr. Mulderig said on Friday. ''In the case of challenging material, striking the right balance between appreciation and rejection of what was alien to Judeo-Christian values could be difficult. But he did it very successfully over a long period.''
Mr. Herx's wife of 49 years, the former Marilyn Jack, died in 2005. Besides his son, he is survived by two daughters, Katherine Herx and Margaret DeLibero; two brothers, John and Fred; two sisters, Mary Miller and Helen Herdrich; and four grandchildren.
By the time he retired in 1999, Mr. Herx had viewed more than 10,000 films, many at home with his children. ''He had a portable projector and a screen that he set up in our living room,'' Joseph Herx said, ''and on Friday and Saturday nights we used to watch everything from classic silent films to the more recent ones.''
Not surprisingly, his passion started with Saturday matinees -- cartoons, newsreels and double features -- in the 1930s. ''If he was lucky,'' his son said, ''he got the extra five cents for popcorn.''

HEADLINE: Smarck Michel, 75, Haitian Ex-Prime Minister

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Smarck Michel, a businessman who served for almost a year as Haiti's prime minister after the United States restored President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in the mid-1990s, died at his home here on Saturday. He was 75. 
The cause was a brain tumor, his son, Kenneth, said.
Mr. Michel became prime minister in 1994 when a multinational military force led by the United States restored Mr. Aristide to the presidency after three years in exile. Mr. Aristide's first term was cut short in 1991 when the army ousted him in a coup.
The choice of Mr. Michel was seen as an effort to placate business leaders and members of Haiti's middle and upper classes who felt threatened by the return of Mr. Aristide, a populist, left-leaning former Roman Catholic priest. Mr. Michel resigned almost a year later over opposition to his economic proposals, which included a privatization plan that was unpopular with Haiti's poor majority.
During Mr. Aristide's first term, Mr. Michel served briefly as commerce and industry minister. He was dismissed from that post amid criticism of the government for not lowering the prices of food and other basic goods. Mr. Michel had instituted price controls, but they were widely ignored.
Smarck Michel was born on March 29, 1937, in St. Marc, a port city north of Port-au-Prince, and moved around Haiti as a child because his father was serving in the Haitian armed forces.
He attended college in New York, then returned to Haiti to help run the bakery his father had started. He later ran a grocery store in downtown Port-au-Prince.
After his brief stint in politics, he returned full time to the grocery store until he closed it in 2010 and retired, his son said.
In addition to his son, Mr. Michel's survivors include his wife, Victoire Marie-Rose Sterlin, and two daughters, Patricia and Marjorie Michel.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Company News: Garda's Founder Makes Offer To Take It Private

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
QUEBEC CITY _ The founder, chairman and chief executive of Garda World Security, an armored car and security company based in Montreal, joined forces with a private equity fund to make a $1.1 billion offer to take the company private on Friday. 
In league with the chief executive, Stéphan Crétier, is Apax Partners, the London-based private equity. The consortium's $12-a-share offer includes the assumption of $625 million in debt.
Garda was founded in 1995 by Mr. Crétier with an investment of $25,000. The company went on a largely debt financed shopping spree during the 2000s, which made it the second largest cash handling company in the United States after Brink's. But the financial crisis in 2008 and problems with its acquisition of ATI Systems International caused to the company to violate the terms of some loan agreements. And its stock price plummeted.
The company eventually refinanced its debt and its operations have recovered along with the financial services sector. But the company's relatively high debt had depressed its share price.
The consortium's offer is 30 percent higher than Thursday's closing share price on the Toronto stock exchange. Following the recommendation of a committee of independent directors, Garda's board has unanimously endorsed the offer. Mr. Crétier abstained from that process.
In a statement, Mr. Crétier suggested that Garda would be able to acquire additional companies more easily once it stops being publicly traded.
"We intend to continue to pursue our growth strategy both organically and through acquisitions, which we can more efficiently accomplish as a private company," Mr. Crétier said.
The company separately announced on Friday that it had earned $4.9 million in its second quarter, up from $3.8 million during the same period last year. Revenue rose 13.7 percent, to $337 million during the quarter.

HEADLINE: A Walmart for Chinatown Stirs a Fight in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Along Broadway here, in the heart of Chinatown, immigrants crowd around fruit and vegetable shops, asking prices in Mandarin and Cantonese. Men hawk huge red grapes from a pile in the back of a pickup truck. And poultry shops sell not only chicken, but roosters, guinea hens and pheasants -- live poultry is available on request.
For more than 70 years, these small businesses have thrived here, lining both sides of the street. 
But some local residents and business owners fear this historic immigrant community is now threatened by the newest addition to the neighborhood: Walmart, which plans to open a scaled-down version of its superstore just a few blocks from the heart of Chinatown.
''They're going to hurt the small businesses,'' said Grace Yen, a Taiwanese immigrant who came here in 1986, as she sat in a Chinatown bakery. ''They have a bigger market. They're going to take over everything.''
The Walmart Neighborhood Market would offer Chinatown its first mainstream grocery store in decades. But since the company's plan was announced in February, a furious battle has broken out over the project, with community activists and labor unions determined to block the world's largest retailer from the neighborhood.
In March, the City Council banned large chain stores from opening in Chinatown. But Walmart received its building permit a day before that vote, exempting the store from the ban.
Then in June, thousands of protesters marched through Chinatown in a show of opposition to the new Walmart. Several labor unions have also sued to stop the project.
But on Friday a judge declined to halt construction on the store, which began in July, until that case is heard. As a result, the Chinatown Walmart now looks more likely than ever to open as scheduled early next year.
Christilily Chiv, 24, said she worries that Walmart's arrival in the neighborhood where she was born and raised could mark the start of a major transition in Chinatown, which remains a first stop for many Asian immigrants, into a historic district where immigrants no longer live and work.
''Chinatown is a cultural community,'' Ms. Chiv said. ''I want to preserve what is there. And I fear what's going to happen is that by having commercial corporations come in, they are going to erase the cultural community and what it stood for in the first place.''
Still, the storefront where the Walmart Neighborhood Market plans to open has sat vacant for two decades, and many residents are eager to see it filled.
''This community has not had a mainstream grocery store in 74 years,'' said George Yu, executive director of the Chinatown Business Improvement District, noting that all grocery stores in the area close by 7 p.m. ''What if you want yogurt or cheese? What if you want dog food? Those are pretty basic needs that every community has.''
''Ninety-nine percent of the community supports this market,'' Mr. Yu added. ''The opposition is coming from outside Chinatown.''
Labor unions have for years criticized Walmart for hiring nonunion workers and paying low wages. And some of the unions and workers' rights advocates that have helped lead the charge to keep Walmart out of Chinatown also fought to limit Walmart's influence in other parts of the region.
This year, three of the top candidates in the 2013 Los Angeles mayoral race all vowed not to accept any campaign donations from Walmart, after unions sent a letter urging them to return contributions from the retail giant.
In addition, the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which helped organize the protest in Chinatown, also helped push through an ordinance that makes it more difficult to open large superstores here.
''We've been organizing to try to make sure that neighborhood small businesses are protected,'' said Allison Mannos, a spokeswoman for the alliance. ''And also to make sure that there are not poverty-level jobs coming in.''
The Walmart Neighborhood Market planned for Chinatown would offer mainly grocery items and a pharmacy. Steven V. Restivo, a spokesman for Walmart, said the company had received largely positive feedback from the community.
''The day our store opens, thousands and thousands of local residents are going to shop at that Walmart Neighborhood Market,'' Mr. Restivo said. ''Those are people who probably never attended a council meeting or wrote a letter to the editor. They just want to have more options close to where they live and work.''
He added, ''In terms of the cultural impact, there is literally a Burger King across the street from our location, and a Subway next door.''
Local residents remained evenly divided, according to a spokeswoman for City Councilman Ed P. Reyes, who represents the area. And even some of the local business owners are not yet sure how Walmart might affect them.
Richard Lam owns an import business, selling clothes and other accessories. He showed off a Walmart app on his smartphone. But he was nervous about the arrival of the store.
''I shop online with Walmart all the time,'' he said. ''I buy phone. I buy camera. It's cheap.''
But he added, ''If they don't open, I'm happier.''

HEADLINE: Markets Cheer E.C.B. Plan to Shore Up Euro

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
LONDON -- Borrowing costs for Spain and Italy were down Friday as new moves to stem Europe's debt crisis received the same enthusiastic response from financial markets that greeted earlier plans.
But analysts warned that while Thursday's announcement from the European Central Bank of an unlimited bond-buying plan should have a positive impact on market perception, familiar political and technical problems still lay ahead for the 17-nation euro zone.
And, in a worrying sign for euro zone policy makers, much of the media and political reaction in Germany -- the euro zone's most important country -- was negative. 
Although Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced support Thursday for the plan, other commentators asserted that the central bank's move was reckless and that German taxpayers could be pushed to pay for the less-responsible members of the euro zone.
''The E.C.B. Rewards Mismanagement,'' read the headline to an editorial the left-leaning Sueddeutsche Zeitung. The editorial page of the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung led with a German proverb, ''Necessity knows no law,'' and criticized the E.C.B. for destroying the separation of fiscal and monetary policy.
''Woe betide us if this goes wrong,'' read the headline of an article explaining the bond program in the country's most widely read paper, Bild.
The E.C.B.'s decision did provide temporary relief for Spain, whose 10-year borrowing costs fell below 6 percent late Thursday for the first time in four months. Italian and Portugese 10-year bond yields also fell.
Underlining the global reach of the euro zone crisis, stock markets in Asia rose Friday, as did those in Europe. The Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, was up 0.7 percent in late afternoon trading, and national stock indexes were also higher.
The euro advanced as well, trading at $1.2759 -- its strongest since late June -- compared with $1.2630 late Thursday in New York.
Speaking in Frankfurt on Thursday, the E.C.B's president, Mario Draghi, outlined a new program to lower borrowing costs of countries like Spain and Italy that have been forced to pay rates which most analysts believe would be sustainable in the medium term.
Called Outright Monetary Transactions, the program will focus on purchasing government bonds with maturities from one to three years. The E.C.B. will not set a limit on how much it buys and will not insist on senior creditor status, which means being paid ahead of others in the event of a restructuring. Such status worries other investors who fear they would face disproportionate losses.
But countries wanting help will have to ask for it and will then need to meet strict conditions. That presents a crucial problem for Spain, which is at the heart of the crisis and whose government worries that such a formal request would constitute a political humiliation.
And difficult discussions lie ahead about Greece's bailout, with international lenders due to arrive in Athens this weekend. The government there is asking for more time to hit its targets, but euro zone nations are reluctant to fill yet another gaping hole in Greek financial plans. A failure of those talks could still lead to a Greek exit from the single currency, with huge consequences for the rest of the euro zone.
While the E.C.B.'s announcement has undoubtedly bought time for the single currency area, analysts said it needed to use that time to build more credible structures in order to restore market confidence, including ambitious plans to construct a banking union.
The experience of the euro zone crisis so far is that, whenever pressure from the financial markets is reduced, politicians postpone difficult decisions. Paradoxically, that could mean that the E.C.B.'s intervention will make agreement on crucial changes seem less urgent.
Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst for Europe at the Eurasia Group, said in e-mailed comments that the E.C.B.'s announcement should prove important in stabilizing sentiment in the near term, but that ''many serious challenges exist regarding the execution and implementation of the bank's new Outright Monetary Transactions in practice.''
He singled out the ''new, more important role'' of the E.C.B. Governing Council in signing off on governments' compliance with their reform programs; the implications for beneficiary countries, and the ''disincentivizing impact'' that ''diminished market pressure could have on euro zone institution-building.''
More immediate challenges include a ruling by the German constitutional court next Wednesday on whether the euro zone's new bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, is in line with Germany's constitution, and elections the same day in the Netherlands, where voters appear critical of euro zone bailouts.
German discontent with further E.C.B. involvement had been widely circulated as details of the proposed bond program leaked out ahead of the Thursday announcement. Jens Weidmann, president of the country's central bank, the Bundesbank, was the only dissenting vote on the program.
Appearing with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain in Madrid, Ms. Merkel said Thursday that the E.C.B., in approving the bond-buying plan, was ''acting with independence and within the framework of its mandate.''
But members of her coalition partner, the pro-business Free Democrats, and opposition parties condemned the plan.
Frank Schäffler, an expert for financial affairs for the Free Democrats, called for charges against the bank before the European Court of Justice.
''The E.C.B. has not become the bad bank of all worthless papers in Europe,'' he said in an interview Friday with Deutschlandradio for Berlin. ''What happened yesterday has historical dimensions.''
But Jörg Asmussen, a close ally of Ms. Merkel who sits on the bank's executive board and who split with Mr. Weidmann over the bond program, sought to reassure Germans that it would not lead to increased inflation.
''It will only be able to happen when a country agrees to strict reform measures,'' Mr. Asmussen said in an interview with Berlin's public radio on Friday. ''That is a mandatory, a necessary requirement for our deal.''
Ms. Merkel was to travel Friday to Vienna, where she was to hold talks with her Austrian counterpart, Werner Faymann. Austria often follows the lead of its larger neighbor to the north; its representatives on the E.C.B. board voted in favor of the bond program.
Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin.

HEADLINE: Asia-Pacific Forum to Agree to Cut Import Duties for Green Technologies

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
VLADIVOSTOK, RUSSIA -- Asia-Pacific nations have made a breakthrough in promoting trade in green technologies, and the United States is pressing ahead with efforts to carve out a regional free-trade zone, a senior U.S. official said Friday.
Speaking before a summit of leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Demetrios Marantis, the deputy U.S. trade representative, said the group had agreed to cut import duties on technologies that can promote economic growth without endangering the environment. 
''This is really a significant achievement, in that it shows how APEC can lead,'' Mr. Marantis said in an interview after ministers finished their preparations for the summit meeting Saturday and Sunday in the Russian port of Vladivostok. ''It allows us to accomplish the twin goals of liberalizing trade and green growth.''
Ministers agreed on a list of 54 green technologies that will be subject to import duties of 5 percent or less beginning in 2015, following through on a commitment made by leaders at the last APEC summit in Honolulu a year ago.
The list includes equipment used in generating power from renewable energy sources like the sun, wind and biomass; treating waste water; recycling; and environmental monitoring.
Officials have described the clean technology initiative as a main summit ''deliverable'' for APEC, a consensus-based group that focuses on economic issues and links rising nations led by China with advanced economies like that of the United States.
APEC represents 40 percent of the world's population, 54 percent of its economic output and 44 percent of its trade. Exports within the group are expected nearly to triple over the next decade to $14.6 trillion, while exports to non-APEC countries will double to $5.6 trillion, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Next year, APEC will tackle so-called local content requirements -- in effect, import restrictions. The United States views the requirements as impediments to trade.
The diverse nature of the Pacific-Rim economies -- which unlike the debt-stricken economies of Europe are showing relatively strong growth -- has led some APEC countries to join Washington in pushing for a new free-trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Mr. Marantis said trade ministers from nine nations participating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks had met in Vladivostok and affirmed their determination to move ahead at negotiations to be held next week in Leesburg, Virginia.
The Leesburg talks will be the 14th round in a Trans-Pacific Partnership process that was initiated by APEC leaders at a summit meeting two years ago.
Negotiators will seek to iron out further details of a 29-chapter multilateral free-trade deal.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership is made up of: Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. Canada and Mexico are due to join the group in October.
Mr. Marantis said the group was ''working together to create a high-standard, 21st century trade agreement that addresses a lot of problems that exporters are facing in a way that will grow jobs and create new opportunities for exporters.''
There are no deadlines for completing the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, but Mr. Marantis said negotiators were seeking to complete the bulk of their work next year.
''Substance will drive timing -- that's what's really important,'' Mr. Marantis said. ''If you look at how much progress we've been able to make in such a short amount of time, we're working to wrap up as much as possible over the course of 2013.''
The Trans-Pacific Partnership ties in with President Barack Obama's goal of doubling American exports within five years of his election in 2008. It has been described as the biggest free-trade pact since the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.
China, the world's second-largest economy, is not a party to the process, while the APEC summit host, Russia -- which has only just joined the World Trade Organization -- says it is not ready to look at joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The Citizens Trade Campaign, a U.S. umbrella group, has criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership process as overly secretive and has called demonstrations against the Leesburg talks, fearing that a free trade deal could result in the loss of American jobs.

HEADLINE: Chinese Shares Surge on Hopes Based on Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER and NEIL GOUGH

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Stock markets in mainland China roared ahead more than 4 percent during Friday trading, amid hopes that the Chinese authorities were revving up efforts to bolster stalling growth in the world's second-biggest economy, after that of the United States.
The rally was set off by the announcement this week of what analysts said was essentially a new stimulus package worth more than $100 billion: the accelerated approval by the country's top economic planning agency of dozens of large-scale state infrastructure projects designed to jump-start growth. 
On Wednesday and Thursday, Beijing policy makers announced approvals of 25 new subway lines and 13 new highway projects spanning thousands of kilometers. Together with several other large-scale projects related to airports, energy production and wastewater treatment plants, the total investment for all projects approved since April was 848 billion renminbi, or $134 billion, according to Zhiwei Zhang, the chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong.
''The decision for the Chinese government to intensively announce these projects over the past two days signals a significant change in its policy stance from the incremental and reactive approach to a more decisive and proactive approach,'' Mr. Zhang said Friday in a research note.
Investors seized on the news Friday, sending the Shanghai composite index to its biggest single-day jump in months. At one point, the index rose 4.5 percent to its highest level since mid-August, before giving up some of the gains to close 3.7 percent higher. The market in Shenzhen ended the day with a gain of 3.8 percent.
Both indexes remain more than 15 percent below where they were 12 months ago, and the evidence of China's broad economic slowdown has resulted in a steep sell-down in domestic shares since May.
At the same time, analysts pointed out that it was unclear whether the approvals in fact represented the pumping of new cash into the flagging construction sector or whether they were part of plans that had been previously announced.
In either case, the announcements were read as clear signals that Beijing was intent on stimulating growth.
''The China market is very sentiment-driven, very driven by what the government is doing,'' said Dariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Crédit Agricole in Hong Kong.
Also lifting sentiment were better-than-expected weekly jobs figures from the United States on Thursday and confirmation, also Thursday, that the European Central Bank would buy large amounts of government bonds in a bid to relieve investor pressure on troubled euro zone economies.
Stock markets across Asia reacted positively to those developments Friday: The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed 3.1 percent higher, while the Kospi in South Korea added 2.6 percent, the Taiex in Taiwan gained 1.3 percent, and the Straits Times index in Singapore rose 1 percent.
The sharp rally in mainland China was mainly driven by the domestic news, which generally tends to play a much bigger part in shaping movements in the country's still largely closed equity markets, Mr. Kowalczyk said.
Beijing has been drip-feeding stimulus measures into the economy over the past few months in an effort to counteract the effects of slowing exports to Europe and to buoy demand at home.
Unlike their approach in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, China's policy makers have recently taken a much more muted approach to encouraging growth, apparently leery of producing another credit-driven investment binge of the kind that pushed inflation and property prices up during 2009 and 2010.
This slow-motion approach to stimulus has worried many analysts and investors, who, over the past two months, have been eagerly awaiting more interest rate cuts and steps to facilitate additional bank lending.
Economic data due out Sunday are expected to show that the economy continued to loose speed in August. The data, Mr. Kowalczyk said, ''will make few people happy.''
Yao Wei, an economist at Société Générale in Hong Kong, wrote in a research note Thursday: ''Chinese economic data since the beginning of Q3 have been a series of disappointments,'' referring to the July-to-September quarter.
''The authorities seem to be running a risky policy experiment to see how well the economy can hold up without any big dose of stimuli,'' Ms. Yao added. ''As the labor market deteriorates and credit risk rises, we think the central government should and will do more, albeit probably still incrementally.''

HEADLINE: Canada Closes Tehran Embassy And Orders Iran Envoys to Leave

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
QUEBEC -- Calling Iran ''the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today,'' Canada's foreign affairs minister, John Baird, abruptly announced Friday that his government had cut all diplomatic ties with the country. 
Mr. Baird told reporters in Vladivostok, Russia, where he was attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, that Canada had closed its embassy in Tehran and given Iranian diplomats in Canada five days to leave. An online list prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade indicated Friday morning that there were 18 Iranian diplomats in Canada.
The action by Canada contrasts with its decision in 1979 to keep its embassy in Tehran open after the United States Embassy there was seized by students and several diplomats were held hostage. Six Americans found sanctuary in the Canadian Embassy and were eventually smuggled out of the country using Canadian passports.
Mr. Baird offered numerous reasons for his decision, including an attack last November by a crowd on the British Embassy in Tehran, which led to concerns for the safety of Canadian diplomats there.
''The Iranian regime has shown blatant disregard for the Vienna Convention and its guarantee of protection for diplomatic personnel,'' Mr. Baird said.
Mr. Baird also noted international criticism of Iran over its support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria as it violently suppresses a widespread popular uprising. He also cited its human rights record, its assistance to terrorist groups and its noncompliance with United Nations resolutions concerning its nuclear program.
He added that Iran ''routinely threatens the existence of Israel and engages in racist anti-Semitic rhetoric and incitement to genocide.''
In a statement, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch opponent of Iran, praised his Canadian counterpart, Stephen Harper, for ''for taking a bold leadership decision that sends a clear message to Iran and the entire world.''
Mr. Netanyahu added, ''The resolve that was demonstrated by Canada is highly important in order for the Iranians to realize that they cannot continue their race toward nuclear weapons.''
Mr. Harper's Conservative government has been supportive of Israel on a variety of issues and has mirrored its aggressive stance on Iran.
The Canadian Embassy had already been reduced to about seven or eight staff members before the closing. Canada has not had a fully accredited ambassador in Iran since 2007, when Iran expelled the ambassador for unspecified reasons. The expulsion followed prolonged Canadian protests over the killing of a photojournalist, Zahra Kazemi, in an Iranian prison in 2003. Ms. Kazemi, a resident of Montreal, held both Canadian and Iranian citizenship.
Mr. Baird did not say why the decision to cut diplomatic relations had been taken so long after the British Embassy episode, but he swiftly rejected suggestions that the move indicated that a military attack on Iran by Israel or other nations was imminent.
''Unequivocally, we have no information about a military strike on Iran,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Writer Evokes Loss on South Korea's Path to Success

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea
LIKE so many South Korean parents at the time, Shin Kyung-sook's mother saw education as her daughter's best chance of escaping poverty and backbreaking work in the rice fields. So in 1978 she took her 15-year-old daughter to Seoul, where Ms. Shin would lie about her age to get a factory job while attending high school at night to pursue her dream of becoming a novelist.
Seoul-bound trains at the time, like the one mother and daughter boarded that night, picked up many young rural South Koreans along the way -- part of the migration that fueled South Korea's industrialization but forever changed its traditional family life.
It is that social upheaval that Ms. Shin evoked in her most famous novel to date, ''Please Look After Mom,'' which earned her the 2011 Man Asian Literary Prize and a commercial success attained by few other Korean writers. (Sales in South Korea passed two million this spring, and the book has been published in 19 other countries, including the United States.) 
That book and a more recent one, ''I Will Be Right There,'' about friendship and love set in the country's political turmoil of the 1980s, are part of a body of work over three decades that has set Ms. Shin apart as one of the most accomplished chroniclers of modern South Korea.
''In her novels, readers have the chance to pause and reflect upon the other side of their society's breakneck race for economic growth, what they have lost in that pursuit and upon people who were left behind in the mad rush,'' said Shin Soo-jeong, a professor of Korean literature at Myongji University in Seoul.
In ''Please Look After Mom,'' an elderly woman from the countryside travels to Seoul to visit her adult children and gets lost in what is quite literally a mad rush: the scramble to get on a Seoul subway. Reviewers have called her disappearance a metaphor for the profound sense of loss in a society that hurtled from an agrarian dictatorship to an industrialized democracy within a single and often tumultuous generation.
That feeling has not overwhelmed South Koreans' pride in their country's accomplishments, notably its rise from abject poverty to the world's 13th-largest economy. But the sense of loss taps into a growing unease over some of the costs of that success, especially a widening gap between rich and poor and a generation of elderly people left largely to fend for themselves as their adult children work in cities.
The filial guilt that suffuses the novel is universal, but also has a particularly Korean spin.
Until a generation ago in South Korea, at least one adult child -- usually the eldest son and his family -- lived with aging parents until their deaths. Now, a growing number of older people live alone in their rural villages or in the nursing homes that are springing up across the country. Often, they have little money left, having invested their savings in their children's educations with the expectation that the children would prosper and eventually care for them.
The children, meanwhile, living in a hypercompetitive society where people work some of the longest hours in the world, often lament that they are too harried to visit their elderly parents. Many also fear using too much vacation time, afraid of being seen as disloyal to their companies.
IN what Ms. Shin says is probably the most important sentence in her novel, the missing mother expresses what many guilt-ridden readers imagine as their own mothers' sense of helplessness at having been effectively abandoned by their children. In a scene in which the old woman imagines meeting her own dead mother, she wonders: ''Did Mom know? That I, too, needed her my entire life?''
Ms. Shin's life, which tracked the trajectory of her country's rise, prepared her well for her role as an interpreter of her generation. Born in the countryside like so many characters in her novels, Ms. Shin, 49, now lives in an expensive residential district in Seoul. Her husband is a college professor as well as a poet and literary critic. They have no children.
From an early age, she was a voracious reader, hiding herself away with books her elder brothers brought home. (She was the fourth of six children.) By the time she was 15, she was increasingly certain she wanted to write for a living.
After their arrival in Seoul on that night train in 1978, her mother left her in the care of an older brother in a crammed room in a slum. While he worked in a government office by day and attended college at night, Ms. Shin worked in an audio and television parts factory and attended high school in the evenings.
She was one of the youngest employees in the factory, where she witnessed the labor discontent that sometimes rocked South Korea as its economy galloped ahead but many workers toiled in sweatshop conditions.
''The girl sitting next to me at the night school had no fingerprints; she worked all day wrapping candies in a confectionery,'' Ms. Shin said in an interview. ''Most of my classmates sent part of their meager wages back home to support their little brothers' and sisters' education. When they came to class, they were so tired most of them dozed.''
At her own factory, a clash involving one of the country's growing number of labor unions turned violent as managers deployed their own security guards, who joined with the police in cracking down on workers organizing for higher pay and better conditions.
Ms. Shin stayed inside, amid the idled conveyor belts, taking her mind off the mayhem by copying a new novel about the urban poor in longhand.
In the end, Ms. Shin was the only one in her high school class to win admission to college, as a creative writing major. She eventually wrote about life at the factory in ''A Lone Room,'' one of her most acclaimed novels. Its French translation won the Prix de l'Inaperçu in 2009.
''I wonder what would have become of me in those days if I hadn't had the goal of becoming a writer to hang on to,'' she said. ''I was determined that one day I would write about what I saw and felt.''
FOR several years after college, she supported her writing with odd jobs: writing scripts for a classical music radio station and reading books to blind people. But by 1993, she was successful enough to be able to write novels and short stories full time.
She also was able to fulfill a personal promise: to repay her own mother's sacrifices for her children. The day they went to Seoul, she remembers, her mother's face was etched with weariness.
''I promised myself then that one day I would write a beautiful book for Mom,'' she said.
That book, ''Please Look After Mom,'' solidified her standing as one of South Korea's finest living novelists and won her accolades.
Her mother's reaction was decidedly more muted, typical of a generation of women who pushed their children hard to succeed but were accustomed to restraining their own emotions, even when those children met or exceeded their family's high expectations.
As Ms. Shin recounted, ''She only said, 'My dear, you have done well.' ''

HEADLINE: Shares Hang On to Thursday's Highs as Focus Veers to Fed

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States held steady at four-year highs on Friday, closing out their best week since June as a disappointing jobs report fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve would act to stimulate the economy next week.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed higher, but strength in both the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq was limited by the blue chips Intel and Kraft, both of which issued warnings on their profit outlooks. 
In the employment report, nonfarm payrolls in August showed growth of only 96,000 jobs, well under the 125,000 expected. The tepid increase added to expectations that the Fed would announce additional stimulus after its policy meeting on Thursday. Until then, investors could be in a holding pattern.
''There's no way to sugarcoat how disappointing the jobs number was, and as it reinforces the view the economy is lagging, that puts more pressure on the Fed to act,'' said Joseph S. Tanious, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds in New York.
''I absolutely think stocks still have room to grow from here, but there will certainly be disappointment if we don't get direction from the Fed next week,'' he said.
The expectations of central bank intervention, both by the Fed and the European Central Bank, fueled a rally that took the S.& P. 500 to its highest level since January 2008 and pushed the Nasdaq to a 12-year high on Thursday.
The gains were fueled by the European Central Bank's decision to introduce a potentially unlimited bond-buying program to lower the borrowing costs of struggling euro zone countries.
''This was a very bold and unorthodox move by the E.C.B., and it appears to be more important for stocks than the payroll report, another example of how Europe is impacting the U.S. with a vengeance,'' said Marco P. Priani, vice president at Advisory Research in Chicago, which has about $10 billion in assets.
Energy and financial shares were among the day's strongest, lifted as investors bought shares in areas tied to the pace of economic growth. ConocoPhillips rose 1.5 percent to $56.64, while Noble Energy rose 2.4 percent to $91.50. Bank of America surged 5.4 percent to $8.80.
The Dow ended up 14.64 points, or 0.11 percent, at 13,306.64. The S.& P. 500 was up 5.80 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,437.92. The Nasdaq was up 0.61 point, or 0.02 percent, at 3,136.42.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 99 20/32, and the yield fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent late Thursday.
For the week, the S.& P. was up 2.2 percent while the Dow rose 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq increased 2.3 percent.
Shares of Pandora Media fell 17 percent to $10.47 after reports that Apple was in talks to license music for a radio service like the one Pandora operates.
Intel cut its third-quarter revenue estimate and withdrew its full-year forecast, saying demand for its chips declined as customers reduced inventory and businesses bought fewer personal computers. Shares of Intel, the world's largest chip maker, fell 3.6 percent, to $24.19, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 0.8 percent.
Kraft Foods gave earnings forecasts for the two companies it will split into next month that disappointed analysts. The stock, which like Intel is a Dow component, fell 5.5 percent to $39.99.
The jobs report showed the unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 percent, from 8.3 percent in July, but the improvement was largely because more workers gave up the search for a job.
Material shares were among the strongest of the day after China approved $157 billion in infrastructure spending in a move to energize an economy that has recently shown signs of slowing. AK Steel Holding surged 7.6 percent to $5.78, while James River Coal added 5.3 percent to $2.76 and Alpha Natural Resources soared 17 percent to $6.90.
About 65 percent of companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher while 56 percent of Nasdaq shares ended higher.
Volume was light, with about 6.44 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below last year's daily average of 7.84 billion.

HEADLINE: As a Coolant Is Phased Out, Smugglers Reap Big Profits

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL and ANDREW W. LEHREN

 BODY:
MIAMI -- The chief executive of the century-old company from America's heartland shifted nervously on the witness stand here as he tried to explain how a trusted senior vice president had been caught on a wiretap buying half a million dollars in smuggled merchandise, much of it from China.
But the contraband purchased by Marcone, a St. Louis-based company that claims to be the nation's largest authorized source for appliance parts, was not counterfeit handbags or fake medicines. It was a colorless gas that provides the chill for air-conditioners from Miami to Mumbai, from Bogotá to Beijing.
Under an international treaty, the gas, HCFC-22, has been phased out of new equipment in the industrialized world because it damages the earth's ozone layer and contributes to global warming. There are strict limits on how much can be imported or sold in the United States by American manufacturers. 
But the gas is still produced in enormous volumes and sold cheaply in China, India and Mexico, among other places in the developing world, making it a profitable if unlikely commodity for international smugglers.
So in 2009, Carlos Garcia, the Marcone vice president, generated big business for his company's growing air-conditioning operation by selling smuggled foreign gas to repairmen at rock bottom prices in a promotion called Freaky Freon Fridays, drawing on a brand name that many use as a synonym for coolants.
Although it has been illegal to sell new air-conditioners containing HCFC-22 in the United States since 2010, vast quantities of the gas are still needed to service old machines. Importing HCFC-22 without the needed approvals, as Marcone did, violates international treaties and United States law and regulations.
Yet for a long time, ''Mr. Garcia was a hero to his company'' for the profits his Freaky Freon Friday campaign generated, an assistant United States attorney, Thomas A. Watts-FitzGerald, told a rapt federal courtroom here in April.
On June 26, Mr. Garcia was sentenced to 13 months in federal prison.
International efforts to curb the use of HCFC-22 are faltering for dozens of reasons, from loopholes in environmental treaties to the reluctance of manufacturers to step up development of more environmentally friendly machines.
But the underlying problem is that even as international treaties and United States law demand that companies renounce the use of the coolant, economics propels them to use ever more -- sometimes even if it means breaking the law.
Although the Marcone case is the largest smuggling prosecution anywhere so far, investigators believe that smuggled gas is used by other companies in the United States, and European customs officials have intercepted shipments of contraband gas arriving in Finland, Slovenia and Poland in the last two years, said Halvart Koeppen, a United Nations official who tracks illegal trade of the gas. This is ''the tip of the iceberg,'' he said.
Much of the global air-conditioning industry relies on the gas the way the auto industry does on gasoline. But while oil is getting harder to find and more expensive, HCFC-22 is becoming more abundant and remaining cheap on the global market.
''There is no question that this is inhibiting phaseout,'' said Rajendra Shende, a former head of the United Nations Ozone Action Program who runs the Terre Policy Center, an environmental research institute in Pune, India.
In the meantime, the price of legitimately obtained gas has been rising in the United States and throughout Europe. That is because governments of industrialized nations, to comply with the ozone treaty known as the Montreal Protocol, restrict the use of the environmentally damaging gas in various ways. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency requires that companies obtain a license to make, sell or buy specific amounts of HCFC-22, with such ''allowances'' decreasing year by year.
The dwindling supply has led to pronounced spikes in price. What once cost retailers like Marcone $55 a canister was by 2009 going for $140 in the United States. By reducing the supply of the coolant and encouraging prices to rise, the United States government hoped to force manufacturers and consumers to scrap old machines and invest in more environmentally friendly, if more expensive, alternatives. But it has not worked out that way, especially in recessionary times when people hang on to old appliances and search for cheap shortcuts.
Many air-conditioning manufacturers have even figured out how to sidestep the 2010 ban on selling new machines containing HCFC-22, by offering unfilled air-conditioning compressors that service workers swap into existing units and then fill with the gas, creating refurbished machines that are as good as new.
The chemical giant DuPont has estimated that the service demand for HCFC-22 could exceed the supply by 27.5 million pounds annually in the United States for the next three years.
A big chunk of that shortfall will be made up through smuggling, experts say. And smuggled gas is cheaper, going for $130 a canister in the Marcone case.
The smuggling is difficult to stop because gas canisters can be readily mislabeled to mask their content. Inspections are time-consuming, policing requires expensive testing equipment that is in short supply, and border agents have more pressing targets like guns and narcotics.
In the 1990s, when the world began a successful campaign to eliminate the use of an even more powerful ozone-depleting substance called CFC-12, smuggling was also a problem. But 20 years later, the challenges are far greater: the center of the cooling industry has moved to Asia, where gas production is more difficult to monitor. China now makes more than 70 percent of the world's room air-conditioners and more than half of the world's supply of HCFC-22.
It is also easier for smugglers to hide contraband in the dizzying flows of legitimate goods in an increasingly globalized world.
''This is a crime that has all the profits of drug trafficking and none of the risk,'' said Mr. Watts-FitzGerald, the prosecutor in the Miami case. In many ways, it was Mr. Garcia's bad luck that the only United States attorney's district office to have a special environmental crimes unit is in South Florida.
Its relentless two-year investigation -- complete with wiretaps and informants -- raised the curtain on a multimillion-dollar web of smugglers and trafficking routes stretching from factories in the developing world -- mostly China -- to the Dominican Republic, Wales, Mexico and other points before the coolant gas ended up in American homes.
The smuggled Marcone coolant entered the United States through a variety of ruses, evidence collected by prosecutors showed.
Some of the Chinese gas on offer traveled to Ireland and the Dominican Republic before arriving in Miami, hidden among legitimate goods in three cargo containers on a small freighter. Mr. Garcia helped falsify shipping documents, express-mailing faked invoices to middlemen in the Dominican Republic to ease passage into the United States.
Other canisters came in an illegal shipment from Harp International, a leading manufacturer of the gas in Wales, accompanied by false documentation that the gas had been recycled to comply with import restrictions.
One lot of smuggled gas traveled a particularly dizzying journey: made in the United States and exported to Mexico, only to be sent back to Miami.
DuPont exports gas to Mexico -- the top foreign destination for American-made HCFC-22 -- because it makes more of the coolant at its Louisville, Ky., factory than it is allowed to sell in the United States. But because Mexico does not yet restrict use of the gas, the market price in Mexico is far lower than in the United States.
The smugglers took advantage of the differential, buying cheaper DuPont gas in Mexico and routing it back through the Caribbean to Miami for sale at north-of-the-border prices. The shipment was stopped after federal agents noticed that the canisters' markings indicated that they had been packaged for the Mexican market.
As a result of the Miami investigation, Marcone pleaded guilty to violating federal laws, although on the witness stand its chief executive said he had not realized Mr. Garcia's imports were illegal. So did several smugglers, including a Florida couple and a now-jailed Irish national financed by a Peruvian businessman who was recently indicted as well.
Caught on a wiretap, Mr. Garcia once asked a supplier whether the product was from Honeywell or DuPont.
''From China,'' the man answered.
Over time, he apparently became comfortable with his booming business, bragging about how easy it was to smuggle coolants into the United States.
''Remember that there are a bunch of tricks,'' he said.
Chilling Effect: Articles in this series describe the impact of the rising demand for coolant gases, a growing contributor to global warming.

MAPS: How a Contraband Coolant Entered the United States: On June 26, Carlos Garcia, vice president of the St. Louis-based appliance supplier Marcone, was sentenced to 13 months in prison for his role in the illegal importing of more than $11 million worth of a controlled refrigerant gas called HCFC-22 by Marcone's Miami branch. Federal laws strictly limit imports of this ozone-depleting gas while its use in this country is being phased out. (A13)

HEADLINE: Family Property Means Managing for a Legacy

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
SOME wealthy people will have to make a decision soon if they are to take advantage of the $5.12 million gift tax exemption that is due to expire at the end of the year.
Cash is always the easiest way to take advantage of the exemption, but few wealthy people want to give that much money away lest they need it at some point. Property, on the other hand, has several virtues. Its value may be depressed now, but it is likely to go up by the time heirs get control. In addition, some wealthy people view property as a way of keeping the family together.
But giving a second home as a gift can be more complicated than people often expect, wealth advisers say. Other types of property, like timberland, farms or buildings, are a better option, advisers say, because they generate income. Still, they also present an intriguing problem beyond how to take advantage of the tax break: how do you make sure the property is well managed for the next 50 years? 
This is something the family that Mark Schleicher married into has been contemplating for 90 years. He said that his wife's family acquired 33,000 acres in southwest Florida when they lent a timber baron some money and he defaulted on the loan. The land, on the border of Sarasota and Manatee Counties, was held in trust and more or less sat there.
The family, whose money came from the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company, had hired a manager to operate it as a ranch, mostly for running cattle, growing citrus trees and mining shells, which were used for road construction.
But in the 1990s, the family decided that the land was being mismanaged and sought advice on how to develop it, Mr. Schleicher said. Since then, they have turned a quarter of the land into Lakewood Ranch, a planned community with 7,500 homes, four million square feet of commercial space and amenities that include golf courses, soccer fields and a polo field.
''We're taking great pride in doing this project,'' said Mr. Schleicher, who is a board member of Schroeder-Manatee Ranch or SMR, the family holding company that owns Lakewood Ranch and other businesses on the property. ''It's not about squeezing the last nickel out of the thing. It's about creating a really first-class community that we can all be proud of, and it's our legacy, really, as a family.''
This, of course, is the reason people leave property in trust. Cash can be spent and so can stocks and bonds, after they are cashed in. But land is meant to keep everyone together generation after generation. So why, then, do these plans often fail?
Not surprisingly, many of them are hatched too quickly or without any advice from the people who are going to benefit from the property but also have to manage it.
''When parents don't communicate well, that's when things don't work out,'' said Peter E. Lang, a managing director at HighTower Advisors, a wealth management firm. ''The more complicated the asset, the more planning; that's when you need to get the kids involved.''
This particularly applies to property, whether it is a vacation home, undeveloped land or a vast planned community. It comes with the obligation to manage it, whether providing simple upkeep or making larger economic decisions.
Scott J. Cooper, managing director in the wealth structuring group at Merrill Lynch, said there had been a lot of interest in putting vacation homes in trust to take advantage of the gift tax exemption, but he said homes were not always an ideal asset, particularly when several children and spouses would use one house.
''Anyone who has ever shared a dorm room with another person probably has a point of view on this,'' he said. ''First of all, there is the issue of, do the kids really want it? Then, you have all the challenges of a time share. When it's time to remodel the kitchen, do you go with granite countertops or Formica? That gets pretty dicey.''
Mr. Lang said that even when clients navigated these issues smoothly, there was usually compromise.
He recalled a client who left her Cape Cod beach house to her twin daughters. One lived around Boston and used it all the time; the other lived outside New York and had little interest in making the five-hour drive. But they agreed to own it jointly and split the expenses because the New York daughter worked in the family business and benefited from that in a way her sister could not.
''They were just very open about it,'' Mr. Lang said.
With a property like Lakewood Ranch, which generates income but also requires investment to keep building it out, the intrafamily discussions are bigger and carry greater financial consequences.
''Real estate is very personal,'' said Michael E. Papierski, senior vice president at Northern Trust and a board member of SMR. ''People don't look at it anything like stocks and bonds. They look at how it's going to be managed in the future.''
His firm manages various properties owned in trust, including a ski resort, a Manhattan office building and a recreational complex in Michigan. He said a big issue that divided families was whether the property should be run to generate income in the short term for current beneficiaries or managed so that its value increased over time.
The answer usually depends on what kind of beneficiaries they are. A second spouse who receives only the income from a trust is not going to feel the same about managing the property as children from the first marriage who will pass it on to their children.
In the case of Lakewood Ranch, Mr. Schleicher said the families used a combination of cash flow and borrowing to build out the community. Doing so required agreement not just among the 12 board members but also among the larger family.
''The family generally has a unified opinion that this is a legacy asset,'' Mr. Papierski said. ''They see the long-term benefits and value that can come from this property.''
But that also raises the question of what happens when the number of descendants increases over time and there are more, but smaller, ownership stakes. Mr. Schleicher said that two or three families controlled Lakewood Ranch and that he had involved his children so they would know what was going on when their generation took over.
This is not the norm. Mr. Papierski said Northern Trust used to manage an office building that was owned in trust with 25 beneficiaries who often disagreed. In that case, he said the beneficiaries got lucky: they were able to sell the building back to the developer, allowing the trust to simply distribute cash to the beneficiaries.
More often, family members will struggle to sell their stakes in a property. Mr. Cooper at Merrill Lynch said he advised clients to put provisions in trusts so that children could sell their shares to other family members.
''The trust also needs the mechanism to buy a beneficiary's interest out, if everyone has a different position in life and there's a disparity in income,'' he said. The rich brother, he said, ''should be able to find a way to buy out his brothers' interest.''
''But it's hard to force people to do it,'' he said.
On an income-generating property, Mr. Cooper said, the same issues can arise when siblings or cousins are seeking money from the trust. ''I don't care who you are, if your brother is getting a $25,000 distribution because there was some excess cash in the building, everyone wants a $25,000 cash distribution,'' he said.
When it works out well, though, property can indeed keep a family together. Mr. Schleicher said he thought the family had succeeded in sticking together because no one depended on the income from the property.
''It sat there for 70 years,'' he said. ''There wasn't any income there. So this is kind of like a newfound income stream, if you will.''
In the 10 years that he has been involved in managing the property, he said the family had gotten along. ''We're all in the same boat and pulling in the same direction,'' he said.
But he said it would take an additional 30 or 40 years for Lakewood Ranch to be completed. And that's a long time for any boat to stay the course -- something for others to keep in mind.

HEADLINE: A Day Later, It's Still the Economy

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and ANNIE LOWREY; Helene Cooper reported from Iowa City, and Annie Lowrey from Washington. Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from Sioux City, Iowa.

 BODY:
IOWA CITY -- Only hours after accepting his party's nomination for a second term, President Obama found himself on the defensive over a jobs report that was weak in almost every way.
The disappointing report leaves the president and his advisers with fading hopes that the economy will surge ahead before Election Day -- much as it did late last year -- and allow them to amplify his case that the country is on the road to recovery.
And so on Friday Mr. Obama found himself making the complicated argument that the flagging recovery, while not good enough, is at least persistent enough to show that he has put the country on the right path. He has also found himself in the bleak position of having to prove to voters in the 59 days before they head to the polls that despite the sluggish economy and high unemployment, Americans would be even worse off with Mitt Romney at the helm. 
''It's certainly not what I would call the position we wanted to be in at this point in the race,'' one Obama administration official, who requested anonymity to talk candidly about the campaign, said on Friday. ''He's going to have to make the case that we wouldn't even be at 8 percent if it weren't for him.''
For the past two years, Mr. Obama based his campaign on the argument that Democrats had reversed an economic free fall and helped put millions of people back to work.
But that argument has proved harder to make with middling-or-worse jobs reports month after month. The August report shows that the unemployment rate fell only slightly, and even that drop was largely because hundreds of thousand of workers had given up looking for jobs.
''Today we learned that after losing around 800,000 jobs a month when I took office, businesses added private-sector jobs for the 30th month in a row,'' Mr. Obama told a campaign rally in Portsmouth, N.H.
Still, the pace of job growth was ''not good enough,'' Mr. Obama was forced to acknowledge.
The bad economic news, with the August jobs report showing continued misery particularly for the less-educated and the long-term unemployed, electrified Republican pollsters and politicians eager to interpret it as yet more evidence of the failure of Mr. Obama's economic policies.
On Friday, Mr. Romney made a full-throated argument that Mr. Obama is failing as an economic steward, referring on Twitter to the Democratic National Convention as a party and the jobs report as the hangover.
''There's almost nothing the president has done in the past three and a half, four years that gives the American people confidence that he knows what he's doing when it comes to jobs and the economy,'' Mr. Romney said on his way to a campaign stop in Sioux City, Iowa.
His surrogates and supporters piled on. ''If this labor market were a horse, they'd send it to the glue factory,'' said Andrew G. Biggs, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, in a statement. ''Lucky for the horse, the factory is closed, too.''
Mr. Obama's advisers say the president in the next two months will hammer home his argument that Republicans have stood in the way of better jobs numbers. He will argue that Republican opposition to his jobs bill has hampered growth. And he will continue to refine the accusation that his opponents are obsessed with tax cuts, an argument he unveiled at the convention in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday night.
On Friday, in a joint campaign appearance with Michelle Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, Mr. Obama was refining -- and expanding upon -- his tax cut argument, until it took an almost humorous turn.
Instead of a jobs agenda, Mr. Obama said, ''all they've got to offer is the same prescriptions that they've had for the last 30 years: tax cuts, tax cuts, gut some regulations, oh, and more tax cuts,'' he said. Then, apparently liking the line he was on, he added: ''Tax cuts to help you lose a few extra pounds. Tax cuts to improve your love life.''
Behind the jokes though, the president, who traveled to Iowa on Friday before heading to Florida for a weekend campaign bus tour, and his advisers are clearly worried, and with good reason.
Economic growth slowed through the first half of the year, leading many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, to raise their year-end unemployment forecasts. American businesses added only 96,000 jobs in August, below expectations.
As disappointing as the report may be, both economic and political analysts said they did not think it changed the fundamentals of either the presidential race or the economy. The stock market on Friday closed virtually unchanged.
The economic narrative seemed to remain the same: The economy is in poor condition, and the recovery anemic, but persistent.
''While there is more work that remains to be done, today's employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression,'' said Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, in a statement.
Polls have remained stable in recent months even as the economic news has become more and more tepid. Many voters seem to have absorbed the state of the economy -- slowly recovering from a deep downturn -- and made up their minds, political scientists and pollsters believe.
''There's not a lot of undecided voters out there, and the impact of any given piece of economic news is going to be relatively small,'' said John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University. ''While it's not good, it's not a decisive shift.''
Mr. Sides also noted that voters tended to focus on economic growth in the year before they headed to the polls.
But other analysts said there seemed to be some evidence that the weak economic reports piling up might weigh on Mr. Obama and help Mr. Romney at the polls.
''I'm reminded of 1992, when, after the election, a story went around that G. H. W. Bush lost because there was a perception of the economy in recession even though the economy was already improving,'' Andrew Gelman, the director of the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia University, wrote in an e-mail.
''The news of the next two months will be important, as the story does not seem set in stone.''

HEADLINE: Behind the Scenes, the Bloodiest Beltway Battle

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE PRICE OF POLITICSBy Bob Woodward
Illustrated. 428 pages. Simon & Schuster. $30.
As a plethora of election-year polls and surveys indicate, Americans are fed up with a deeply dysfunctional Washington paralyzed by partisan gridlock and increasingly incapable of dealing with the daunting problems facing the nation: a White House plagued by infighting, disorganization and inconsistent leadership; a Republican Party bent on obstruction and increasingly beholden to its insurgent right wing; and a Congress riven by party rivalries, intraparty power struggles, petty turf wars and an inability to focus on long-term solutions instead of temporary Band-Aids.
Bob Woodward's depressing and often tedious new book, ''The Price of Politics,'' reads like a minutely detailed illustration of these woes. It focuses on ''the struggle between President Obama and the United States Congress to manage federal spending and tax policy for the three and one-half years between 2009 and the summer of 2012.'' And the bulk of its narrative is devoted to behind-the-scenes negotiations that took place in the summer of 2011, as the country teetered on the brink of a potentially catastrophic default over the federal debt ceiling. 
Much of this story has already been told in lengthy articles in The New York Times Magazine by Matt Bai and in The Washington Post by Peter Wallsten, Lori Montgomery and Scott Wilson. ''The Price of Politics'' adds some colorful new details to earlier accounts and examines the aftermath of the failure of the president and Speaker John A. Boehner to reach a ''grand bargain'' in July 2011 involving cutting the deficit, rewriting the tax code and rolling back the cost of entitlements. It also describes tensions between the White House and Capitol Hill, between the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats and between Mr. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader.
Beyond the most hard-core fiscal policy wonks, however, it's difficult to imagine anyone outside the Beltway being interested in this volume's granular telling and retelling of these matters, its almost blow-by-blow chronicle of the maneuvering, haggling, grandstanding and ideological positioning that have taken root on both sides of the aisle.
Most of ''The Price of Politics'' sticks like Velcro to its narrow focus on the debt-ceiling negotiations, declining really to grapple with broader questions about the Obama administration's handling of the economic crisis it inherited after the 2008 crash: the perceived successes and failures of its stimulus program; the infighting among members of its economic team; its much debated stewardship of the banking crisis and Wall Street reform; and its continuing struggles with unemployment and an underwater housing market. For these issues, the reader is better off turning to books like ''The Escape Artists'' by Noam Scheiber, ''Confidence Men'' by Ron Suskind, or Michael Hirsh's ''Capital Offense.''
Like Mr. Woodward's earlier books, ''The Price of Politics'' is based on lots of insider interviews, conducted mostly on background -- meaning, Mr. Woodward writes, ''the information could be used in the book but none of the sources would be identified by name'' -- along with supporting documents, meeting notes, e-mails and diaries. As a result, the narrative tends to reflect the spin of people who talked the most -- or the most persuasively -- with Mr. Woodward: in this case, it would seem, Republican and Democratic Congressional officials, and some administration insiders.
Large swaths of this book concern the depressing blame game the administration and Congressional Republicans waged against each other after talks between President Obama and Mr. Boehner about the grand bargain abruptly collapsed. What caused that collapse? Depends which side you believe.
Republicans have argued that the White House, nervous about how Congressional Democrats and the party's base would react, ''moved the goal posts'' at the last minute, requesting an additional $400 billion on the revenue side.
Democrats have suggested that Mr. Boehner walked away because he could not rally Republican support for the deal. Within the White House, Mr. Woodward writes, many of those involved in the negotiations argued that Mr. Boehner ''did not come close to steering his own ship'': ''Instead of being a visionary trying to make a grand bargain, Boehner had, almost all alone, crawled out on a limb and watched as Eric Cantor and the Tea Party sawed it off.''
Mr. Woodward provides a dramatic account of the angry phone call in which Mr. Boehner told Mr. Obama that the deal was off. Mr. Woodward writes that Rob Nabors, a White House official, remembers the usually cool president gripping the phone so tightly that it looked as if it might break, displaying what Mr. Woodward calls ''a flash of pure fury.''
Mr. Boehner tells Mr. Woodward, ''He was spewing coals.'' This is what Mr. Boehner said he told the president: ''I'd put revenue on there if we had real changes in entitlement programs. Every time we get there, you and I agree; all of a sudden you guys keep backing up, backing up, backing up. And now you call me and you want more revenue. It ain't going to happen. I'm done with it.''
Many aspects of this book's portrait of Mr. Obama echo reports from other journalists and Washington insiders: a president who has not spent a lot of time cultivating relationships with members of Congress, Republican or Democrat, and who has similarly distant (if not downright tense) relationships with business executives; an idealistic but sometimes naïve and overconfident chief executive with little managerial experience and little understanding of the horse-trading and deal-making that make Washington run (skills that, say, Lyndon B. Johnson possessed in spades).
The White House was in such disarray in the wake of the Republicans' big win in the 2010 midterm elections, Mr. Woodward reports, that when the president went to make a congratulatory call to Mr. Boehner, the incoming House speaker, the Obama staff had to scramble to find a phone number for him, eventually turning to a fishing buddy of somebody who worked for Mr. Boehner.
Another scene in this book, from early 2009, describes Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, then the House speaker, working with Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, on last-minute details of the stimulus package when the president calls. As Mr. Obama -- who's been put on speakerphone -- begins to deliver a high-minded message about how important the bill is, Mr. Woodward reports, Ms. Pelosi ''reached over and pressed the mute button on her phone,'' so they could hear him but he couldn't hear them as they continued number-crunching the bill.
As for Mr. Boehner, he praises the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, but criticizes the rest of the Obama team. In hindsight, the speaker tells Mr. Woodward: ''They never had their act together. The president, I think, was ill served by his team. Nobody in charge, no process. I just don't know how the place works.''
It's an accusation that echoes comments, cited in Mr. Suskind's ''Confidence Men,'' that Lawrence H. Summers, the former chief White House economic adviser, reportedly made to the White House budget director, Peter Orszag: ''We're home alone. There's no adult in charge.'' (Mr. Summers has disputed comments attributed to him in that book, saying they were distorted or taken out of context.)
In the past, Mr. Woodward has been known for writing straight-ahead narratives, with little analysis, context or assessment. This changed with the last two of his four books on George W. Bush's administration, ''The War Within'' and ''State of Denial,'' in which he came to the conclusion that President Bush had ''displayed impatience, bravado and unsettling personal certainty about his decisions'' instead of real leadership.
''The Price of Politics'' ends with similar editorializing. Mr. Woodward writes that ''the debt-limit crisis was a time of peril for the United States, its economy and its place in the global financial order'' and that ''neither President Obama nor Speaker Boehner handled it particularly well,'' unable to transcend ''their fixed partisan convictions and dogmas.''
His harshest words are reserved for Mr. Obama: ''It is a fact that President Obama was handed a miserable, faltering economy and faced a recalcitrant Republican opposition.
''But presidents work their will -- or should work their will -- on the important matters of national business. There is occasional discussion in this book about Presidents Reagan and Clinton, what they did or would have done. Open as both are to serious criticism, they nonetheless largely worked their will.
''Obama has not. The mission of stabilizing and improving the economy is incomplete.''

HEADLINE: Race Is On In Earnest As Candidates Hit the Road

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and HELENE COOPER; Jeremy W. Peters reported from Sioux City, Iowa, and Helene Cooper from Iowa City.

 BODY:
SIOUX CITY, Iowa -- Mitt Romney's plane touched down here on Friday, and with it arrived the beginning of what is expected to be the most expensive and intense political advertising war ever.
The Romney campaign has unleashed its first barrage of commercials in Iowa and seven other battleground states, a narrowly targeted effort that underscores just how much money will flood so few states in such a small amount of time. It also presents a challenge to the Obama campaign, which will be at a financial disadvantage. Mr. Romney will spend $4.8 million for just four days of advertising.
In Iowa -- and in a handful of states from Colorado and Nevada in the West to New Hampshire and Virginia in the East -- the next two months before Election Day will be a blur of television, radio and Internet ads, campaign rallies and endless unsolicited phone calls. 
Friday, the first real day of general election campaigning, offered a preview of what the race will look like over the next few weeks -- in all its relentlessness and fury.
As the morning newscasts were getting under way with coverage of both Mr. Obama's speech to the Democratic convention on Thursday night, and the release of new, disappointing jobs numbers, the Romney campaign put its ads on the air.
They hammer the president with a line of attack that Mr. Romney has started making more forcefully in recent days: that Mr. Obama's policies have failed to make the country better off than it was four years ago, despite what he and his allies might say.
For his part, with the convention over Mr. Obama wasted no time crisscrossing the country. He and Mr. Romney campaigned just hours apart in Iowa and New Hampshire. Then the president left for Florida, where he is going on a bus tour this weekend.
Mr. Obama alluded to his financial disadvantage while campaigning in Portsmouth, N.H., with his wife, Michelle, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill.
''You can't give up on the idea that your vote makes a difference,'' Mr. Obama told the crowd. ''Because if you do give up then the lobbyists and the special interests, they'll fill the void: The folks who are writing the $10 million checks, the folks running all these super PAC ads.''
Mr. Obama also took some swipes at Mr. Romney and Republicans, saying their criticisms of him were merely a diversion because they lacked a plan of their own.
''They want your vote, but they don't want to show you their plan,'' he said. ''That's because all they've got to offer is the same prescriptions that they've had for the last 30 years -- tax cuts, tax cuts, gut some regulations, oh, and more tax cuts. Tax cuts when times are good; tax cuts when times are bad. Tax cuts to help you lose a few extra pounds. Tax cuts to improve your love life. It will cure anything, according to them.''
Mr. Romney's campaign released 15 new ads in all, each focused on a specific state and the issues most likely to resonate with voters there.
In Florida, for example, people will see commercials about falling real estate values and high foreclosure rates. In Colorado, where the military and its contractors are large employers, people will be told that the president's budget cuts could cost 20,000 military jobs there.
And here in Iowa, ads will tell voters how ''excessive government regulations are crushing small businesses and family farms.''
Despite the differing messages, the ads open with the same clip from Mr. Romney's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. ''This president cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office,'' he is shown saying.
The other states where the ads will run until Tuesday -- when both candidates have agreed to suspend their advertising for the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks -- are Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia.
The ads will help Mr. Romney keep pace on the air with Mr. Obama, who spent close to $50 million on television commercials in the last month alone.
Though Republican ''super PACs'' gave him cover by showing their own ads during the summer, Mr. Romney was limited by campaign finance regulations from spending his $185 million war chest on advertising until he officially became the nominee.
For the first time, Mr. Obama will be at a direct spending disadvantage compared with Mr. Romney. As of the most recent reporting period, which counted campaign account totals through the end of July, Mr. Obama had about $60 million less cash on hand than his Republican rival.
And the super PAC that supports him, Priorities USA Action, has failed to raise money at the same levels as its Republican counterparts, which will continue to inundate the airwaves with ads.
American Crossroads, the super PAC founded by Karl Rove and other top Republican strategists, started a new $6.6 million advertising campaign this week with an ad that mocks the president's campaign slogan, ''Forward.''
''President Obama says he'll move us forward. But where's he taken us so far?'' asks an announcer before giving a list of grim economic statistics.
The different targets of the candidates' ad campaigns show how a race this tight could turn on any number of issues or demographics.
Both campaigns have pursued carefully focused advertising strategies, said Elizabeth Wilner of Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group.
''Obama's advertising has targeted by demographic: lots of ads aimed at Latinos, women, with ads about abortion-related issues, young people with ads about the cost of education, etc.,'' she said. ''Romney's advertising is geo-targeting with economic issues: housing in Florida, manufacturing in Ohio. And it's a reflection of the broader situation. In a nutshell, the economy favors Romney. The demographics favor Obama.''

HEADLINE: Record Number of Foreigners Were Deported in 2011, Officials Say

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Immigration enforcement authorities detained and deported record numbers of illegal immigrants in 2011 and are on track for similar figures this year, even as the numbers of migrants crossing the border illegally dropped to a 40-year low, according to data published Friday by the Department of Homeland Security. 
Immigration agents deported 391,953 foreign-born people during the 2011 fiscal year, the department's Office of Immigration Statistics reported. They included more than 188,000 people who had been convicted of crimes in the United States -- an ''all-time high'' for such deportations, the report found.
Citizens of four Latin American countries -- Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- made up 93 percent of all people deported last year.
With just one month to go in the 2012 fiscal year, deportations were down slightly, with just over 366,000 people expelled through Aug. 31. But they include more than 191,000 convicted criminals, more than last year, according to figures from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, one of several agencies in the department.
The figures provide a backdrop to the administration's political calculations on the thorny issue of immigration as President Obama heads into the last stretch before the November elections. Although Homeland Security Department officials have said they are focusing their efforts on criminals, the fast pace of deportations in the last two years was felt in many Latino immigrant communities, and caused growing disillusionment with Mr. Obama.
Pressure from Latino and immigrant groups helped persuade Mr. Obama to take a sweeping executive action in June to suspend deportations temporarily for as many as 1.7 million young illegal immigrants who came to this country as children. The program, which has been very popular among Latinos, began to accept applications on Aug. 15. Homeland Security Department officials have not yet reported that any applicants have been approved and their deportations deferred.
In spite of the sharp increases in deportations of criminals, Mr. Obama's policies have not won him friends on the other side of the political divide. Republicans in Congress say the deferred deportations are a backdoor amnesty, and they accuse the administration of crippling enforcement by demanding that agents steer away from arresting illegal immigrants if they are not convicted criminals.
In addition to formal deportations, last year Homeland Security Department agents expelled about 324,000 foreigners back to their countries without formal court proceedings, according to the report. Most were illegal immigrants who agreed to leave voluntarily after they were detained, rather than be removed by the authorities.
According to the new figures, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is known as ICE, detained about 429,000 immigrants last year, another record.
Homeland security authorities have increasingly concentrated their efforts at the border with Mexico, with the majority of detentions and expulsions coming there. In 2011, the Border Patrol captured about 335,000 migrants trying to cross illegally, the lowest number since 1971, and the figures are continuing to drop. High rates of unemployment here and intensified border enforcement have discouraged many migrants from Mexico and Central America from attempting illegal crossings, officials said.
The Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has said his priority would be tougher border enforcement. He has not said if he would cancel the deferred deportations program.

HEADLINE: Job Gains Slow, Posing Problem For Obama's Bid

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The nation's employers eased up on hiring in August, making it clear that the economy was stuck in low gear.
The pace of job creation, disclosed in government figures released on Friday, fell far short of the stronger showing at the start of the year. It presents a fresh challenge to President Obama just two months before the election. It also provides more ammunition for Republicans, who say the country needs a new economic course.
While the weak report reverberated on the campaign trail, traders and economists immediately focused on the Federal Reserve, betting increasingly that its policy makers will take new action to stimulate the economy when they meet next week.
The nation added 96,000 jobs in August, compared with a revised figure of 141,000 in July and well below the 125,000 level economists had expected. Over the last six months, job growth has averaged 97,000 a month, typically not enough to absorb new entrants to the labor force, let alone cut the unemployment rate significantly. 
''This is one of those reports that as you dig deeper, it looks less friendly,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''The improvement in the rate was purely due to people who gave up looking for jobs.''
For August, the jobless rate did fall to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent in July, but that was largely because more people left the work force entirely. The government report showed that the overall labor force dropped by 368,000 workers in August. The portion of the population in the labor force fell to 63.5 percent, the lowest level since September 1981.
''Politically, you can spin the drop in the rate as a positive, but it's a sign of weakness,'' Mr. Harris said. ''The economy is slowing down and it wasn't very robust to begin with.''
As job growth in the United States has cooled in recent months, European economies have weakened as the debt crisis deepened there. And the Chinese economy has shown signs of a sharp slowdown recently.
Though the figures for August did not represent a drastic plunge in job creation from recent months -- in June the economy created just 45,000 jobs -- many experts quietly raised their forecasts ahead of the announcement by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That optimism seemed to be supported by a drop in first-time unemployment claims on Thursday, as well as a report the same day from Automatic Data Processing, a private payroll firm, that showed a gain of 201,000 jobs in the private sector. A.D.P. tracks about 400,000 companies that are clients, Mr. Harris said, while the government statisticians capture a broader range of businesses.
For the Federal Reserve, Friday's report provided more evidence of economic weakness. Economists said it raised the likelihood of action to stimulate the economy when the Fed's Open Market committee convened on Wednesday and Thursday.
Just last week, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, delivered a forceful argument for more action, calling the unemployment level a ''grave concern.'' Unemployment has been above 8 percent since February 2009.
One possible course would be another round of asset purchases intended to push down rates, making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and invest. A more limited option would be for the Fed to extend its commitment to a low benchmark interest rate, now near zero, into 2015 from late 2014.
Despite the weak jobs report, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a slight gain on Friday, highlighting a conviction among many investors that the Fed will act. Many economists, though, are not so sure about how far the Fed will go.
Some, like Nigel Gault of IHS Global Insight, predicted a third round of so-called quantitative easing, with the Fed buying $500 billion to $600 billion worth of assets, mostly mortgage-backed securities, to try to lower rates.
Others, like Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research, predicted that the Fed would limit itself to extending the ultralow benchmark rate. He estimated a 60 percent chance that the Fed would extend the rate but only a 10 percent chance of another round of asset purchases.
''I don't think the economy is quite as weak as the 96,000 figure suggests,'' he said. ''The Fed doesn't react to one data point.''
One problem for the Fed is that more easing tends to lower the value of the dollar against foreign currencies, he said. Besides driving up the price of commodities like oil, it does little to help China or Europe avert a further slowdown.
The rate of job creation has been erratic in 2012. After adding more than 250,000 jobs in both January and February, the economy slowed. Job creation briefly recovered a bit in July, but few economists expect big gains in the coming months.
Sectors with growth in employment tended to be lower-paying ones, said Mark Vitner, a senior economist with Wells Fargo. About 40 percent of the new jobs came from four areas: retail, leisure and hospitality, temporary help services and home health care services. Manufacturing, a closely watched barometer for the economy, lost 15,000 jobs.
''This is one of the reasons wages haven't been growing,'' he said. ''People are taking jobs they didn't take in the past, moving from sectors like construction into jobs at lower-paying, big-box retailers.''
There were a few slivers of encouragement in Friday's report. Using the broadest measure of unemployment, which includes part-time workers who want to work full time as well as individuals who are not looking for jobs but indicate they want to work, the unemployment rate fell to 14.7 percent from 15 percent.
The pace of government layoffs seems to be slowing, said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School and director of the school's Center for Human Resources. As the private sector added 103,000 jobs in August, governments cut just 7,000. That is down from 21,000 in July, and well below the average of 16,000 reductions a month since March. Federal employment actually increased by 3,000 in August, to 2.8 million, the first monthly increase since February 2011.
There was only slight relief for the long-term unemployed, defined as workers out of a job for at least 27 weeks. Their ranks fell by 152,000 to just over five million in August, and they account for 40 percent of all unemployed people. Among workers with less than a high school education, the unemployment rate fell to 12 percent from 12.7 percent, but that remains far above the 4.1 percent unemployment level for workers with a college degree or more.
Still, there were plenty of other signs the economy was still treading water. Average hourly earnings paid by private employers ticked downward by 1 cent in August, to $23.52, while the length of the typical private sector workweek remained flat at 34.4 hours. Both measures have barely budged from where they were six months ago.

HEADLINE: Steady Progress or More of Same? Politicians React

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A modest improvement in the unemployment rate and a marginal increase in job creation were greeted by Democrats as signs of slow but steady progress and disparaged by Republicans as another month of sluggish economic underperformance.
The jobless rate, now 8.1 percent, has been drifting in a narrow range between 8.1 and 8.3 percent all year, and it is a nip-and-tuck question whether it will edge below the 8 percent mark in the two months before the election.
''This is more of the same for middle-class families who are suffering through the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression,'' said Mitt Romney in a statement along the same lines as several others issued by top Republicans. In an interview on Fox News, he questioned whether President Obama ''knows what he is doing,'' and said that if the economy had performed as the White House projected in the administration's early days, with unemployment dropping to 5.4 percent by now, nine million more people would have jobs. 
House Speaker John A. Boehner said, ''This report underscores President Obama's failed promises to get our economy moving again.'' He noted that unemployment has exceeded 8 percent for 43 months.
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican whip, sounded the same theme in a quick message on Twitter: ''I'm unwilling to accept @BarackObama's new normal of 8% unemployment.''
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said that ''while our recovery is still moving too slowly for many Americans, job growth would likely have been even stronger if Republicans had not blocked Democratic efforts to hire more teachers, firefighters and police officers.'' (Employment in government was little changed in the month, falling by 7,000.)
If the unemployment rate appears to be locked in to a familiar pattern, so are the predictable political reactions of the two parties' leaders.
Even though the data shows a bit of improvement, it remains hard for the Democrats to make much out of a formula that includes fewer than 100,000 new jobs and a shrinking of the work force, along with downward revisions of previous monthly data.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, pointed out that August was the 30th consecutive month of growth in private-sector jobs and asserted that ''our nation is headed in the right direction.''
Congressional leaders of both parties accused their opponents of obstructionism and said that the picture would look better if only the other side would adopt their competing jobs legislation. And both sides said it was important to remove the uncertainty over the future course of taxes and spending, which may be dampening employment.
But the two parties' legislative packages have little in common and neither side's favored approach has a chance of passage before the Nov. 6 election determines where the balance of power will lie next year
''While encouraging, today's report also shows that we have more work to do,'' Mr. Hoyer said. ''We should be taking action to encourage American businesses to expand and hire for well-paying jobs that won't be shipped overseas.''
The White House, in a statement by Mr. Obama's economic adviser, Alan B. Krueger, said the president ''continues to support the elements of the American Jobs Act that have not yet passed, including further investment in infrastructure to rebuild our nation's ports, roads and highways, and assistance to state and local governments to prevent layoffs and to enable them to rehire hundreds of thousands of teachers and first responders.''
Republicans seemed eager to use the new numbers to pop any balloons left over from the Democratic convention that just ended in Charlotte, N.C.
''President Obama made a spirited pitch for the failed status quo this week, but the fact is: we can do better,'' Mr. Boehner said. It is time to ''let go of the failed 'stimulus'-style policies of the past,'' he said.
Mocking a slogan heard frequently at the Democratic convention, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said: ''Marching forward is fine if you are headed in the right direction. Clearly, this economy is not.''
As Mr. Romney put it: ''If last night was the party, today is the hangover.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Face a Juggling Act Over Jobs

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- With both parties' conventions now concluded, what is clear is that each played to type -- Republicans as the party of business, Democrats of the worker. For President Obama, however, the week here captured his tricky balancing act: a four-year struggle to show that pro-worker does not mean antibusiness.
The Democrats' three-day program, and Mr. Obama's climactic nomination acceptance speech on Thursday, included standard slams at oil and insurance companies, but far fewer knocks at private equity firms like Mitt Romney's Bain Capital than the Obama campaign and its allies were lobbing just a few months ago.
The challenge for the campaign was to counter Republican attacks at their Tampa, Fla., convention depicting Mr. Obama as the enemy of job creators when unemployment persists, while energizing his liberal base in the convention hall and beyond. The delicate juggling was most evident on Wednesday, during the brief daily window of network television coverage. 
To the chagrin of moderate Democrats, a prime-time speaker was Elizabeth Warren, the liberal scourge of Wall Street who is running in Massachusetts to unseat Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican. Her scheduling slot reflected Democrats' zeal to capture that seat and protect their slim Senate majority.
''The system is rigged,'' Ms. Warren shouted to a receptive crowd. (While she spoke, television showed Michelle Obama chatting with Julián Castro, the mayor of San Antonio and the convention keynote speaker.)
''Look around,'' Ms. Warren said. ''Oil companies guzzle down billions in profits. Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. And Wall Street C.E.O.'s -- the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs -- still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors and acting like we should thank them.''
But as the schedulers arranged, she followed James D. Sinegal, the well-known co-founder of Costco. He was among several speakers from the business world chosen to affirm Mr. Obama's philosophy that the private sector needs the hand of government to educate a work force, build roads, finance research and more. That sought to counter a Republican convention theme, based on an Obama quote taken out of context, that the president recently said of businesses, ''you didn't build that.''
''Some of my friends in corporate America say that they need a government that gets off the backs of businesses,'' Mr. Sinegal said. ''And that's why many of them are supporting the opposition with donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars.''
''But I think they've got it all wrong,'' he continued. ''Business needs a president who has covered the backs of businesses, a president who understands what the private sector needs to succeed.''
Wednesday night's other speakers included Ms. Warren's like-minded Democrats, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, Richard L. Trumka, and Bob King, president of the United Auto Workers. But the hours before prime time also featured the billionaire investor Tom Steyer, who introduced himself, with a hint of defensiveness, as ''a businessman, a professional investor and a proud Democrat''; Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a self-described ''card-carrying capitalist'' who helped found Nextel; Austin Ligon, a founder and former chief executive of CarMax; and a small-business man from swing state Virginia, Bill Butcher.
''If you listened only to Elizabeth Warren, the message was catastrophically antibusiness,'' said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. That ''further drives a wedge between business and Democrats that may not be fair but is the way business perceives things,'' he said. ''And making voters into victims is not a winning strategy.
''As Bill Clinton used to say, you can't love the jobs and hate the job creators,'' said Mr. Bennett, who worked in the Clinton administration.
Mr. Obama's speech, like Mr. Clinton's the night before, he said, ''hit the perfect balance: no victimization of the American middle class or excessive attacks on American business. Instead, he kept the focus on growth, shared prosperity and citizenship.''
But it was Mr. Obama's talk in past years, more than his policies, that alienated many on Wall Street and in big business, corporate representatives continue to say, like calling auto-company bondholders ''speculators'' and bankers ''fat cats.''
''There is a feeling that the administration does not understand business, and it's not so much that they're antibusiness, it's that their intuitions are all wrong,'' said one corporate representative here, who like others asked not to be identified in criticizing Mr. Obama. ''It's like taking someone who's grown up and spent their whole life on the Upper East Side and put them in charge of farm policy.''
Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat whose constituency includes many who work on Wall Street, said he tells businesspeople, including those he saw at the convention, that Democrats are more likely to deliver on their chief concerns: a skilled work force, because Democrats promote education, and deficit reduction, because Democrats are more willing to reduce spending on social programs than Republicans are to raise needed revenues.
''When we focus on the actual policies and policy differences, as opposed to the rhetoric, we win business over,'' he insisted.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland cited 18 tax cuts and increased lending for small businesses under President Obama, adding, ''There's a lot that's been done.''
As it happens, corporate America and Wall Street have largely recovered from the recession, even as the small businesses and workers that Mr. Obama and other Democrats focus on continue to struggle. The stock market hit its highest level in four years Thursday before Mr. Obama accepted the nomination and, on the morning after, the monthly jobs report again proved disappointing.
For all the emphasis at Democrats' convention on touting the administration's rescue of the auto industry, the Big Three manufacturers were not in evidence. With taxpayers still owning about 30 percent of General Motors, the company broke from its past practice of providing cars for officials at both parties' conventions, an official said. A Republican at a competing auto manufacturer said, ''I think business in general has a smaller presence at both conventions, and the auto industry is no different.''
Corporate America was represented at the Democratic convention by the likes of AT&T, Comcast, Bank of America and high-tech companies like Google. A few Democratic stalwarts from Wall Street showed up, including Robert E. Rubin and Roger C. Altman, who were, respectively, Treasury secretary and deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, and Mark T. Gallogly, a co-founder of the investment firm Centerbridge Partners.
Notably present -- given the Wall Street defections from Mr. Obama's cause -- was Hamilton E. James, president of the private equity firm Blackstone, who was attending a convention for the first time. Blackstone's co-founder, Stephen A. Schwarzman, is a top Romney fund-raiser. But Mr. James, who has expressed concern for rising income inequality, decided to do the same for the president after some courtship.
Republicans, reflecting a more populist conservative base in the South and West, used their convention to showcase support for small business as their way of reaching the middle class.
''You have a party becoming the champion of small business, which is where the middle class starts,'' said Carly Fiorina, a former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.
Among Republican convention speakers were executives of companies that Bain Capital invested in, attesting to Mr. Romney's qualifications and questioning Mr. Obama's ability to handle a struggling economy. ''You have to ask yourself,'' said Tom Stemberg, who headed Staples, ''Why would an administration that can't create any jobs demonize someone who did?''
So it was that in the Democrats' counterprogramming, Governor Markell, the former Nextel executive, said in his remarks that just because Mr. Romney succeeded in business, it ''does not mean he deserves to be president.''

HEADLINE: Jobs and Politics

 BODY:
Coming two months before Election Day, the employment report for August is a problem for President Obama. The economy added 96,000 jobs last month, a slow pace that lowered the monthly average this year to 139,000, versus 153,000 in 2011. Even the decline in the jobless rate, to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent in July, was a disappointment, because it indicated a shrinking labor force as people gave up looking for work. 
But properly understood, the report should not encourage voters to support Mitt Romney. That's because boosting tepid job growth requires stimulative fiscal policy -- including spending to rehire teachers and to rebuild schools, roads and other infrastructure, as well as loan modifications for underwater homeowners. Mr. Obama has proposed all of that, while Republicans have blocked such measures and the Republican agenda rejects them.
Republicans are even increasingly adamant that the Federal Reserve should do nothing to try to help the economy, with Representative Paul Ryan saying on Friday that monetary easing by the Fed would be a ''bailout of bad fiscal policy.'' Really? The Fed, if it acts, would be trying to compensate for the dearth of fiscal solutions, the result of Republican obstructionism. The Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, has been explicit in asserting correctly that the ailing housing market and contractionary fiscal policy are the biggest threats to the economy. He has indicated that Congressional action to address those issues would be preferable to more Fed easing. Yet the Republican response is to tell the Fed to back off.
Worse, the Republican agenda misdiagnoses the cause of slow job growth, blaming taxes and regulation, while championing more tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of the banks and other businesses as a cure. Those policies, however, are precisely the ones that were in place as the bubble economy of the Bush years inflated, and then crashed, with disastrous consequences. They are the problem, yet they are all that Mr. Romney and his party have to offer.
In the meantime, the pain of unemployed and underemployed Americans is all too real. Good jobs, like teaching, are being lost, while others, like manufacturing, are getting harder to come by as the global economy slows. In their place are jobs in bars and restaurants and other low-wage activities. Even the college educated are in trouble. In the past year, unemployment among college graduates under age 25 has averaged 8.1 percent, no better than the general population. The situation is worse for high school graduates under age 25, whose jobless rates in the past year have averaged nearly 21 percent.
Tax cuts and deregulation will not help them. Federal spending to create jobs, loan modifications to ease debt burdens and further Fed action would.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
7:30 P.M. (HBO) EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE (2011) Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), an 11-year-old New Yorker whose father (Tom Hanks) died in the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, traverses the five boroughs in search of the owner of a key in an envelope scrawled with a single word -- ''Black'' -- that he believes will unlock the answer to what happened on ''the worst day.'' Sandra Bullock, above with Mr. Horn, plays Oskar's grieving mother, who seems oblivious to his travels; Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are the first of the 472 Blacks whose names Oskar has culled from city phone books; and Max von Sydow is the mysterious man who becomes Oskar's sidekick. ''The performances, including from the reliably appealing Mr. Hanks and Ms. Bullock, are smoothed of any roughness, which can be chalked up to the fact that most of the story is seen through Oskar's eyes,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''Mr. Horn, who was 13 when the movie was made, is an attractively real-looking boy, with an impish smile and a natural-feeling directness, and he holds his own just fine, even against a scene-stealer like Mr. von Sydow.'' But, she added: ''It's an impossible role in an impossible movie that has no reason for being other than as another pop-culture palliative for a trauma it can't bear to face. 
In truth, 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close' isn't about Sept. 11. It's about the impulse to drain that day of its specificity and turn it into yet another wellspring of generic emotions: sadness, loneliness, happiness.''
10:30 A.M. (13) RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY This newsmagazine kicks off its 16th season with a report by Kim Lawton from the Democratic National Convention about the issues liberal religious leaders face, and how President Obama's stance on gay marriage has affected his support among some religious groups. Also, Bob Faw interviews Ron Hansen, an author and Roman Catholic deacon.
NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND Nicole Maestas, an economist, concludes a discussion of her Senate testimony on encouraging work at older ages.
8 P.M. (Lifetime) A KILLER AMONG US (2012) A father of three (Tom Cavanagh) tries to cope with the loss of his beloved wife while helping his teenage daughter, Alex (Tess Atkins), get to the bottom of the mystery of who killed her mother. But the answer may lie a little too close to home for comfort.
9 P.M. (Hallmark) PUPPY LOVE (2012) Megan (Candace Cameron Bure), a single mother overcome by guilt about moving to a new town, allows Caitlin (Katie Hawkins), her 10-year-old, to adopt a dog. She immediately regrets her decision when Caitlin chooses Jake, the biggest and most unruly in the shelter. But as soon as he begins to destroy their home, Ben (Victor Webster), a professional baseball player, knocks on their door and claims that Jake is his. The solution: joint custody, and maybe romance.
9 P.M. (WE) MY FAIR WEDDING WITH DAVID TUTERA: UNVEILED A sixth season begins as Mr. Tutera tries to reason with a burlesque performer who insists on wearing a red latex dress with tassels and feather fans on her big day. Her man of honor has ideas of his own, including stripping at the reception.
9 P.M. (Starz) THE VOW (2012) Paige and Leo, a happily married couple played by Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum, both above, find their bliss shattered when she is thrown through a windshield in a car accident and emerges from a coma with the personality of a Stepford wife and no memory of their four years together. Against all odds, Leo sets out to win Paige's heart back in this weepy, directed by Michael Sucsy and inspired by real events. But first he'll have to get past her disapproving parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) and old flame (Scott Speedman). ''This could have been a rich, strange melodrama; a psychological thriller; a horror movie; a dark comedy; or any combination of these, and scholarly viewers can relieve the tedium by imagining it remade by more daring filmmakers. Just think of what Alfred Hitchcock or Pedro Almodóvar or Luis Buñuel or John Waters could have done with this material,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''Never mind. 'The Vow' is designed for comfort, not shock. But even by the standards of commercial melodrama, it's a pretty weak brew.'' KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Reviews of the President's Big Night

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Character, Not Audacity'' (column, Sept. 7):
David Brooks suggests that the speakers at the Democratic National Convention offered no ''audacious'' new and big ideas. 
Are immigration reform, the Dream Act, investment in infrastructure, investment in public education standards and teachers, investment in research, a balanced plan to reduce the deficit, including fair taxes for the wealthy, ending our war in Afghanistan, and making sure that our veterans are served when they come home small ideas?
No, they are the big unfinished business of our nation.
As to the dysfunctional political climate in Washington that Mr. Brooks claims was not addressed, President Obama and other speakers made it clear -- ''we the people'' have a choice to make in November. It's up to us to change that dysfunctional political climate, and we know what we need to do to make that change: elect representatives who believe that our government can and must address the people's big items of unfinished business.
STEVE BELL Kew Gardens, Queens, Sept. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks complains that President Obama's speech was not audacious enough. But making promises to enact laws and create programs depends on bipartisan cooperation. The Republicans have vowed to unseat the president, and if he wins, they may well block any ideas he proposes just to prove that he doesn't fulfill his promises, as they have in the past.
Since passing any of his programs would have enhanced his standing before this election, they were determined to subvert them. There is no reason to expect the Republicans to change their ways to allow another Democrat to win in 2016.
ROBERT ZAVOD Haddam, Conn., Sept. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
As I keep reading David Brooks's columns expressing disappointment with President Obama for not articulating the kind of big economic plan that Mr. Brooks thinks he should, I am reminded of a T-shirt frequently worn by students at the University of Chicago, Mr. Brooks's alma mater:
Front: It Works in Practice
Back: But Does It Work in Theory?
The incremental improvements that the president has achieved have moved us in the right direction, and I believe that they will continue to move us in the right direction. There are too many uncertainties to announce a grand plan that can be scuttled by external events, like what happens in the euro zone.
MELISSA TREVVETT Brookline, Mass., Sept. 7, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks's summation that ''the next president has to do three big things, which are in tension with one another: increase growth, reduce debt and increase social equity'' would have been as apt in 1932 as it is in 2012.
Those of us out here in the ''reality-based community'' who insist on learning from our history recognize that the way to achieve these things is through Keynesian deficit spending in the crisis years and repaying that debt in the good times.
Since the power to tax and the power to spend don't belong to our executive, the way to get there -- now, as then -- is to elect not only a Democratic president, but a Democratic Congress as well.

HEADLINE: Six Days After 9/11, Another Date Worth Honoring

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgf1@columbia.edu

 BODY:
In the coming days, the calendar will bring the anniversaries of two signal events. One, of course, is Sept. 11, a Tuesday this year, as it was in 2001, when Al Qaeda terrorists in four hijacked planes killed more than 3,000 Americans. With public memorial services and private tears, those deaths will be recalled and mourned.
The other anniversary is of the visit President George W. Bush made to a Washington mosque just six days after the attack, where he spoke eloquently against the harassment of Arabs and Muslims living in the United States and about the need to respect Islam. 
This act of leadership and statesmanship, however, has all but vanished from the national collective memory. It deserves, instead, to be noted and heeded and esteemed.
In its immediate moment, Mr. Bush's appearance at the Islamic Center of Washington may have helped to quell vigilante assaults on American Muslims and on those, like Sikhs, who were mistaken for them. At the policy level, the president's words also served notice that unlike Franklin D. Roosevelt after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he would not intern or in any way collectively punish innocent American citizens who happened to share a religion or ethnicity with foreign foes.
After hailing American Muslims as ''friends'' and ''taxpaying citizens'' in his comments at the mosque, Mr. Bush went on to say: ''These acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. And it's important for my fellow Americans to understand that.'' He quoted from the Koran: ''In the long run, evil in the extreme will be the end of those who do evil.'' Then he continued in his own words: ''The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war.''
Eleven years after the fact, Mr. Bush has been treated like a prophet without honor in his own land. He was barely mentioned at the Republican convention last week, and former presidential candidates like Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann have regularly inveighed against Muslims. While former President Bill Clinton praised Mr. Bush at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C., for his work on AIDS in Africa and disaster relief, most allusions to Mr. Bush there were for the war in Iraq and the economic collapse that struck in his final months in office.
Yet there was always another side to Mr. Bush, present in his self-definition as a ''compassionate conservative,'' in his deep faith and respect for all religions. He was probably the most colorblind Republican president since Lincoln, appointing Hispanic and black Americans to meaningful cabinet positions -- national security adviser, secretary of state, secretary of education, attorney general.
During Mr. Bush's campaign for the Republican nomination in 2000, he spoke at a mosque, making him the first candidate in either party to do so. During a debate against his Democratic opponent, Al Gore, he denounced the profiling of Arab-American and Muslim-American airline passengers. Mr. Bush's appointment schedule on Sept. 11, 2001, until tragedy intervened, included a 3 p.m. meeting with a delegation of American Muslim leaders.
''His entire concept of human liberty cannot be understood apart from his elemental view of the spiritual nature of all men and women,'' said Tim Goeglein, a White House staff member involved in planning the mosque visit and author of ''The Man in the Middle,'' about the role of religion in the Bush administration. ''This is one of the very important narratives of the Bush presidency.''
As Mr. Bush recounted in his own book ''Decision Points,'' in the days after Sept. 11, he was disturbed by reports of bias crimes against American Muslims. And he had heard firsthand accounts of the Japanese-American internment from one of its victims -- Norman Y. Mineta, a Democrat who served as Mr. Bush's transportation secretary.
Out of that combination of historical perspective and visceral decency, Mr. Bush sent instructions to the White House's Office of Public Liaison to arrange for him to visit a mosque. For the men and women in that office, the stakes were instantly clear.
''In the aftermath of 9/11, when every move the president made was being watched extremely closely, it was important to demonstrate that American Muslims were not the same people who attacked the U.S.,'' said Matt Smith, the liaison office's associate director at the time. ''When you show that these people are Americans, it goes a long way.''
One of several Muslim members of the White House staff was Suhail Khan, who worked in the liaison office and took a leading role in deciding which mosque the president should visit. The Islamic Center of Washington struck him as nearly ideal. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had laid its cornerstone in 1957, and its congregation included diplomats, business executives and other professionals. Unlike several other Washington mosques, it had been built for Muslim worship, not converted from a previous use. So television and still cameras would be able to capture the image of an American president in a visibly, indelibly Islamic setting.
Within about 24 hours, the mosque was checked by the Secret Service for security, a briefing memo was prepared for the president and an advance team was dispatched to the Islamic center. Then, on the afternoon of Monday, Sept. 17, Mr. Bush and all the attendant news media went to the mosque.
Mr. Bush removed his shoes, in accordance with Islamic practice, before entering the mosque's prayer room. He met for about 45 minutes with leaders of several American Muslim organizations, including Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Afterward, standing before a tile wall of characteristically Islamic patterns and near a woman wearing a hijab, Mr. Bush, speaking in a grave and subdued tone, issued his appeal for tolerance and unity.
''I think in those days, so many people here and around the world watched that clip,'' Mr. Awad said recently. ''And it should be played over and over to remind people that what made America great is respect for religious freedom and zero tolerance for hate crimes against innocent people.''

HEADLINE: Influence Of Funds Ended Overhaul

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Four years after the fall of Lehman Brothers, and with a presidential campaign in full swing, everyone can surely agree on one thing: we shouldn't risk another financial crisis.
But after four years of studies, hearings and round tables, the Securities and Exchange Commission late last month abandoned efforts to impose new regulations on money market funds intended to prevent another panic like the one that occurred in 2008 and eliminate the need for a taxpayer bailout of the multitrillion-dollar funds.
The S.E.C.'s proposed changes had the backing of the White House, Treasury officials, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, a council of academic experts, The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page, the former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, the former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- just about every disinterested party who weighed in on the issue.
So it's no wonder many S.E.C. staff members were shocked when three of the five S.E.C. commissioners -- two Republicans and one Democrat -- indicated they wouldn't support the proposals. It was a rare case of a Democratic commissioner breaking ranks with the agency's chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, an Obama appointee who is a political independent. 
''I'm not the crusading type,'' a frustrated Ms. Schapiro told me. ''This isn't based on conjecture. We know what can go wrong. We saw what happened with the Reserve Fund in 2008. There was a broad run on money market funds; credit markets froze. People didn't have access to their money, which was extraordinary. We're trying to prevent that. And if you're opposed to government bailouts, you have to support these reforms.''
So what accounts for the collapse?
Though Republicans in Congress have generally sided with the mutual fund industry, and the reforms emerged from a Democratic administration, several people I spoke to said it was a mistake to view the outcome through the prism of partisan politics. ''It's not Republicans versus Democrats,'' a person involved in formulating the proposals told me. ''It's the mutual fund industry and its allies versus the American taxpayer.''
For many in the mutual fund industry, 2008 seems both a distant memory and the equivalent of a 100-year flood, something unlikely to be repeated. But just four years ago, on Sept. 16, 2008, shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the Reserve Fund, the nation's oldest money market fund, ''broke the buck'' and set off a run on the global money fund industry.
Money market funds -- convenient, higher-yielding and supposedly ultrasafe alternatives to deposits at banks -- are a mainstay of the mutual fund industry, offered by all the major fund families. They typically invest in short-term, low-risk assets (like United States Treasuries and highly rated commercial paper), and with the blessing of regulators, each day they report a stable net asset value of $1 a share. That's convenient for tax purposes (there are never any reportable gains or losses), and it promotes the idea that these funds are risk-free because the reported value never fluctuates.
In reality, this has always been an illusion, or what Ms. Schapiro calls a ''fiction.'' Even short-term assets may fluctuate as interest rates change, even if the moves are very small. And they can also fluctuate because of credit risks. That's what happened to the Reserve Fund: it owned $785 million in Lehman Brothers' commercial paper. When the value of Lehman Brothers debt collapsed, there was no way the Reserve Fund could claim that its shares were worth $1, even using generous rounding and averaging tactics to mask shifts in value. When the Reserve Fund admitted its shares weren't worth $1, investors panicked and began a run on the fund. The Reserve Fund froze its assets and no one could get their money out, even though the actual net asset value was only a few cents less than $1.
The run quickly spread to other money market funds. Funds were frantically trying to unload commercial paper and other assets to raise cash. Major corporations that rely on commercial paper to cover day-to-day operations found themselves unable to issue new securities as the market teetered on collapse. Secretary Paulson fielded phone calls from chief executives alarmed that they might be unable to meet their payrolls. The run on the Reserve Fund and other money market funds took the financial crisis straight from Wall Street to Main Street.
I remember that week vividly because I relied on a money market fund for cash. When I needed some, I went to an A.T.M. and tapped in my access code. I didn't even have a conventional bank account and prided myself on my modern approach -- until I woke up the morning after the Reserve announcement to face the prospect that I might not have access to any of my money. In the many years I'd been relying on my money market account, such a calamity had never crossed my mind. Those old-fashioned government-insured bank accounts suddenly looked appealing.
Like many others, I was saved by Treasury and Federal Reserve officials who concluded that money fund assets would be backed in their entirety by the full faith and credit of the United States. The move stopped the run in its tracks. The commercial paper market came back to life, borrowing costs eased, and A.T.M.'s kept dispensing money to people like me. Though largely unsung at the time, it was an important step that staved off a global financial collapse.
It also made American taxpayers liable for over $3 trillion, the total assets held by money market funds at the time. It dwarfed the size of the subsequent TARP bailout, which was $750 billion. And even though policy makers across the political spectrum vowed that such a thing could never happen again, the failure of the S.E.C.'s draft proposals last month means that American taxpayers could again be liable for trillions of dollars in assets.
To prevent this, the S.E.C. proposed two major reforms. The first was to report money market fund values the way every other fund does, which is the actual net asset value, or N.A.V., not something rounded to $1. The idea is that investors would become accustomed to and comfortable with slight changes in values. The net asset values of many short-term bond funds fluctuate modestly, and there aren't any panics or runs just because their value declines a penny or two.
The second was to require fund sponsors, if they wanted to maintain the stable $1 value, to start holding cash reserves.
The mutual fund industry rallied against the proposals and lobbied fiercely to defeat them. The industry's self-interest is obvious: the proposals impose costs and additional regulations. More fundamentally, why wouldn't the industry and money market fund customers love the status quo? They get all the benefits of an implied government guarantee while taxpayers assume all the risk. Several people compared the situation to the way the mortgage industry fiercely supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the financial crisis made the government responsible for them.
But is it only naked self-interest that explains the industry's opposition? I spoke to John S. Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard, which is the largest mutual fund company and, as a nonprofit company, can usually be relied upon to act in the best interests of its customers. Vanguard has strongly opposed the S.E.C.'s reform efforts.
''We believe the proposals, if implemented, would end money market funds,'' Mr. Woerth told me. ''Our clients want a stable N.A.V. They write checks, pay their bill from these accounts. Would every one of these now be a taxable transaction based on gains and losses? That's untenable.'' As for the capital requirement, ''It would be onerous and raise costs, which would have to be passed onto our clients.'' He noted that Vanguard's Prime money market fund this week was yielding just 0.04 percent and additional costs would bring it close to zero. He noted that many fund companies were already waiving expenses to keep the funds' yields above zero, and said that additional costs were not sustainable.
Vanguard has also argued that the 2008 crisis set off by the Reserve Fund was a liquidity crisis, and that reforms already adopted in 2010 address that issue.
The S.E.C. counters that its job isn't to ensure the survival of money market funds, but to protect Americans from another Reserve-type crisis, which remains possible unless there are further changes. Even John C. Bogle, Vanguard's 83-year-old founder and former chairman, broke ranks with the company and offered support for the S.E.C.'s proposed reforms. In a recent interview, he told The Associated Press that the stable $1 value is an ''illusion'' and that money market funds pose ''one of the major risks in the mutual fund industry.''
Mr. Woerth responded: ''John Bogle speaks his mind on any issue and always has. He's an iconoclast and a rabble-rouser.''
Ms. Schapiro told me she won't raise the issue again with the current commission. So the debate now shifts to the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Financial Stability Oversight Council for further study. But any action could be years away. And given the recent fate of the S.E.C.'s four-year effort and the fund industry's clout in Washington, it may never happen until the next crisis is upon us.

HEADLINE: 'Rebecca' Delayed, Again, After Major Investor Dies

BYLINE: PATRICK HEALY


HIGHLIGHT: The producers of one of the most expensive, and troubled, musicals of the fall season are in talks with the investor's estate to secure the promised money. 

 BODY:
3:30 p.m. | Updated 
One of the most expensive - and troubled - musicals of the Broadway fall season, "Rebecca," is once again in limbo, with producers announcing on Saturday that a major investor in the show has died and they are in protracted talks with the estate to secure the promised money. The investor was responsible for an investment pool of $4.5 million for the musical, more than one third of its $12 million capitalization costs for Broadway, according to the producers, who declined to divulge the investor's name.
The investor, who lived in Europe, had been expected to provide $2 million for the show, and he had also secured pledges totaling $2.5 million from three other people. That money is still being sought as well. One of the "Rebecca" producers, Ben Sprecher, left for Britain on Sunday to continue the estate negotiations.
As a result, rehearsals for "Rebecca" - which had been scheduled to start on Monday - will be delayed two weeks until Sept. 24. It is the second postponement to rattle the producers, cast and crew of "Rebecca," based on the Daphne du Maurier novel; last winter the producers announced that the show, which had been scheduled to open on Broadway in April, would be delayed until this fall because they had not been able to raise the $12 million budget in time, citing the bad economy. That delay cost the musical its leading actor and actress, who were set to play the main characters in "Rebecca," a mysterious Englishman and his new, second bride who is haunted by the memories of the first wife. (Thoseroles have since been re-cast.)
The latest postponement will push back the load-in of the show's elaborate set (which is already built) to its Broadway theater, the Broadhurst, by two weeks as well, and performance dates are sure to change; the producers said they would announce new dates for the start of preview performances and an opening night soon. "Rebecca" had been scheduled to begin previews on Oct. 30 and open on Nov. 18.
But that presumes that the show will go on, an outcome that is in doubt given the complications of securing a significant sum from an estate in just two weeks' time. If the musical's lead producers, Mr. Sprecher and Louise Forlenza, cannot nail down the money in that time, the cancellation or indefinite postponement of "Rebecca" is likely. 
The producers declined to be interviewed on Saturday, but they said in a statement: "Since the tragic and sudden death of a major investor in early August, we have been working with the representatives of the estate to complete the committed investment. We had been reassured that the commitment would be honored, and have tried day and night to finalize this matter, but as of yet have been unable to do so, which has left us no choice but to delay the start of rehearsals for 'Rebecca' by two weeks. We are fiercely committed to resolving this issue as soon as possible and getting the production back on track in two weeks."

Philip J. Smith, chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns the Broadhurst, said in a telephone interview on Saturday that Mr. Sprecher informed him a day earlier about the new delay and the latest in the negotiations with the investor's estate. "We want to be cooperative and let them work it out, but it's a very difficult, very unusual happening - I've been around here since 1950 and I've never seen a scenario quite like what's happened to 'Rebecca,'" Mr. Smith said. "Evidently the lawyers for the estate seem to be cooperating, so there's some hope, but estate business is very complicated and we just need to see what happens. But let's face it: there's a short window of time for this to be revolved."
The cast of "Rebecca" is led by Jill Paice ("The Woman in White") as a new wife, simply known as I, and Ryan Silverman (who has played Raoul in "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway) as her husband, Maxim de Winter. The show has music by Sylvester Levay, an original book and lyrics by Michael Kunze, English book adaptation Christopher Hampton, English lyrics by Mr. Hampton and Mr. Kunze, and direction by Tony Award winner Michael Blakemore ("Kiss Me, Kate") and Francesca Zambello ("The Little Mermaid").

HEADLINE: Live Updates: Second Weekend

BYLINE: PAUL MYERBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Updates and analysis on the day's college football news from The New York Times. 

 BODY:
11:23 P.M. | Let's call it a night
Alright, so let's put this night to bed. What did we learn today? Not much.
L.S.U. is great, but we knew that. U.S.C. can score points, Nebraska can't play defense, Missouri can't play "old-man football," Arkansas isn't as good without Petrino and it's going to be a long year for Penn State - we knew this already. (Not so much with Missouri, to be fair.)
Next week is a prove-what-you've-got week. U.S.C. plays Stanford. Florida State plays Wake Forest, which beat U.N.C. earlier. Florida plays Tennessee in a big SEC East tilt. Michigan State hosts Notre Dame. It's a good week.
It's still been fun, right? Let's do it again next week.
11:16 P.M. | Northwestern, not Nebraska, is N.U.
Northwestern beat Nebraska last year. The Wildcats are a minute away from sewing up a win over Vanderbilt.
Nebraska is about to lose to U.C.L.A., barring a miracle.
Henceforth, until the two meet again later this season, Northwestern is N.U., Nebraska is not. Deal?
11:09 P.M. | Arkansas loses to Louisiana-Monroe
I can say five things with absolute certainty:
Arkansas is not beating Alabama.
Arkansas is not beating L.S.U.
Arkansas is not winning the SEC.
Arkansas is not earning an at-large B.C.S. bid.
John L. Smith is not returning as Arkansas' head coach.
Smith, the former Michigan State head coach and Arkansas assistant, was hired by the Razorbacks as an interim replacement for Bobby Petrino, who was dismissed in April. He was given an eight-month contract with the potential, should he lead Arkansas to a successful season, of being Petrino's permanent replacement.
Well, that's dream is over. Arkansas just lost to Louisiana-Monroe, 34-31, in overtime. That's not good for business. And next week's date with Alabama just became a whole lot less interesting.
10:48 P.M. | So, so close for Bowden and Akron
So, so close. It had been some time since Akron last beat an F.B.S. opponent during non-conference play - since Sept. 22, 2008, actually. Since then, the Zips' two non-conference wins have come against teams from the F.C.S.
It's been a bad few years. First, the university fired J.D. Brookhart, who went 30-42 from 2004-9. Not bad, all things considered. Then came Rob Ianello, who won two games in as many years before being fired after last season.
So what do you do when your back is against the wall? Hire a Bowden, of course. Not that one: Bobby's not coming back. Or that one: Tommy's going to come back someday, just not at Akron. That one: Terry.
Terry Bowden, who once led Auburn to one of the most unforeseeable undefeated seasons in college football history, who had spent the last three years at North Alabama, going 29-9. (With some help from current Louisiana-Lafayette head coach Mark Hudspeth, who left Bowden with a monster at U.N.A.)
Bowden's new team, Akron, was swamped by U.C.F. in the opener. And the Zips lost tonight, 41-38 to F.I.U., though it took overtime. So close. Maybe next week.
10:32 P.M. | L.S.U. takes care of business
L.S.U. is really, really good. Did we forget? Maybe. After all, Alabama moved ahead of L.S.U. in the polls after shoving around Michigan last Saturday.
The Tigers are just efficient. A week ago, the Tigers stayed vanilla in a win over North Texas. No flash, just smash.
Tonight, the Tigers took Washington apart at the seams. The secondary, down Morris Claiborne and Tyrann Mathieu, held Washington's Keith Price to 17 of 36 for 157 yards and an interception. So much for his dark-horse Heisman hopes.
And the offense features a more productive passing game, even if L.S.U. continues to keep Zach Mettenberger under wraps. He has yet to try many passes downfield, but Mettenberger, the former JUCO transfer - via Georgia, where he began his career - hit on 11 of 17 attempts for 185 yards against the Huskies.
Quietly, confidently, L.S.U. continues to take care of business. Through two weeks, the only team on its schedule that can give L.S.U. a game is Alabama - so yes, little has changed. That game, on Nov. 3, comes in Baton Rouge.
10:11 P.M. | Louisiana-Monroe giving Arkansas a game
I'm just going to leave this score here, because it's rare:
Arkansas 28, Louisiana-Monroe 21.
There's about 7:30 left in the game. The Warhawks have the ball.
The last Sun Belt team to beat an SEC opponent? Louisiana-Monroe, of course. The Warhawks beat Alabama, 21-14, back in 2007. That was Nick Saban's first season with the Crimson Tide.
9:58 P.M. | A rundown of the day's completed games
A rundown of today's noteworthy scores, with additional notes when warranted:
N.C. State 10, Connecticut 7
Ohio State 31, U.C.F. 16
Virginia 17, Penn State 16
Kansas State 52, Miami (Fla.) 13
Mississippi State 28, Auburn 10
Wake Forest 28, North Carolina 27
Michigan 31, Air Force 25
U.S.C. 42, Syracuse 29
Notre Dame 20, Purdue 17
Florida 20, Texas A&M 17
Iowa State 9, Iowa 6
Oregon State 10, Wisconsin 7
Ohio State suffered a brief scare from U.C.F., which tied the game at 10-10 and had a chance in the second half to draw within a touchdown, but the Buckeyes persevered. Again, my biggest worry is the fact that Braxton Miller is being fed such a load on offense.
Penn State left 13 points on the board in the kicking game. Sam Ficken missed four field goals and had an extra-point blocked. Just that one P.A.T. meant the difference between a loss and overtime.
Kansas State dominated. That's all. For Miami, it was the program's worst loss since a 51-13 defeat at Oklahoma in 2007. In my mind, it was the Hurricane's worst loss since a 66-13 whopping to Syracuse in 1998.
Both Michigan and U.S.C. had to sweat a bit. It's clear that the Trojans were disjointed due to the weather and weather delays. Air Force had a great chance at the upset before running out of gas late in the fourth quarter.
The strangest substitution of the day was also the day's wisest substitution, in a way. Brian Kelly put Tommy Rees into the game with two minutes left against Purdue, tied at 17-17, despite the fact that Rees did not play in the Irish's opening win against Navy. (There's also the fact that Rees had seemingly tumbled down to third on the depth chart, behind Everett Golson and Andrew Hendrix.)
Nevertheless, Rees led the Notre Dame offense down the field for the game-winning field goal with seconds left. Quarterback competition? Don't even think about it. Kelly put those ideas to rest very quickly.
A&M's SEC debut started poorly. Wisconsin's clearly not the same team without Russell Wilson, several lost starters on defense and several new assistant coaches. Iowa State won its second straight against rival Iowa.
9:21 P.M. | A new world for Missouri
It's a new world for Missouri. It's a world of "old-man football," as Missouri's Sheldon Richardson said earlier this week, drawing the ire of his coach, Gary Pinkel.
"Old-man football" wins championships, as many have remarked. But the SEC plays a different style than they do in the Big 12; Richardson merely needed to choose his words a little more carefully.
Here's one fact that might explain the difference between the Big 12 and the SEC: Missouri has played in only two conference games since 2006 where the two teams combined for less than 30 points. That would be against Iowa State in 2010 (a 14-0 win) and against Texas last fall (a 17-5 win).
With 1:55 left in the first half, Missouri and Georgia are tied at 3-3. It's a new world.
9:04 P.M. | ESPN reports Florida State game called early
It's over in Tallahassee, thankfully. According to ESPN, Florida State, Savannah State and the officiating crew have decided to call the game with 8:59 left in the third quarter.
This is partly as a result of the weather, which hasn't been good. After an earlier delay, the officials sent the teams back into the locker rooms roughly 15 minutes ago due to another lightning warning.
But let's be serious: this has as much to do with the fact that this game is a joke as any weather issues. They wouldn't institute a running clock or call the game if this was Florida State and Miami, for example.
In fact, there would be a huge revolt in Tallahassee if officials called a 59-0 game with nine minutes left in the third quarter. "Call the game! Well, I never. We were just starting to have fun!"
Savannah State is through the national-title-contender portion of its schedule. Up next are your F.C.S. foes, the teams that Savannah State might have a chance to, you know, beat. (Or at least have a chance to beat.)
8:46 P.M. | No defense at the Rose Bowl
Where has Nebraska's defense gone? Is it just lost? Can Bo Pelini find the answer?
Based on the first five quarters of this season, the Cornhuskers' offense is vastly improved. This was to be expected: Tim Beck is in his second year as Nebraska's coordinator, so some part of the growth stems from added experience.
 Taylor Martinez's massive improvement is another factor. His ability to throw the football in the pocket - under pressure, no less - has been the biggest development to come out of Lincoln. And with Rex Burkhead sidelined with a knee injury, Martinez has taken on a heavy load in the running game against U.C.L.A.
That he only carried the ball six times in the opener against Southern Mississippi might have led U.C.L.A. to focus more so on running back Ameer Abdullah, not Martinez. The junior made the Bruins pay, taking a zone-read play 92 yards for a touchdown on Nebraska's latest series.
But the Bruins are moving the ball against Nebraska - and the Cornhuskers are barely putting up a fight. While U.C.L.A.'s most recent drive sputtered inside the red zone, kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn hit a 36-yard field goal to trim Nebraska's advantage to 14-10.
Fairbairn had already missed one field goal tonight. Last week, he missed three field goals in U.C.L.A.'s win over Rice. (Rice beat Charlie Weis and Kansas earlier, by the way.)
8:35 P.M. | Tallying the push-ups
How many push-ups has Puddles done through the first 30 minutes of Oregon's game against Fresno State? Let's see.
7-3 (7 push-ups, 7 total)
14-3 (14, 21)
21-3 (21, 42)
28-3 (28, 70)
35-3 (35, 105)
So: 105 push-ups. Poor guy.
8:25 P.M. | F.S.U. takes on a running clock
Oh, thanks goodness. Due to "weather concerns," the game between Florida State and Savannah State will use a running clock. Thankfully, the final 34 minutes will fly by.
What's a running clock? If you're unfamiliar with the idea, you should see more high school football. A running clock is a clock that, well, runs - instead of stopping on first downs, or when a player goes out of bounds, the clock will run and run and run until everyone goes home.
That's good.
8:05 P.M. | F.C.S. upset alert
I put an F.B.S. team on "F.C.S. upset alert" earlier today, though I didn't put it out there publicly, which was a mistake.
The F.B.S. team: Colorado State. The F.C.S. team: North Dakota State.
How good is North Dakota State? The Bison are the defending F.C.S. national champs. Last September, they absolutely manhandled Minnesota in a 37-24 win. This team is good enough to weather a mid-week storm: Eight N.D.S.U. players have been charged with voter fraud - faking petition signatures for a ballot initiative - though based on what I heard earlier this week, none will be suspended for tonight's game. 
How good is Colorado State? I realize that the Rams opened the Jim McElwain era with a great win over Colorado, but the jury remains out on McElwain's ability to field a consistent winner in his first season. 
Of all the games between F.B.S. and F.C.S. teams, this has the highest probability of an F.C.S. win. You know what? I don't think it would be an upset at all. Former Nebraska defensive coordinator Craig Bohl has done an outstanding job at North Dakota State.
Five minutes into the second quarter, the Bison hold a 16-7 lead. Again, this won't really be an upset - except for the fact that one team plays in the F.B.S. and the other in the F.C.S.
7:46 P.M. | Washington's offensive line struggling
In its first three drives, Washington gained six yards. L.S.U. back Alfred Blue scampered for a 21-yard touchdown run, and he went relatively untouched. And just now, Beckham made up for his early troubles with a nifty, sideline catch, then dropped another one. L.S.U. quarterback Zach Mettenberger has had plenty of time to throw, while Price has seemed rushed.
Also, to start the game, Erik Kohler slid from right guard to right tackle, replacing the injured Ben Riva, where Kohler started all of last season. Then after Barkevious Mingo charged at and through Kohler on one play, Kohler went down and went off with an apparent leg injury. He was replaced by Mike Christie, who's never started a game before.
At right guard, replacing Kohler, was James Atoe, another inexperienced lineman. Micah Hatchie, who's making his second career start, just allowed Lavar Edwards to sack Price untouched, ending Washington's fourth drive.
7:41 P.M. | Night games we're following
Night games to follow:
Washington at L.S.U.
Fresno State at Oregon
Nebraska at U.C.L.A.
Georgia at Missouri
Tim Rohan is covering the first game for The Times. He told me a little while ago that if five people leave a comment below he'll send in updates. He didn't even specify that the comments be about college football - or football, or even sports. So all you need to do is leave your name and a brief salutation. He told me this, I swear.
Also, before fixing the error, I had "Florida State" at Oregon, not Fresno State. Man, I wish. The Seminoles and Ducks? Sign me up.
I would like nothing more than to give you Nebraska-U.C.L.A. updates, but Fox is not making that an option. Instead of Cornhuskers-Bruins, Fox is showing Mets-Braves. I'm not giving baseball updates.
Georgia at Missouri - the Tigers' SEC debut. By the way, there were two Bulldogs-Tigers games in the SEC today: Auburn at Mississippi State and Georgia at Missouri. SEC wins national titles for football, not nickname-imaginativeness.
7:30 P.M. | This is Nevada choking
This is Nevada choking:
Up by 31-20 with three minutes left, the Wolfpack allow B.J. Daniels, South Florida's much-maligned quarterback, to hurl two 50-plus-yard touchdowns over the game's final 180 seconds. Yes, B.J. Daniels.
The loss deals a fatal blow to Nevada's nascent B.C.S. hopes. As in 2010, Nevada will still fall short of the B.C.S. threshold even should it beat Boise State in November. Hey, but the Wolfpack are still the only team in the Mountain West that can possibly unseat the Broncos - so that's Nevada's newest goal.
It's a shame, however. The Wolfpack outplayed the Bulls. Cody Fajardo had 401 yards of total offense: 270 through the air, 131 on the ground. (Double-check my math, please.)
Nevada should not have lost this game. For U.S.F., the win takes some pressure off of Skip Holtz heading into mid-September.
7:18 P.M. | Dustin Hopkins misses a P.A.T.
A brief tidbit on Florida State, and not the last to come from this shellacking, still in progress:
Dustin Hopkins missed an extra-point, one that would have given F.S.U. a 49-0 lead with eight minutes to go in the first half. That snapped his streak of 145 consecutive made extra-points, leaving him 15 shy of the A.C.C. record. So your record is safe, former Georgia Tech kicker Alex Trlica.
Also, this game is ridiculous. F.S.U. doesn't really want to score. I'm serious. The Seminoles would love to play with a running clock the rest of the way. It's a joke. It'll get into the 70s, if not into the 80s.
7:05 P.M. | Don't give the Leaders to Wisconsin
Whether due to its own strengths or the fact that Ohio State was ineligible for postseason play, most handed Wisconsin the Big Ten Leaders division before the season even kicked off. It's a different story today, based on the day's developments.
Wisconsin will lose to Oregon State; the only question is whether the Badgers will score. With 4:30 left, the Beavers hold a 10-0 lead.
Meanwhile, Purdue is taking Notre Dame down to the wire. A touchdown pass from Caleb TerBush tied the game at 17-17 with two minutes left.
 So let's not go handing the Badgers a spot in the Big Ten title game just yet. And you can even throw Illinois into the mix, should the Illini beat Arizona State on the road later tonight. (Sun Devil Stadium has been a graveyard for Big Ten teams over the years.)
Now, an interesting development for Notre Dame: Brian Kelly took out Everett Golson, who's played very well, and put in last year's starter, Tommy Rees. Why? Perhaps because of Rees' familiarity with Kelly's two-minute offense. But I don't see it.
6:58 P.M. | Tom Spousta with the recap
Talk about adjustments. After being run ragged in the first half, the Gators held the Aggies scoreless in the second half to finish off a 20-17 victory the old-fashion SEC way. Florida ground it out on offense, too.
Great atmosphere. And Aggies played above expectations given this was their opener. And they learned they have a playmaking quarterback in Johnny Manziel.
So are the Gators a true top 25 team? We'll see how far they jump after a strong road win.
6:47 P.M. | Tim Rohan from Baton Rouge
Tyrann Mathieu's absence wasn't exactly noticed in No. 3 L.S.U.'s 41-14 win over North Texas last week. Coach Les Miles' offense was mostly vanilla and his defense looked dominant at times, but fine. Considering how inferior the Tigers' competition was, it's likely Miles preferred not show Alabama or Arkansas or any other S.E.C. foe schemes or formations meant for later this season.
Against Washington, L.S.U.'s opponent Saturday, Miles might inflict the same, ho-hum thrashing. Washington quarterback Keith Price threw for 222 yards and a touchdown in a less than impressive 21-12 win over San Diego State last week. Already adjusting without star running back Chris Polk, Price told media members this week he didn't trust his protection, was hurried in the pocket, and missed easy throws. Against San Diego State.
Then his right tackle, Ben Riva, broke his forearm, and now both of Washington's tackles - Micah Hatchie, who made his first career start last week, and Mike Cristie, who is expected to make his first career start tonight - will be overmatched against L.S.U.'s stud defensive ends, Sam Montgomery and Barkevious Mingo.
"It's rough, just not really knowing who's going to block for you," Price said earlier this week, though he added: "I think our guys prepare, especially our twos prepare like ones. It shouldn't be that big of a drop off."
But are Washington's twos better than L.S.U.'s potential All-Americans?
6:43 P.M. | 28-0 Florida State (after nine minutes)
I now know far more about Savannah State than I should. I know that they're the Tigers. I know that the Tigers have won two games in two years, both times against North Carolina Central. The head coach is Steve Davenport.
I also know that Savannah State has no business playing teams like Oklahoma State and Florida State. The Cowboys squeezed past with an 84-0 win last Saturday. It could have been worse.
Through nine minutes against the Seminoles, the Tigers are behind by 28-0. That's all. It's 28-0 after nine minutes. Four touchdowns in nine minutes. At this rate, F.S.U. will sneak past with a 186-0 win.
What's Savannah State getting for its trouble? The university is getting $860,000 from Oklahoma State and Florida State combined.
6:27 P.M. | A&M struggling in the second half (again) 
Please, don't tell me. I can't take it - I couldn't possibly bear it. New coach, new league, new offense, new defense, new everything yet Texas A&M remains utterly incompetent in the second half? Please, this can't be happening.
Last fall, A&M lost five games despite controlling the tempo after 30 minutes: Arkansas, Oklahoma State, Missouri, Kansas State and Texas. Oh, Texas.
At halftime today, A&M held a 17-10 lead over Florida. But something was amiss, right? The Aggies were in the driver's seat, dominating the line of scrimmage, tiring out Florida's defense and getting pressure on Jeff Driskel. Despite playing so well, A&M still led by only a touchdown.
New year, somewhat similar story. This game, should A&M lose, won't come close to matching last year's weekly disaster - though it won't feel good, being the program's SEC debut and all.
The Aggies have gained 29 yards in the second half (there's less than 10 minutes to go) after gaining 269 yards in the first half. The Gators have figured out a way to slow down Manziel: keep him in the pocket.
At his most dangerous, Manziel is throwing on the move. Pigeonholed into being a pocket passer, Manziel simply doesn't scare Will Muschamp and the Gators.
So how does A&M bounce back? By getting back to the running game, for one. Secondly, the offense must move quicker. In the first half, A&M was at its best when running a no-huddle attack. The Aggies need to rediscover that rhythm.
5:59 P.M. | More from Tom Spousta
Both teams settling down here in third quarter. Now it seems like an SEC slugfest instead of a Big 12 track meet. Sturgis kicked a 25-yard field goal to cap Gators first possession and pull within 17-13. U.F. has kept the Aggies' defense on field, like what A&M did to them in first half.
5:37 P.M. | Poor start for the Pac-12
This has not been a good day for the Pac-12. Having said that, there's every reason to think that the Pac-12 will be 5-0 heading into the night games. What?
U.S.C. has looked sloppy against Syracuse. It's 14-3 at the half - remember, there's the weather delay - but the Trojans continue to sputter offensively. I'm holding Matt Barkley and this offense to a higher standard.
Three teams are struggling against F.C.S. competition. Washington State leads Eastern Washington by 24-14 with 1:30 left in the third quarter. California leads Southern Utah, 20-17, with 3:15 left. Colorado leads Sacramento State, 28-24, with 1:50 left.
(Colorado's Jon Embree is still feeling the love despite a 3-11 start with the program, since the fan base and administration remember the mess he inherited from Dan Hawkins and company, but the good feelings might evaporate should the Buffaloes lose to Sacramento State - which lost to New Mexico State by 30 points last weekend.)
Oregon State's carrying the flag, leading Wisconsin by 3-0 at the half, but that game's very much in doubt, obviously. It hasn't been a solid afternoon.
It won't get better tonight. L.S.U. will beat Washington. U.C.L.A. will lose to Nebraska (I think; more on this game later). Arizona won't beat Oklahoma State. And so on and so forth.
5:24 P.M. | Halftime from Kyle Field
A&M leads by 17-10 at half (let's not forget Aggies were very slight favorites coming in).
Gators surely could have benefited from some A&M game film from the season-opener, but of course there wasn't any. There's no way they could have known how good Manziel was going to be - like 16 of 20 for 141 yards good, plus 41 yards rushing and a touchdown. Driskel was 6 of 6, and Florida obviously playing conservative on offense - when they had the ball. Aggies dominated with ball control, running 46 plays for 269 yards to Gators 26 plays for 101. Could argue that A&M should be ahead by more than a touchdown.
Gators defense needs to rein in Manziel and force a turnover or two. Aggies just need to keep what they're doing.
5:23 P.M. | Weather delay in East Rutherford, N.J.
Supposedly, there was a tornado in Queens earlier today. That's news to me. But the weather has finally hit home: the second-half kickoff between Syracuse and U.S.C. has been delayed by "approaching severe weather."
So you'll have to find your football elsewhere. Try ESPN, NBC, FX, etc.
5:17 P.M. | A Syracuse-U.S.C. update
What seemed primed to be an aerial spectacle between two of the nation's best gunslingers has been more of a hard-hitting, ground-and-pound contest at MetLife Stadium between No. 2 U.S.C. and Syracuse.
U.S.C. leads 14-3 at halftime, thanks to Matt Barkley's two touchdown passes.
The game was scoreless for the first 17:45, which was surprising considering that last week Barkley threw for 372 yards and 4 touchdowns and Ryan Nassib topped him for 470 yards and 4 touchdowns.
The storm swirling toward New Jersey is not close enough to affect the passing conditions yet. But clear skies have not helped receivers hold on to the football or prevented lineman from getting handsy with both quarterbacks. Barkley is 13 of 17 and Nassib is 9 of 17, with each suffering momentum-squelching sacks.
U.S.C. orchestrated its first scoring drive on four plays over 55 yards in 91 seconds in the second quarter. After three productive rushes, Barkley pump-faked and then connected with Margise Lee on a 13-yard touchdown pass.
Barkley missed Robert Woods on an audacious fourth-and-long attempt in the first quarter, but Barkley connected with him for his second touchdown of the game - a 29-yard pass on 3rd-9 - with 75 seconds left in the first half.
With only enough time left in the first half for one or two plays, Syracuse could not capitalize on a chance to ignite some momentum and change the course of the game. U.S.C. rushed five and Nassib lobbed a pass to Jeremiah Kobena in the end zone, but Brian Baucham leapt up and flailed his arms to knock it down. Syracuse settled for a field goal and U.S.C. ended the half ahead, 14-3.
Despite top-billed teams in a top-billed venue, the play has been lackluster. The good news is that an historic upset is up for grabs if Syracuse players can cut down on penalties and, well, catch the ball.
5:08 P.M. | Kyle Field inaccuracies 
Aggie fans surely will notice the change to the championship wall. Indeed, Texas A&M decided to spruce up its resume heading into its SEC opener (a move that has rankled many throughtout Texas and Big 12 country).
They posted two more national championships on the wall, claiming one in 1919 and another in 1927 (to go with what's recognized as an official title in 1939). The A.P. didn't start awarding titles until 1936, and before that various publications and associations named their own champions.
In 1919, according to RantSports.com, Harvard, Illinois, Notre Dame and A&M were all named champs, but Harvard and Illinois got more No. 1 votes from more outlets.
The Aggies also decided to claim a pair of division titles as two Big 12 titles - 1997, when they won the league's South Division, but lost the Big 12 title game to Nebraska 54-15; and 2010, when there was a three-way tie in the South, and A&M was passed over by Oklahoma for the title game.
5:05 P.M. | Quarterbacks of the day (so far)
Your quarterbacks of the day as we reach the midway point of the 3:30 p.m. games:
Braxton Miller, Ohio State. Miller completed 18 of 24 attempts for 155 yards to go with 141 yards on 27 carries in leading the Buckeyes to a 31-16 win over U.C.F. My worry? Miller is not yet prepared physically for being a 25-carry weapon for Ohio State.
Perry Hills, Maryland. Hills was pegged for a backup season - if not a redshirt season - until Maryland lost would-be starter C.J. Brown to injury. After a dreadful debut, Hills avoided errors, throwing for 190 yards and 2 scores, in leading the Terrapins to a 37-26 win over Temple.
Tyler Russell, Mississippi State. I wrote over the summer about Mississippi State's potential on offense with Russell, a stronger passer, replacing Chris Relf. Against Auburn, Russell completed 20 of 29 attempts for 224 yards and 3 touchdowns. He even added a yard on the ground - one yard, but don't expect much more from the junior.
Collin Klein, Kansas State. Klein broke Miami's will. Don't get upset, Hurricanes: he does this to everyone.
Johnny Manziel, Texas A&M. It's only halftime, but Manziel, a redshirt freshman, is lighting up the Gators. I knew Manziel could run (he's one of the quickest quarterbacks in college football), but you have to be impressed by his ability to move the ball through the air. Through 30 minutes, he's completed 16 of 20 attempts for 141 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Manziel is a legendary figure on the Texas high school ranks, by the way.
4:53 P.M. | Woeful play from Florida
Gators guessing on defense. Guessing wrong too. Aggies just went 79 yards in 10 plays. Delays, misdirections, screens, even a reverse pass. Then Christine Michael takes a direct snap after a shift in which Manziel moved to the slot, to finish the drive. Sumlin's got Muschamp's number so far.
A&M is ahead by 17-7 late in second quarter. Defense gaining confidence too. After not sacking Florida's Jeff Driskel in first quarter, Aggies got to him five times so far in second.
4:42 P.M. | David Tyree talks Syracuse, Big East
The Syracuse Orange honored two alumni and former New York Giants at today's game between U.S.C. and Syracuse. Joe Morris and David Tyree participated in the pre-game coin toss at MetLife Stadium for the inaugural "New York's College Classic."
Morris, who played for Syracuse from 1978-1981, holds school records for rushing yards in a game (252), a season (1,372) and a career (4,299). The New York Giants selected Morris in the second round of the 1982 draft. He played seven years with New York, was part of the Super Bowl XXI championship team and played in two Pro Bowls.
Tyree was a wide receiver and special teams standout for the Orange from 1999-02, but his lasting legacy was built in the Giants' Super Bowl XLII victory, making "the catch" by holding the ball against his helmet as he fell to the ground to set up his team's game-winning scoring drive.
The Montclair, N.J., native was happy to skip the four-hour drive upstate and have his alma mater delivered to him on one of the N.F.L.'s biggest stages.
"For Syracuse to have a platform like this again, it makes me feel like when I was recruited," Tyree said. "My first year, when Donovan McNabb was a senior, we played Michigan, we played Tennessee, so this is where we belong."
Tyree said that Syracuse's move to the A.C.C. next year will finally separate the program from a deteriorating Big East that is "falling apart from what it once was, the integrity, the competition and the level of play."
"But for basketball, it's a little sore spot for me," Tyree added. "That Georgetown rivalry, that being lost, that hurts a little bit. But now we get to start new rivalries with Duke."
Tyree is still adjusting to "real life," as he called it, after finishing a brief final stint with the Ravens in 2009. "Just been grinding away and getting acclimated to the real thing," he said. "Just growing up."
Now he is developing an employee service group called Heroes.
Despite the ups and downs of trying build a life after football, Tyree said his split-second Super Bowl catch still resonates.
"I think about what it means for people and what it means for fans in the New York area," he said. "I had a piece of N.F.L. or Super Bowl history."
4:30 P.M. | Nevada's taking care of business
There are several non-B.C.S. conference programs with at-large B.C.S. bowl hopes: Louisiana Tech, Boise State, Ohio and Nevada, for example.
Louisiana Tech needs to survive a non-conference slate that includes Illinois, Virginia, Texas A&M and Houston, though today's date with the Cougars looks far less intimidating than it did in August. (Houston lost to Texas State, 30-13, last Saturday.)
Boise State's dreams remain intact despite last week's loss to Michigan State. Remember, the highest-ranked B.C.S. conference team inside the top 16 of the final B.C.S. standings earns an at-large bid.
You remember Ohio: The Bobcats took care of Penn State last weekend; next up is New Mexico State, followed by the easiest schedule in the country.
And what of Nevada? It's time to take the Wolfpack seriously. As was the case two years ago, Nevada has a date with Boise State looming. But after shellacking California last week, the Wolfpack need to focus on South Florida before turning towards Mountain West play.
Nevada's taking care of business - led by Cody Fajardo. Fajardo, Nevada's starting quarterback, is 11 of 14 for 133 yards and a score through the air; he's added 94 yards on 6 carries. Nevada 21, U.S.F. 6.
4:27 P.M. | Tom Spousta with another update
Just about every pregame breakdown was about how Aggies will need to adjust to physical and speedy SEC defenses. Maybe it should have been about how Gators would adapt to Big 12 spread offenses. The Aggies' tempo is obviously much faster than Gators and Muschamp expected.
A&M scores again, takes 10-7 after Manziel's 11-yard run completes 81-yard, 13-play drive.
It's early in second quarter, and the Gators are forced to punt after a pair of sacks by Aggies.
4:17 P.M. | A third update on Devon Walker
Again, an update on Tulane's Devon Walker that confirms earlier reports:
From Tulane's athletic department's official Twitter account: "Safety Devon Walker is stable in St. Francis hospital per team doctor."
The account also quotes Curtis Johnson, who said after the game that the "mood in the locker room was somber. Definitely one of the most difficult times."
4:11 P.M. | Some midday Heisman chatter
Should we talk Heisman? Is this on? My top 10 contenders heading into this weekend, with today's (or this week's) opponent in parentheses:
Matt Barkley, U.S.C. (vs. Syracuse)
De'Anthony Thomas (vs. Fresno State)
Montee Ball, Wisconsin (at Oregon State)
Le'Veon Bell, Michigan State (at Central Michigan)
Geno Smith, West Virginia (bye)
E.J. Manuel, Florida State (vs. Savannah State)
Marcus Lattimore, South Carolina (vs. East Carolina)
Taylor Martinez, Nebraska (at U.C.L.A.)
Aaron Murray, Georgia (at Missouri)
Collin Klein, Kansas State (vs. Miami)
Of this group, Martinez and Murray are two players with a great chance of moving up the list. Martinez needs a big game against the Bruins to follow up his start against Southern Mississippi, when he was superb. All eyes will be on tonight's game between Georgia and Missouri - by extension, all eyes will be on Murray.
4:02 P.M. | 3:30 p.m. games to watch
Games we'll be tracking among the 3:30 p.m. starts:
Syracuse vs. U.S.C. (Hunter Atkins on site)
Florida at Texas A&M (likewise with Tom Spousta)
Purdue at Notre Dame
South Florida at Nevada
3:58 P.M. | A&M gets on the board
Sumlin apparently thinks he's still got Case Keenum at quarterback. A&M comes out firing behind Manziel, go 66 yards in 15 plays, and kick a 27-yard field goal for 3-0 lead on its first possession in the SEC. Might have been 7-0, but Manziel was 3 yards over the line of scrimmage when he threw a 7-yard touchdown pass.
Gators looked a bit stunned. Did well to hold Aggies to a field goal.
3:47 P.M. | Another update from Tom Spousta:
SEC Commissioner Mike Slive just announced it as "SEC Day," including his trip to Missouri in his festive pregame comments. Slive will toss a commerative here, then leave in the middle of second quarter for Columbia, Mo., and do the coin toss for Mizzou vs. Georgia.
Slive said he soaked in some of A&M's traditions, including Yell Practice on Friday night, when about 40,000 Aggies show up at Kyle Field and, well, practice yelling.
"It's a historic day," Slive said. "The preliminaries are over, and now we're going to play football and watch how they can compete."
3:46 P.M. | An update from Tom Spousta at Kyle FIeld
Hey from Kyle Field, and what's being hailed as a historic day - by the SEC and Texas A&M, anyway. Quite the buzz here, and folks are finally ready for actual blocking and tackling.
That, and to see how redshirt freshman Johnny Manziel, who's never taken a college snap, runs new coach Kevin Sumlin's Air Raid offense imported from Houston. We'll see how much it's toned down from what he and Case Keenum ran at Houston.
Gorgeous day. A few clouds, temperatures in the 80s, fans waving their white towels and the place is about to start swaying!
3:39 P.M. | SEC life begins at Texas A&M
What's the best atmosphere I've seen in college football over the last half-decade? It came in College Station, in 2010, when Texas A&M hosted Nebraska. It gave the Aggies an unstoppable home-field advantage - it was an SEC-like atmosphere, in fact.
When the Aggies are rolling, there are few stadiums as special as Kyle Field. And for you first-time visitors, take heed: "Please do not be alarmed as the press box will move during the Aggie War Hymn."
3:34 P.M. | Final: Virginia 17, Penn State 16
A final in Charlottesville: Penn State falls, 17-16. Sam Ficken missed a 42-yard field goal as time expired. Virginia staked a dramatic final drive, finally scoring with a six-yard touchdown pass by Michael Rocco to Jake McGee with 1:28 remaining. Penn State falls to 0-2 for the first time since 2001, and this one was a heart-breaker. The three missed field goals (and extra point) really came back to haunt them.
3:21 P.M. | Hunter Atkins from U.S.C.-Syracuse
Want to know what to watch for in today's U.S.C.-Syracuse game at MetLife Stadium?
Look up. Because that is where the ball will almost always be today.
Who could have predicted that Curtis McNeal and Silas Redd, both 1,000-yard rushers in 2011, would have combined to carry the ball 14 times in U.S.C.'s 49-10 victory over Hawaii last week? Perhaps Lane Kiffin designed an early boost for quarterback Matt Barkley's Heisman Trophy campaign. Barkly passed for 372 yards and four touchdowns.
But Syracuse quarterback Ryan Nassib made his own case for the better gunslinger, leading the nation in completions (45), passing yards (482) and total offense (512 yards) in a 42-41 loss to Northwestern last Saturday.
Syracuse lost to Northwestern after a stirring 28-point rally gave the Orange a 41-35 lead with less than three minutes to play, but the Wildcats rallied to score the decisive touchdown in the final minute to extend a six-game losing streak dating back to last October.
Dubbed the inaugural "New York's College Classic," Syracuse (0-1) and No. 2 U.S.C. (1-0) will meet for the second year in a row. Behind five touchdown passes from Matt Barkley, the Trojans beat the Orange, 38-17, a year ago in Los Angeles. This game will be one of three games in five days at MetLife Stadium. On Wednesday, Tony Romo led the Dallas Cowboys over Eli Manning and the Giants. Barkley and U.S.C. invade today. And former Trojan Mark Sanchez will start for the New York Jets against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday - with one of college football's legends, Tim Tebow, waiting in the wings.
Barkley is anticipating what he called "a blast of a weekend," earlier this week. His image streamed across a video board in Times Square this week and today is his 22nd birthday. The Orange's porous defense seems gift-wrapped for a big celebration. Northwestern quarterbacks completed 22 of 32 passes for 213 yards in its win over the Orange and the Trojans are 26-point favorites today.
Still, Nassib gives the Orange a chance of a close shoot-out.
"I feel like if we can keep it close, play them tough all game long and not let the game get away from us, I think we've got a good shot," Nassib said earlier this week.
An upset win for Syracuse could buck a decade of mediocrity. The Orange have had two winning seasons since 2001.
Syracuse head coach Doug Marrone, who grew up in the Bronx, acknowledged that Saturday's game will be a showcase for prospective recruits, even if it makes for a challenging trip for the hometown faithful upstate.
Plenty of Syracuse and U.S.C. fans flooded Penn Station and practically hijacked the transit system, turning it into a string of high-speed rally buses to New Jersey.
"It's like we turned the NJ Transit system into a frat party," said Sarah, who graduated from Syracuse in May and spent most of the ride embarrassed by her boyfriend's outlandish displays of fandom.
Joe, a mechanical engineering major, held an informal poll on the train when he raised his hand and shouted: "Who here is unemployed?"
"I haven't been looking to hard," Joe said of finding a job. He said that Syracuse gamedays will hold him back even further.
"This makes me never want to get a job," he said as he clutched a case of 30 light beers.
Joe looked over his shoulder at Sarah and added, "She made me leave the whiskey at home."
3:04 P.M. | Mississippi State, Miami (Fla.) unprecedented
How rare is Mississippi State's forthcoming win over Auburn? (The Bulldogs have the ball, up by 28-10, with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter.)
The Bulldogs have not won an SEC opener since 1999. Eight of the 12 conference-opening losses over this span have come against Auburn.
Nor has Mississippi State beat a SEC West team other than Mississippi since Dan Mullen took over in 2009. This is a big win for Mullen and this program.
How about Miami (Fla.), currently losing, 45-9, to Kansas State? The Hurricanes have lost only two games by 30 or more points since 2000: the 2005 Peach Bowl to L.S.U. (40-3) and in 2007 at Oklahoma (51-13).
This specific team is historically bad. And what does Miami's showing against the Wildcats say about Boston College, which lost, 41-32, to the Hurricanes last Saturday?
3:00 P.M. | Penn State surges ahead
Penn State has scored nine unanswered points and leads, 16-10, with 10:55 remaining in the fourth. It grabbed the lead when the tight end Allen Robinson made a terrific diving catch in the end zone, and the kicker Sam Ficken finally put a field goal through, this time from 32 yards. Setting up for a good finish here.
2:47 P.M. | A second update on Devon Walker
A second update on Tulane's Devon Walker, who was injured late in the first half of the Green Wave's game at Tulsa:
Rece Davis of ESPN reports that Walker is in stable condition at a nearby hospital, confirming Curtis Johnson's earlier statement. Keep Walker in your thoughts.
2:42 P.M. | Sims in; a storm's coming
Heading to the fourth quarter now, still 10-7, Virginia. The Cavs have put the former Alabama transfer Philip Sims in the game at quarterback, looking for something, anything, to happen offensively. It's starting to get cloudy here, too, and I hear a storm is coming. Mom, if you're reading this, I'm safe in a press box.
2:26 P.M. | Anthony Fera's transfer looms large
Hey, it's understandable. We don't think about kickers - we focus on quarterbacks, running backs and receivers. So while the headlines focused on Silas Redd leaving for U.S.C., Rob Bolden for L.S.U. and Justin Brown for Oklahoma, few considered how Anthony Fera's transfer to Texas would impact Penn State in Bill O'Brien's first season.
So far? Instead of Redd (or his former backup), the Nittany Lions started a walk-on at running back. After Matt McGloin was injured, the offense was forced to turn to the true freshman Steven Bench, not Bolden. Without Brown in the mix, O'Brien used a linebacker, Gerald Hodges, on punt returns against Ohio (O'Brien has since had a change of heart).
And what of Fera? Without the team's former kicker and punter, O'Brien has been forced to turn to the sophomore kicker Sam Ficken - to disastrous results. Ficken has missed three field goals, most recently a 20-yard chip shot; as a result, Virginia has maintained its 10-7 lead.
No one thinks about the kicker, until his backup misses three field goals and your team loses by a touchdown or less.
2:16 P.M. | Virginia moves ahead against Penn State
Virginia takes its first lead at 9:22 in the third quarter on a one-yard pass from Michael Rocco to the tight end Jeremiah Mathis. That capped a 77-yard opening drive, which nearly equaled their entire offensive output from the first half (95 yards). Penn State still without Matt McGloin and are facing an uphill battle, indeed.
2:13 P.M. | Curtis Johnson on Devon Walker
An update on Devon Walker:
Tulane head coach Curtis Johnson tells Fox Sports' Desmond Purnell that Walker "was breathing again and he is stable."
2:09 P.M. | Tulane defensive back injured
A developing story coming out of this afternoon's game between Tulane and Tulsa:
Tulane defensive back Devon Walker, a former walk-on who was recently put on scholarship, suffered an apparent neck injury late in the first half. Walker suffered a head-to-head blow with a teammate as both tackled a Tulsa wide receiver.
According to Bill Haisten of the Tulsa World, medical personnel appeared to be administering C.P.R. on the field.
Fox Sports, which is broadcasting the game, reported that Walker had stopped breathing, requiring resuscitation. He is considered to be in "stable" condition, per Fox Sports.
Walker was taken off the field in an ambulance, joined by Tulane athletic director Rick Dickson, after being strapped onto a board and placed on a stretcher.
I'll update as more information comes in from Tulsa.
1:56 P.M. | No Watkins, no problem for Clemson
Oh, what is Clemson doing to do without Sammy Watkins? How will the Tigers survive?
Life without Watkins is going quite well, thank you. For one, the Tigers still have the offensive coordinator Chad Morris - and as long as Morris is around, the Tigers' offense will run with the best of 'em. (Clemson has given Morris the sort of contract that should ensure he sticks around until a team offers him a head coaching job, which should be soon.)
And the Tigers also have Nuk Hopkins. Last year's second banana, Hopkins has filled Watkins' shoes with style. In last week's win over Auburn, Hopkins set a new school record with 13 receptions. In the first half of today's game against Ball State, Hopkins has tied a school record with three touchdown grabs.
Quickly, Hopkins has gone from wildly underrated as a secondary option to the A.C.C.'s most prolific receiver. What does this mean for Clemson? It's just another weapon that opponents - like Florida State, for example - must consider when planning a defense that can slow down this offense. It's a major, major development for an already potent attack.
1:45 P.M. | Temple lays a first-half egg against Maryland
It's all Maryland, thanks to a 23-point second quarter. Heading into halftime, the Terrapins hold a 26-3 lead. Bully for you, Maryland. And for you, Temple? Get your act in gear.
Through 30 minutes, the Owls' statistical line includes the following gems: two first downs (one via a Maryland penalty), one completed pass, three points, five penalties, four fumbles (lost two), 1.3 yards per carry.
It's hard to find the right word to describe such a performance. Gruesome? Horrific? Hilarious? (If you're a Maryland fan, a Villanova fan, etc.)
Big East jokes are low-hanging fruit, so let's be serious: Temple losing by 23 points to Maryland - a really weak team, in my opinion - is just bad for the league. It's not good. I thought that the Owls would be the Big East's worst team in 2012, but to get your doors blown off by the Terrapins reflects poorly on your team and your league.
1:35 P.M. | Halftime in Charlottesville
It's halftime at Scott Stadium, and I'd say that the story here is really how poor the Cavaliers are playing. The offense turned the ball over twice and has been sluggish, to say the least. A 46-yard field goal is the only thing they have to show for it. Meanwhile, Penn State is currently winning without its starting quarterback or running back. And as far as atmosphere goes, I've seen Tim Rohan wear hats with more eccentricity than the crowd has shown here so far.
1:18 P.M. | U.C.F.'s busy offseason
U.C.F.'s offseason, in brief: Big East, N.C.A.A. violations, N.C.A.A. appeal. Let's go down the line.
U.C.F. has been a member of Conference USA since 2005; before joining the league, the Knights spent three years in the Mid-American Conference (2002-4) and six years (1996-2001) as an F.B.S. Independent. (From 1979, when the program debuted, through 1995, U.C.F. spent time in Division III, Division II and in the F.C.S.)
Come 2013, U.C.F. will join three others Conference USA programs in making a move to the Big East - joining Memphis, S.M.U. and Houston.
Now, the violations. Propelled by a story by Pete Thamel, then of The New York Times, the N.C.A.A. in 2011 began investigating U.C.F.'s relationship with Ken Caldwell, a Chicago man who had allegedly given more than $16,000 in impermissible benefits to 11 U.C.F. men's basketball and football recruits. 
U.C.F. self-imposed penalties, putting its athletic department on three years of probation and placing recruiting limitations on both athletic programs - decreasing the number of official visits the men's basketball and football programs could use during a given year. 
In late July, the N.C.A.A. added another penalty: U.C.F.'s men's basketball and football programs will be ineligible for postseason play during the 2012-13 academic year. For the football team, a postseason ban includes the conference title game. The only silver lining for U.C.F. is that the penalties assessed by the N.C.A.A. did not extend into the 2013-14 year, when the university joins the Big East.
Finally, the appeal. The penalties would not have extended in 2013-14, rather, if U.C.F. hadn't opted to appeal its postseason ban. In short, the Knights might win the appeal, meaning the program will not undergo any ban whatsoever. Win or lose, the appeal will likely continue through this coming season - meaning that U.C.F., if it loses the appeal, would be ineligible for postseason play in its first year as part of the Big east.
1:18 P.M. | Injury news for Penn State
Bad news for the Nittany Lions: the quarterback Matt McGloin was taken to the locker room with 8:16 left in the second quarter. It looks like he was favoring his right shoulder. He got crushed on a pass attempt that went incomplete, the second time in the last couple of minutes that he took a hard shot to that right side. We'll see if he can come back. Steven Bench, a freshman, is the backup. Penn State still leads, 7-0.
12:51 P.M. | Maryland and Temple meet again
Baby steps, Maryland. Baby steps. In last year's meeting, the Terrapins trailed Temple by 21-0 after the first quarter. This year, the Terrapins and Owls are tied at 3-3 after 15 minutes. Progress! (Progress?)
Both teams opened 2012 with a win over an F.C.S. opponent, though each victory had a different feel. Maryland's 7-6 win over William & Mary was as ugly as it sounds; the Tribe could have won - should have, in fact - had a wide receiver not dropped a sure touchdown pass in the second half.
Temple, on the other hand, dismantled a fairly good Villanova team, 41-10. While some have the Owls pegged as the last-place team in the Big East (I'm not naming names), they should still be able to beat a team like Maryland. Decimated by attrition and injuries, Randy Edsall's squad has no identity, no leaders and no hope for a winning season.
What does Maryland have? A superb true freshman in Stefon Diggs, a five-star product who has already moved into a huge role at wide receiver. Through the first minute of the second quarter, Diggs has gained 12 yards on the ground to go with 2 receptions for 21 yards.
And look at that: Maryland just scored to make it a 10-3 game. Perry Hills, a freshman who stepped in at quarterback after C.J. Brown suffered a season-ending injury late in fall camp, found Matt Furstenburg for a six-yard touchdown. 
12:32 P.M. | Zach Schonbrun: Penn State strikes first
Penn State gets on the board with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Matt McGloin to the tight end Kyle Carter. That capped a 17-play, 75-yard opening drive, which also included two timeouts, one video replay, two 4th-down conversations and felt like it took years off my life. But anyway, good start for the Nittany Lions to strike first on the road. Showing no jitters.
12:26 P.M. | George O'Leary is not impressed by the Horseshoe
George O'Leary, speaking Thursday on his weekly radio show, on Ohio State's supposed home-field advantage: 
"I tell you what, it's like Michigan. It's not a loud stadium. I mean, they sit on their hands in that stadium. I've been there before, and you take Wisconsin, you take Iowa, you take U.C.F. is much louder than that stadium. It really is as far as the noise is concerned, because it is so far away from the field. But a lot of stadiums are a lot louder than that place. I didn't even bring in music this week, or any type of noise because I think we should be able to execute without it."
Ohio State averaged 105,231 fans per game last fall, the second-highest total in the country, trailing Michigan. And when was the last time O'Leary coached in the Horseshoe? That would be 1980, when he was a first-year defensive line coach at Syracuse. It's been a while.
The Buckeyes lead, 7-0, and just regained possession after forcing U.C.F. into a punt.
12:01 P.M. | Zach Schonbrun from Scott Field
Minutes away from kickoff at Scott Stadium in Charlottesville. A sellout crowd is expected tonight, and there are a lot of Penn State fans here, too. So far the crowd seems pretty docile. Some signs in the student section but nothing too tawdry. On a personnel note, Penn State's running back Bill Belton did not make the trip and Derek Day will start.
11:57 A.M. | Noon games we'll be following
Noon games we'll be following (and if you have any suggestions, please leave them below):
U.C.F. at Ohio State
Penn State at Virginia
Maryland at Temple
Miami (Fla.) at Kansas State
Auburn at Mississippi State
Storylines abound. George O'Leary thinks Ohio State fans "sit on their hands." Penn State looks to avoid an 0-2 start. Maryland is a train wreck. Miami came within an inch of knocking off Kansas State last September; one could make the case that the win propelled the Wildcats to a double-digit win season. While it won't match the 3-2 game in 2008, the Auburn-Mississippi State won't have close to the same amount of fireworks as last season's 41-34 Auburn win.
11:40 A.M. | Pregame reading; quarterback notes
A little pregame reading from Tim Rohan, Zach Schonbrun and Tom Spousta.
First, Tim with an enlightening profile of Vanderbilt's James Franklin:
"Undeterred, Franklin visited every fraternity and sorority three times, telling them to take pride in the team, their university. It became cool to go to games, and Rodgers is now hounded by his fellow students. Still, Rodgers said, 'Coach Franklin's the rock star on campus.'
Many students watched the YouTube videos Franklin posted of him surprising the team with a dodge ball tournament or with a bowling outing. The videos humanized the coach and his team. Recruits saw the videos and the success, and now they listened when Franklin visited their homes. He presented what he called a logical argument: why wouldn't they want to play right away in the SEC, receive a quality education and make history at Vanderbilt?"
Zach with a great piece on Kyle Flood, the former Rutgers offensive line coach who was named as Greg Schiano's successor over the winter:
Well before Rutgers named Flood its football coach in January, he was a math teacher at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens. His nightly concern was stimulating 41 high school students through five algebra and trigonometry courses each weekday morning. He was a part-time offensive line coach at C. W. Post in the afternoons.
Tom, who will be in College Station for Texas A&M's debut against Florida, discusses the animosity between two new rivals:
"Little would suggest any animosity between Texas A&M and Florida. But fuel the pregame hype with a hurricane, a gift basket and a strategically placed billboard, and a heated rivalry might be born Saturday at Kyle Field."
Now, football news. Connor Shaw, who suffered an upper-body injury in South Carolina's season-opening win over Vanderbilt, will not start for the Gamecocks against East Carolina.
Instead, the Gamecocks will go with the sophomore Dylan Thompson - but don't be surprised if Shaw sees some time early, especially if U.S.C. struggles. Thompson is a work in progress.

HEADLINE: After Jobs Report, Obama Tries to Change the Subject

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER and ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama began hammering away at the Republican ticket's plans for Medicare, using a campaign swing through Florida to try to turn the page from anemic employment growth, his biggest weakness, to entitlements, a Democratic strength. 

 BODY:
SEMINOLE, Fla. - President Obama on Saturday began hammering away at the Republican ticket's plans for Medicare, using a campaign swing through Florida, with its large number of retired and elderly voters, to try to turn the page from anemic employment growth, his biggest weakness, to entitlements, a Democratic strength.
Kicking off a two-day bus tour through this perennial swing state, the president told a rally here that Mitt Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, had proposed overhauling Medicare and replacing it with a voucher system that could mean higher costs for beneficiaries.
"Florida, you should know I will never turn Medicare into a voucher system," Mr. Obama said to rousing cheers from a crowd of 11,000 at St. Petersburg College, Seminole. "No American should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies."
The president's advisers have indicated that they are eager to re-engage their opponents on their Medicare plan, while the Romney camp would prefer to talk about the economy. A government report on Friday showed that employers had eased up on hiring in August, adding just 96,000 jobs, compared with 141,000 in July. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent, but that was largely because of people leaving the work force entirely.
Mr. Romney has sought to blunt Mr. Obama's Medicare offensive with attacks of his own, something Obama advisers appeared to await eagerly.
"If they want to have a discussion about who do you trust on Medicare for the next 60 days as their central argument, you know we ought to send them an in-kind contribution," David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday. "We're happy to have that discussion. We think people trust the president more on Medicare."
The president grabbed that mantle on Saturday and ran with it. "We will reform and strengthen Medicare," he told the rally, "but we'll do it by reducing the costs of health care, not by dumping the costs on seniors."
For good measure, he threw in several more lines in his stump speech aimed at older people, who he said "are saving an average of $6,000 on prescription drugs because of Obamacare. And by the way, I do care." That was a reference to the derogatory phrase that Republicans have given his health care overhaul. These days, the president has embraced the label with open arms.
"I like the name 'Obamacare,' " he said. Mr. Romney "says he's going to repeal it. That's because Romney doesn't care."
With 58 days to go until Election Day, the battle for seven or so fiercely contested swing states has intensified. No state is more crucial than Florida, with its 29 electoral votes and its diverse mix of conservative Southerners, Hispanics, African-Americans and elderly and Jewish voters.
Mr. Obama does not appear to have much of a shot with conservative Southerners, but he is fighting mightily for the rest. That is why his weekend bus tour was straddling the center of the state, in the territory that hosted the Republican National Convention two weeks ago. Mr. Obama won Florida in 2008.
After Seminole, the president traveled up Interstate 4 toward Orlando, with a stop in Kissimmee. On Sunday, he was to head down to Melbourne and then West Palm Beach, ground zero for the Bush-Gore election recount of 2000.
Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, was focusing his efforts Saturday on Virginia, another state that Mr. Obama captured in 2008 and that he has made a priority in his re-election bid.
At his first stop, in Virginia Beach, Mr. Romney led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance, using it as a jumping-off point to criticize Mr. Obama and the Democrats for initially passing a convention platform that did not mention God.
"The promises that were made in that pledge are promises I plan on keeping if I am president, and I've kept them so far in my life," Mr. Romney told the cheering audience. "That pledge says 'under God.' I will not take 'God' out of the name of our platform. I will not take God off our coins, and I will not take God out of my heart."
The stop in Virginia Beach and an appearance at the start of the Sprint Cup Series Nascar race in Richmond, is intended to help him shore up his lead among white working-class voters.
Although the president trails Mr. Romney in this crucial demographic, some polls still show Mr. Romney underperforming among those voters. Mr. Romney's choice of Mr. Ryan as his running mate was also expected to help him win over working-class whites and the Republican conservative base, many of whom were wary of Mr. Romney during the primary contests.
For Mr. Romney, the son of a Detroit auto executive turned Michigan governor courting working-class voters may be a challenge. He is Harvard educated and has an estimated net worth of more than $200 million.
During a visit to the Daytona 500 this year, Mr. Romney ran into some trouble when he said that while he did not follow the sport as closely as some ardent fans did, he had "some great friends who are Nascar team owners." His opponents used the comment to portray him as wealthy and out of touch with the concerns of average voters.
Mr. Obama has made repeated campaign stops in Virginia, particularly courting black voters around the Richmond area to try to drive up their turnout. He has also focused on liberal-leaning areas of Northern Virginia.
Besides the on-the-ground campaigning this weekend, the Sunday morning talk shows were on the candidates' agendas. Mr. Romney was to make his first appearance of the campaign season on "Meet the Press" on NBC, and Mr. Obama and Mr. Ryan were scheduled to appear on "Face the Nation" on CBS.

HEADLINE: Taking the 'Cheap' Out of the Small Car

BYLINE: By LINDSAY BROOKE

 BODY:
THE idea that good things come in small packages has rarely played well with American car buyers. And who can blame them?
After all, a longstanding notion that bigger was always better, combined with gasoline at bargain prices compared with the rest of the world, led Detroit's executives and engineers to direct their best efforts toward more profitable cars in the midsize and large classes. In the process, they sentenced their small cars to a starvation diet.
''This goes back to the domestic philosophy of 'small cars equal small profit,' '' said Jim Hall, managing director of 2953 Analytics, an auto consulting firm. ''The philosophy was that you're going to be low-profit, so you want to convince people to buy something bigger.''
Even Henry Ford's early investors tried to persuade him to abandon his idea for the compact, efficient Model T and instead concentrate on big 6-cylinder touring cars because that's where the money was. Though Ford prospered with the Model T, his business plan later changed, and in the postwar years hulking, powerful American cars prevailed. 
There's no getting around the basic mechanics that make longer, wider, heavier cars feel comfortable on the road and their 6- and 8-cylinder engines inherently silky and quiet running.
''Generally, the lighter and shorter the car, and the shorter its wheelbase, the greater the challenge in your overall refinement options,'' said Jim Federico, General Motors' global chief engineer for small cars.
He noted that while a smaller car's lighter weight can benefit fuel economy, it may also reduce the pleasure of traveling in it.
''First, mass is actually your friend for reducing N.V.H.,'' he said, using the engineer's shorthand for noise, vibration and harshness. ''So our approaches to designing in refinement on a 3,100-pound Cruze and a 2,200-pound Spark will have many similarities and some differences.''
Even the profile and proportions of the bodies are factors: a long car typically manages airflow at the rear more smoothly, while a design that has been truncated abruptly at the rear generates turbulence at speed.
''The shorter the vehicle, the more difficulty engineers have in making aerodynamics work in favor of fuel economy, as well as interior noise,'' Mr. Federico said. ''Cars like the Spark create an expectation, because of their small size, that they have superhigh highway fuel economy. But in reality they have the aerodynamics of a brick.''
The refinements that helped turn big cars into Detroit's profit centers were mostly absent when fuel efficiency became a selling point in the 1970s and '80s and a wave of new small cars arrived in showrooms.
Remember the Ford Pinto and Escort? Datsun F10? Dodge Shadow? The Chevrolet Chevette and Citation? They may have been cheap to buy, but there was little joy in driving them. These and other buzzy underachievers -- often called penalty boxes and worse by owners -- set a low bar for the small-car genre in the United States.
The picture is much brighter today. Small cars have the benefit of years of development, and American buyers demand greater levels of polish. Consider how far removed a modern compact like the European-bred Ford Fiesta has advanced from efforts of four decades ago like the troubled Pinto.
Some credit for this trend belongs to the vehicles that came from Japan and Europe, where gasoline has long been expensive and multivehicle families are far less common. There, the reference standard for small cars is on another plane entirely.
Delightfully light-to-the-touch controls and 4-cylinder engines with electric-motor smoothness became hallmarks of cars like the Honda Civic, which elevated refinement in a mainstream small car to an art form.
Buyers in the United States and Europe generally have different expectations about vehicle refinement, particularly in regard to the powertrain. Because manual transmissions are far more prevalent in Europe, for example, drivers are more used to the sound, vibrations and comfort levels associated with shifting gears manually.
Today's small cars actually span three main segments in the global vehicle market. The tiny A-segment cars include the Chevy Spark and Smart Fortwo. They're extremely short and very light. Slightly larger are B-segment cars like the Ford Fiesta and Chevy Sonic. The A- and B-cars are known as subcompacts.
In the C-segment -- typically called compacts -- are the largest of the small cars. Examples include the Toyota Corolla, a perennial sales leader, as well as the Ford Focus, Chevy Cruze, Hyundai Elantra, Honda Civic and Volkswagen's Golf and Jetta.
Chevrolet's entries in all three segments highlight the small-car dimensional differences that can limit their relative refinement. The Spark is just 145 inches long, has a 93.5-inch wheelbase (the distance between axles) and weighs about 2,240 pounds. The B-segment Sonic is 18 inches longer than the Spark with a wheelbase nearly six inches longer; the Sonic is also almost 500 pounds heavier. The C-segment Cruze is yet another 18 inches longer than the Sonic, with a wheelbase more than six inches longer; the Cruze weighs almost 400 more pounds more than the Sonic.
Mike Merlo is chief engineer of the 2012 Dodge Dart, which is based on the well-regarded Alfa Romeo Giulietta platform developed by Chrysler's parent, Fiat.
Mr. Merlo's counterparts in Italy define ''vehicle refinement'' differently from the American engineers.
''To them, refinement means a 'European feel' of the car,'' he said. ''They spend a lot of time on seat comfort and its relation to the driving position, and maybe not as much time as we do on road isolation characteristics, because their roads are generally in much better condition than ours.''
European car owners also favor three-season tires that have exemplary ride and handling characteristics in spring, summer and fall. When winter comes, they install tires with specific winter grip and performance; Americans typically mount all-season tires for year-round use.
''So we had to calibrate the Dart's suspension and ride characteristics for the tire differences,'' Mr. Merlo said. ''The all-season tires led to trade-offs in the car's overall refinement.''
A suspension calibration can involve changing the rubber bushings at the connecting points between the suspension and the body. The bushings are rated according to their specific hardness; different bushings give firmer handling, a more compliant ride or a combination of both. Calibration can also involve the selection of alternate wheels and tires, and upgrading to sophisticated, and more expensive, suspension dampers.
Mr. Merlo noted two important lessons, shared by the members of his Chrysler team and their Fiat counterparts, that brought a higher level of refinement to the new Dart. One was a type of door construction commonly used in Europe that features advanced noise-sealing techniques.
The other was Chrysler's unusually high standards for the stiffness of the car's body -- the torsional bending measurement. Chrysler's requirement surprised the Fiat engineers, but the extra rigidity made it possible to build the larger Dart from the smaller foundation of the Alfa.
''These really helped us end up with a cabin that's very quiet,'' Mr. Merlo said. ''Because the body is stiff, it allows us a lot of flexibility to have both a softer-riding car when we want it to be soft and a firmer-riding car when we want it to have outstanding chassis dynamics.''
With United States small-car sales up 14 percent in the last decade, automakers are increasingly devoting major design and engineering resources to their development. Extensive computer analysis of body construction and materials, noise and vibration sources and driving dynamics is done in the early stages of vehicle design before any metal parts are made.
The goal is to identify the sources within the vehicle that cause unpleasant acoustics, sloppy control or poor driving dynamics -- and reduce or eliminate them, rather than devising expensive fixes aimed at masking them.
Engineers can select from a deep box of technologies aimed at vehicle refinement, including sound-damping materials behind the dash panel, under the floor and in the headliner; thick door seals and laminated acoustic glass.
But the state of the art in executing a great small car is in knowing how to make the vehicle refined in the right places -- making a steel bulkhead a fraction of a millimeter thicker, or using an adhesive to join two parts.
''The key is to thoroughly understand the vehicle's dynamics and N.V.H. sources up front,'' Mr. Federico said.
''To an increasing number of American buyers, small cars are no longer base cars,'' said Mr. Hall, whose early experience as a magazine journalist exposed him to many of the worst small cars of past years. ''They want the same things they have in their larger cars, just in a smaller size. They don't need the space, and they're a generation who are more open to small cars than their parents were.''

CHART: My, How We've Grown: The Changing Measure of the Small-Car Class: Cars classified as compact models and smaller have long been available in American showrooms, but low gas prices have kept them from the top of the sales charts. Last month, as has been the case for years, large pickups and midsize sedans were the best sellers. That may change, however, with the introduction of new models that include more big-car features, and with the advent of tougher fuel-economy standards. One small car that has consistently succeeded in the United States is the Honda Civic, serving through the years as a benchmark of refinement and dependability. Over four decades, the Civic has also grown considerably, gaining roughly two feet in wheelbase, three feet in overall length and 1,000 pounds in weight. No longer the smallest car Honda sells in America -- the Fit hatchback is more than a foot shorter -- it serves as a good case study in automotive evolution. The specifications below trace some of those changes. Engine size, prices and fuel economy are for the base model at the introduction year of each generation. The mileage ratings are adjusted to reflect the most recent calculation method of the Environmental Protection Agency, and they are based on models equipped with an automatic transmission. All prices are adjusted for inflation to 2012 dollars; destination charges, which are not available for early models, are not included. The original sale prices are in parentheses.

HEADLINE: Very, Very High Season

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
AS you approach from the west, the Spaceport America main terminal looks like a gigantic moth, its rounded wings outspread against the arid, reddish-brown dirt of southern New Mexico. 
But it is the view from the east -- which reveals a curved, pitched glass facade, soaring steel hanger doors and a white-on-white ''2001''-style interior -- that truly encapsulates the future hopes of this complex, which officials call the first specifically designed to serve commercial space companies.
''The idea was to really bring economic development to New Mexico,'' said Christine Anderson, the executive director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority. ''We think the commercial space industry is poised to take off. Literally.''
Built by the state at a cost of $209 million, Spaceport America was constructed with a tenant in mind -- Virgin Galactic -- which has signed a 20-year lease and is expected to start suborbital flights in the next year or so.
To say the site is remote doesn't do it justice. A power substation had to be installed, wells dug, water and sewer systems put in place. And while the spaceport will have a restaurant, at the moment the nearest place to grab a meal is more than 20 miles away.
But the Spaceport Authority hopes to make the place more inviting by the end of 2013 -- part of a mandate that the spaceport be self-supporting. Plans are afoot for an elaborate visitor center complete with interactive exhibits devoted to all manner of space-oriented activities.
Hopes are high; officials say they expect to draw as many as 200,000 visitors a year to see the spaceport.

HEADLINE: Korean-Flavored Chevy Is Thrifty and City-Smart

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
AT the 2001 Detroit auto show, before he was pulled back into the family business like the movie mobster Michael Corleone, General Motors' godfather-for-hire, Robert A. Lutz, gravely assessed the design studies on display: ''A whole family of angry kitchen appliances, demented toasters, furious bread machines and vengeful trash compactors.''
Mr. Lutz, 80, is now retired from G.M., again. But I thought of him when I drove the new Chevrolet Spark: Mr. Lutz, your toast is served. With a nice coating of green marmalade.
Yes, the Spark looks as though it's about to spit a load of brioche from its roof. But as strange as this mini city car may appear, the oddest thing about the Spark is the Chevy bow tie that gleams from its grille and hatch. 
Mr. Lutz, long associated with steroidal specials like the Dodge Viper, once pronounced global warming a ''total crock.'' Yet the Berkeley-educated former Marine fighter pilot -- always a blend of contradictions -- was soon shepherding the Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid to production, saying the electrification of the automobile was inevitable.
This Spark is not battery-powered, not yet, though the model will lead G.M.'s electric car efforts with a low-volume, limited-market edition set to arrive next year. But the Spark's name, styling and park-anywhere size did lead one Manhattan onlooker to assume that a cache of batteries was on board.
Whether a gasoline version or electric, the Spark also suggests a road to Damascus experience for G.M. The company's obsession with paramilitary Hummers and other expressions of S.U.V. overkill nearly brought it to ruin when fuel prices ran up and buyers ran away.
Currently earning billions as the ''new'' G.M., the company is not out of the woods. But while this 1.2-liter 84-horsepower urban runabout is about the slowest thing on wheels -- and as much a niche car in America as any Hummer -- its very existence says something good about G.M. On all fronts, the company is at least trying to anticipate market trends, rather than propagate an action-movie fantasy worthy of Michael Bay.
That is not to say there isn't room for cinematic Camaros or modern S.U.V.'s. What it does mean is that the parochial Midwestern bubble that once surrounded G.M. -- and in which Chrysler and Ford happily floated as well -- seems to have popped for good.
The Spark also illuminates G.M.'s greater global focus, having been designed, engineered and built in Korea. The littlest Chevy, which replaces the larger Aveo, has been on sale internationally since 2009.
This demented toaster is barely larger than a breadbox, 14 inches shorter than Chevy's Sonic hatchback and roughly 2 inches shorter than a Mini Cooper. Although a Mini or a Fiat 500 is sexier, sportier and much more expensive than the Spark, neither has a back seat nearly as habitable.
The Spark is ultra-affordable, starting at $12,995, rising to $15,795 for the line-topping 2LT, and it never feels cheap or chintzy. That's especially true of the interior, which mimics style leaders like the Mini with swoopy shapes, body-color trim and an instrument pod that sprouts from the steering column.
My test car was laden with standard features that included stability control, 10 air bags, Bluetooth, cruise control, keyless entry and a leather-clad steering wheel with audio and phone buttons.
The styling follows a trend of cars like the Nissan Leaf E.V., which, deciding they can't be pretty, choose to be out-there instead. That defiantly frumpy approach can be charming, as Nissan has managed with its Juke crossover.
But I confess to feeling more silly than edgy at the wheel of this narrow, squashed-face carnival buggy, even as it showed me a responsible 42 m.p.g. on the highway and about 37 m.p.g. over all. The manual-shift Spark easily topped federal estimates of 32/38 m.p.g. in city and highway use.
The green paint didn't improve my self-esteem, either. Chevy calls it Jalapeño, but I'd never touch tongue to any chili with this irradiated shade.
But then the Spark isn't aimed at people like me, who thought '80s hatchbacks were small. Instead, Chevy seems convinced that millennials, the much-sought demographic segment ranging in age from about 16 to 31, are the Spark's natural audience. I picture more Gulf Coast retirees than Brooklyn hipsters in the Spark, but what do I know? I still think of Pabst Blue Ribbon as factory-town swill.
To that youthful end, the Spark's cabin is rich with connected technology that may well make its way to top luxury models rather than the usual trickle-down from posh to poor. Its Chevrolet MyLink system integrates all its functions -- phone, music, video and navigation -- through an iPhone or Android phone. There's not even a slot for CDs.
It's all managed, with reasonable smoothness, through a passive 7-inch display screen that doesn't require navigation or other systems to be embedded in the dashboard. Those systems can add thousands of dollars to the window sticker, and their maps and other features can quickly grow obsolete. In contrast, a phone-based system can be updated as easily as downloading a new app. SiriusXM satellite service, as well as apps for Pandora and Stitcher Smart radio, are installed at the factory.
There are pitfalls to current phone-based systems: they can eat up cellphone minutes, and smartphone antennas are not as good as a car's antenna. Spark's apps, including route guidance, won't work in a tiny town or barren wilderness with no cell service. The familiar ''Can you hear me now?'' will become ''I'm lost, can you find me now?''
The Spark could also use one or two more dedicated buttons on the dashboard or screen, including a simple map button to return to the main view and an easy-access volume control. But one thing is certain: the Spark's controls were more advanced and easier to operate than those of many cars that cost more.
If only the Spark drove as well as it dialed calls or summoned Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds from the bowels of, um, an iPhone.
The barely 2,200-pound microcar gets the job done on city or suburban streets for which it's intended. There's decent bump control and just enough urge to keep up with traffic, despite a 0-60 m.p.h. time well into the double digits.
My test car's 5-speed manual shifter, roughly the length of a croquet mallet, would have been at home in a school bus. A 4-speed automatic is available for $925, though some critics have found it douses the Spark's already tepid acceleration.
As speeds increase, the Spark's short wheelbase, underdamped suspension and meager power make for rougher going. Road imperfections crashed and boomed in the high-decibel cabin. Heaven help you if you get caught in the wrong gear on a highway on-ramp.
The car itself feels solid and well built. But with its flaccid suspension and lifeless, overboosted steering, the Spark charted a wobbly highway course; there's none of the fun and nimbleness you'd prefer in such a tiny car. Flogging the little green goblin, I managed to keep pace, barely, with BMWs on the Interstate. But the Spark is more at home in the slow lane.
Consider the Spark a city-centric econobox -- with a clever bonus box inside for iPhone or Android users.

HEADLINE: The Problem With a No-New-Tax Pledge

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In '' 'Framing' Prevents Needed Stimulus'' (Economic View, Sept. 2) Robert J. Shiller argued that the persistent layoffs of public workers were a result of a framing problem -- the idea that superficial, irrelevant details can lead uninformed people to make the wrong choices, in this case about taxes. 
I disagree. Many Americans are willing to accept higher taxes in order to reduce deficits and prevent further government layoffs. The problem is that a promise not to raise taxes has virtually become a condition of being a Republican elected official. All but a handful of Republicans of Congress have made that pledge, despite the benefits that increased taxes could bring.
So even if the public is ready to make rational choices about their tax rates and government revenue, it wouldn't matter right now, because many of their elected officials have pledged that they will forever be irrational.

HEADLINE: Bulk of Charitable Giving Not Earmarked for the Poor

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
One weekend several years ago, as I was arriving at my neighborhood farmers' market, a college student approached me with a clipboard and an impassioned, if easily forgettable pitch for Greenpeace. If I signed the papers he had in his hand, a $20 charge would appear on my credit card statement each month and a small but vital fraction of the world's marine life could be saved. Confronted by an actual person and standing in the vicinity of cheese whose per-pound price was equal to the monthly cost of potentially saving a monk seal, I was too embarrassed to say, ''Thanks, but I'll pass,'' only then to move on to the artisanal cheddars of Pennsylvania. 
Need confronts us all the time, especially in New York, where density and dependence on mass transit place those on various sides of the economic divide into more routine contact than might occur in Houston or Denver or Seattle. Need, of course, has been escalating in recent years, and liberals fear that it would soar far more aggressively under a Republican leadership likely to make significant cuts to federal programs that benefit the poor. Could charitable inclination, further aroused by new tax breaks, really assume the burdens relinquished by government? Though it may be the case, as some would contend, that decentralized giving is the most efficient means of reaching the poor, the argument rests on the assumption that human beings give efficiently.
It is not entirely clear that they do. Americans give generously but they give polymorphously. Charitable contribution is motivated by compassion, affinity, history, fealty, social contest and, not infrequently, shame. The bulk of charitable donations in this country are made by individuals, and the passions of individuals do not typically align with the broader exigencies of a particular social moment. Nationally, 32 percent of the $298 billion given away last year went to religious institutions, 13 percent to cultural organizations and 12 percent to social services, according to a report issued annually by the American Association of Fundraising Counsel. But if giving were conducted with the greatest consideration paid to the most urgent needs of the society, then Yale, a private institution with a $19.2 billion endowment, would arguably never receive another 50 cents.
New Yorkers give lavishly. According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, the metropolitan area ranks highest among cities in terms of dollar sum (though not in percentage of income) given to charity. The Upper East Side's 10021 ZIP code was responsible for $459 million in charitable donations in 2008, making it the country's most magnanimous in terms of money allocated.
And yet if we look at the Chronicle's ranking of individual donations of $1 million or more made in New York State so far this year, we see very little money going to causes aimed at enriching the lives of the less fortunate. Of the top five donations, totaling $190 million, one was made to Columbia University's business school, another to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Third on the list is Joshua P. Rechnitz's $40 million contribution to the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation, made specifically for the purpose of building an indoor cycling track. That figure represents about 25 times the amount raised by New Yorkers for Children, an organization focusing on young people in foster care and run by a former commissioner for the Administration of Children's Services, Nicholas Scoppetta, at its annual gala.
Looking at the top 49 gifts on the Chronicle's list, not one went to support social services explicitly.
Even when improving the lives of the suffering is at the forefront of charitable interest, giving in a way that maximizes the usefulness of what you give is not something ordinary civilians are reflexively equipped to do. It may be that $240 given annually to Greenpeace does wonderful, impactive work or it may be that the money would be of more vital use to an organization like the Food Bank for New York City -- to pick one of a hundred examples -- which has been forced to deliver 11 million fewer meals this year because of cuts in federal spending. The more charitable obligation we assume, the more we are put in the uncomfortable position of playing God.
And then there are the questions of metrics, numbers, statistics. ''If you spend 50 percent on fund-raising, you're considered a bad charity,'' Lorie A. Slutsky, chief executive of the New York Community Trust, a nearly-100-year-old organization that administers charitable giving for the wealthy, told me. But that measure of analysis is itself fluid, she explained, because new charities may not see yield on expensive direct-mail solicitation for years. Barring the reading of 990 tax forms, it is often difficult to determine what constitutes a successful charitable enterprise.
I asked Ms. Slutsky, who has taken donors to impoverished parts of the city in the hope of widening their charitable scope beyond the institutions favored on the Upper East Side, what she thought of the idea that charity could repair potentially bigger holes in the social safety net. ''I always say to people, name one of the richest people you can think of,'' she told me. ''Let's say Mike Bloomberg. Even if he gave away every penny he had -- $22 billion -- that would be a drop in the bucket. That's basically New York City's public school budget for one year.''

 BODY:
SEPTEMBER
LE POÈME HARMONIQUE New Yorkers have done well in recent years to make the acquaintance of L'Arpeggiata, a Paris-based ensemble that combines the highest level of early-music artistry and imagination with shifting degrees of theatricality. Now another fine French-based early-music group, which likes additionally to perform by candlelight if not in total darkness, receives its most prominent New York exposure to date, opening the season of the Miller Theater at Columbia University. The program, ''Venezia,'' is predictably heavy on works by Monteverdi, less predictably so on works by Francesco Manelli. Then again, Le Poème, like L'Arpeggiata, seems to put little premium on predictability. Just keep an open mind, and revel in the unexpected. Wednesday, Friday. (James R. Oestreich) 
TWELVE IN '12 Though by now it has been reduced to Nine in '12. Julian Wachner's music program at Trinity Wall Street, which did spectacular service in the first half of last season, especially for the Sept. 11 anniversary commemorations, only to be suspended for much of the second half for a re-evaluation of finances and purpose, is back and seeking new challenges. Under Mr. Wachner the program has become a hotbed of early music, especially with the Trinity Choir's Bach at One series at St. Paul's Chapel (which resumes on Oct. 1). Now, expanding the activities of Trinity's instrumental ensemble Novus NY, Mr. Wachner plans to make contemporary music an equal partner. Here, in a series of hourlong midday concerts, he opens the Trinity season with works by Pulitzer Prize-winning composers of the last dozen years. The first program, scheduled for last Thursday, offered works of Steven Stucky, Zhou Long and Paul Moravec. This week's concert features Jennifer Higdon, David Lang and John Corigliano. Still to come are Kevin Puts, Yehudi Wyner, John Adams, Henry Brant, Steve Reich and Ornette Coleman. Thursday (also Sept. 20, 27). Trinity Church. (J.R.O.)
'EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH' There have been many great operas, but only a few have redefined the very meaning of the art form. Of that select group, Monteverdi's ''Orfeo'' and Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' receive regular performances, but Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's 1976 masterpiece, ''Einstein on the Beach,'' which stretched the bounds of duration and plotlessness, is more talked about than seen. That makes this revival of the original production, part of an international tour honoring Mr. Glass's 75th birthday, one of the season's crucial events. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. Opens Friday. (Zachary Woolfe)
'I DUE FOSCARI' The Los Angeles Opera has retrenched artistically in recent seasons, having taken a huge chance on Achim Freyer's ambitious, often brilliant production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle. This year the only divergence from the standard repertory is this rarely performed tale of political and personal intrigue in 15th-century Venice, which is being mounted for the company's general director, the tenor Plácido Domingo, as he takes another step on his controversial path through Verdi's baritone roles. He is joined by the tenor Francesco Meli and the soprano Marina Poplavskaya; James Conlon, the company's music director, conducts. Opens Saturday. Los Angeles Opera, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, (213) 972-8001, laopera.com. (Z.W.)
NATE WOOLEY When this avant-garde trumpeter played part of his mesmerizing ''Seven Storey Mountain'' at Issue Project Room in June, he used a trumpet without a mouthpiece, amplifying it to create breathy, lightly pitched, sometimes squawking, sometimes almost spoken sounds that whispered over a dense shimmer of other instruments. He returns, again under the auspices of Issue Project Room, with another of the instrument's innovators, Mazen Kerbaj, for an evening of solos and duets. Sept. 19. Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral, 113 Remsen Street, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Alan Gilbert and the orchestra have restructured the opening of their season so that it no longer begins with a gala concert, however frothy. (That happens on Sept. 27, with Itzhak Perlman playing morsels by Massenet and Kreisler, and Mr. Gilbert adding Respighi's ''Fountains of Rome'' and ''Pines of Rome.'') Instead the season opens with a substantial subscription program: Gyorgy Kurtag's ''... quasi una fantasia ...''; Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Leif Ove Andsnes as soloist; and Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' You may run into ''The Rite'' a lot this season, in anticipation of the 100th anniversary of its scandalous premiere in May. (Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic also open their subscription season with it on Sept. 28.) But in this case it may be as much a matter of Mr. Gilbert's wanting to continue honing his interpretation of a thorny classic that he also performed in March, with the Juilliard Orchestra. Sept. 19-22. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
COMPOSER PORTRAITS This invaluable series -- the centerpiece of the Miller Theater's programming, established by George Steel and carried through admirably by his success sor as director of the theater, Melissa Smey, with, bless her, a greater concentration on women -- has generally featured living composers. But it starts this year with a nod to the centenary of John Cage: a program of Cage (and Pierre Boulez's ''Marteau Sans Maître'') with Steven Schick conducting the International Contemporary Ensemble. Other composers featured this season at the Miller are Jonathan Harvey, Olga Neuwirth, Sofia Gubaidulina, Enno Poppe, Rebecca Saunders, Oliver Knussen and Julio Estrada. The Composer Portraits series also goes on the road, to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, with programs devoted to Fred Lerdahl (Oct. 18) and Ms. Gubaidulina (March 21; a somewhat different program). Sept. 20. Miller Theater. (J.R.O.)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM The Met concert series, long a bastion of traditional classical music programming, sports a new face, as Limor Tomer, its new general manager, presents her first full season of programs. Here the Wordless Music orchestra joins the Danish art-rock group Efterklang in songs from that band's new album, ''Piramida.'' Page 33. Sept. 22. (J.R.O.)
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Nothing is easy for this ensemble as it searches for a music director to succeed James Levine, who resigned in 2011. Last September the prime candidates seemed to be Riccardo Chailly and Andris Nelsons, and both were well represented in that season's programming. But Mr. Chailly had to cancel because of a heart arrhythmia; Mr. Nelsons, because of the birth of his child. Mr. Chailly must surely be out of the running now, the orchestra having struggled through no end of health crises with Mr. Levine. Mr. Nelsons, who caught up with the orchestra at Tanglewood this summer and is scheduled to appear in Boston this season (Jan. 31; Feb. 1-2, 5), still seems to be a front-runner, though he just extended his contract as music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in England through the 2014-15 season. Other names currently circulating include those of Vladimir Jurowski, who makes his Boston Symphony debut in October (11-13), and -- a dark horse -- Esa-Pekka Salonen, who is not scheduled to conduct the Boston Symphony this season. The season opens here with Itzhak Perlman conducting a program of Beethoven in which he also performs the two violin romances. It seems safe to say that he harbors no ambitions to become the orchestra's music director. Sept. 22. Symphony Hall, (617) 266-1200 or (888) 266-1200, bso.org. (J.R.O.)
'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' How can you tell that a singer and a composer are riding high at the Metropolitan Opera? When they are given two opening nights in a row. The star soprano Anna Netrebko, who opened the last season in the title role of ''Anna Bolena,'' takes on another Donizetti opera -- though not ''Maria Stuarda,'' the follow-up to ''Bolena,'' as Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager originally hoped. (That vehicle falls to the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato on New Year's Eve.) Instead Ms. Netrebko plays Adina in a new production of the classic comedy ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' which combines ample laughs with threads of melancholy and touching emotion. The tenor Matthew Polenzani plays the love-struck Nemorino; the charismatic baritone Mariusz Kwiecien is Sergeant Belcore, his rival for Adina's affections; and the bass Ambrogio Maestri (and later in the run, the winning Erwin Schrott) sings Dr. Dulcamara, the lovable quack who dispenses the supposed elixir of love. Bartlett Sher, whose Met productions can teeter between spirited and frenetic, directs; Maurizio Benini conducts the burbling, effortlessly charming score. Opens Sept. 24. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The great joy of the society's concerts is the interaction of up-and-coming musicians with established ones: a violinist like Benjamin Beilman, say, on the cusp of a major career, and the veteran flutist Ransom Wilson. Those two, along with a host of colleagues, will play an opening program of serenades by Mozart, Kodaly, Strauss and Dvorak, the introduction to a season that reaches from Bach's keyboard concertos (played by Jeremy Denk as part of the annual Baroque Festival in December) by way of 19th-century classics to the complete Shostakovich string quartets in March. Sept. 24. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
'DOG DAYS' David T. Little, a percussionist with a composerly predilection for the theater, presents an example, ''Dog Days,'' as part of the Peak Performances series at Montclair State University (with another, ''Soldier Songs,'' to follow from Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now in January). Page 35. Opens Sept 29. Kasser Theater, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org. (J.R.O.)
GREEN MUSIC CENTER If ever there was a concert hall worth emulating, it is the Musikverein in Vienna, and the designers of Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood studied it well. If ever there was an indoor-outdoor concert hall worth emulating, it is Ozawa Hall, and those same designers -- notably the architect, William Rawn and the acoustician Lawrence Kirkegaard -- were recruited to do likewise with a 1,400-seat hall on the campus of Sonoma State University. An infusion of funds from Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of the board of Carnegie Hall, and his wife, Joan Weill, gave it a name, Weill Hall. (So is it Tanglewood West or Carnegie West?) The opening weekend includes a recital by the pianist Lang Lang and a concert by the Santa Rosa Symphony, conducted by its music director, Bruno Ferrandis, and others. Sept. 29-30. Green Music Center, Rohnert Park, Calif., (866) 955-6040, gmc.sonoma.edu. (J.R.O.)
'THE RITE OF SPRING' AT 100 This season-long festival gets a jump on the centennial of the masterpiece that not only defined Stravinsky's career -- more in subsequent performances than in its tempestuous premiere on May 29, 1913 -- but also set the course for much of 20th-century music, on into the 21st. The celebration opens here with ''The Seasons,'' by Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky commissioned for the occasion and performed by the cellist Y0-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble. Mr. Yanov-Yanovsky adapts folk tunes used by Stravinsky in ''The Rite.'' Later events include multiple staged interpretations of the work, notably the Joffrey Ballet's attempt at a ''literal re-creation'' of the original choreography (March 23-24) and a new Basil Twist rendering with puppets (April 12-13). Valery Gergiev conducts the Mariinsky Orchestra in two concerts, the second culminating in ''The Rite'' (Oct. 29-30, after a scholarly conference on ''Reassessing 'The Rite,''' Oct. 25-28), and Giancarlo Guerrero leads the Cleveland Orchestra in a program featuring Stravinsky's ''Petrouchka'' (March 17). Actually, the festival isn't quite season-long, ending in late April, before the actual anniversary. Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Carolina Performing Arts, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, (919) 843-3333. theriteofspringat100.org. (J.R.O.)
OCTOBER
'THE PRISMATIC DEBUSSY' New York City's major cultural institutions have largely ignored the 150th anniversary of the birth of Debussy, so the Eastman School of Music is picking up the slack with a series of concerts exploring his multifaceted output, held in conjunction with lectures, films and exhibitions. Oct. 1-27. Eastman School of Music, Rochester, (585) 274-1100, esm.rochester.edu/debussy. (Z.W.)
CECILIA BARTOLI ''Steffani's star isn't in the ascendant,'' says the heroine (a musicologist!) of the Venice-based mystery writer Donna Leon's novel ''The Jewels of Paradise,'' to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press in October. Well, the star of Agostino Steffani -- ''composer and bishop, musician and diplomat,'' in Ms. Leon's words -- may soon rise, at least by a blip. As EMI Classics tries to ride the coattails of E.L. James's steamy potboiler ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' with an album of works mentioned in the book (there will be no quotations from that book here, nor any endorsement of that recording), Decca takes a more imaginative approach to a publishing tie-in with Ms. Bartoli's latest project, ''Mission,'' a two-disc set of arias and other works by Steffani. Ms. Leon and Ms. Bartoli are said to be friends, and they evidently shared scholarly groundwork in conjuring Steffani's personage and reviving his music. Ms. Leon's protagonist, hired to sort through newly discovered documents left behind by Steffani, recalls tunes of his that she has heard: ''What was that heartbreaking lament, something about 'Dal mio petto'?'' And Ms. Bartoli sings a good many of them, including that one, from the opera ''Niobe.'' As with her previous album ''Sacrificium: The Art of the Castrati,'' Ms. Bartoli strikes an androgynous pose, this time as a bald-pated, crucifix-clutching (and per Ms. Leon, castrated?) Steffani for the cover art. Oct. 2. Decca. (J.R.O.)
CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA This year the great Chicagoans fill the coveted spot opening the Carnegie Hall season. It is the start of the orchestra's third year under the music director Riccardo Muti, who has had the ensemble playing with characteristic sheen and power through the eclectic programs he favors. The three-night stand at Carnegie veers from Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' on opening night -- no one is better than Mr. Muti at ratcheting up the drama in vocal and choral works -- to music of Wagner, Franck, Dvorak, Martucci, Respighi and the young composer-D.J. Mason Bates. Oct 3-5. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
TWOSENSE All-stars from the All-Stars. The brilliant and searching Lisa Moore was the founding pianist of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, a position she held until 2008, and Ashley Bathgate is the group's current cellist. The two came together in 2010 as a commissioning and performing duo devoted to pairing new works and the classics. This program features premieres by Ryan Brown, Daniel Felsenfeld and Hannah Lash. Oct. 4. Roulette, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org. (Z.W.)
EMANUEL AX As artist in residence with the New York Philharmonic this season, the beloved pianist makes a move many of us have long been waiting for, taking up music of Bach in concert: here, the Keyboard Concerto in D minor (BWV 1052). In addition, he shows his marvelous versatility by working on an opposite fringe of the standard repertory, with Schoenberg's Piano Concerto. Alan Gilbert conducts the program, which also includes Mozart's ''Linz'' Sympony. Oct. 4-6. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
MINSOO SOHN The Honens International Piano Competition in Calgary, Alberta, which has developed a better track record than most, has been trying to beef up its international presence in recent years. In April, it held quarterfinals in New York for this year's competition, which concludes in Calgary in October. It has also started a record label to feature its winners, and Mr. Sohn, the 2006 prize laureate, made a big impression with a release of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations,'' which he now brings to New York along with variations by Brahms and Webern. Page 35. Oct 6. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
'LA FINTA GIARDINIERA' René Jacobs's recordings of Mozart's operas bring back some of the thrill that must have attended these works when they were new; his ''Nozze di Figaro,'' in particular, truly does make you hear that work as if for the first time. (Who knew that that critical commonplace could ever be deserved?) ''La Finta Giardiniera,'' one of Mozart's earliest operas, has long hovered in semiobscurity -- not a true rarity but not often performed, either -- despite its gorgeous music and acute libretto. Mr. Jacobs and the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra are sure to locate both its uproarious farce and its core of melancholy. The only downside of a new installment in the series is that it gets that much closer to coming to an end. Oct. 9. Harmonia Mundi. (Z.W.)
GREAT MUSIC IN A GREAT SPACE The conductor and organist Kent Tritle, best known for Sacred Music in a Sacred Space, the acclaimed, longstanding series he founded at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, revived a similarly named series presented in earlier years at St. John the Divine, when he moved there during the last season. Here he conducts the Cathedral Choir and Orchestra in Bach's certifiably great Mass in B minor. Oct. 10. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, (866) 811-4111, stjohndivine.org. (J.R.O)
RENÉE ANNE LOUPRETTE This excellent organist, who like Kent Tritle left her position at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola and is now at Trinity Wall Street, inaugurates another new feature in Trinity's suddenly resurgent music program: Pipes at One, a series of 40-minute midday organ recitals (by her and others) on the beautifully restored Schlicker organ at St. Paul's Chapel. No repertory has been announced yet; trust Ms. Louprette to make it worth your while. Oct. 10. (J.R.O.)
'MOBY-DICK' The first products of the David Gockley leadership at the San Francisco Opera, which began in 2006, showed little of the enterprise that characterized Mr. Gockley's 33 years at the Houston Grand Opera. But this season represents something of a breakthrough for Mr. Gockley and the company. Jake Heggie's adaptation of ''Moby-Dick,'' Herman Melville's masterpiece, had its premiere at the Dallas Opera in 2010 and is the first of three operas by living American composers being presented. (Nolan Gasser's family-friendly ''Secret Garden'' has its premiere on March 1, and Mark Adamo's ''Gospel of Mary Magdalene'' opens on June 19.) These are not the most adventurous composers working in opera today, but taken together their works add up to a considerable and refreshing commitment to the art form's present and future. Opens Oct. 10. War Memorial Opera House, (413) 864-3330, sfopera.com. (Z.W.)
NIELSEN PROJECT One of Alan Gilbert's marquee initiatives as he gets deeper into his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic is a series of concerts and recordings over a number of years exploring the six symphonies and three concertos of the underappreciated Danish composer Carl Nielsen. Having spent time with some of the symphonies, Mr. Gilbert turns his attention this season to the concertos for flute (with the orchestra's principal, Robert Langevin) and violin (with the guest soloist Nikolaj Znaider) in a program with Tchaikovsky's grand Second Symphony, the ''Little Russian.'' Oct. 10-13. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA Some of us recall the founding of this conductorless ensemble as if it were yesterday and still sort of wonder (despite the continuing success of the 62-year-old Prague Chamber Orchestra, among other conductor-free groups) whether the noble experiment will succeed. Well don't look now, but Orpheus, having recorded more than 70 albums, celebrates its 40th anniversary this season. Evidently it is here to stay. Its first program offers Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' Overture; ''Earth Echoes,'' a song cycle by Augusta Read Thomas, sung by the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke and the baritone Nathan Gunn; and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, which the orchestra has performed numerous ... er, never. It's a great piece, Orpheus; you'll love it. Carnegie Hall. Oct. 11. (J.R.O.)
'WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE' There will be a bittersweet quality to this new production of Oliver Knussen's captivating opera based on the beloved, bracing children's book by Maurice Sendak, who died in May. Brilliantly juxtaposed with Ravel's ''Mother Goose,'' it is being presented as part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's sweeping commitment to new and recent opera under its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, who conducts a cast that includes Claire Booth and Susan Bickley. The production is by the British director and video artist Netia Jones, who will conjure up animations based on Sendak's classic illustrations. (Ms. Jones is well practiced in Mr. Knussen's take on Sendak, having created a version of the operatic ''Higglety Pigglety Pop'' this summer at the Tanglewood Festival in Massachusetts.) Oct. 11-14. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com. (Z.W.)
YANNICK NÉZET-SÉGUIN Finally! Four years after the departure of Christoph Eschenbach as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and two years after it was announced that Mr. Nézet-Séguin (whom, for obvious reasons, the orchestra has been marketing on a first-name basis) would succeed him, the once fabulous Philadelphians again have a music director. Happily, they had expert musical guidance in the interim from an eminently capable and devoted principal conductor, Charles Dutoit, who maintained a high level of artistic achievement as administrative chaos swirled around him. (That included a period without music director, executive director or board chairman, and a 2011 filing for bankruptcy protection, from which the orchestra emerged in late July.) The delay, it turns out, had a good, or at least opportune, side, allowing the orchestra now to cloak Mr. Nézet-Séguin in the mantle of messiah, since it was just 100 years ago that Leopold Stokowski, who had a huge formative influence on the orchestra, arrived. Let the comparisons begin, in a gala concert featuring the soprano Renée Fleming and anchored by Brahms's Fourth Symphony. Oct. 18. Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org. (J.R.O.)
MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA It has been a tough time financially for American orchestras, and several of them had yet to negotiate new contracts with the players by press time (others including the Cleveland Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra). In addition, the Minnesota Orchestra faces a season of wandering as its Orchestra Hall is being renovated. (New Yorkers can only envy the resolve: what would a year or two of imaginative wandering by the Philharmonic matter if we could solve the Avery Fisher Hall Problem once and for all?) Osmo Vanska has worked artistic wonders as the orchestra's music director, and he can probably be counted on to steer it through these extracurricular shoals as well. He opens the season with a program of Elgar, Rachmaninoff (Piano Concerto No. 3, with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist) and Respighi at the orchestra's temporary home. Oct. 18-20. Auditorium at the Convention Center, Minnesota, (612) 371-5656, minnesotaorchestra.org. (J.R.O.)
WORLD ORCHESTRA FOR PEACE This international assemblage of star players, founded in 1995 by the conductor Georg Solti and conducted here by Valery Gergiev, who is widely active in New York over the next two weeks, celebrates the Solti centennial. The program includes excerpts of operas by Mozart and Verdi, with the soprano Angela Gheorghiu and the bass René Pape, Strauss's ''Don Juan'' and Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra (which Solti conducted with a particular, Hungarian flair). Oct. 19. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
LES ARTS FLORISSANTS Before this peerless Baroque-music ensemble and its director, William Christie, bring their production of Marc-Antoine Charpentier's ''David et Jonathas'' to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in mid-April, they offer a teaser of sorts with rare performances of three of Charpentier's impassioned sacred motets. A week later members of the group join the terrific student ensemble Juilliard415 for Handel's glorious oratorio ''Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno'' (''The Triumph of Time and Truth''). Alice Tully Hall. Oct. 19, 27. (Z.W.)
'GLASS AT 75' As we said, no end of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' this season: here the four-hand piano version, played by Maki Namekawa and Dennis Russell Davies, and given historical context between works by Debussy -- ''En Blanc et Noir,'' actually composed two years after ''The Rite,'' in 1915 -- and Philip Glass, the ostensible subject of the program. Oct. 21. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, (212) 685-0008, ext. 560, themorgan.org. (J.R.O.)
NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG Celebrating its 25th anniversary, this worthy enterprise opens its season with a program timed with an eye toward the election, ''Mr. Gershwin Goes to Washington.'' It's actually Mr. Gershwins, plural: an evening of satire drawn from George and Ira Gershwin's songs about politics, directed and adapted by Laurence Maslon. The featured artists are the sopranos Anne-Carolyn Bird and Lauren Worsham and the pianists Steven Blier, the festival's artistic director, and Joseph Thalken. A tease in the season announcement promises that ''a distinguished member of the political news media will be the surprise guest narrator.'' We're all a-twit. (And so as not to spoil the surprise when the program itself goes to Washington a couple of days later, the narrator there will be different.) Oct. 20. Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan. Oct. 22. Terrace Theater, Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, (212) 501-3330, nyfos.org. (J.R.O.)
LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Here is Valery Gergiev again, with one of his own orchestras. The London Symphony is making much of the the 100th anniversary of its first North American appearance, claiming that it was ''the first European orchestra to visit the United States and Canada.'' (It was originally booked for the fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic, whose delay forced the players to board a smaller ship; they were already in St. Louis when they learned of the disaster.) Not that the programming particularly reflects the occasion. It is all Brahms: the Symphonies Nos. 2 and 4, the Violin Concerto (with James Ehnes as soloist), the Piano Concerto No. 1 (with Denis Matsuev) and the ''Tragic Overture.'' It might all seem more special if Kurt Masur were not scheduled to conduct two weeks of Brahms (Symphonies Nos. 2-4, Double Concerto) with the New York Philharmonic in the same hall in early November. (Whether an increasingly frail Mr. Masur can endure all of that is another matter.) Oct. 22, 24. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'THE TEMPEST' New York is kept mostly up-to-date with the orchestral and solo piano music of the mercurial English composer Thomas Adès, but his masterly 2004 Shakespeare adaptation, one of the most praised operas of the 21st century, is just now receiving its New York premiere. It is one of the vanishingly few contemporary operas to receive the Metropolitan Opera's imprimatur, and the company is giving it a brilliant, mostly young cast. Mr. Adès conducts. The only element to give pause is the director, Robert Lepage, whose production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle was roundly dismissed by critics. Whether he can return to his roots as a darling of the theatrical avant-garde may be the biggest question of the Met season. Page 33. Opens Oct. 23. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA The brilliant young conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin has so far been best known in New York for his opera performances: memorably galvanic takes on Bizet's ''Carmen'' and Gounod's ''Faust'' at the Metropolitan Opera. For his first Carnegie Hall appearance as music director of the marvelous Philadelphians, he works to his dramatic strengths, offering Verdi's operatic-scale, hellfire-breathing Requiem, with the orchestra joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir. The soloists are the only real difficulty, since two of the four -- the febrile soprano Marina Poplavskaya and the often ailing tenor Rolando Villazón -- have a way of polarizing opera fans. But this is Mr. Nézet-Séguin's chance to shine and, perhaps, to fuel speculation that he eventually may be a candidate to replace James Levine as the Met's music director. Oct. 23. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
WHITE LIGHT FESTIVAL When this festival began in 2010 as an exploration of transcendence, it seemed more a personal statement by its creator, Jane Moss, the artistic director of Lincoln Center, than any particular sign of the times. But with themes of spirituality having recently taken hold at festivals in Salzburg, Austria, and Lucerne, Switzerland, and elsewhere, Ms. Moss seems to have caught the beginnings of an international wave, to whatever extent she did not herself set it in motion. The festival opens with a free program, ''Without Shadows,'' featuring Kiran Ahluwalia, a Punjabi vocalist, with Indian percussion and contemporary instruments. Oct. 23. David Rubinstein Atrium. (J.R.O.)
ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Flexibility is a rare commodity in the programming of major orchestras and concert halls, especially when international appearances are involved. Planning is done far in advance, and there are too many moving parts to allow much change. But the Israel Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta, its music director for life, who made a strong showing in the Salzburg Festival's Spiritual Overture in July with two programs based mostly in Judaism, decided to build quickly on that success. They set aside the big pieces originally scheduled for this appearance (Hindemith's ''Mathis der Maler'' and Brahms's First Symphony) and replaced them with works from their first festival concert: Schoenberg's ''Kol Nidre'' and Noam Sheriff's ''Mechaye Hametim'' (''Revival of the Dead''), a Holocaust remembrance. Both are choral works, and the switch was doable because the chorus used in Salzburg was the Collegiate Chorale of New York, and the baritone Thomas Hampson was available (or made himself available) to reprise his roles. The flexibility could not be complete, since the orchestra had a commitment to another soloist, the young pianist Yuja Wang, and few will object to hearing her perform Mendelssohn's First Piano Concerto. But the cost is Mr. Hampson's searing interpretation of Mahler's ''Kindertotenlieder'' (''Songs on the Death of Children''), which, though composed as a personal statement 40 years before the Holocaust, made for a better thematic fit. Oct. 25. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
GABRIEL KAHANE An emblem of a generation of composers who work eagerly and beautifully in multiple genres, Mr. Kahane is a noted composer of pop music, concert works and musical theater. (His ''February House'' recently completed a run at the Public Theater.) In ''Don't Even Listen'' he is joined by the vocalist Shara Worden and the young string quartet Brooklyn Rider for a program that encompasses works old and new, including a premiere (''The Fiction Issue'') and songs by Cee Lo Green, Schubert, Schumann, Sufjan Stevens and Mr. Kahane himself. Oct. 25. Zankel Hall. (Z.W.)
'OUT COLD'/'ZIPPO SONGS' Bigger, in the arts, is not lately better. With more and more music, dance and theater conceived on a chamber scale, it is only natural to want smaller spaces for them. This season the Brooklyn Academy of Music unveils its new Richard B. Fisher Building, designed for performances more intimate than those in its older theaters. One of the early offerings is this program of two song cycles by Phil Kline, best known for his widely performed, ambulatory piece for the winter holidays, ''Unsilent Night,'' in which both audience and recorded sound source travel around. ''Zippo Songs'' (2003), with texts from lines inscribed on the sides of Zippo lighters by American G.I.'s in Vietnam, will be heard in a new arrangement for string quintet, piano and percussion, and the new ''Out Cold'' has Schubert's ''Winterreise'' meet some of Frank Sinatra's wintriest recordings for a reflection on introversion and isolation. The longtime Kline collaborator Theo Bleckmann sings alongside the well-regarded American Contemporary Music Ensemble in stagings directed by Emma Griffin. Oct. 25-27. BAM Fisher. (Z.W.)
BRITTEN CENTENNIAL Few enjoy the rote attention that composers tend to get paid in major anniversary years, but the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center seems sincere in its season-long tribute to Benjamin Britten, who was born a century ago, in 1913, and whose chamber music is among the most distinguished parts of his wide-ranging output. In three fascinating programs the Escher String Quartet juxtaposes Britten's quartets with a variety of repertory: first with the Baroque and Beethoven, then with fellow British composers and finally with other quartets composed during and after World War II. A final concert featuring various artists offers a rich selection of Britten's music, including the adorable ''Insect Pieces'' for oboe and piano; the sublime mini-opera canticle ''Abraham and Isaac,'' featuring the countertenor Daniel Taylor and the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey; and the eloquent Cello Sonata, with David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, the society's artistic directors. There are few gifts to the city this year as sweet as the immersion in this music that the society is offering. Oct. 25, Feb. 28, May 2. Rose Studio. May 10. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The Philadelphia Orchestra is not the only ensemble celebrating a Stokowski legacy this season. The maestro founded the American Symphony to perform at Carnegie Hall in 1962, after the New York Philharmonic had decamped for Lincoln Center. Now the American Symphony, which returned to Carnegie after a long absence in 2010, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with an outsize concert conducted by its music director of the last two decades, the intrepid Leon Botstein. It opens with the first work Stokowski performed with the ensemble, his own arrangement of ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' and also includes Ives's Fourth Symphony, whose premiere Stokowski and the orchestra presented in 1965, 11 years after Ives's death. The program, also featuring the Collegiate Chorale, is filled out with Mahler's gargantuan ''Symphony of a Thousand,'' typically given as a concert in itself. True the symphonies add up to only 90 minutes in time, but in weight? For this concert, ticket prices are being rolled back to 1962 levels, from $1.50 to $7, and no question, it's a lot of bang for your buck-fifty. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
MARLIS PETERSEN For her New York recital debut this coolly intelligent soprano, best known to New York audiences for stepping in for Natalie Dessay in a new production of Ambroise Thomas's ''Hamlet'' in 2010, brings a program focused on Goethe's concept of the eternal feminine. The music ranges from the core of classic lieder -- Beethoven, Schubert, Wolf, Schumann -- to 20th-century masters like Hanns Eisler and Walter Braunfels. She is joined by the pianist Jendrik Springer. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
DJ SPOOKY And here is the personification of the new concert programming at the Metropolitan Museum: Paul D. Miller, a k a DJ Spooky, That Subliminal Kid, an artist in residence for the season. Here he presents a screening of the 1956 film ''Madame Freedom'' with a rescoring for string quartet. Page 33. Oct. 26. Metropolitan Museum. (J.R.O.)
ANDRAS SCHIFF With this pianist playing Bach, you almost needn't say more. Whereas other pianists perform Bach, some of them magnificently, Mr. Schiff seems to embody him, so thoroughly has he internalized the music and so freely does he let it unfold. Here, beginning a two-season comprehensive Bach Project in various New York halls, he plays ''The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Books 1 and 2. Page 35. 92nd Street Y. Oct. 27, Nov. 1. (J.R.O.)
ANGELA HEWITT Bachians may think they had died and gone to heaven. To tide them over between Mr. Schiff's ''Well-Tempered'' recitals, Ms. Hewitt, one of those pianists who perform Bach's music magnificently, offers the ''Goldberg'' Variations, and you can listen with beer in hand: in H.L. Mencken's words, Bach's ''natural solvent.'' Page 35. Oct. 28. Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lprnyc.com. (J.R.O.)
ELGAR, CARTER CELLO CONCERTOS Jacqueline du Pré's recording of the Elgar Cello Concerto with her husband, Daniel Barenboim, wasn't her best take on her signature work; that honor goes to the album she made with John Barbirolli. But her collaboration with Mr. Barenboim remains a potent mixture of the personal and the artistic. So it is major news indeed that Mr. Barenboim has now made another recording of the grand, lyrical work, 25 years after du Pré's untimely death, and with another female cellist: the richly gifted Alisa Weilerstein. The orchestra is the Dresden Staatskapelle, and the Elgar is intriguingly paired with another grand cello concerto, Elliott Carter's shivering, heaving, bursting addition to the repertory, from 2000. Oct. 30. Decca. (Z.W.)
MARIINSKY ORCHESTRA And here is Valery Gergiev again, with his other orchestra, fresh from presenting two concerts at the Carolina Performing Arts festival The Rite of Spring at 100, where they performed the title work. No Stravinsky here: Mr. Gergiev and his St. Petersburg troops offer a suite from Rodion Shchedrin's ''Little Humpbacked Horse,'' Shostakovich's Symphony No. 6 and Strauss's ''Heldenleben.'' Oct. 31. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
NOVEMBER
LIQUID MUSIC The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra -- assuming that the ensemble itself is still liquid by then, given reports of financial constraints and threats to its full-time status -- will offer a new series of six boundary-crossing programs, beginning, as the presidential election approaches, with the performance artist Laurie Anderson's politically tinged ''Dirtday!'' Other programs feature guest artists of many alt-classical stripes mingling with members of the orchestra at locations in St. Paul, mostly the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Center. Nov. 2-3. Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, (651) 291-1144. thespco.org/liquidmusic. (J.R.O.)
VOICES FROM LATIN AMERICA With Clive Gillinson as its executive and artistic director, Carnegie has made a specialty of organizing major citywide festivals, often on international themes. Here is another. The Carnegie performances open with an evening by the popular artist Gilberto Gil, one of the artistic advisers (along with Gustavo Dudamel, Osvaldo Golijov and Chucho Valdés). Strictly classical music will play a relatively small part in the festival (which runs through Dec. 11), aside from concerts by the New Juilliard Ensemble, the Ensemble ACJW and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela. Nov. 8. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' The director David Alden, whose politically charged, vividly theatrical productions have been praised and debated since the 1980s, worked briefly at the Met early in his career, refurbishing productions of Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and Berg's ''Wozzeck.'' But he makes his real company debut with this seething Verdi work about betrayal at a royal court. It was set to star the soprano Karita Mattila, but she pulled out in May, after deciding that the role no longer fitted her voice, and was replaced by Sondra Radvanovsky, a stalwart of the Met's Verdi wing. Marcelo Álvarez, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Kathleen Kim also star, and the cast is rounded out by the veteran Dolora Zajick as Ulrica. Fabio Luisi conducts. Opens Nov. 8. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
VOX FESTIVAL One of the New York City Opera's signature offerings, this laboratory for full-orchestra readings of excerpts from contemporary American operas has been constricted to just six works on a single day, but it continues nevertheless. Now presented in conjunction with the service organization Opera America, this season's festival will feature works by the downtown favorite John Zorn (a ''mystery play'' based on the life and work of Hildegard von Bingen), Moto Osada, Christopher Weiss, Evan Meier, James Stepleton (''The Awakening,'' based on the Kate Chopin novella) and Osnat Netzer. Nov. 8. N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, La Guardia Place at Washington Square South, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET Second to none in French repertory, this pianist -- long unfairly known more for his sartorial choices than for his musical ones -- gives a recital devoted to Debussy, who, though celebrating his 150th birthday, is largely ignored this year by New York's cultural institutions. Nov. 10. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA These days the orchestra tends to alternate in New York between making big statements -- as with its Bruckner symphonies at the Lincoln Center Festival last year and its concert performance of Strauss's opera ''Salome'' at Carnegie Hall in May -- and slipping in and out relatively modestly. Here it sets down on the way to one of its regular Miami residencies, with Franz Welser-Möst, its music director, conducting works by Beethoven (Symphony No. 4, ''Grosse Fuge''), Matthias Pintscher (''Chute d'Étoiles,'' in its New York premiere) and Scriabin (''Poem of Ecstasy''). Mr. Welser-Möst reserves his big New York statement this season for the Vienna Philhamonic's Carnegie weekend in March. Nov. 13. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
BERNARDA FINK For date night with a sophisticated singing fan, look no further: there are few artists more eloquent and elegant than this Argentine mezzo-soprano, who will sing some of Dvorak's ''Biblical Songs,'' which are included on her astonishingly lovely, spirited recent recording of that composer's songs and duets on Harmonia Mundi. The program, with Anthony Spiri as pianist, also includes Schumann's ''Lenau Lieder'' and songs by Mahler. Nov. 14. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
'LA CLEMENZA DI TITO' The conductor Harry Bicket, a Baroque specialist, has been responsible for some of the most scintillating and lively Met performances in recent seasons. After leading a run of this long-underrated Mozart opera in 2008, he returns to it now with an even better cast: Lucy Crowe, Barbara Frittoli, Elina Garanca, Kate Lindsey and Giuseppe Filianoti. Opens Nov. 16. Metropolitan Opera. (Z.W.)
ORCHESTRA RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE John Eliot Gardiner made a big impression with his crack period-instrument orchestra in four symphonies of Beethoven last season at Carnegie. All you need to know now is that his Monteverdi Choir is sure to be just as fine, and that's a good thing, since Mr. Gardiner is reaching for the sky with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony one night and his ''Missa Solemnis'' the next. Not to be missed. Nov. 16-17. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
JOYCE DIDONATO This assured and radiantly good-natured American mezzo-soprano will take on the title role of Donizetti's ''Maria Stuarda'' at the Met on New Year's Eve. But before that bel canto milestone she ventures earlier in a Baroque program called ''Drama Queens'' (also the title of her new recording), which includes tours de force by Handel, Monteverdi, Gluck, Hasse and others, with Alan Curtis leading Il Complesso Barocco. Nov. 18. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA In 2009 Esa-Pekka Salonen ended his transformative run as the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic to, he said, concentrate on composing. But thankfully for audiences, he has not abandoned conducting at all; he even took over the helm of this great ensemble, which arrives at Lincoln Center for two nights: first Mahler's Ninth Symphony and then, even more exciting, a concert performance of Berg's opera ''Wozzeck,'' with luxury casting: the baritone Simon Keenlyside and the soprano Angela Denoke. If anyone can find the sensuality and drama of Berg's pathbreaking score, it is Mr. Salonen. Nov. 18-19. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY To celebrate its 50th anniversary, this worthy ensemble does not diverge from its time-tested formula of offering Carnegie Hall exposure to gifted young performers, conductors and composers. For the anniversary -- also the hall debut of its new music director, Joshua Gersen -- the orchestra will play works by Shostakovich and Ludwig Wilhelm Maurer, Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony and a premiere by Gabriel Zucker. Nov. 25. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'THE PEONY PAVILION' The latest changes in the Met Museum's concert programming stem largely from a desire to tie it more closely to exhibitions, as with this staging of the 16th-century Chinese opera, presented in connection with the exhibition ''Chinese Gardens: Palace Pavilions, Scholars' Studios, Rustic Retreats.'' Conceived for presentation in a garden in Shanghai, the production will be staged in the small Astor Court and relayed live from there in high definition to the overflow audience in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. Tan Dun, the director, has shaved some 18 hours off the opera -- as presented in all its glory in the stunning production by Chen Shi-Zheng at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1999, and elsewhere in the years following -- bringing it down to a mere 70 minutes, while presumably retaining a goodly measure of that glory. Metropolitan Museum. Nov. 30. (J.R.O.)
DECEMBER
OLGA NEUWIRTH This Austrian composer may be part of Melissa Smey's campaign to bring more women into the fold of the Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series, as here. Ms. Neuwirth can do big and brash and bold with the best of them. Page 35. Dec. 6. Miller Theater. (J.R.O.)
SIMÓN BOLÍVAR ORCHESTRA OF VENEZUELA El Sistema, Venezuela's storied music education system, has many success stories but none quite as astonishing as that of the conductor Gustavo Dudamel, who rocketed through the program to stardom and the music directorship of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He has brought to prominence with him the youthful Bolívar ensemble, whose two-night stand is part of Carnegie Hall's Voices of Latin America festival. The repertory, including works by composers like Silvestre Revueltas, Esteban Benzecry and Heitor Villa-Lobos, is almost never done here, and it is sure to be galvanizing: few conductors draw visceral excitement out of an orchestra -- especially these young charges -- the way Mr. Dudamel does. Dec. 10-11. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'MESSIAH' There are so many excellent New York performances of this great Handel oratorio at Christmastime that it is impossible to predict which will be best over all, whatever that may mean. But John Scott's is sure to rank high among the contenders, and it is typically the most lovable, with the superbly trained St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys holding forth in festive red cassocks before the church's intricately sculptured altarpiece. (The ailing pipe organ is another story, with pleas for contributions sure to be stuffed into the program.) James Richman's Concert Royal, on period instruments, fills out a sound worthy of the magnificent space. Dec. 11, 13. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org. (In other notable performances of ''Messiah,'' Julian Wachner conducts the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at Trinity Church on Dec. 9 and at Alice Tully Hall on Dec. 12; Kent Tritle conducts the amateur Oratorio Society of New York at Carnegie Hall on Dec. 17 and the professional Musica Sacra, also at Carnegie, on Dec. 20 and 22; and Emmanuelle Haïm conducts the New York Choral Artists and the New York Philharmonic from Dec. 18 to Dec. 22.) (J.R.O.)
'LES TROYENS' James Levine, the Met's ailing music director, has long been a champion of Berlioz's sprawling, shining masterpiece, so his absence from the podium for this revival of Francesca Zambello's production is particularly painful. Fabio Luisi will replace him, leading a cast that includes the deeply sympathetic mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the spurned queen Dido, the tenor Marcello Giordani in the high-reaching role of Aeneas and Deborah Voigt, fresh from trying out the epic Brünnhilde in Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, as the desperate prophetess Cassandra. But one of the vocal pleasures may be in a minor role: the excellent bass Kwangchul Youn as Narbal. Opens Dec. 13. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'CHRISTMAS ORATORIO' Here, in Bach's six-pack of Christmas cantatas, is a welcome change of pace from Philippe Herreweghe and his Collegium Vocale Gent Choir and Orchestra, whom we are used to hearing in Bach's somber Passions (no bad thing, to be sure). It should be entertaining as well as uplifting to catch them in a jubilant mood. Dec. 15. Alice Tully Hall. (In another notable performance of Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio,'' as part of Trinity Wall Street's 12th Night Festival, Julian Wachner and the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra, who last season presented each of the six component cantatas on the appropriate day of the liturgical calendar, will this year divide them differently, with midday performances of Nos. 1 and 2 on Jan. 3, and Nos. 3 and 4 on Jan. 4, all at St. Paul's Chapel; and Nos. 5 and 6 on Jan. 5, at Trinity Church.) (J.R.O.)
'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' The Met, of late, has offered tightened versions of certain productions as family-friendly entertainments for the holiday season, and Bartlett Sher's antic version of Rossini's classic is an ideal choice. The company has not stinted on this year's cast, which features the charming up-and-coming stars Isabel Leonard, Alek Shrader, Rodion Pogossov and Jordan Bisch. The conductor Yves Abel's work at the house has always had stylish spirit. Opens Dec. 18. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
CONTACT! Last year's installment of the New York Philharmonic's series of new and recent music felt staler than in the past, but this concert is a return to form, with premieres of works by Andy Akiho and Jude Vaclavik as well as the first New York performances of ''Try,'' by the noted young composer Andrew Norman, and Jacob Druckman's ''Counterpoise.'' Jayce Ogren, well practiced in contemporary music, conducts, and the vocal soloist is the brilliant soprano Elizabeth Futral. Dec. 21. Metropolitan Museum. Dec. 22. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS Delightful pluck! On the day a Mayan text projects as the ''end date'' of the Mayan calendar (whatever that may mean for the world at large), Harold Rosenbaum, his excellent professional choir and the Orchestra of St. Luke's propose to pick up the pieces with a performance of Haydn's great oratorio ''The Creation.'' Haydn's resounding C major burst of light can undoubtedly be counted on to set the cosmos aright once again. Dec. 21. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'MARIA STUARDA' Another New Year's Eve, another starring role for the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato at the Met. Last year Ms. DiDonato led a sterling cast in the Baroque pastiche ''The Enchanted Island.'' Now she takes on the diva role of the embittered Mary Stuart in Donizetti's riveting melodrama, part of that composer's trilogy of operas based, however loosely, on the lives of Tudor queens. The Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, had originally intended for all three of the operas to be directed by David McVicar and to star the soprano Anna Netrebko; Mr. McVicar is still on for ''Maria Stuarda'' and the third, ''Roberto Devereux,'' next season, but Ms. Netrebko decided that ''Anna Bolena'' was it for her, clearing the way for Ms. DiDonato. She will be joined by a cast of rising stars: Elza van den Heever (as Mary's rival, Elizabeth), Francesco Meli, Joshua Hopkins and Matthew Rose. Maurizio Benini conducts. Opens Dec. 31. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
JANUARY
GREEN MOUNTAIN PROJECT The soprano Jolle Greenleaf and the violinist and conductor Scott Metcalfe have made Monteverdi a welcome fixture of the new year in New York. In 2010 and 2011, they presented the towering 1610 Vespers, and this year they produced a 1640 Vespers, something of a pastiche. Now it is back to 1610 and back to the church where it all began. A happy new year indeed. Jan. 2-3. Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (646) 470-5809, tenetnyc.com. (J.R.O.)
PROTOTYPE: OPERA/THEATER/NOW Though New York City Opera's Vox Festival will continue this year, albeit curtailed in size and scope, as a laboratory for new operas, this new festival aims to add to the city's range of performances of contemporary work. Organized by Here Arts Center in SoHo and Beth Morrison, an adventurous arts presenter, the two weeks will feature a commissioned premiere -- ''Sumeida's Song,'' by the rising young composer Mohammed Fairouz -- as well as David T. Little's ''Soldier Songs,'' directed by Yuval Sharon, and other readings, presentations, concerts and panels. Jan. 9-19. Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, (212) 352-3101, prototypefestival.org. (Z.W.)
BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA There are few better marriages of conductor and orchestra than Ivan Fischer and his alert, exciting ensemble. Frequent guests of Lincoln Center, they come this year with a varied program: Shostakovich's ''Suite for Variety Orchestra,'' Bernstein's ''Serenade'' (based on Plato's ''Symposium'' and featuring the violinist Janine Jansen) and Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2. Jan. 20. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
'DOUBT' Reeling from the recession, opera companies across America are playing it safe. But the Minnesota Opera -- which has, in Minneapolis and St. Paul, communities used to adventurous culture -- continues to program new work and thoughtful, theatrical productions of the classics. Next year brings this major commission composed by Douglas J. Cuomo, with a libretto by John Patrick Shanley, based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The cast features the huge-voiced soprano Christine Brewer, in one of her too-rare operatic turns, as well as Denyce Graves, Matthew Worth and Adriana Zabala. Christopher Franklin conducts, and Kevin Newbury directs. Opens Jan. 26. Minnesota Opera, Ordway, St. Paul, (612) 333-6669, mnopera.org. (Z.W.)
'RIGOLETTO' This one might cause a ruckus. For his Metropolitan Opera debut, the director Michael Mayer (Broadway's ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' and ''Spring Awakening'') places Verdi's great opera in Rat Pack-era Las Vegas, with a set by Christine Jones and the Duke cast as a sleazy Sinatra-type entertainer. Met audiences have tended to be doubtful about such updatings, but the previous production, from 1989, never inspired much affection, and if anyone can sell a difficult concept it is the excellent opening-night cast: the soprano Diana Damrau, the tenor Piotr Beczala and the baritone Zeljko Lucic. (Lisette Oropesa, Vittorio Grigolo and George Gagnidze take over later in the run.) Opens Jan. 28. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
MARC-ANDRÉ HAMELIN Everything this pianist plays, he plays well. And it's a good thing, since he plays almost everything. He began his career exploring the virtuosic fringes of the repertory and has gradually moved toward the center. His program here ranges from Bach to Mr. Hamelin's own Variations on a Theme by Paganini (in its New York premiere) and also includes works by Debussy, Rachmaninoff and Busoni. Jan. 30. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
WEST-EASTERN DIVAN ORCHESTRA Daniel Barenboim performing Beethoven at Carnegie is nothing new. But this time he brings his orchestra of young Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs to play all the symphonies. There is little in the sound of their recently released recordings of the works that would make you sense either youth or diversity. Seeing them in action should be a different matter, Jan. 30-31, Feb 2-3, Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
OPERA LAFAYETTE Sometimes this intrepid company's wanderings through the thickets of the French operatic repertory can yield great pleasures, and sometimes they remind you that there are reasons obscurities are obscure. Ah, but life's a crap shoot like that. Will ''Lalla Roukh,'' an Orientalist fantasia by Félicien David that wowed the Opéra Comique in 1862, hold up today as any more than a curiosity? We shall see. In any case, Ryan Brown's conducting is always spirited, and the production, by Bernard Deletré, incorporates the acclaimed Indian-dance troupe Kalanidhi Dance. Jan. 31. Rose Theater. (Z.W.)
FEBRUARY
OSVALDO GOLIJOV Mr. Golijov is Carnegie Hall's composer in residence this season, and a concert in its Making Music series, which offers commentary from composers as well as their music, could offer fascinating insights if the right questions are asked and answered. It is a chance to explore the methodology of a composer whose acquisitive methods have recently been called into question, to the point that some have accused him of plagiarism. The program, performed by the St. Lawrence String Quartet, the Zankel Band and others, includes the New York premiere of Mr. Golijov's ''Qohelet'' (more widely known under the spelling ''Koholet''), a Carnegie co-commission and one of the works that was challenged. Mr. Golijov altered it as a result. So what is the whole story? Feb. 4. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S It was a significant coup for this ensemble, excellent though it is, to secure the fast-rising Pablo Heras-Casado as its new principal conductor. He leads the orchestra for the first time at Carnegie Hall since his appointment in a program of the central repertory: Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture, Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 (with Christian Zacharias as soloist), Hans Zender's orchestrations of five Debussy preludes and the lighter, leaner 1841 version of Schumann's Fourth Symphony. All these are distant from the Baroque and new music in which Mr. Heras-Casado has long specialized. The orchestra has bet that his charisma and energy will outweigh his relative inexperience; it may be good for both him and the band that he will get to work with these fine players to refine his interpretations of the standards. Feb. 7. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA Mariss Jansons -- the principal conductor of both this ensemble and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and thus a regular commuter between Amsterdam and Munich -- turns 70 in January and seems to have emerged from several health crises of recent decades in fine fettle. Oh, he may still suffer from jet lag, but he certainly doesn't seem fazed. He takes the Bavarians to Tokyo to perform all the Beethoven symphonies in late November. Here he presents good variety in programs well gauged to show off this great orchestra's and Mr. Jansons's own versatility: in one, Bartok's Second Violin Concerto, with Leonidas Kavakos as soloist, and Mahler's First Symphony; in the other, Strauss's ''Death and Transfiguration'' (Mr. Jansons may feel that he has lived it) and Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. Feb. 13-14. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'PARSIFAL' Appearing a bit earlier than its traditional place around the Easter season, Wagner's final and perhaps deepest music drama arrives in New York in a new production by François Girard after a practice run at the Lyon Opera, where its scenic requirements -- a stage-filling sea of blood, for one thing -- strained the company's technical capabilities to the breaking point. Presumably those challenges will be a walk in the park for a Met recently tested by the mechanical headaches of Robert Lepage's Wagner ''Ring'' cycle. And blood aside, the house is fielding a remarkably strong cast: Jonas Kaufmann, seemingly born for the title role, as well as Katarina Dalayman, Peter Mattei, René Pape and Evgeny Nikitin, making his first New York appearance since his withdrawal from the Bayreuth Festival after the bizarre discovery that one of his tattoos resembled, at one point, a swastika. Daniele Gatti's deliberate, expansive take on the opera has polarized audiences in the past, but a little more time spent with singers of this quality wouldn't be too bad a fate. Opens Feb. 15. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'POWDER HER FACE' It's a sign of the composer Thomas Adès's rise to the top of his field that both his operas are being performed in New York this season. The Met's production of his sweeping version of ''The Tempest,'' opening in October, will doubtless grab more attention, but the chamber work ''Powder Her Face,'' about a 1960s sex scandal involving the Duchess of Argyll, has raunchily intimate charm. It's an opera that in content and scale wouldn't make much sense at the Met, so it's an ideal opening act for a New York City Opera, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two of its four productions, that is trying to define itself artistically after a listless last season. Jay Scheib directs; Jonathan Stockhammer, a specialist in contemporary opera, conducts. Opens Feb. 15. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. (Z.W.)
'DON CARLO' When Lorin Maazel returned to the Met podium for a run of Wagner's ''Walküre'' in 2008 it was the first time he had conducted at the company since the early 1960s. It's a far smaller gap this time, as he leads Verdi's dark masterpiece and an experienced cast that includes Barbara Frittoli, Anna Smirnova, Ramón Vargas, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Eric Halfvarson and Ferruccio Furlanetto, who scored a personal coup as Philip II when Nicholas Hytner's production was new in 2010. Opens Feb. 22. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'RADAMISTO' Harry Bicket has that rarest and best of gifts for an early-music specialist: the ability to make regular opera orchestras play with the snap of a period-instrument band. But there is still something special that happens when he leads his own English Concert, which will be joined for one of Handel's lesser-known masterworks by a fine cast that includes the veteran countertenor David Daniels, Brenda Rae, Patricia Bardon, Joélle Harvey and Luca Pisaroni. It is the first in a series of concert performances of Baroque operas at the hall by Mr. Bicket and the ensemble in coming seasons, so there's much to look forward to. Feb. 24. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'THE TURN OF THE SCREW' The New York City Opera finally has the right idea. This beleaguered company has learned that it's a losing battle to go head to head with the Met in terms of repertory and production style, and smarter to compete with the city's smaller, more nimble companies. To that end, it is opening its season with two intimate-scale operas that would have been naturals from, say, Gotham Chamber Opera: Thomas Adès's ''Powder Her Face'' and this intensely creepy work by Britten, both performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The conductor is the versatile Jayce Ogren; the director is Sam Buntrock, whose Broadway production of ''Sunday in the Park With George'' used lighting and projections with fluid ease. The cast had not been announced at press time. Opens Feb. 24. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. (Z.W.)
MARCH
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Happiness is conducting two of the world's greatest orchestras at Carnegie Hall in one season. Franz Welser-Möst, having dropped in with his own Cleveland Orchestra in November, now leads an orchestra that -- though proudly independent -- is his in another sense, he being Austrian. The three programs include symphonies by Dvorak (No. 7), Schubert (No. 6) and Bruckner (No. 4); songs by Richard Strauss, sung by the tenor Herbert Lippert; Berg's Violin Concerto, played by Frank Peter Zimmermann; and a work by the contemporary German Jörg Widmann. March 1-3. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
JENNIFER KOH You may see Ms. Koh early in the season, since she is enacting the frizzy-haired, fiddle-playing title character of Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's ''Einstein on the Beach'' in some performances (Sept. 14-16) of the Brooklyn Academy production. Here, in the second installment of her three-part multiyear series Bach and Beyond, she occupies the stage alone and presumably without fright wig, playing solo violin works by Bartok and Phil Kline, in addition to Bach. (A recording of the first part is to be released in October by Cedille Records.) March 2. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
'FRANCESCA DA RIMINI' The Met reserves runs of Riccardo Zandonai's infectiously dramatic verismo rarity for divas it really believes in. It was last mounted in the 1980s for Renata Scotto, and this new revival is a major endorsement of the soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek, a favorite in London whose New York career is just getting started. (She also joins the Met Orchestra for Wagner's ''Wesendonck Lieder'' at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 14.) Her co-star, the tenor Marcello Giordani, is ardent but inconsistent, two adjectives that also apply to the conductor, Marco Armiliato. But when Ms. Westbroek is in her groove, she is as thrilling as large stretches of Zandonai's score. Opens March 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
THE BACH VARIATIONS The early-music specialist Masaaki Suzuki and his Bach Collegium Japan and Yale Schola Cantorum join the New York Philharmonic in opening its monthlong festival. The program is built on a lovely idea, juxtaposing works by Bach with near counterparts by his great revivalist, Mendelssohn. (From each comes a Magnificat in D.) March 6-9. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'LA PASIÓN SEGÚN SAN MARCOS' As a sort of belated appendage to its festival Voices From Latin America, Carnegie Hall devotes its choral institute this season to Osvaldo Golijov's magnum opus. In the culminating performance, Robert Spano conducts the Orquesta la Pasión, members of the Schola Cantorum de Venezuela and choruses from area high schools. March 10. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Lincoln Center's Great Performers series, having presented the London Symphony and the Philharmonia Orchestra in the fall, completes its minifestival of major London orchestras. Vladimir Jurowski, the orchestra's principal conductor, presents two programs: first Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1, with Vadim Repin as soloist, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 5; then Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4, with Hélène Grimaud as soloist, and Mahler's Symphony No. 5. March 10-11. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
MASS IN B MINOR Happily, major American orchestras have been rediscovering Bach and the Baroque, having largely conceded that repertory to early-music specialists for several decades. The New York Philharmonic had a leg up with Kurt Masur as its music director through the 1990s. Coming from a long tenure in Leipzig, Germany, where Bach spent his last 27 years, Mr. Masur brought Bach's major choral works to the orchestra with some regularity and in 1998 even imported the choir of St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, which Bach had directed, for a ''St. Matthew Passion.'' It is good to see Alan Gilbert pick up the mantle here as part of a major Philharmonic series, the Bach Variations, with the New York Choral Artists and stellar vocal soloists: Dorothea Röschmann, Anne Sofie von Otter, Steve Davislim and Eric Owens. March 13-16. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' This season Renée Fleming has a coveted Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, for which she has programmed two recitals, including a battle of the divas alongside the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, and a concert with the New York Philharmonic. But the centerpiece is a semistaged concert performance of this gauzily lyrical André Previn opera, with Blanche DuBois created as a vehicle for Ms. Fleming, first performed in 1998. The work hasn't been heard much since, though it is being revived on March 26 at Lyric Opera of Chicago, where Ms. Fleming is the creative consultant. The Carnegie performance, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's under Patrick Summers, is a test run of sorts for that Chicago stand, featuring the same excellent supporting cast: Susanna Phillips, Teddy Tahu Rhodes and Anthony Dean Griffey. March 14. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY After this gloriously adventurous ensemble's American Mavericks festival last year at Carnegie Hall, which featured work from some of the out-there corners of the repertory, it will be a fascinating shift to hear it in the standards, in which the orchestra and its music director, Michael Tilson Thomas, also shine. The first night's program pairs Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 (with the brilliant Yuja Wang as soloist) and Brahms's First Symphony with the New York premiere of a work by Samuel Carl Adams, and the second concert features the Ninth Symphony of Mahler, a Thomas favorite. March 20-21. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
CARTER BREY New York Philharmonic audiences have been blessed, hearing Mr. Brey regularly since he became the orchestra's principal cellist in 1996. But the pleasure has been mixed, because he had to cut back sharply on his solo career to do it. In a substantial bit of payback, the Philharmonic puts Mr. Brey forward to perform Bach's six unaccompanied cello suites as part of its Bach Variations festival. Expect him to shine. March 27. Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, 65th Street and Central Park West, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org. (J.R.O.)
LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC At its premiere in Los Angeles in May, John Adams's oratorio ''The Gospel According to the Other Mary'' badly lagged dramatically, but many moments of its protean, searching score showed a mature composer at the height of his powers. The Philharmonic and its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, bring the work to New York with the same excellent soloists -- Tamara Mumford, Kelley O'Connor and Russell Thomas -- and a new element: a staging by the theater artist Peter Sellars, who collaborated with Mr. Adams on the libretto. The next evening's concert features Claude Vivier's ''Zipangu,'' for strings, ''La Mer'' by Debussy and Stravinsky's ''Firebird,'' the kind of vividly dramatic work at which Mr. Dudamel excels. March 27-28. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' Ivan Fischer's conducting appearances in New York invariably yield fine performances, but in recent years they have also become genuine events. In 2010 Mr. Fischer presented all the Beethoven symphonies, half on period instruments, half on modern; in 2011 he offered Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' in his own staging; and in April he led Mozart's Requiem with choristers intermingled among the orchestra to give the players a better feel for the text. Bach's great Passion is to be sure an event in itself, and no unusual twists have been announced -- yet. Mr. Fischer conducts Musica Sacra and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, with soloists including Dominique Labelle, John Tessier and Hanno Müller-Brachmann. March 28. Carnegie Hall. (In other notable performances of the ''St. Matthew Passion,'' John Scott conducts the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and Concert Royal at St. Thomas Church on March 22, and Julian Wachner conducts the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at Trinity Church on March 24.) (J.R.O.)
APRIL
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In all the rampant speculation about who might succeed James Levine as the orchestra's music director, the name Daniele Gatti seems to have receded. Mr. Gatti is a gifted and experienced maestro in midcareer and seems not to be overcommitted by the standards of conductors today, despite major posts at the Orchestre National de France and the Zurich Opera. In this series, after a mixed program conducted by Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, a veteran who has given the orchestra yeoman service during its transition, the second and third programs are conducted by Mr. Gatti. Though there is no reason to expect anything but excellent performances, it will be hard not to wonder what Mr. Levine might have done with Mahler's Third Symphony, one of his great specialties, this time around in the second program, or what he might have made of the third, all Wagner. Certainly, on each of these terrains, Mr. Gatti will be held to the highest standard, by orchestra and public alike. April 3-5. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'GIULIO CESARE' It's tough being the final new Met production of the year. With everyone exhausted and attention flagging, you tend, like Rodney Dangerfield, to get no respect. It doesn't help that David McVicar's version of this Handel masterpiece, which puts a colorful colonial-era, Neo-Classical spin on the ancient Egyptian setting, has already been captured on DVD. But the Met's cast -- David Daniels in the title role, Natalie Dessay as Cleopatra and the excellent Alice Coote as Sesto -- is of interest, and the conductor, Harry Bicket, is a pro at this repertory. The Met orchestra plays its heart out for him. Opens April 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'GESUALDO REFLECTIONS' The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is best known for the classics; its concerts are the place to go when you want a Beethoven quartet played with dependable polish. But the society also has a relatively unheralded, consistently creative and excellent new-music series in Lincoln Center's intimate Kaplan Penthouse. The highlight, though it doesn't take place at the penthouse, is a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the birth of the brilliant and murderous composer Carlo Gesualdo featuring the Antioch Chamber Ensemble, the pianist Soyeon Kate Lee and the Brentano String Quartet. In keeping with Gesualdo's experimental music, centuries ahead of its time, the program juxtaposes his work with 21st-century responses -- by Bruce Adolphe, Brett Dean, David Gompper and Wolfgang Rihm -- for various chamber forces. April 4. Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org. (Z.W.)
'DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN' There will be a degree of deja vu as the Met brings back Robert Lepage's version of Wagner's epic masterpiece for the first time as a piece of the repertory, after the rollout of the full cycle last season. For the three cycles Deborah Voigt and Katarina Dalayman still alternate as Brünnhilde; Jay Hunter Morris's bright-voiced Siegfried still gets his turn, as does Hans-Peter König's memorably rich Hagen; and the enormous planks of Mr. Lepage's machine still rotate impassively. The question will be whether and how the spectacle suffers without the intensity provided by some of last season's stars: Bryn Terfel, Jonas Kaufmann, Eva-Maria Westbroek and Waltraud Meier. Fabio Luisi conducts. Cycles open on April 6 and 25 and May 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'MOSÈ IN EGITTO' Rossini's serious operas still don't receive the productions they deserve; they are long and not easy to cast. But they have irresistible grandeur. The Opera Orchestra of New York did Rossini's French adaptation of ''Mosè in Egitto'' in concert last year, and it sailed along with the muscular grace of an ocean liner. Now the New York City Opera offers a super-rare staging of the Italian original at City Center, the company's original home. The production is directed by Michael Counts, the visually eclectic creator of City Opera's ''Monodramas'' evening; we'll see how he handles the climactic parting of the Red Sea. (Projections, credited to Ada Whitney/Beehive, will presumably play a role.) Jayce Ogren, City Opera's man for all seasons, conducts. Opens April 14. New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
DRESDEN STAATSKAPELLE It will be fascinating to catch up with this orchestra and itsprincipal conductor, Christian Thielemann, in view of the jockeying for power going on at European festivals. After Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic announced that they would leave the Salzburg Easter Festival next spring in favor of an event in Baden-Baden, Germany, Mr. Thielemann and the Staatskapelle were quick to move in. The Berlin Philharmonic sounded in splendid shape at Carnegie in February, and this season, just weeks after that Salzburg appearance, it is the Staatskapelle's turn in programs of Brahms (''Academic Festival Overture''; Violin Concerto, with Lisa Batiashvili as soloist; Symphony No. 4) and Bruckner (Symphony No. 8). April 17, 19. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'TRISTAN UND ISOLDE' The acclaimed Swedish dramatic soprano Nina Stemme, who set Carnegie Hall ablaze as Strauss's Salome with Franz Welser-Möst and the Cleveland Orchestra in May, has said that her way in life is ''to hurry slowly.'' She has held back in establishing a career in the United States, and she will take up Wagner's Isolde at the Met only in the 2016-17 season. American Wagnerites will undoubtedly flock to Houston to hear her do it sooner. Ben Heppner is scheduled to sing Tristan, but you may recall that he gave the Met fits in the role in 2008, claiming illness and showing up for only the last of six planned performances. Christof Loy directs, and Patrick Summers conducts. If it all comes together, it should be worth the trip. Opens April 18. Houston Grand Opera, Wortham Center, (713) 228-6737, houstongrandopera.org. (J.R.O.)
'LA PÉRICHOLE' Christopher Alden's dreamlike production of Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte'' was the bright spot in the New York City Opera's uninspired last season, the latest in a series of memorable shows the director has made for the company in recent years. He now turns his attention to a seemingly unlikely work: this farcical operetta by Offenbach about a Peruvian street singer who triangulates between her true love and a Spanish official. (Another frothy opera, Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus,'' is also on Mr. Alden's agenda this year, with a production opening in October at the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto.) Mr. Alden has a gift for bringing out the darkness and sophistication in the unlikeliest of places and pieces. Opens April 21. New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
'WAR REQUIEM' Of the many commemorations of Benjamin Britten's centennial here in 2013, this performance of a consummate masterpiece, a pacifist statement mingling the text of the Requiem Mass with poetry of Wilfred Owen, will undoubtedly be one of the more imposing, with Kent Tritle conducting the 200-voice Oratorio Society of New York, itself celebrating its 140th anniversary. The vocal soloists are the excellent Emalie Savoy, soprano; John Matthew Myers, tenor; and Jesse Blumberg, baritone. April 22. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
SWEDISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA New York admirers of the Swedish soprano Nina Stemme who cannot catch that ''Tristan und Isolde'' in Houston must content themselves with this catchall concert, in which she will perform songs of Berlioz, Brahms, Wagner, Grieg, Sibelius, Strauss and Weill. In addition, Thomas Dausgaard conducts the fine ensemble in works or parts of works by Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Elgar, Sibelius and Ravel. April 25. Alice Tully Hall. (J.R.O.)
STRAVINSKY SACRED WORKS Julian Wachner continues his emphasis on more or less contemporary fare this season with the Trinity Choir and Novus NY devoting a weekend to the complete sacred works by a restless master. Stravinsky essentially announced modernism in music with his ''Rite of Spring'' in 1913, then looked back over his shoulder with a Neo-Classicism largely of his own invention and finally found his way to the spare, serialist aesthetic that dominates in many of the works here. Rightly, the majestic ''Symphony of Psalms'' crowns the affair. April 26-27 at Trinity Church. April 28 at St. Paul's Chapel. (J.R.O.)
YALE IN NEW YORK This four-concert series concludes with a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Paul Hindemith, ''Prankster and Master'': a Yale professor for the 13 years before his death and an astonishingly prolific composer and champion of useful music (Gebrauchsmusik) most of whose works have largely fallen into disuse. The current faculty members Boris Berman, pianist, and Ettore Causa, violist, and members of the Yale Philharmonia perform works of Hindemith including the sure-to-be-immortal ''Overture to 'The Flying Dutchman' as Played at Sight by a Second-Rate Concert Orchestra at the Village Well at 7 O'Clock in the Morning,'' for string quartet. April 28. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
MAY
'DIALOGUES DES CARMÉLITES' Some critics, including Anthony Tommasini in The New York Times, have called for the Met to appoint a director of productions, who would work with the general manager, Peter Gelb, and the music director, whoever that may be, to plot the company's theatrical direction. (S0 far Mr. Gelb has resisted the idea.) The last time something like that happened was when John Dexter filled the position in the late 1970s and early '80s. Audiences are periodically reminded of that brief golden age for theater at the Met when Dexter's productions are revived; though more than 30 years old, their elegance and intelligence shine through, as in his spectacular yet subtle take on Britten's ''Billy Budd,'' performed last season. One of Dexter's finest shows was his ''Dialogues des Carmélites,'' as unadorned and inspired as Poulenc's score. This revival has a fine cast, including Isabel Leonard, Patricia Racette, Erin Morley, Elizabeth Bishop and Paul Appleby, conducted by Louis Langrée. Opens May 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK The fascinating program ''London's Musical Bridge: The Enlightened English'' pairs works by 18th-century native English composers with counterparts by Germans who had settled in London: thus, suites by John Avison and Handel, overtures by William Boyce and Johann Christian Bach, and sinfonias by Thomas Arne and Frederick William Herschel. Herschel, in his day job as astronomer, discovered the planet Uranus: enlightened indeed. May 4. First Church of Christ, Scientist, Central Park West at 68th Street, (212) 280-0330. earlymusicny.org. (J.R.O.)
SPRING FOR MUSIC This annual festival of North American orchestras, conceived by top music professionals to encourage and reward adventurous programming, has in its first two seasons effectively filled what it has shown to be a valuable niche: giving Carnegie Hall-exposure to ensembles showing initiative, several of which might otherwise never have found their way there. Carlos Kalmar and the Oregon Symphony -- who made the biggest splash in 2011 with a program they have since recorded for the Pentatone label, ''Music for a Time of War'' -- present a wide-ranging collection of works by Schubert, Ravel, Schoenberg, Kurt Weill and the Thai composer Narong Prangcharoen (May 9). Also returning to the festival, which mandates a year off between appearances, are David Alan Miller and the Albany Symphony Orchestra, who presented a program centered on spirituals in 2011 and now play another American program, with works by Gershwin, Morton Gould and John Harbison (May 7). In addition, Marin Alsop conducts the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra; JoAnn Falletta, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; Leonard Slatkin, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra; and Christoph Eschenbach, the National Symphony Orchestra. May 6-11. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
DETROIT SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA To single out the oddest of the Spring for Music programs: Leonard Slatkin conducts Ives's Symphonies Nos. 1 through 4, a notion utterly logical on its surface yet, given the ear-twisting complexities in much of the music, utterly bizarre. Not even counting however many intermissions and stage changes, the program runs well over two hours. But will Mr. Slatkin be able to resist adding an encore: say, Ives's attempt at a monster sequel, the ''Universe Symphony,'' which the Nashville Symphony performed in the completion by Larry Austin at Spring for Music this year? May 10. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
TOKYO STRING QUARTET Though the personnel has shifted in recent years, it was still quite a brand, established over 43 years of excellent performance (and kudos to Kazuhide Isomura, the violist, who saw it all). Now the quartet has decided to quit while still near the top. It has picked excellent collaborative works to go out with, both in this concert (Schubert's resolutely sunny String Quintet, with the cellist Lynn Harrell) and in its penultimate recording (Brahms's late, mellow Clarinet Quintet, with the clarinetist Jon Manasse), to be released by Harmonia Mundi in November. But the quartet takes final leave on its own, both here on stage, with works by Haydn and Bartok (the Sixth Quartet, his last), and on disc, with works of Dvorak and Smetana, scheduled for release in 2013. May 11. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' Looking around and noting the decided paucity of quality opera in its city, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, never an ensemble to rest on its laurels, is improbably turning itself into a de facto opera company. It is focusing on new and recent works but also unveiling a series of staged performances of Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte's three classic operas, conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and featuring sets and costumes by noted architects and fashion designers. Last year ''Don Giovanni'' was promising, but the logistics, with the orchestra far above and behind the singers, were a work in progress. For this year's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' the setup will be adjusted for a production designed by Jean Nouvel and Azzedine Alaïa and starring Christopher Maltmann and Dorothea Röschmann. May 17, 19, 23, 25. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com. (Z.W.)
'GILBERT'S PLAYLIST' If four programs in May and June are being put forward as Alan Gilbert's playlist, you have to wonder what that implies about the rest of his season with the New York Philharmonic. Rote? Required? But questions about the marketing strategy don't detract from the quality and creativity of the work he is offering under that unfortunate title. First come jazz-inflected works by Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Copland and Wynton Marsalis, played alongside the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, then Dallapiccola's stark one-act opera ''Il Prigioniero'' (featuring Gerald Finley and Patricia Racette), sharing a bill with Lisa Batiashvili in Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1. Mr. Gilbert offers his new arrangement of Wagner, ''A Ring Journey,'' with Christopher Rouse's ''Seeing,'' featuring the pianist Emanuel Ax. Finally, to close the season, Doug Fitch, who has collaborated with Mr. Gilbert and the orchestra in recent seasons, directs and designs an evening of Stravinsky ballets (''The Fairy's Kiss'' and ''Petrouchka'') with Karole Armitage creating choreography for the New York City Ballet dancer Sara Mearns. May 31-June 29. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
JUNE
STOKOWSKI CELEBRATION Now the gloves are off. Mr. Nézet-Séguin, for all practical purposes, embodies Stokowski, as the Philadelphia Orchestra returns to its treasured but acoustically flawed old home, the Academy of Music. In three days of intensive programming, he conducts Brahms's First Symphony and Dvorak's Ninth, Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade'' and works by Ippolitov-Ivanov and Wagner, an audience-choice program and repertory from the animated Disney film ''Fantasia.'' But in the film, Stokowski got to shake hands with Mickey Mouse. How do you replicate that, Mr. Nézet-Séguin? June 21-23. Academy of Music, Philadelphia, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org. (J.R.O.)

FOR countless newly minted college graduates, it's a rite of passage. After the mortarboards have been tossed into the air, they head for New York City, ready to embark on the next chapter of their lives. In 2010, some 40,000 graduates age 22 to 28 moved to the city in search of jobs, according to the latest figures from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.
But whatever the next step, they first need a place to live. As rents continue to soar -- in August, the average monthly rent for a Manhattan apartment was $3,536 -- and the job market sputters, the task can be daunting, especially for those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. Even people who have heard horror stories about how hard it can be to find a first apartment in New York aren't prepared for the challenges. 
For an up-close look at what the search is like, several dozen new graduates were interviewed and four were followed as they set out to find a home. They represented renters looking in three price ranges from $1,000 to $2,000 a month.
Isaac Hancock, a Connecticut College graduate who is teaching at Success Academy Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn through Teach for America, wanted an apartment where he and four roommates would each pay about $1,000 in rent. With the help of Teacher Space NY, an agency that caters to teachers on tight house-hunting schedules and equally tight budgets, the group found a five-bedroom on the Upper East Side that is near the subway and is flooded with natural light.
Riley Hall and Averi Ahsmann, who graduated with combined bachelor and master's degrees from St. Bonaventure University, about an hour's drive from Buffalo, N.Y., wanted to pay a rent of $1,250 each. Ms. Hall, who is studying for her certified public accountants' exam, and Ms. Ahsmann, who works as a marketing assistant, found a two-bedroom apartment with a large living area near Gramercy Park, with the help of Morgan Turkewitz of Citi Habitats.
Charles McConnell, a recent graduate of Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., who plans to travel and play professional tennis while looking for a job in politics, wanted an apartment where he and two fraternity brothers could each pay about $2,000 in rent.
With the help of the Next Step Realty, a national real estate company that specializes in finding apartments for new college graduates, they found a three-bedroom in Murray Hill, complete with exposed brick, working fireplaces and a skylight. A coin laundry, a pizza place, a grocery store, A.T.M.'s and other services are within a block.
To give a sense of what it's like for new graduates to find a first apartment in New York, these four people were asked to keep track of the ups and downs of their search from the moment they began looking for a place to the day they signed the lease. (By coincidence, all four wound up in Manhattan, despite the fact that Brooklyn, and increasingly, parts of Queens, attract great numbers of young renters.) In all cases, the search proved more challenging than anticipated, but all four were happy with the place where they ended up.
These new graduates didn't get exactly what they were looking for when they started out, especially when it came to price. But now that they are settled into their new places and are preparing to embark on their new lives in the city, they can look back and impart a little wisdom to those who will come after them.

HEADLINE: Doubts as Portland Weighs Fluoride and Its Civic Values

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Who bears responsibility for an impoverished child with a mouth full of rotting teeth? Parents? Soda companies? The ingrained inequities of capitalism? Pick your villain, or champion. They are all on display here as the largest city in the nation with no commitment to fluoridating its water supply -- and one of the most politically liberal cultures anywhere -- has waded into a new debate about whether to change its ways and its water.
The debate flared on Thursday at a public hearing before the five-member City Council, whose vote on the issue is scheduled for this week. Some of the arguments have focused on health concerns, with opponents raising questions and citing studies about fluoride's effects on brain development and I.Q.
Others said that times had changed since in the 1950s, when fluoridation first took off in the United States. People now get plenty of fluoride, critics say, in products from toothpaste to food that has been processed, grown or cleaned elsewhere. About three-fourths of the country's population lives in areas where fluoride is added to the water. 
''If there's a problem with kids' dental health, why don't we put the money toward better nutrition?'' said Angel Lambart, who testified on Thursday with her young daughter on her lap.
But befitting a city where socially conscious, environmentally fervent goals have become a kind of local brand, the more ferocious questions for both sides centered on personal choice and societal burden. Once consigned to the ranks of the gritty and damp, along with Seattle and other Pacific Northwest shipping towns, Portland has been reinvented by waves of highly educated newcomers working at places like Intel, a huge regional employer.
But beyond the bike-friendly, walk-friendly downtown of rose gardens and coffee bars, a kind of parallel Portland of perpetual poverty, concentrated in minority groups and often invisible to visitors, has festered.
Dental decay rates, numerous state and federal studies say, are linked to income, education and access to health insurance, but also to lifestyle, diet and parental choices in insisting on a toothbrush. Such conclusions give fuel to both sides, with supporters of fluoride seeing a social problem to be solved by government, while opponents focus on unhealthy habits and diets that they say will not be affected by chemicals.
Mayor Sam Adams, who backs the fluoridation plan and has one of five votes on the Council, comes firmly down on the side that says Portland must address dental care for everyone if its progressive goals and self-image are valid.
''It's about health equity, it's about social justice,'' he said in an interview. ''Fluoride is means to an end,'' he added. ''I hope that folks, whether they agree with me or not, understand that my intentions are to help those Portlanders that have no voice in this process.''
Some opponents of fluoridation have lobbed that kind of reasoning right back into the laps of the commissioners. ''I don't appreciate you trying to alleviate your white guilt by putting toxins in our water,'' Frances Quaempts-Miller, who described herself as mixed black and Muscogee Indian, said in testifying at the public hearing before the all-white Council of four men and one woman.
Who is empowered to make the choice for Portland has become part of the debate as well. Fluoridation efforts have failed at the ballot box here, most recently in 1980. And two other members of the City Council, in addition to Mr. Adams, who is not seeking re-election in November, said even before public testimony was taken that they planned to vote for the plan -- making a majority -- when it goes before them. Some opponents call that an undemocratic end-run around the popular will.
But one of the commissioners, Nick Fish, in a defense of his pro-fluoride position at Thursday's hearing, said that what some call closed-door deal-making, he calls leadership. ''I think we were elected to make the tough calls,'' said Mr. Fish, the public works commissioner. He said that gridlock in Congress was an example to be avoided. ''In this community we have a chance to do something different,'' he said.
Some critics say Portland's sense of civic duty is misplaced when it comes to bad teeth, which they say is a much greater problem in what many residents call the ''other Oregon,'' beyond the Portland metro area. Portland has bounced back from recession, while much of the rest of the state, where residents also mostly drink unfluoridated water, continues to struggle.
But even before the recession, there was a dental divide. A study in 2007 by the Oregon Department of Human Services said that 1 out of 17 first, second and third graders outside the Portland metro area needed urgent dental care because of pain or infection, but in the metro area itself, only 1 in 100 students did. Adding fluoride to Portland's water would affect about 900,000 residents in a state of 3.9 million people.
''Portland has better teeth,'' said Kim Kaminski, director of Clean Water Portland, a group that is fighting fluoridation. She called fluoridation for Portland a Band-Aid on a larger problem.
Fluoride remains a debating point around the nation, with some communities questioning the cost or re-examining the science. In Florida, the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners voted last October to halt fluoridation, but the water district serving San Jose, Calif., voted in December to start.
Portland residents interviewed on a downtown public square on a morning last week were divided on whether voters or their elected representatives should have the final say.
''There are issues that are more complex than the general population sometimes can really assess appropriately,'' said Carol Lindstrom, the marketing director for an energy efficiency company. Ms. Lindstrom said she grew up in a rural community in Washington State that did not have fluoride, ''and I think I suffered for it,'' she added.
Celia Wagner, a Web site developer, said the local fluoride debate, full of hyperbole and passion, had brought out the ''rugged individuality and quirkiness'' of Portland's character, for better and worse. ''It's Portland doing its Portland thing, which I love; I've been here 35 years,'' she said. ''It's charming, but occasionally not charming.''
Still, she said that it should be the voters who decide, and that she would vote for fluoride if she could. She grew up with it in the suburbs of Seattle. ''People tell me I have nice teeth,'' she said. ''I don't see the problem.''

HEADLINE: Where Cows Are Happy and Food Is Healthy

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
YAMHILL, Ore.
FOOD can be depressing. If it's tasty, it's carcinogenic. If it's cheap, animals were tortured.
But this, miraculously, is a happy column about food! It's about a farmer who names all his 230 milk cows, along with his 200 heifers and calves, and loves them like children.
Let me introduce Bob Bansen, a high school buddy of mine who is a third-generation dairyman raising Jersey cows on lovely green pastures here in Oregon beside the Yamhill River. Bob, 53, a lanky, self-deprecating man with an easy laugh, is an example of a farmer who has figured out how to make a good living running a farm that is efficient but also has soul.
As long as I've known him, Bob has had names for every one of his ''girls,'' as he calls his cows. Walk through the pasture with him, and he'll introduce you to them. 
''I spend every day with these girls,'' Bob explained. ''I know most of my cows both by the head and by the udder. You learn to recognize them from both directions.''
''This is Hosta,'' he began, and then started pointing out the others nearby. ''Jill. Sophia. This is Kimona. Edie would be the spotted one lying there. Pesto is the black one standing up. In front of her is Clare. Next to her is Pasta, who is Pesto's daughter.''
I asked about Jill, and Bob rattled off her specs. She is now producing about eight gallons a day, with particularly high protein and butterfat content. Jill's mother was Jolly, a favorite of Bob's. When Jolly grew old and unproductive, he traded her to a small family farm in exchange for a ham so she could live out her retirement with dignity.
When I pushed for Bob's secret to tell the cows apart, he explained: ''They have family resemblances. They look like their mothers.''
Oh, that helps.
As a farmkid myself, growing up with Bob here in the rolling green hills of Yamhill, where the Willamette Valley meets the coastal range, I've been saddened to see American farms turn into food factories. Just this year, I've written about hens jammed in cages, with dead birds left to rot beside the survivors, and about industrial farms that try to gain a financial edge by pumping chickens full of arsenic, antibiotics, Tylenol and even Prozac.
Yet all is not lost. Family farms can still thrive, while caring for animals and producing safe and healthy food.
For Bob, a crucial step came when he switched to organic production eight years ago. A Stanford study has cast doubt on whether organic food is more nutritious, but it affirms that organic food does contain fewer pesticides and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bob's big worry in switching to organic production was whether cows would stay healthy without routine use of antibiotics because pharmaceutical salesmen were always pushing them as essential. Indeed, about 80 percent of antibiotics in the United States go to farm animals -- leading to the risk of more antibiotic-resistant microbes, which already cause infections that kill some 100,000 Americans annually.
Bob nervously began to experiment by withholding antibiotics. To his astonishment, the cows didn't get infections; on the contrary, their health improved. He realized that by inserting antibiotics, he may have been introducing pathogens into the udder. As long as cows are kept clean and are given pasture rather than cooped up in filthy barns, there's no need to shower them with antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals, he says.
Many cows in America now live out their lives in huge dairy barns, eating grain and hay and pumping out milk. But evidence is growing that cows don't do well when locked up, so now many dairies are reverting to the traditional approach of sending cows out to pasture on grass.
''Pasture does wonders for cow health,'' Bob said. ''There's so much evidence that they are much happier out there. You can extend their lives so much by keeping them off concrete, so the trend is going that way.''
Is it a soggy sentimentality for farmers to want their cows to be happy? Shouldn't a businessman just worry about the bottom line?
Bob frowned. ''For productivity, it's important to have happy cows,'' he said. ''If a cow is at her maximum health and her maximum contentedness, she's profitable. I don't even really manage my farm so much from a fiscal standpoint as from a cow standpoint, because I know that, if I take care of those cows, the bottom line will take care of itself.''
This isn't to say that Bob's farm is a charity hostel. When cows age and their milk production drops, farmers slaughter them. Bob has always found that part of dairying tough, so, increasingly, he uses the older cows to suckle steers. That way the geriatric cows bring in revenue to cover their expenses and their day of reckoning can be postponed -- indefinitely, in the case of his favorite cows.
I teased Bob about running a bovine retirement home, and he smiled unapologetically.
''I feel good about it,'' he said simply. ''They support me as much as I support them, so it's easy to get attached to them. I want to work hard for them because they've taken good care of me.''
Like many farmers, Bob frets about regulations and reporting requirements, but he also sympathizes with recent animal rights laws meant to improve the treatment of livestock and poultry.
''You hate to have it go to legislation, but we need to protect the animals,'' he said. ''They're living things, and you have to treat them right.''
Granted, such a humane attitude may be easier to apply to dairying than to poultry. It's tough for cage-free poultry farms to compete economically with huge industrial operations that raise millions of birds jammed into cages, and healthy food that is good for humans and animals in some cases will cost more.
Moreover, we're never going to revert to the kind of agriculture that existed a century ago. Bob's 600 acres used to be farmed by five different families, and that consolidation won't be undone. But neither is it inevitable that consolidation will continue indefinitely so that America's farms end up as vast, industrial, soulless food factories.
I loved growing up on a sheep and cherry farm, even if that did mean getting up at 3 a.m. in the winter to check for newborn lambs, and I hope medium-size family farms remain a pillar of rural America. As Bob's dairy shows, food need not come at the cost of animal or human health and welfare. We need not wince when we contemplate where our food comes from.
The next time you drink an Organic Valley glass of milk, it may have come from one of Bob's cows. If so, you can bet it was a happy cow. And it has a name.

HEADLINE: The Issues? Yawn.

BYLINE: By DAVID JAVERBAUM. 
David Javerbaum is the author of ''The Last Testament: A Memoir by God.''

 BODY:
In this or any election year the candidates can be counted on to make regular references in their campaign speeches to ''the issues.'' It's important to realize that in doing so they are not actually alluding to the real-world challenges facing Americans. They are alluding to ''the issues'' -- just that, that actual two-word phrase.
The issues, of course, are what we all know elections are supposed to be about. In theory we want our public servants to be like those in Thucydides, appealing to our intellect with long, detailed, well-defended elaborations of their positions on those economic and geopolitical questions upon whose answers the future of our nation depends. But in practice, you were yawning by the end of that sentence. 
Most of us just aren't built to endure that much debate. (And they weren't in ancient Greece either. Thucydides was the Aaron Sorkin of his day -- a great writer who used current events as the basis for inspiring and thought-provoking speeches no real person would or could ever actually say.)
No: we are human beings. We like personalities and ad hominem attacks and sex scandals and gossip. This is how Homo electorus rolls. But the Homo sapiens part of us feels guilty about this. We know we should be talking about the issues. We just don't wanna. Luckily, the candidates are just as uninterested in getting wonky as the electorate is, and the two sides have evolved an ingenious, mutually beneficial arrangement to make structuralists proud: Turn signifier into the signified. Like:
''I care about the issues facing this country.''
''The issues facing this country are far too urgent for me to spend the next 10 minutes outlining them.''
''I want this debate to be about the issues. The economy. Our future. How to make America great. [Pause.] I'll tell you what else is great -- the fried dough here at the Iowa State Fair!''
If you don't make me talk about policy, I won't make you think about it. That is the unspoken agreement behind ''the issues.'' It is the electoral equivalent of the agreed-upon ''safety word'' that automatically ends an S&M session before it gets too intense.
But the phrase's work is still not done, for the officeseeker must now use it to win over the crowd, allaying its guilt over its own attention-deficit disorder by blaming a scapegoat -- his opponent.
''My opponent wants to avoid the issues.''
''My opponent is dancing a contemptuous cha-cha around the issues.''
''My opponent doesn't think you're smart enough to discuss the issues. To talk in-depth about things like... prosperity. Jobs. Money. [Pause.] Although I will admit there is plenty of 'dough' here at the Iowa State Fair! [Aide whispers in ear.] I mean the Missouri State Fair!''
In this way, ''the issues'' triggers an instantaneous meta-shift in the terms of the debate. The candidate now seeks to be judged, not on what he believes, but on how seriously he can get you to believe he wishes he could talk about what he believes. (In fact, a sentence like ''My opponent wants to avoid the issues'' implies a character flaw in one's opponent that, in a bit of Möbius logic, is itself a distraction from the issues.)
''The issues'' is versatile enough to allow columnists, bloggers and pundits -- the collective unholy troika of all human misery -- to join the fun. By dint of nine simple letters, they can effortlessly pose as Apollonian intellectuals perched high above politics' dismal squalor.
''Why won't Barack Obama and Mitt Romney talk about the issues?''
''Why are we so fixated on a congressman who believes in magical spermicidal anti-rape vagina fairies instead of the issues?!?''
''Why are we so fixated on the Athenian general Alcibiades' regular attendance at Dionysian orgies in Attica and Sparta instead of on the issues?!?''
''The issues'' is a rhetorical head fake; a feint toward a line of discussion as unlikely to ensue as a Martian invasion; the theoretical magnetic north to which the conjectural needle of some hypothetically idea-driven campaign desperately wishes to point.

HEADLINE: A City's Heartbreak Outlives Its Source

BYLINE: By MARK WINEGARDNER. 
Mark Winegardner is the author of four novels, including ''Crooked River Burning.''

 BODY:
On a bright, yet metaphorically dark day in 1995 -- temperature in the high 30s, balmy for Cleveland in December -- my 6-year-old son and I trudged down toward the lake to witness the real Cleveland Browns' dying day.
We threaded our way though a throng of angry tailgaters chanting ''Go to hell, Art Modell.'' Actually, Modell, the Browns' owner, was taking one of the best-supported teams in N.F.L. history not to hell but to Baltimore.
This and other profane slogans could also be found emblazoned on unlicensed T-shirts. My son, Sam, begged me for one.
I strongly considered it. 
Even though the N.F.L. would award Cleveland an expansion team that was allowed to keep the Browns' name, colors and records, Sam would never have the relationship with the team that a half-century's worth of Clevelanders had enjoyed -- and righteously suffered for.
From the time the team was founded in 1946 until Modell bought it in 1961 -- a prosperous era in which Cleveland was nobody's laughingstock -- the Browns were the best team in American sports. They had a record of 143-37-6. They were the only champion the All-American Football Conference ever had, and, in 1950, their first year in the N.F.L., they won that league's title, too. They returned to the championship game for each of the next five years, winning twice.
Cleveland loved these guys, but not just because they won.
The coach, Paul Brown, was from Massillon, right down the road. He had built Massillon High School into a prep powerhouse and won a national championship at Ohio State. He created the modern passing game. He helped integrate professional football, bringing in the future Hall of Famers Marion Motley and Bill Willis, both Ohio kids. The team's other big stars had names that sounded like the guy next to you on the assembly line -- and nicknames that were sublimely cool. Dante (Glue-Fingers) Lavelli. Automatic Otto Graham. Frank (Gunner) Gatski. Lou (the Toe) Groza.
When, in 1956, the Browns finally had a losing season, they used the sixth pick in the draft to select perhaps the greatest player ever: Jim Brown.
I missed all this.
I was born in 1961, eight months after Modell bought the team. Obviously, I have no memory of the next year, when Modell got into a power struggle with Paul Brown and fired him, or of 1964, when the Browns won the only championship by any major Cleveland sports team in my lifetime. I was oblivious when, after the '65 season, Jim Brown, in London filming ''The Dirty Dozen,'' asked to report late to training camp. Modell refused. Insulted, Brown -- barely 30, having led the league in rushing the previous year by almost 700 yards -- retired from football.
My first Browns were the Bill Nelson/Leroy Kelly teams, which, in 1968 and 1969, came up one game short of the Super Bowl. By then, Cleveland had become the scene of riots, of blocks of burning buildings. Our river had burned, too, somehow. This became a running joke, first on the television show ''Laugh-In,'' then pretty much everywhere else.
For most of the '70s, the Browns hugged .500. Not until 1980, about halfway through the Modell years, did the team start to feel accursed.
The so-called Kardiac Kids, led by quarterback Brian Sipe, after a year's worth of late-game heroics, were in the playoffs, at home, in subzero weather with a gale-force wind, down, 14-12, to Oakland with less than a minute to play and on the Raiders' 13. Sipe threw the ball into the wind. It was intercepted.
The name of the play was Red Right 88. Some now call it the Pass.
Later in the '80s, as Cleveland's attempts to repair its image and economy came to seem futile, in came a new hero, quarterback Bernie Kosar -- from Youngstown, right down the road. In both '86 and '87, the Browns came within a game of the Super Bowl. Both times, they lost, in the final moments and to Denver, undone once by the Drive and the next year by the Fumble, the details of which are too painful to explain.
In the '90s, as the city had a short-lived economic comeback, the Browns struggled. In 1991, Modell hired Bill Belichick, and said with confidence that if Belichick didn't work out, he would leave town.
In fact, Modell's departure was already on the horizon. When the city built a new stadium for the Indians, and the Browns had the chance to share it, Modell told the city he was O.K. waiting for a renovation to Cleveland Stadium. When he reconsidered, Cleveland put an initiative on the ballot for that renovation. On the eve of Election Day, Modell announced that he was moving to Baltimore. The next day, the initiative passed, with 72 percent of the vote.
A month later, my son and I entered the stadium for the last game. All around us were fans passing through the gates with wrenches, hacksaws and crowbars.
Inside, all the advertising had been blacked out. Modell watched on TV from his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. -- something that, because the game was not a sellout, unlike hundreds of games in a row before that season, and was thus not shown locally, the people of Cleveland could not do.
The Browns beat Cincinnati, 26-10. There was no booing. Nobody blamed the players. Afterward, people sawed and pried out the seats families had had for generations. The Browns ran over to the hard-core fans in the north end zone, the Dawg Pound, shaking hands and saying thank you.
After the season, Modell fired Belichick.
An expansion team called the Browns made its debut in 1999, but the connection with the team's past will probably, like Cleveland itself, never be the same.
In the fake Browns' second season, Baltimore won the Super Bowl. When Modell hoisted that trophy, he might as well have kneecapped us with it.
The year after, it was Belichick, then with New England, who was a Super Bowl champion.
The fake Browns are 68-141 and expected, again, to be awful. Yet on Sunday, three days after Modell's death, Sam and I will each be watching the first game of the season, me in Tallahassee, Fla., Sam an adult living in Chicago, wondering if we will live to see a champion in the city our hearts call home.

HEADLINE: Russia and Japan in Agreement on Natural Gas Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia -- Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled gas monopoly, signed an accord on Saturday with the government of Japan to move forward with plans for the construction of a $13 billion natural gas terminal here that would propel the Kremlin's ambitions to multiply its business and trade ties in the Far East.
While the ultimate deal still hinges on reaching an agreement on the price Japan will pay for the natural gas, the accord is a crucial step toward increasing Russian energy exports at a time when Japan is eager to find alternatives to its largely shuttered, and politically embattled, nuclear power industry. 
The agreement was signed by Aleksei Miller, the chairman of Gazprom, and Ichiro Takahara, a senior Japanese trade official, on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, which is being held in Russia for the first time.
Gazprom already sells natural gas to Japan, but another major deal would further reduce Russia's reliance on Europe as its primary market.
In a statement, Mr. Miller said that the Asia-Pacific market was ''the most capacious in the world'' and that within the next few years, sales by Gazprom to Asia would exceed its sales in Europe, where the company fills roughly a quarter of the Continent's demand.
At the economic summit meeting, officials said that the 21 members of the economic group, representing Pacific nations from Asia and the Americas, had reached an agreement to prevent any ban on the export of grains or other food products that could lead to rising prices and social unrest.
A ban on grain exports by Russia in 2010 was widely viewed as contributing to a global spike in prices, and it raised doubts about Russia as a reliable supplier of agricultural products. Severe droughts in the United States and parts of Russia this year have renewed fears of increases in food prices.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has said there will be no export ban this year, and experts say that solid harvests in other parts of the world, including India, should help avert a crisis. Mr. Putin, as the conference host, had set food security as a top item on the agenda.
Officials said they had also reached an accord to reduce tariffs on products related to 54 technologies deemed environmentally friendly -- fulfilling a goal set at the economic conference last year.
Among the so-called green-technology items to benefit from the tariff reductions is equipment used for generating renewable energy, like solar and wind power, as well as products related to recycling and wastewater treatment. Under the agreement, customs duties could be no more than 5 percent by 2015.
One development being celebrated here in Vladivostok is Russia's entry last month into the World Trade Organization, making it the last major world economy to join the group, which establishes global norms and provides mechanisms to settle disputes.
But even as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton praised her Russian hosts for this development, noting that American exports ''could double or even triple'' as a result, she also criticized lingering protectionist policies, especially favored treatment of state-owned businesses.
Her comments were a clear rebuke of Russia and China, both of which maintain large state-controlled companies and sovereign wealth investment funds.

HEADLINE: Rescued by Music, Happy to Mail Out His Own CDs

BYLINE: By ANDY LANGER. 
Andy Langer is the music columnist for Esquire and the midday D.J. on KGSR in Austin.

 BODY:
Just two years ago, ''Junky Star,'' the album by Ryan Bingham & the Dead Horses, was released by the celebrated Nashville label Lost Highway Records. It was the most commercially successful album of Mr. Bingham's career, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard country charts. But on Sept. 18, when he releases its follow-up, ''Tomorrowland,'' the record will not appear on Lost Highway or any other major label. It will be put out by his own label, Axster Bingham Records, which has no track record and no other artists on its roster.
Mr. Bingham does not have the high profile of Wilco, Jack White or Radiohead -- other artists who have taken the risks and put in the hard work that come with independence for the right to make their own decisions and keep most of the profits. But Mr. Bingham had reason to believe the time for striking out on his own was good. The success of ''Junky Star,'' his third major-label album, closely followed ''The Weary Kind,'' his contribution to the soundtrack of the movie ''Crazy Heart,'' which earned Mr. Bingham and his co-writer, T Bone Burnett, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Golden Globe. 
''It's a liberating thing to work for yourself,'' said Mr. Bingham, 31, a native of New Mexico who in 2004 traded a fledgling career bull riding in rodeos across Texas for a similarly itinerant life as a musician. ''We've always been more of a road band than a band that depended on record sales or radio play. Touring, the hard-work part, doesn't scare us. So we're not afraid to sit in the office and sign CDs or stuff envelopes. Running to the post office to mail CDs is a lot less dangerous than six months on the road.''
Late last month, Mr. Bingham discussed his independence and his time spent in Texas in a telephone conversation from his home in Southern California.
Q. Parts of this record lean in a more rock-oriented direction then we've heard from you.
A. For the first time in my career, I had some time off before recording, and it's really the first opportunity I had to sit down at home with some electric guitars and experiment. I was listening to a lot of Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix. And the Clash. And the truth of the matter is that rock 'n' roll is a lot more fun to play live. My last record was a little slow, and a lot of the songs were dark and sad. Playing those songs every night got tough sometimes. I wanted a record this time around that would be fun to play live.
Q. There's a lot of mythology around your time in Texas -- ranch work, rodeo riding and what sounds awfully close to homelessness. How lean were the Texas days?
A. They were pretty rough. I went out on my own at 17. I was fortunate to have a lot of friends in a bunch of different towns. Eventually, I started working for a rodeo company in Del Rio. I always had couches to stay on, but never anywhere I felt was home. The decision I eventually made, to live out of the car and be on my own, was really my decision. It made me feel uncomfortable to rely on other people and ask for favors, so a lot of times I felt more at ease sleeping in the truck or camping out somewhere than asking people for a place to sleep and some food to eat.
Q. Music rescued you.
A. I truly believe that. I started playing songs and from the get-go, it was really therapeutic. It's always helped to say stuff out loud. The songs weren't really written for anybody to hear. A lot of the places I played early on were rough roadhouses, honky-tonks and dive bars. People were there to get drunk and fight. I could sing the songs all night long, and nobody was listening to the lyrics as long as the guitars were loud and the tempos were up. But it gave me the opportunity to sustain myself. I could make 40 bucks a night and pay for gas and food.
Q. In an election year, ''Tomorrowland,'' an album about the small guy fighting back, sounds like a protest record.
A. I'm not a political person or a protest songwriter. But I think what's going on around me influences me like anybody else -- social issues, corruption, the economic situation. For a lot of people, these are lean times. Drive though Detroit or Baltimore or Hartford, Conn., and they look like war zones. As touring musicians, we see a lot of harsh realities; the places we experience and the characters we see at certain times of the night, most people don't see. As a songwriter, I'm not trying to describe the impressions we collect on the road specifically, but more the emotion, the feeling that exposure to that stuff leaves you with.
Q. I suppose it could leave you cursing someone or something you think is to blame. This album has enough four-letter words on it I'd have expected one of those old black-and-white parental advisory warning stickers.
A. It's part of who I am and how I talk. Every now and then, everyone has to get a four-letter word off his chest. I just have a few more than the next guy.

HEADLINE: In School Finance Tangle, Wealth Doesn't Necessarily Mean More

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.
School districts can get rich just as fast as the people in the oil business, and the poor-to-rich whiplash can have some weird aftereffects.
Public schools in Texas get about half of their money, on average, from property taxes. And when the property turns out to be sitting on top of the Eagle Ford Shale play, the sudden changes in wealth can produce fiscal temblors in the schools. 
Some, like the Dilley Independent School District, see an influx of money and get to keep it. Others, like the Cotulla I.S.D., see the money come in but don't get to keep it for very long.
Dilley, southwest of San Antonio on Interstate 35, has seen property values balloon to about $275 million from $130 million two years ago, according to Nobert Rodriguez, the superintendent. It is by most measures a poor school district -- one that gets money from the state to supplement what can be raised from local property taxes.
The general idea (school finance is about as simple as the tax code) is that no district should have too high a tax rate and that the state will supplement those that can't raise enough locally to pay for schools. The rich districts that can, with the same tax rate, raise more than a certain amount for public schools have to use some of their money to support the poor districts. That's called ''recapture,'' in the gnarled language of school finance.
The boom in property values means more money for Dilley, where 78 percent of the students qualify for free and reduced school meals, a benefit that is based on family income. And as fast as its fortunes have risen, Dilley is still in a position to raise money locally and to get money from the state. Property values will have to increase by another $140 million or so before the state comes asking for money. It's not impossible, Mr. Rodriguez said. ''Last year,'' he said, ''we went up $100 million.''
Cotulla, off the next major exit ramp from I-35 as you go south, is in a more difficult situation. Values there have jumped to $2.3 billion from $877 million, according to the school superintendent, Jack Seals. The district will bring in more money this year and won't have to write the state a big check -- there's a one-year lag before the new local values are plugged into the state's formula. Next year, however, Mr. Seals estimates, Cotulla will be writing the state a $15 million check.
It doesn't mean that the district is rich or the people in it are wealthy -- just that the land it taxes has gone up quickly and dramatically in value. In Cotulla, 85 percent of the students were from economically disadvantaged families in 2010.
But more money in revenue can mean more money for the schools, as is the case in Dilley. In Cotulla, it's an issue for the accountants, who will need to set aside enough of this year's windfall to help cover next year's check to the state. Theoretically, they'll have about the same amount of money to spend per student each year.
But booms make the schools nervous. Right now, construction is at a crazy pace, and there are big trucks on all the roads. Out-of-town workers outnumber rooms and beds and have to sleep in trailers, new hotels, portable buildings or the backs of their trucks.
It's a classic boom. People are getting rich and working hard, and the dirt is flying.
Since 2010, more than a dozen school districts -- mostly small ones like North Zulch, Carrizo Springs and Karnes City -- have seen property values rise rapidly, with more than half the growth coming from mineral properties, according to an analysis by Moak, Casey & Associates, a consultancy in Austin.
If the boom stops, property values will drop. If oil and gas prices fall -- even if the production and construction continue -- property values will fall. In the Dilleys and Cotullas, that would mean less money. Dilley gets to keep its windfall now without sending it to the state, but would not see it replaced should values drop.
Cotulla would be able to get state money again. But remember that one-year lag that's working for them now? It would work against them in a year of declining values.
''I worry about declining values in the future,'' Mr. Seals said. ''If values drop, we're going to be well behind the eight ball.''

HEADLINE: Tech's New Wave, Driven By Data

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY tends to cascade into the marketplace in waves. Think of personal computers in the 1980s, the Internet in the 1990s and smartphones in the last five years.
Computing may be on the cusp of another such wave. This one, many researchers and entrepreneurs say, will be based on smarter machines and software that will automate more tasks and help people make better decisions in business, science and government. And the technological building blocks, both hardware and software, are falling into place, stirring optimism.
Michael R. Stonebraker, a pioneer in database research, is one of the optimists. Software used by companies and government agencies -- in products sold by Oracle, I.B.M., Microsoft and others -- descends from research done in the 1970s by Mr. Stonebraker and Eugene Wong, a colleague at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as a team of scientists at I.B.M.
Today, Mr. Stonebraker sees an opportunity for new kinds of ultrafast databases. The new software, he explains, takes advantage of rapid advances in computer hardware to help businesses and researchers find insights in the rising flood of data coming from so many sources, including Web-browsing trails, sensor data, genetic testing and stock trading. 
So, at 68, Mr. Stonebraker is a co-founder and chief technology officer of two start-ups in the field of data-driven discovery, VoltDB and Paradigm4.
''Now is the time,'' says Mr. Stonebraker, who is an adjunct professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory. ''The economics and the technology are ripe.''
The case for optimism is by no means unqualified. The march of these technologies raises social issues, including privacy concerns, and the timing is uncertain. All of the bold predictions in the 1990s that the Internet would disrupt traditional industries like media, advertising and retailing did come true -- a decade later.
But a series of related technologies, scientists and entrepreneurs say, has reached a critical mass -- come to a digital boiling point, so to speak -- so that new products and capabilities become possible. The technical ingredients, they note, include powerful, low-cost computing and storage spread across thousands of computers. The digital engine rooms of Google and Amazon are prime examples.
Another fast-improving technology involves inexpensive and intelligent sensors, which are crucial to a new breed of automated machines like experimental driverless cars and battlefield drones. Clever software -- notably machine-learning algorithms -- animates much of the current wave of smarter technology. Two well-known examples are found in Watson, the ''Jeopardy''-winning computer from I.B.M., and the movie recommendations on Netflix.
ADVANCES in such underlying technologies are fueling the current excitement in fields like artificial intelligence, robotics and data analysis and prediction. ''All parts of the technology pipeline are gearing up at the same time, and that's how you get this explosion of new applications and uses,'' says Jon Kleinberg, a computer scientist at Cornell University.
Behind the seeming explosion, experts say, is a process of technology evolution. Paul Saffo, a technology forecaster, compares the process to the evolutionary biology concept known as ''punctuated equilibria'' formulated by the paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge. The idea is that species often evolve in periodic spurts.
Yet, they say, there are typically years of progress before a commercial breakthrough in the technological realm.
''Even in Silicon Valley, it takes most technologies 20 years to become overnight successes,'' says Mr. Saffo, a consulting professor at Stanford's school of engineering.
The Internet provides a case study of both technology's evolutionary progress and its exponential growth. In 1969, there were only four computers connected to the nascent Internet, compared with roughly a billion computing devices today, from laptops to cellphones, says Edward Lazowska, a computer scientist at the University of Washington.
The early increases in connected computers drew scant attention. ''But at some point in the late 1990s,'' Mr. Lazowska says, ''you were going from 4 million to 8 million to 16 million to 32 million to 64 million, and people started to notice that something revolutionary was going on.''
Rocket Fuel is a four-year-old Silicon Valley start-up that uses artificial-intelligence software to place display advertisements for marketers on the Web. The company can not only tailor ads by demographic slices of viewers' ages, gender and interests, but can also use its predictive algorithms to produce campaigns based on results, says George H. John, the company's chief executive.
For example, a luxury carmaker might tell Rocket Fuel that it wants to place 100 million ads in the next month, and it will pay the company, say, $80 for generating a sales lead, as evidenced by a potential customer downloading a brochure or filling out an online form.
Rocket Fuel is growing fast, having nearly doubled its work force since the start of the year, to 240. So far in 2012, it has handled campaigns for more than 500 advertisers, including BMW, Duncan Hines, Allstate, Pizza Hut and Ace Hardware. It has raised $76 million in venture funding and debt, and its thousands of computers handle 19 billion bid requests a day on ad exchanges. Each online auction for ad space is typically completed in about 100 milliseconds, a tenth of a second.
Rocket Fuel, Mr. John says, is using some of the ideas he worked on in the 1990s as a doctoral student focusing on artificial intelligence at Stanford -- research that was supported with government dollars from the National Science Foundation and other agencies, as is so often the case. In the last few years, building a business around those ideas has become achievable and affordable. ''And a lot of it has to do with the underlying technology,'' Mr. John says.
FOR Mr. Stonebraker, the hardware advance that opens the door to his start-ups is the striking improvement of solid-state memory, as performance climbs and prices plunge. Solid-state, or flash, memory is most widely known as the lightweight storage technology used in consumer devices like small music players and smartphones.
But increasingly, solid-state memory can be used in big computers, holding a hefty database in memory instead of sending data off to be stored on disk drives. According to Mr. Stonebraker, some data-handling tasks can now be completed 50 times faster than with conventional systems.
''Memory is the new disk,'' he says. ''The obvious thing to do is to exploit that technology.''
In the yin and yang of computing, it is software that exploits hardware, enabling a computer to do useful things. And machine-learning programs and other data-sifting software are advancing swiftly.
''There is no point in collecting and storing all this data if the algorithms are not able to find useful patterns and insights in the data,'' says Mr. Kleinberg at Cornell. ''But the software is scaling up to the task.''

HEADLINE: Game Maker Without a Rule Book

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
BELLEVUE, Wash.
THIS is no Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
Every way I look, the scene shifts, the battle unfolds. I have a crazy contraption strapped to my head: a boxy set of goggles that looks like a 22nd-century version of a View-Master. It immerses me in a virtual world. I whirl one way and see zombies preparing to snack on my flesh. I turn another and wonder what fresh hell awaits.
Behold the future of video games. Or at least the future as envisioned by a bunch of gamers, programmers, tinkers and dreamers at the Valve Corporation here. This is the uncorporate company that brought us the Half-Life series, the hugely influential first-person shooter game.
The Valve guys aren't done yet. Founded 16 years ago by a couple of refugees from Microsoft, Valve makes games that wild-eyed fans play until their thumbs hurt and dawn jabs through the curtains. But what really makes Valve stand out is its foresight on technology. 
A decade ago, long before every media executive figured out that downloading was the future, Valve started an online service, Steam. It has since become for games what iTunes is to music -- a huge online distributor, in its case one with more than 40 million active users and that, by some estimates, accounts for about 70 percent of the PC games bought and downloaded from the Web. Through Steam, Valve effectively collects a toll on other companies' online game sales, in addition to making money from selling its own products.
On Monday, the company will begin a public test of a new television-friendly interface, Big Picture, for buying Steam games and playing them on computers in the living room.
''They're on the cutting edge of the future of this industry,'' says Peter Moore, the chief operating officer of Electronic Arts, a big games publisher that is both a Valve competitor and partner.
Now Valve executives think they may be onto the next big thing in games: wearable computing. The goggles I'm wearing -- reminiscent of the ones Google recently unveiled to much hoopla -- could unlock new game-playing opportunities. This technology could let players lose themselves inside a virtual reality and, eventually, blend games with their views of the physical world.
It's one thing if a bottomless money well like Google wants to sink its profits into Project Glass, its own wearable-computing initiative. But for a 300-person software company like Valve, developing eyeball computers seems an absurdly ambitious -- some say foolish -- enterprise.
Valve's exploration of new forms of game hardware comes as the PC, the device on which it has depended for much of its history, is changing in ways that could undermine its business. With a new PC operating system, Windows 8, coming out in October, Microsoft will start its own online marketplace for distributing software, including games. The move could take some of the, well, steam out of Steam.
Valve fosters unorthodox thinking through a corporate culture unusual even by the quirky standards of technology companies. While many start-ups pay lip service to flat organizational structures, Valve emphasizes that its workplace is truly ''boss-less.''
''We don't have any management, and nobody 'reports to' anybody else,'' reads Valve's handbook for new employees, which generated buzz this year when it leaked onto the Web.
Forget silly-sounding Silicon Valley job titles like code jedi or chief listener. Valve has no formal titles. The few employees who've put titles on business cards do so to satisfy outsiders apprehensive about working with people without labels. The same applies to Gabe Newell, one of Valve's founders.
''I think he's technically the C.E.O., but it's funny that I'm not even sure of that,'' says Greg Coomer, a designer and artist who was one of Valve's first employees. (For the record, Mr. Newell is technically Valve's chief executive.)
To spur creativity, Google management created the concept of ''20 percent time,'' the portion of employees' schedules that they could commit to entirely self-directed projects. At Valve, it's more like 100 percent time. New employees aren't even told where to work in the company. Instead, they are expected to decide on their own where they can contribute most. Many desks at Valve are on wheels. After figuring out what they want to do, workers simply push their desks over to the group they want to join.
A few years ago, a Valve hire who had worked in special effects in Hollywood balked at wheeling his desk. The news reached Mr. Newell, who promptly picked up the desk himself and carried it to the new location, to the new employee's embarrassment.
The man, whom Valve declined to name, is no longer with the company.
In an interview in a conference room at Valve's headquarters, Mr. Newell says that relatively few people have left Valve over the years. When they do, it's often because a sick parent needs help. In one case, Valve moved an employee's parents to the Seattle area, where one of them was also able to receive better cancer treatment.
''I get freaked out any time one person leaves,'' says Mr. Newell, a bearded bear of a man with John Lennon-style glasses. ''It seems like a bug in the system.''
THE company has been among its industry's leaders in engaging its audience. Valve won credibility early on with gamers by not merely tolerating the modification, or ''modding,'' of its games with players' own creations but encouraging it.
The consistent originality of its games, too, has resonated with players. Portal 2 is a brainteaser that hinges on a mysterious weapon called a portal gun that a player can use to open entrances through walls, floors and ceilings, along with corresponding exits somewhere else. Players can use the gun to propel themselves across a chasm by jumping vertically into a hole and out a portal position on a wall.
The game has inspired an amusing string of fan videos in which gamers use homemade portal guns, and a dose of special effects, to cross a busy street and jump through walls of their homes.
Valve's teams, dedicated to games and other projects, are clustered in open spaces around the five floors of the skyscraper the company occupies in this city, across Lake Washington from Seattle. Vintage pinball machines are arrayed around its corridors, and doors throughout its offices are etched with tributes to Team Fortress, a Valve game that features an evil virtual corporation that hates its customers and sells them inferior products.
''Mann Co. We sell products and get in fights,'' reads the sign on the door in Valve's lobby.
Valve has an eclectic work force. The company became interested in hiring one artist only after learning that his pastime was spray-painting graffiti art in Britain. It recently hired Leslie Redd, a school administrator, to lead an effort to use ''Portal'' to teach physics and other subjects in schools by offering a more engaging way to present ideas like escape velocity. Ms. Redd said that more than 2,000 teachers worldwide had registered to use the game in classes.
This year, Mr. Newell hired Yanis Varoufakis, a Greek economist, after being impressed with Mr. Varoufakis's personal blog, which he fills with commentary on the European financial crisis. Mr. Varoufakis, who had never heard of Valve and is not a gamer, is studying the workings of the virtual economies of Valve games, in which players can barter and sell items like hats and armor. He said he was drawn to the job partly by Valve's ''completely anti-authoritarian'' culture that, to his surprise, seemed to be working.
''What does Valve have to add to our perception of the evolution of corporate structures in the future?'' he said in a Skype interview from the Greek island of Aegina. ''Let's face it, the current state of that culture leaves a lot to be desired.''
Valve's most striking recruiting campaign is a recent move to establish a hardware group to develop technologies that can enhance the playing of games. The company posted a job listing for an industrial designer, hinting that it planned to get into the computer business itself. ''We're frustrated by the lack of innovation in the computer hardware space, though, so we're jumping in,'' the listing read. ''Even basic input, the keyboard and mouse, haven't really changed in any meaningful way over the years.''
Valve also recruited Jeri Ellsworth, an inventor and self-taught chip designer, whose pinball machines decorate Valve's offices. Ms. Ellsworth recently gave a tour of Valve's hardware laboratory, proudly showing off 3-D printers, a laser cutter and other industrial tools used to cobble together hardware prototypes. While interviewing for the job, she said, she was dubious about Valve's interest in hardware.
''At one point, I said a hardware lab could be very expensive, it could be like a million dollars,'' she recalled. ''Gabe said, 'That's it?' ''
A DRIVING force behind Valve's most far-out hardware project, wearable computing, is being led by Michael Abrash, a veteran of technology and game companies who helped Valve get off the ground in the 1990s by licensing its important game software from his employer at the time, Id Software. To Mr. Abrash, glasses that project games in front of players' eyes are an obvious next step from today's versions of wearable computers, smartphones and tablets.
While Google's glasses will display texts and video conferences, Valve has greater technical challenges to overcome with augmented-reality games. It has to figure out how to keep stable an image of a virtual object (say, a billboard) that is meant to be attached to a real-world object (the side of a building) while a player moves around. Otherwise, the illusion would be shattered.
Mr. Abrash said glasses capable of credible augmented-reality games could be three to five years away, though he said virtual reality glasses would arrive sooner. He said Valve hadn't decided whether it would make glasses itself. But its ultimate goal is to share its designs freely so other hardware companies can make glasses, too.
''Gabe has a saying, which is, 'We will do what we need to do,' '' Mr. Abrash says. ''We don't particularly want to be a company that makes hardware in large quantities. It's not what we do.''
Mr. Moore of Electronic Arts doubts that wearable-computing projects championed by the likes of Mr. Newell and Sergey Brin of Google will connect with the mainstream. ''It's appealing to them because they live in that outer fringe of I.Q. and money,'' he says.
Mr. Newell's technology vision is one reason that his comments this summer about Windows 8, which he called a ''catastrophe for everyone in the PC space,'' caused such an industry stir. He elaborated on some of his concerns more recently, saying he was troubled by a trend in computing toward devices that are less open to developers like Valve than they used to be. Apple kicked off the shift with its App Store for iOS devices, through which Apple controls the distribution of software that people can install on their iPhones and iPads, and takes a cut of the proceeds as well.
Mr. Newell concedes that this approach has been successful for Apple. He says, however, that he is concerned that Microsoft is taking a similar approach for Windows 8 applications, which will need to be distributed through a Microsoft app store if they take advantage of the most modern features in the operating system. Valve worries that Microsoft's control will undermine Steam on Windows 8 by creating a bottleneck for updates to games.
''We would say to Microsoft, we understand all these frustrations about the challenges to your business,'' he said. ''But trying to copy Apple will accelerate, not slow, Microsoft's decline.''
Mark Martin, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment.
SOME game executives say it's ironic that such concerns come from Valve, which has become a gatekeeper with Steam. Last year, the company had a dust-up with Electronic Arts over Steam's policy of taking a cut of all revenue generated from a game, like the sale of virtual goods, even after a player has bought the game. As a result, E.A. is not selling a number of its latest games through Steam.
Valve says that without such a policy, developers could easily game the Steam system by making all their software free and charging consumers for additional content later. It is worth pointing out, too, that E.A. last year began competing directly against Steam by starting its own online game store, Origin.
Valve can do without many formalities of a traditional company because it's privately held and controlled by Mr. Newell. He and Mike Harrington, who is no longer with the company, founded Valve in 1996 with the wealth they accumulated in Microsoft's early days. The company has never raised money from outside investors, so it is under no external pressure to sell itself or go public.
Not that Mr. Newell hasn't had opportunities to sell out. Valve has been pursued over the years by Electronic Arts, which would very likely have valued Valve at well over $1 billion had the talks progressed that far, said two people with knowledge of the discussion who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.
Although Valve's finances are private, Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that the company could be worth around $2.5 billion today.
Mr. Newell said that there was a better chance that Valve would ''disintegrate,'' its independent-minded workers scattering, than that it would ever be sold.
''It's way more likely we would head in that direction than say, 'Let's find some giant company that wants to cash us out and wait two or three years to have our employment agreements terminate,' '' he says.

HEADLINE: Rain and Rest Days Spell the End Of Super Saturday

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Say goodbye to Super Saturday, as we have known it. With its meteorological and emotional intensity, its drama kings and drama queens, Super Saturday has been the centerpiece of the United States Open for nearly three decades.
But this day of days is heading toward a multimillion-dollar extreme makeover of unknown structure. Next year the Open will try to please stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, by scheduling a day of rest between the semifinals and the finals for men and women.
Quite fittingly, this final edition of Super Saturday was haunted by weather, with warnings of extreme weather causing the day's program to be ended at 5:11 p.m. and forcing the Open to be extended to Monday for the fifth straight year. This latest improvisation might serve as a tryout for a scheduled Monday final as soon as next year.
This last Super Saturday began with rain and warnings of severe weather, forcing fans and workers to seek cover and closing down the tennis center for about half an hour before the scheduled 11 a.m. start of play. 
The threat of severe weather forced the women's final between Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka, scheduled for Saturday night, to be postponed until Sunday, which made sense. Given the ominous forecast, it made less sense to keep the Andy Murray-Tomas Berdych semifinal in Ashe Stadium (Murray won a long four-setter) and not move the David Ferrer-Novak Djokovic semifinal to Armstrong Stadium. That second match did not get out of the first set before storm warnings caused it to be postponed to Sunday.
David Brewer, the new tournament director, said he had hoped to get both matches in on Ashe without forcing fans to rush to an alternate match in the smaller Armstrong Stadium, which has happened in the past. There are other factors: the players, performers as well as competitors, do not like being shunted to a secondary stadium; and CBS understandably does not want both semifinals played simultaneously. Still, Open officials may have made the wrong decision after the 90-minute delay from the morning storm.
Turbulent weather in early September is not going to go away. But next year the format of the tournament is going to change.
''You have to start with the premise that players will get a day off between the semifinals and the finals,'' Sean McManus, the chairman of CBS Sports, said Friday in a telephone interview.
McManus listed two options for the men -- semifinals on Friday and final on Sunday, or semifinals on Saturday and final on Monday night -- with the women's finalists also getting a day off between matches, playing on Thursday and Saturday or on Friday and Sunday.
Many fans do not care if the men or the women have to play back-to-back -- not at the money the players make. But the game has become more physical because of the players' increased size and conditioning and the upgrade in firepower of the rackets. Contemporary tennis is more demanding on the players' bodies.
The wonder is that the players piped up at all. They know that Saturday and Sunday are the best days for CBS, which has been showing this tournament since 1968. The three other Grand Slam tournaments, two with roofs over their main courts and the French Open with a roof in the planning stage, have long separated the semifinals and the finals, but the Open has stayed with a model of women's semifinals on Friday and final on Saturday, and men's semifinals on Saturday and final on Sunday.
''Super Saturday has provided the greatest platform for tennis,'' Chris Widmaier, a spokesman for the United States Tennis Association, said last week.
''We recognize that the physicality of the game has changed,'' he said. ''We will provide a day of rest.''
Widmaier added, ''We still have certain scenarios to work out.''
McManus, when asked about the economics of restructuring, said: ''A lot of it is financial. We're analyzing it. They are well aware of it.''
The Monday finals the past four years were a sweet coda to the hectic two weeks, but murder on ratings.
''I can tell you that Monday night is awful,'' said Neal Pilson, who ran CBS Sports from 1981 through 1994 and is now a consultant and does not speak for the network.
Monday evening has belonged to the N.F.L. since Howard Cosell began emoting into the night in 1970. The longtime wisdom is that women will prefer alternative programming, which theoretically may include tennis.
Super Saturday became an instant sensation in 1984, when the men's semifinals were sandwiched around the women's final. The event was not yet billed as Super Saturday, just as the championship game of pro football was not named the Super Bowl when it came along after the 1966 season.
That Saturday in 1984 is still considered one of the great tennis days. It began with a bonus match between two former champions, Stan Smith and John Newcombe, not long past their prime.
In the first men's semifinal, Ivan Lendl outlasted Pat Cash in five sets, two of them tiebreakers, while Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert hung out together in the locker room, waiting.
''Now, it seems inconceivable that we didn't have a starting time for a final,'' Navratilova wrote last week in an e-mail. ''For me that was the most difficult thing. I think the Super Saturday was great for TV, and the fans, but horrible for all the players. Guys having to play such a big match at 11, then us and then the other semifinal where the winner is at a big disadvantage for Sunday. So a bad scenario all the way around for the players that brought the best day of tennis of the year for everyone else.''
The rivals shared Navratilova's stash of bagels until they finally got on the court, and Navratilova prevailed after losing the first set. Then John McEnroe outlasted Jimmy Connors in five sets, ending at 11:16 p.m., 12 hours after Super Saturday began.
CBS has continued to sell this super day of tennis, with adventures along the way. In 1987, the women's semifinals ran long on a Friday afternoon, and hearing that CBS might delay the first national evening newscast at 6:30 p.m., Dan Rather left the studio. When the match suddenly ended, through a series of glitches, CBS went dark for six long minutes.
The next morning, because of a forecast for bad weather, officials moved up the starting time for Super Saturday to 10 a.m. from 11 a.m. The two opponents scheduled for the early match, Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander, felt aggrieved enough to stage a Swedish-style uprising, arriving 15 minutes late. That showed 'em.
In 1996, with the women's final moved back to Sunday, Steffi Graf barely outlasted Monica Seles before a vicious gale lashed the center.
Now the male players are forcing the Open to rework its lucrative arrangement with CBS.
''You could make the argument that the reason these guys make so much money is from that exposure,'' Pilson said, referring not only to prize money, but also to endorsements.
''If they change it, they change the economics of it,'' Pilson continued.
''Life's a trade-off,'' he said.
The women have been making trade-offs, playing the semifinals and final back-to-back, although they play only best-of-three matches. In 2001, their final was given a separate time slot (and separate admission). CBS's McManus happens to know that in the 11 years of a separate final, ''we've never had more than two sets.'' Maybe the demise of Super Saturday will make that happen. Or not.

LITTLE AMERICAThe War Within the War for Afghanistan
By Rajiv ChandrasekaranIllustrated. 368 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95.
Rajiv Chandrasekaran has done it again. Like ''Imperial Life in the Emerald City,'' his chronicle of Washington's hapless management of the Iraq war in its early days, ''Little America'' is a beautifully written and deeply reported account of how a divided United States government and its dysfunctional bureaucracy have foiled American efforts abroad, this time to suppress the Taliban insurgency and bring stability to Afghanistan. It tells a story of political foibles, overly ambitious goals and feckless Afghans and Americans. The United States seems condemned to lurch between disastrous quick fixes and unrealistic visions of remaking countries overnight in its own image, never finding a middle road. No doubt most readers of this book will come away with the conclusion that our principal enemy in all this is ourselves. 
Chandrasekaran takes his title from an earlier effort to help Afghanistan. In the 1950s the Afghan king set out to bring prosperity to the rural southern region of his country through a huge development project supported by Afghan and American money. The construction giant Morrison Knudsen built a Little America enclave for engineers, workers and their families, complete with a swimming pool and card parties. In a telling vignette, Chandrasekaran recounts a riot that erupted in Kandahar when the conservative Pashtun elders found out that Afghan girls were being taught alongside boys in schools the Americans had built. The elders violently rejected this form of progress, but ultimately it was the land itself that thwarted the program: the salinity of the soil wrought havoc with most crops.
Fifty years later, the United States has repeated many of its past errors in the very same place. Chandrasekaran, an associate editor at The Washington Post, skewers the United States Agency for International Development, which refused to back an Afghan program to revive cotton gins in the south on the grounds that it would not be a free-market endeavor -- no matter that the American cotton industry depends on government protection. Another tragicomedy is a hydropower project at Kajaki Dam, in a guerrilla-infested corner of Helmand Province. If it is ever finished, it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars and only slightly increase the supply of electricity.
Such fiascoes highlight U.S.A.I.D.'s lack of management skill and expertise. But the most egregious error in development policy, Chandrasekaran shows, is a simple one: gushers of cash have been pumped into one of the world's poorest economies, creating Potemkin progress and a tidal wave of corruption.
If the American model for promoting economic growth is fundamentally broken, the same might be said for its wartime policy-making process. The Pentagon favored a broad counterinsurgency program, whereas the Obama White House wanted a narrower effort directed at preventing Al Qaeda from regaining a foothold in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the legendarily energetic and egotistic Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, pursued a third strategy, trying to negotiate an end to the Taliban insurgency, that was supported by neither the White House nor the military.
Chandrasekaran adds important new details to previous accounts of the crippling infighting at the top levels of government. Douglas E. Lute, the White House's chief adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the American ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry, engaged in perpetual bureaucratic warfare with Holbrooke and the Pentagon. Lute tried to get Holbrooke fired. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Holbrooke's friend and boss, protected his job, though his ceaseless forays, before his death, in quest of a Balkan-like peace deal were bearing no fruit. And while Holbrooke and Eikenberry were allied in their criticism of President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, neither had much influence with him. The only senior official to forge decent relations with Karzai was Stanley McChrystal, the four-star commander in Kabul, who resigned after his staff's scathing remarks about the White House became public. According to Chandrasekaran's sources, President Obama became increasingly skeptical of American involvement, but he did not intervene to stop the infighting that undermined whatever chance it might have had of succeeding.
On the military front, Chandrasekaran spent most of his time on the ground charting the Marines' operations in Helmand. They arrived to bolster the undermanned and faltering British effort, but Helmand, which had a booming opium crop, was not in any sense the strategic center of the war. Neighboring Kandahar, the Pashtun homeland and the Taliban heartland, had half the 20,000 troops that Helmand received. According to Chandrasekaran, both McChrystal and Lute recognized this as a misallocation of forces but did not correct it. The young Marines fought heroically, taking terrible casualties, especially from thickets of homemade mines affixed to irrigation canals, culverts and walls.
Some of the troops grumbled at the restrictions on air power that McChrystal had imposed to reduce the number of civilian casualties as being too soft on the enemy. But there was still plenty of killing in the fields of Helmand and western Kandahar. Explosives were used to blast open routes to villages on heavily mined roads, and when the 101st Airborne arrived in Arghandab District, it leveled a few villages that had been vacated except for Taliban fighters. Chandrasekaran tells the discouraging story of Harry Tunnell, the commander of the Fifth Brigade, Second Infantry Division, which took heavy casualties in Arghandab, came out swinging with rogue kill teams and never stopped. Tunnell was an unrepentant opponent of counterinsurgency who gave his brigade the moniker ''Destroyer'' during training, and ordered its vehicles painted with the motto ''Search and Destroy.'' Senior leaders wondered if he should have been relieved of command, but by the time his unit's possible crimes were uncovered, he was back home. An investigation absolved him of responsibility.
''Little America'' is a brilliant and courageous work of reportage. Its only weakness is a final chapter that feels more like a grab bag of complaints than a coherent critique. Chandrasekaran's contribution to our current debates over Afghanistan would have been greater had he answered more definitively the questions of whether Obama's policy was essentially unworkable, and whether there was a path not taken.
Chandrasekaran does provide some tantalizing possibilities. A diplomat advising the Marines in Helmand advocated a more modest but sustained approach, and, the author writes, ''he had been right all along: . . . Obama should have gone long, not big.'' Chandrasekaran also recounts a pragmatic attempt by the United States commander in Kandahar, Maj. Gen. James Terry, and his deputy Ken Dahl to achieve a balance among competing factions in the south, but this became a lost cause, Chandrasekaran says, once Ahmed Wali Karzai, one of the plan's chief Afghan architects, was murdered by an aide. Clearly, Afghanistan is a Hobbesian world of palace intrigue, where life for many will go on being nasty, brutish and short.

HEADLINE: What's a $4,000 Suit worth?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
A few years ago, Peter Frew came to New York with an important professional skill. He was one of maybe a few dozen people in the U.S. who could construct a true bespoke suit. Frew, who apprenticed with a Savile Row tailor, can -- all by himself, and almost all by hand -- create a pattern, cut fabric and expertly construct a suit that, for about $4,000, perfectly molds to its owner's body. In a city filled with very rich people, he quickly had all the orders he could handle. 
When I learned about Frew, I assumed he was some rich designer in an atelier on Madison Avenue. That's what Frew hopes to be one day, but for now the 33-year-old Jamaican immigrant works out of his ground-floor apartment near Flatbush Avenue, in Brooklyn, and makes around $50,000 a year. His former living room consists of one large table piled with bolts of cloth and a form with a half-made suit. As Frew sewed a jacket, he explained how he customizes every aspect of its design -- the width of the lapel, the number and size of the pockets -- for each client. What makes a bespoke suit unique, he said, is that it's the result of skills that only a trained hand can perform. Modern technology cannot create anything comparable.
As I watched Frew work, it became glaringly obvious why he is not rich. Like a 17th-century craftsman, he has no economy of scale. It takes Frew about 75 hours to make a suit -- he averages about two per month -- and he has no employees. A large part of his revenue is used to pay off his material expenses, and because his labor is so demanding, he relies on an outside salesman, who requires commissions. (Frew can't even afford to make a suit for himself. When we met, he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt.) While he hopes to one day hire full-time assistant tailors and rent a Manhattan showroom, he knows it will be a huge challenge to get there.
Tailors pose an odd riddle for our current economy. Why can't a wealthy city -- particularly at a time when the rich are doing so well -- support a niche business that people are willing to pay for? Even London, the historic home of the bespoke suit, isn't immune. During the 1980s and 1990s, Anderson & Sheppard -- the prestigious Savile Row suit maker to kings and movie stars -- seemed content to survive through its existing clients and, perhaps, their sons. But in 2005, Anda Rowland joined the company and began catering to newer customers. (She even plans to introduce a line of casual trousers and accessories to capture more of the brand's value.) Seven years ago, the company made 17 suits each week for revenue of $3.6 million. Today Anderson & Sheppard makes around 25 suits per week, for $5.4 million a year.
Growth of 40 percent over seven years is mediocre for many businesses and could get a C.E.O. fired from a large apparel firm. But for the bespoke industry, it's close to miraculous. As Rowland explained to me, even with a century-old reputation and a profoundly loyal customer base, it's nearly impossible to get ahead. ''There's no scalability,'' she explained. ''Whether we're making 50 suits or 1 -- each unit costs the same.''
In essence, Anderson & Sheppard simply faces a larger version of the problem plaguing Frew. Bespoke suits -- like expensive couture gowns -- are great for building a reputation, but they are lousy for business. And modern clothiers' profits have long come from establishing a strong brand and then emblazoning it on all sorts of cheaper products, like fragrances, which can be mass-produced. Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren -- not to mention Carolina Herrera -- began as small studios before spinning off into variegated billion-dollar businesses. Meanwhile, Anderson & Sheppard stuck to its stock in trade and has stayed about the same size.
The only way to make money in the perfectionist craftsperson industry, it seems, is to stop being a perfectionist craftsperson. However, Martin Greenfield Clothiers in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has maintained high-quality tailoring standards along with modern efficiencies for decades. Greenfield himself says the factory floors are almost the same as when this place opened, in 1916, and nearly identical to what he first saw when he got a job here in 1947, before he bought the factory. More than 100 tailors sit at sewing machines, some ancient, or work by hand.
Greenfield's factory makes custom suits, which are known in the business as made-to-measure. Customers can go to a third-party boutique, like J. Press, to pick a fabric and be measured. The cloth and measurements are then sent to Brooklyn, where patterns are created, fabric cut and then sent through the production line of cutters and tailors. Just as Adam Smith described in ''The Wealth of Nations,'' there are huge efficiency gains when one complex process is broken down into constituent parts and each worker specializes in one thing. At Greenfield, one worker sews pockets all day long, and another focuses entirely on joining front and back jacket pieces. The labor involved in each suit's construction is about 10 hours. The suits Greenfield makes typically retail at around $2,000.
Even with all those efficiency advantages, Greenfield isn't without its difficulties. Demand has fallen just as the cost of raw materials has gone up. Manufacturers in China, where a suit can be made in about 30 minutes at a cost well below $100, are driving up the price of wool, which increases the prices of fancier fabrics too. A few decades ago, there were thousands of clothing factories in New York. Now Greenfield's is one of only a handful left. He and his sons, Tod and Jay, who run the business with him, say there are several ways they could have made more money, but their two best bets are selling their building to a residential housing developer or moving their manufacturing operation to Asia.
Sentimentality aside, Greenfield told me that he has not even considered moving. Suiting is an apprenticeship business, and new employees learn their craft by watching the many people who have worked there for years. If they started over, they could never replicate that institutional knowledge. At the end of the day, he said, their only competitive advantage is that knowledge.
Unable to move, though, they're also unable to make much profit. They pay New York prices for all their services and are further undercut by cheaper suits coming from low-wage countries that use all the latest technology, which is, indeed, getting better. The glue that simulates stitches is nowhere near as good as hand sewing, but it's an awful lot better than it used to be. The whole marketing apparatus of fashion magazines, shows, billboards and celebrity endorsers is increasingly sophisticated. As the handcrafted stuff continues to cost more, it just keeps getting easier and cheaper to profit from mass-produced branded products.
Still, I kept thinking that if people spent the time to learn about suits, they'd value Frew's work so much more. But not everyone is willing to wait. Bespoke suits commonly require three fittings, and that's after a long consultation. Even the richest customer simply has to wait -- sometimes months -- before the new suit is finished. No wonder so many pass up a $4,000 bespoke suit for a ready-to-wear Kiton version at twice the price.
When I spoke to Frew, Rowland and the Greenfields, they talked about how there is now a large difference between what is monetizable and what is actually valuable. One of the defining attributes of capitalism is that the market determines what succeeds even if it means that the Kardashian Kollection might bring in more money than all the bespoke suits in the world.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. How can you not get rich selling $4,000 suits?
1.5. Insist on making them perfect.
2. The bespoke business is being squeezed by the luxury business it helped start.
3. Can it learn anything from the Kardashians?

HEADLINE: Controlling My Own Destiny

BYLINE: By RICHARD GELFOND. 
As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
MY parents raised me in a blue-collar neighborhood of Plainview, N.Y., on Long Island. My mother was a homemaker and my father was a furrier, a job that left him unemployed for months at a time, because no one bought fur coats during the summer.
One day I was visiting my father at work, and his supervisor told him that it was time to get back to work. From that day, I decided I wanted to be in control of my own destiny. I began by shining shoes and mowing lawns, then working as a shipping clerk at a fabric company. 
I'm a born entrepreneur, and in junior high school I started a monthly newspaper, The New York Ball, to carry news of New York sports teams. I enlisted other students to sell the paper at Madison Square Garden and Nassau Coliseum, and sold it at New York City newsstands and via subscriptions. I signed on some big advertisers like Keds shoes.
I worked my way through college at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, earning my bachelor's degree in three years. After graduating in 1976, I enrolled in the Northwestern University School of Law. I was on the law review and received my degree in 1979. Then I worked as a clerk to Max Rosenn, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia. He was a great influence on me and imparted advice that I still heed, such as to return every phone call every day and to spend as much time on philanthropy as on work.
In 1980, I joined Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, a New York law firm. But the lawyer's job is to counsel clients against risk. I thrive on risk-taking, so I decided that the law wasn't for me. Six years later, I started a dry-cleaning chain, built it to 30 stores and then sold it to a Colgate-Palmolive subsidiary.
In 1988, I joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in its mergers-and-acquisitions group during the wave of corporate takeovers. That's where I met my eventual business partner, Brad Wechsler.
I left as Drexel went bankrupt, and helped found a small investment bank. I later moved on to start Cheviot Capital Advisors, working on buyouts and venture capital investments. In 1993, a few years before I left Cheviot, Brad and I, backed by some investors, bought Imax, because it provided large, intensive film experiences, then mainly in museums and science centers. We took the company public in 1994, and I served as co-chairman. Two years later, I became co-chief executive and then chief executive. But around 2000, the business began to falter because the cinema industry had been overbuilt.
The company needed a new strategy, so we figured out how to convert Hollywood films to the Imax format. We also began to retrofit multiplex cinemas with Imax projectors and screens. The strategy has worked. When ''The Dark Knight'' had its premiere in 2008, it was on Imax screens in 149 theaters. Since then we have continued to expand, so that when ''The Dark Knight Rises'' opened this summer, it was on 600 Imax theater screens in more than 50 countries.
The shooting at a screening of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' in Colorado was shocking to everyone, and had an impact on me and our entire company. To express our support for the victims and their families, we made a corporate donation and are matching our employees' donations as well.
I have two daughters from my first marriage. In 2010, I married a second time, to Peggy Bonapace, also a Stony Brook graduate. We celebrated at Ellis Island, the place where our fathers entered the United States, hers from Italy and mine from Ukraine via Turkey.
There's a saying that I use a lot: ''It's never as bad as it looks or as good as it seems.'' I try to take that approach in life and toward managing the business. It has served me well.

HEADLINE: Why Brokers Study Chinese

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
WITH a torrent of money flowing into the United States from China, some savvy real estate brokers are trying to jump in farther upstream to better position themselves to win new clients.
When the New York market dried up at the end of 2008, Sotheby's International Realty turned its focus to Asia. The company dispatched one of its prominent brokers, Nikki Field, to travel to Asia to develop relationships with potential clients. She and her real estate partner, Kevin Brown, began making about four trips a year there, with a growing focus on mainland China.
''We wanted to get out ahead of the world's investment flow,'' Ms. Field said.
And with good reason. The explosion of wealth in China has created myriad new billionaires eager to diversify their holdings with real estate investments in the United States. Often, they are looking to give their children a plush crash pad for boarding school or college, or a place to live in when they start careers and families. Many wealthy Chinese are also looking for places to invest where they can preserve their wealth and avoid the rising inflation in major Chinese cities like Shanghai and Beijing. 
No city in the United States has been a bigger beneficiary of the Chinese buying wave than New York.
So to some brokers, it has made sense to more aggressively seek out Chinese buyers on their own turf.
Since 2008, Ms. Field said, she has been on an at times exasperating journey to understand China. She started taking Mandarin classes about two years ago. More recently she and Mr. Brown have been attending classes in Mandarin and business culture at the State University of New York's Confucius Institute for Business, a program that began in early 2011 and that is seeing a lot of interest from real estate brokers eager to sell to the Chinese.
While other major foreign buying groups in New York -- the Brazilians, the Russians and other Europeans -- all require some cultural understanding for brokers to be successful, no group has posed more of a challenge than the Chinese, brokers say.
The old way of doing business is no longer enough, Ms. Field said. ''We as Americans always expected anyone to adapt to our business style, and they did,'' she said. ''That is no longer true with the Chinese. There are too many of them, they have too much power. We truly must adapt to their style of business in order to do deals.''
Not all brokers agree that regular trips to China and classes in Chinese business protocol are necessary to win deals in Manhattan.
Janet Wang, a broker at the Corcoran Group, who along with her colleague Carrie Chiang, make up one of the more successful real estate teams doing deals with the Chinese in New York, said that they have politely declined invitations by banks and organizations to travel to China to talk about American real estate.
''I have yet to see how successful those cold approaches and road shows are,'' Ms. Wang said. ''Chinese, especially on the high end, rely heavily on the circle of their trusted friends and family members and people they have done business with in the past.''
Dolly Lenz, the vice chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that classes in Mandarin and Chinese culture aren't necessarily the answer.
''In my opinion, that won't be what will work in the end, but it can't hurt,'' Ms. Lenz said. ''What matters to them is trust. And they expect you to be on the ball and know everything.''
Ms. Lenz hasn't made a trip to Asia in six years. She said she continues to rely on the web of contacts she made during an eight-year span when she made some 25 trips to Asia.
Still, she is benefiting from the Chinese buying wave. Half of her clients now come from Asia, many of them from China. That is twice as many as she had two years ago, she said.
Chinese billionaires continue to buy high-end properties in buildings like the Time Warner Center, 15 Central Park West and the newest, One57. But in May and June she saw something different: an ''almost overwhelming volume'' of calls and sales driven largely by interest in apartments ranging from $3 million to $6 million -- what Ms. Lenz calls the ''middle market'' in Manhattan.
Chinese buyers are also no longer paying all cash as they were a few years ago. In recent months, several Chinese buyers have financed their purchases, some with United States-based loans, Ms. Lenz said. They seem to be leveraging in New York so they can also buy properties in Los Angeles, London or other cities, she said.
On her trips to China, Ms. Field has noticed a change in the conversation among potential clients. ''When I first went over there five years ago, my presentations all had to be about return,'' she said.
''Everyone was looking for returns. Two years ago, return questions almost dried up. Now it is all about wealth preservation. They are anticipating a bubble'' in China, she added.
For Ms. Field's team, that concern has translated into growing sales. Meetings with 37 potential Chinese clients this year resulted in nine signed contracts or closings on properties in Manhattan, at prices ranging from $3.5 million to $50 million. Most of those were at One57, she said.
Groups of Chinese are making their way to New York for house-hunting tours. A Mandarin-English luxury lifestyle magazine, YUE, is organizing a real estate conference in New York in October at which Ms. Field is scheduled to speak. More than 150 wealthy Chinese that Sotheby's has reached out to are expected to attend, she said.
After five years of traveling to Asia, Ms. Field acknowledges that she is still not fluent in Mandarin and has ''only scratched the surface on the choreography'' required to be successful with the mainland Chinese. There is proper protocol with greetings to consider, welcome gifts, seating and who eats when at meals. There are nuances related to distinguishing business time and social time.
Understanding Chinese negotiating styles has been a challenge, she said.
But nothing is more puzzling to brokers and non-Chinese sellers than feng shui, the Chinese belief system that often dictates a final purchase decision. Apartments need to be feng shui-friendly. The layout of the apartment -- which direction it faces, where the kitchen and bathrooms are -- are all factors. Ms. Wang said some of her clients have a family feng shui counselor ''on speed dial'' and won't hesitate to fly him or her in from China with a compass to evaluate a potential purchase.
Numbers are a particular focus. The number eight sounds like the word for ''prosperity,'' and that is one reason some of the full-floor apartments at One57 were sold early to Chinese buyers for about $50 million apiece. The Extell Development Company, which is building One57, specifically set aside apartment 88 for Chinese buyers, and it is under contract to a Chinese buyer, Ms. Field said.
Developers like Extell and the Related Companies have tried to make buildings feng shui-friendly. The designer Clodagh created peaceful, harmonious lobbies at the Caledonia in West Chelsea and at 225 Rector in Battery Park City that have helped make those buildings popular with Chinese buyers, said Sherry Tobak, a senior vice president of the Related Companies.
But some buildings simply face an uphill battle. At 995 Fifth Avenue, the former Stanhope Hotel, Ms. Field said that Chinese buyers in Beijing and Shanghai initially were excited about an 8,000-square-foot apartment she was selling for $30 million -- until they realized it was a restoration, not a new building. ''They were very concerned about past lives that were inhabiting the building,'' Ms. Field said.
A development at the former Drake Hotel site, 425 Park Avenue, which will be the city's tallest residential building (and some say the country's) when it opens, is not likely to have many Chinese residents. The number four sounds like the word for ''death'' in Chinese. Both Ms. Field and Ms. Lenz said they haven't received any calls from the Chinese, although wealthy Russians keep calling.
But knowing that four is not a good number to have in an address is the easy part. ''I have talked to my tutors about this, hoping to get a road map, so I would understand what would be approved as good feng shui versus bad, but there is no road map,'' Ms. Field said.
Ms. Field is off to Asia again in two weeks, this time on a swing through Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, Sotheby's auction house will be selling art and wine. She is expecting the event to attract a lot of high-net-worth Asians from the region.
''It is drawing bigger numbers than our auction houses have in the past for any sales,'' Ms. Field said. ''They are buying art and also looking for the houses to put the art in.''

HEADLINE: What to See Next? Gaze at the Horizons

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
''What should I see?''
These are words that can stir excitement, anxiety or occasionally embarrassment in the soul of a theater critic. When the crop of new shows is worth celebrating, the question is answered with ardor. When the season is unusually fallow, we are likely to do some hemming and hawing before mumbling forth an apologetic, ''Um, well, have you seen 'Book of Mormon'?''
The advice seekers tend to swarm as the fall season approaches, and this year I have hit upon an easy answer: ''See whatever's onstage at Playwrights Horizons.''
Almost since its inception in 1971 Playwrights Horizons has been a mainstay of Off Broadway and possesses one of the most distinguished histories among New York's producers of new work. The list of playwrights discovered or supported by the company over the years is practically a Who's Who of contemporary drama. It added to its roster of Pulitzer Prize winners with a fifth for Bruce Norris's ''Clybourne Park,'' which had its premiere at Playwrights Horizons before moving on to Broadway. 
This season is a remarkably promising one even by the company's own high standards. It opens with a bang with Lisa D'Amour's ''Detroit,'' a Pulitzer Prize finalist last year that I first caught at its premiere at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago. A dark, fiercely funny comedy about class, money and the marital tensions that our seemingly endless white-knuckle economic era can breed, ''Detroit'' is one of the most trenchant new plays I've seen in the last few years.
Anne Kauffman is directing the New York production. Even better news: The production occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of the terrific Amy Ryan, whose career in film and television has lately taken her to Hollywood. She stars opposite another well-known television star, David Schwimmer of ''Friends,'' and the cast is rounded out by Darren Pettie, Sarah Sokolovic and the veteran John Cullum.
''Detroit'' is a known quantity, at least to me, so I'm even more intrigued by what follows in the company's season: the main-stage debuts of two young playwrights whose work has been consistently terrific. Both broke through to New York acclaim with productions on Playwrights Horizons' smaller stage: Amy Herzog with ''After the Revolution'' and Annie Baker with ''Circle Mirror Transformation.''
Beginning in November is ''The Great God Pan'' by Ms. Herzog, a drama about the revelation of a family secret whose reverberations threaten to upend the promising life of a budding Brooklyn journalist. Carolyn Cantor, who directed ''After the Revolution,'' undertakes the same chores here, and the first-rate cast includes Becky Ann Baker, Peter Friedman and Keith Nobbs. (I might just as easily answer the ''what to see'' question with the response ''anything by Amy Herzog''; New York Theater Workshop will produce her superb psychological drama ''Belleville'' in the spring.)
Following ''The Great God Pan'' on the main stage beginning in February is ''The Flick,'' by Ms. Baker. Set in a slightly down-at-heels movie theater in a central Massachusetts town, the play depicts the relationships among the theater's three underpaid employees.
Stale popcorn and gum under the seats? Doesn't sound like fertile ground for lively drama, but Ms. Baker has a seemingly boundless talent for bringing forth the beauty in the quiet give and take among seemingly unprepossessing or undistinguished characters, evinced both in ''Circle Mirror'' and ''The Aliens,'' a finely wrought comedy-drama.
''The Flick'' also continues Ms. Baker's collaboration with the director Sam Gold, one of the most fruitful partnerships in the New York theater today. Mr. Gold directed both ''Circle Mirror'' and ''Aliens,'' and they teamed over the summer to present a vital, intimate new version of ''Uncle Vanya'' for Soho Rep.
The main-stage roster at Playwrights wraps with one of the most highly anticipated new musicals of the season, ''Far From Heaven,'' which sounds far more enticing than the dispiriting crop on tap for Broadway. (A musical about Aimee Semple McPherson with a score by Kathie Lee Gifford? I think I'd rather see a musical about Kathie Lee Gifford with a score by Aimee Semple McPherson, fantastical though the idea is.)
True, ''Far From Heaven'' represents yet another example of the increasingly exhausted Netflix model of new musical making. It's based on the movie by Todd Haynes, which is itself a homage to the sudsy melodramas of Douglas Sirk. But the creative team inspires confidence: The score is by Scott Frankel and Michael Korie, who wrote the songs for the musical version of ''Grey Gardens.'' (At least they show admirably eccentric, offbeat taste in choosing the movies they make into musicals.) Michael Greif, who directed the premiere production of ''Grey Gardens'' at Playwrights Horizons before it moved to Broadway, is also staging ''Far From Heaven,'' and the book is by the veteran playwright Richard Greenberg (''Three Days of Rain,'' ''Take Me Out'').
The A-list talent isn't all behind the scenes either. In the central role of Cathy Whitaker, a happily domesticated wife and mother in 1957 Connecticut who embarks on a romance that shakes up her tidy little world, is Kelli O'Hara. Her bright soprano and natural grace, now being shown to fine effect in ''Nice Work If You Can Get It'' on Broadway, are among the happy wonders of the New York musical theater.
Add two promising new plays on the company's smaller stage -- ''The Whale'' by Samuel D. Hunter, author of the much-admired ''Bright New Boise,'' and ''The Call'' by Tanya Barfield (''Blue Door'') -- and the Playwrights Horizons season appears, on paper at least, to be a season worth singing about.

HEADLINE: The Weatherman Is Not a Moron

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
From the inside, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction looked like a cross between a submarine command center and a Goldman Sachs trading floor. Twenty minutes outside Washington, it consisted mainly of sleek workstations manned by meteorologists working an armada of flat-screen monitors with maps of every conceivable type of weather data for every corner of the country. The center is part of the National Weather Service, which Ulysses S. Grant created under the War Department. Even now, it remains true to those roots. Many of its meteorologists have a background in the armed services, and virtually all speak with the precision of former officers. 
They also seem to possess a high-frequency-trader's skill for managing risk. Expert meteorologists are forced to arbitrage a torrent of information to make their predictions as accurate as possible. After receiving weather forecasts generated by supercomputers, they interpret and parse them by, among other things, comparing them with various conflicting models or what their colleagues are seeing in the field or what they already know about certain weather patterns -- or, often, all of the above. From station to station, I watched as meteorologists sifted through numbers and called other forecasters to compare notes, while trading instant messages about matters like whether the chance of rain in Tucson should be 10 or 20 percent. As the information continued to flow in, I watched them draw on their maps with light pens, painstakingly adjusting the contours of temperature gradients produced by the computers -- 15 miles westward over the Mississippi Delta or 30 miles northward into Lake Erie -- in order to bring them one step closer to accuracy.
These meteorologists are dealing with a small fraction of the 2.5 quintillion bytes of information that, I.B.M. estimates, we generate each day. That's the equivalent of the entire printed collection of the Library of Congress about three times per second. Google now accesses more than 20 billion Web pages a day; the processing speed of an iPad rivals that of last generation's most powerful supercomputers. All that information ought to help us plan our lives and profitably predict the world's course. In 2008, Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired magazine, wrote optimistically of the era of Big Data. So voluminous were our databases and so powerful were our computers, he claimed, that there was no longer much need for theory, or even the scientific method. At the time, it was hard to disagree.
But if prediction is the truest way to put our information to the test, we have not scored well. In November 2007, economists in the Survey of Professional Forecasters -- examining some 45,000 economic-data series -- foresaw less than a 1-in-500 chance of an economic meltdown as severe as the one that would begin one month later. Attempts to predict earthquakes have continued to envisage disasters that never happened and failed to prepare us for those, like the 2011 disaster in Japan, that did.
The one area in which our predictions are making extraordinary progress, however, is perhaps the most unlikely field. Jim Hoke, a director with 32 years experience at the National Weather Service, has heard all the jokes about weather forecasting, like Larry David's jab on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' that weathermen merely forecast rain to keep everyone else off the golf course. And to be sure, these slick-haired and/or short-skirted local weather forecasters are sometimes wrong. A study of TV meteorologists in Kansas City found that when they said there was a 100 percent chance of rain, it failed to rain at all one-third of the time.
But watching the local news is not the best way to assess the growing accuracy of forecasting (more on this later). It's better to take the long view. In 1972, the service's high-temperature forecast missed by an average of six degrees when made three days in advance. Now it's down to three degrees. More stunning, in 1940, the chance of an American being killed by lightning was about 1 in 400,000. Today it's 1 in 11 million. This is partly because of changes in living patterns (more of our work is done indoors), but it's also because better weather forecasts have helped us prepare.
Perhaps the most impressive gains have been in hurricane forecasting. Just 25 years ago, when the National Hurricane Center tried to predict where a hurricane would hit three days in advance of landfall, it missed by an average of 350 miles. If Hurricane Isaac, which made its unpredictable path through the Gulf of Mexico last month, had occurred in the late 1980s, the center might have projected landfall anywhere from Houston to Tallahassee, canceling untold thousands of business deals, flights and picnics in between -- and damaging its reputation when the hurricane zeroed in hundreds of miles away. Now the average miss is only about 100 miles.
Why are weather forecasters succeeding when other predictors fail? It's because long ago they came to accept the imperfections in their knowledge. That helped them understand that even the most sophisticated computers, combing through seemingly limitless data, are painfully ill equipped to predict something as dynamic as weather all by themselves. So as fields like economics began relying more on Big Data, meteorologists recognized that data on its own isn't enough.
The I.B.M. Bluefire supercomputer in the basement of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., is so large that it essentially creates its own weather. The 77 trillion calculations that Bluefire makes each second, in its mass of blinking lights and coaxial cable, generate so much radiant energy that it requires a liquid cooling system. The room where Bluefire resides is as drafty as a minor-league hockey rink, and it's loud enough that hearing protection is suggested.
The 11 cabinets that hold the supercomputer are long and narrow and look like space-age port-a-potties. When I mentioned this to Rich Loft, the director of technology development for NCAR, he was not amused. To him, this computer represents the front line in an age-old struggle to predict our environment. ''You go back to Chaco Canyon or Stonehenge,'' Loft said, ''and people realized they could predict the shortest day of the year and the longest day -- that the moon moved in predictable ways. But there are things an ancient man couldn't predict: ambush from some kind of animal, a flash flood or a thunderstorm.''
For centuries, meteorologists relied on statistical tables based on historical averages -- it rains about 45 percent of the time in London in March, for instance -- to predict the weather. But these statistics are useless on a day-to-day level. Jan. 12, 1888, was a relatively warm day on the Great Plains until the temperature dropped almost 30 degrees in a matter of hours and a blinding snowstorm hit. More than a hundred children died of hypothermia on their way home from school that day. Knowing the average temperature for a January day in Topeka wouldn't have helped much in a case like that.
The holy grail of meteorology, scientists realized, was dynamic weather prediction -- programs that simulate the physical systems that produce clouds and cold fronts, windy days in Chicago and the morning fog over San Francisco as they occur. Theoretically, the laws that govern the physics of the weather are fairly simple. In 1814, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace postulated that the movement of every particle in the universe should be predictable as long as meteorologists could know the position of all those particles and how fast they are moving. Unfortunately, the number of molecules in the earth's atmosphere is perhaps on the order of 100 tredecillion, which is a 1 followed by 44 zeros. To make perfect weather predictions, we would not only have to account for all of those molecules, but we would also need to solve equations for all 100 tredecillion of them at once.
The most intuitive way to simplify the problem was to break the atmosphere down into a finite series of boxes, or what meteorologists variously refer to as a matrix, a lattice or a grid. The earliest credible attempt at this, according to Loft, was made in 1916 by an English physicist named Lewis Fry Richardson, who wanted to determine the weather over northern Germany on May 20, 1910. This was not technically a prediction, because the date was some six years in the past, but Richardson treated it that way, and he had a lot of data: a series of observations of temperature, barometric pressures and wind speeds that had been gathered by the German government. And as a pacifist serving a volunteer ambulance unit in northern France, he also had a lot of time on his hands. So Richardson broke Germany down into a series of two-dimensional boxes, each measuring three degrees of latitude by three degrees of longitude. Then he went to work trying to solve the equations that governed the weather in each square and how they might affect weather in the adjacent ones.
Richardson's experiment failed miserably. It ''predicted'' a dramatic rise in barometric pressure that hadn't occurred and produced strange-looking weather patterns that didn't resemble any seen in Germany before or since. Had he made a computational error? Were his equations buggy? It was hard to say. Even the most devoted weather nerds weren't eager to solve differential equations for months on end to double-check his work for one day in one country six years in the past.
What Richardson needed, he thought, was more manpower. He envisioned a weather-forecasting center with some 64,000 meteorologists, all working simultaneously to have the computational speed to make accurate weather forecasts in real time. His dream came to fruition (sort of) in 1950, when the first computer weather forecast was tried by the mathematician John von Neumann and a team of scientists at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. They used a machine that could make about 5,000 calculations a second, which was quite possibly as fast as 64,000 men. Alas, 5,000 calculations a second was no match for the weather. As it turned out, their forecast wasn't much better than a random guess.
Our views about predictability are inherently flawed. Take something that is often seen as the epitome of randomness, like a coin toss. While it may at first appear that there's no way to tell whether a coin is going to come up heads or tails, a group of mathematicians at Stanford is able to predict the outcome virtually 100 percent of the time, provided that they use a special machine to flip it. The machine does not cheat -- it flips the coin the exact same way (the same height, with the same strength and torque) over and over again -- and the coin is fair. Under those conditions, there is no randomness at all.
The reason that we view coin flips as unpredictable is because when we toss them, we're never able to reproduce the exact same motion. A similar phenomenon applies to the weather. In the late 1950s, the renowned M.I.T. mathematician Edward Lorenz was toiling away in his original profession as a meteorologist. Then, in the tradition of Alexander Fleming and penicillin or the New York Knicks and Jeremy Lin, he made a major discovery purely by accident. At the time, Lorenz and his team were trying to advance the use of computer models in weather prediction. They were getting somewhere, or so they thought, until the computer started spitting out contradictory results. Lorenz and his colleagues began with what they believed were exactly the same data and ran what they thought was exactly the same code; still, the program somehow forecast clear skies over Colorado in one run and a thunderstorm in the next.
After spending weeks double-checking their hardware and trying to debug their code, Lorenz and his team discovered that their data weren't exactly the same. The numbers had been rounded off in the third decimal place. Instead of having the barometric pressure in one corner of their grid read 29.5168, for example, it might instead read 29.517. This couldn't make that much of a difference, could it? Actually, Lorenz realized, it could, and he devoted the rest of his career to studying strange behaviors like these by developing a branch of mathematics called chaos theory, the most basic tenet of which is described in the title of his breakthrough 1972 paper, ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?'' In other words, a small change in initial conditions can produce a large and unexpected divergence in outcomes.
Chaos theory does not imply that the behavior of the system is literally random. It just means that certain types of systems are very hard to predict. If you know the exact conditions of a coin as it leaves someone's hand, you can -- with the right laboratory equipment -- predict, almost perfectly, which side it will land on. And yet the slightest disturbance to that motion can change a coin toss from being almost wholly predictable to almost wholly unpredictable.
The problem with weather is that our knowledge of its initial conditions is highly imperfect, both in theory and practice. A meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told me that it wasn't unheard-of for a careless forecaster to send in a 50-degree reading as 500 degrees. The more fundamental issue, though, is that we can observe our surroundings with only a certain degree of precision. No thermometer is perfect, and it isn't physically possible to stick one into every molecule in the atmosphere.
Weather also has two additional properties that make forecasting even more difficult. First, weather is nonlinear, meaning that it abides by exponential rather than by arithmetic relationships. Second, it's dynamic -- its behavior at one point in time influences its behavior in the future. Imagine that we're supposed to be taking the sum of 5 and 5, but we keyed in the second number as 6 by mistake. That will give us an answer of 11 instead of 10. We'll be wrong, but not by much; addition, as a linear operation, is pretty forgiving. Exponential operations, however, extract a lot more punishment when there are inaccuracies in our data. If instead of taking 5^5 -- which should be 3,125 -- we instead take 5^6, we wind up with an answer of 15,625. This problem quickly compounds when the process is dynamic, because outputs at one stage of the process become our inputs in the next.
Given how daunting the challenge was, it must have been tempting to give up on the idea of building a dynamic weather model altogether. A thunderstorm might have remained roughly as unpredictable as an earthquake. But by embracing the uncertainty of the problem, their predictions started to make progress. ''What may have distinguished [me] from those that proceeded,'' Lorenz later reflected in ''The Essence of Chaos,'' his 1993 book, ''was the idea that chaos was something to be sought rather than avoided.''
Perhaps because chaos theory has been a part of meteorological thinking for nearly four decades, professional weather forecasters have become comfortable treating uncertainty the way a stock trader or poker player might. When weather.gov says that there's a 20 percent chance of rain in Central Park, it's because the National Weather Service recognizes that our capacity to measure and predict the weather is accurate only up to a point. ''The forecasters look at lots of different models: Euro, Canadian, our model -- there's models all over the place, and they don't tell the same story,'' Ben Kyger, a director of operations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me. ''Which means they're all basically wrong.'' The National Weather Service forecasters who adjusted temperature gradients with their light pens were merely interpreting what was coming out of those models and making adjustments themselves. ''I've learned to live with it, and I know how to correct for it,'' Kyger said. ''My whole career might be based on how to interpret what it's telling me.''
Despite their astounding ability to crunch numbers in nanoseconds, there are still things that computers can't do, contends Hoke at the National Weather Service. They are especially bad at seeing the big picture when it comes to weather. They are also too literal, unable to recognize the pattern once it's subjected to even the slightest degree of manipulation. Supercomputers, for instance, aren't good at forecasting atmospheric details in the center of storms. One particular model, Hoke said, tends to forecast precipitation too far south by around 100 miles under certain weather conditions in the Eastern United States. So whenever forecasters see that situation, they know to forecast the precipitation farther north.
But there are literally countless other areas in which weather models fail in more subtle ways and rely on human correction. Perhaps the computer tends to be too conservative on forecasting nighttime rainfalls in Seattle when there's a low-pressure system in Puget Sound. Perhaps it doesn't know that the fog in Acadia National Park in Maine will clear up by sunrise if the wind is blowing in one direction but can linger until midmorning if it's coming from another. These are the sorts of distinctions that forecasters glean over time as they learn to work around potential flaws in the computer's forecasting model, in the way that a skilled pool player can adjust to the dead spots on the table at his local bar.
Among the National Weather Service's detailed records is a thorough comparison of how well the computers are doing by themselves alongside the value that humans are contributing. According to the agency's statistics, humans improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts by about 25 percent over the computer guidance alone. They improve the temperature forecasts by about 10 percent. Humans are good enough, in fact, that when the organization's Cray supercomputer burned down, in 1999, their high-temperature forecasts remained remarkably accurate. ''You almost can't have a meeting without someone mentioning the glory days of the Cray fire,'' Kyger said, pointing to a mangled, half-burnt piece of the computer that was proudly displayed in the office where I met him. ''If you weren't here for that, you really weren't part of the brotherhood.''
Still, most people take their forecasts for granted. Like a baseball umpire, a weather forecaster rarely gets credit for getting the call right. Last summer, meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center were tipped off to something serious when nearly all their computer models indicated that a fierce storm was going to be climbing the Northeast Corridor. The eerily similar results between models helped the center amplify its warning for Hurricane Irene well before it touched down on the Atlantic shore, prompting thousands to evacuate their homes. To many, particularly in New York, Irene was viewed as a media-manufactured nonevent, but that was largely because the Hurricane Center nailed its forecast. Six years earlier, the National Weather Service also made a nearly perfect forecast of Hurricane Katrina, anticipating its exact landfall almost 60 hours in advance. If public officials hadn't bungled the evacuation of New Orleans, the death toll might have been remarkably low.
In a time when forecasters of all types make overconfident proclamations about political, economic or natural events, uncertainty is a tough sell. It's much easier to hawk overconfidence, no matter if it's any good. A long-term study of political forecasts conducted by Philip Tetlock, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, found that when political experts described an event as being absolutely certain, it failed to transpire an astonishing 25 percent of the time.
The Weather Service has struggled over the years with how much to let the public in on what it doesn't exactly know. In April 1997, Grand Forks, N.D., was threatened by the flooding Red River, which bisects the city. Snowfall had been especially heavy in the Great Plains that winter, and the service, anticipating runoff as the snow melted, predicted that the Red would crest to 49 feet, close to the record. Because the levees in Grand Forks were built to handle a flood of 52 feet, a small miss in the forecast could prove catastrophic. The margin of error on the Weather Service's forecast -- based on how well its flood forecasts had done in the past -- implied about a 35 percent chance of the levees' being topped.
The waters, in fact, crested to 54 feet. It was well within the forecast's margin of error, but enough to overcome the levees and spill more than two miles into the city. Cleanup costs ran into the billions of dollars, and more than 75 percent of the city's homes were damaged or destroyed. Unlike a hurricane or an earthquake, the Grand Forks flood may have been preventable. The city's flood walls could have been reinforced using sandbags. It might also have been possible to divert the overflow into depopulated areas. But the Weather Service had explicitly avoided communicating the uncertainty in its forecast to the public, emphasizing only the 49-foot prediction. The forecasters later told researchers that they were afraid the public might lose confidence in the forecast if they had conveyed any uncertainty.
Since then, the National Weather Service has come to recognize the importance of communicating the uncertainty in its forecasts as completely as possible. ''Uncertainty is the fundamental component of weather prediction,'' said Max Mayfield, an Air Force veteran who ran the National Hurricane Center when Katrina hit. ''No forecast is complete without some description of that uncertainty.'' Under Mayfield's guidance, the National Hurricane Center began to pay much more attention to how it presents its forecasts. Instead of just showing a single track line for a hurricane's predicted path, their charts prominently feature a cone of uncertainty, which many in the business call ''the cone of chaos.''
Unfortunately, this cautious message can be undercut by private-sector forecasters. Catering to the demands of viewers can mean intentionally running the risk of making forecasts less accurate. For many years, the Weather Channel avoided forecasting an exact 50 percent chance of rain, which might seem wishy-washy to consumers. Instead, it rounded up to 60 or down to 40. In what may be the worst-kept secret in the business, numerous commercial weather forecasts are also biased toward forecasting more precipitation than will actually occur. (In the business, this is known as the wet bias.) For years, when the Weather Channel said there was a 20 percent chance of rain, it actually rained only about 5 percent of the time.
People don't mind when a forecaster predicts rain and it turns out to be a nice day. But if it rains when it isn't supposed to, they curse the weatherman for ruining their picnic. ''If the forecast was objective, if it has zero bias in precipitation,'' Bruce Rose, a former vice president for the Weather Channel, said, ''we'd probably be in trouble.''
The National Weather Service, on the other hand, takes plenty of blame when its cautious forecasts seem retrospectively unwarranted. I was reminded of this when I arrived in Tampa for the Republican National Convention. The city was briefly in Hurricane Isaac's cone of chaos before the storm took a westward tack. The airport and roads were remarkably quiet, no doubt because some reporters and delegates (and thousands of tourists) heeded caution and stayed home. When I so much as mentioned the weather forecast, my taxi driver turned and launched into a series of obscenities.

LE POÈME HARMONIQUE New Yorkers have done well in recent years to make the acquaintance of L'Arpeggiata, a Paris-based ensemble that combines the highest level of early-music artistry and imagination with shifting degrees of theatricality. Now another fine French-based early-music group, which likes additionally to perform by candlelight if not in total darkness, receives its most prominent New York exposure to date, opening the season of the Miller Theater at Columbia University. The program, ''Venezia,'' is predictably heavy on works by Monteverdi, less predictably so on works by Francesco Manelli. Then again, Le Poème, like L'Arpeggiata, seems to put little premium on predictability. Just keep an open mind, and revel in the unexpected. Wednesday, Friday. (James R. Oestreich) 
TWELVE IN '12 Though by now it has been reduced to Nine in '12. Julian Wachner's music program at Trinity Wall Street, which did spectacular service in the first half of last season, especially for the Sept. 11 anniversary commemorations, only to be suspended for much of the second half for a re-evaluation of finances and purpose, is back and seeking new challenges. Under Mr. Wachner the program has become a hotbed of early music, especially with the Trinity Choir's Bach at One series at St. Paul's Chapel (which resumes on Oct. 1). Now, expanding the activities of Trinity's instrumental ensemble Novus NY, Mr. Wachner plans to make contemporary music an equal partner. Here, in a series of hourlong midday concerts, he opens the Trinity season with works by Pulitzer Prize-winning composers of the last dozen years. The first program, scheduled for last Thursday, offered works of Steven Stucky, Zhou Long and Paul Moravec. This week's concert features Jennifer Higdon, David Lang and John Corigliano. Still to come are Kevin Puts, Yehudi Wyner, John Adams, Henry Brant, Steve Reich and Ornette Coleman. Thursday (also Sept. 20, 27). Trinity Church. (J.R.O.)
'EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH' There have been many great operas, but only a few have redefined the very meaning of the art form. Of that select group, Monteverdi's ''Orfeo'' and Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' receive regular performances, but Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's 1976 masterpiece, ''Einstein on the Beach,'' which stretched the bounds of duration and plotlessness, is more talked about than seen. That makes this revival of the original production, part of an international tour honoring Mr. Glass's 75th birthday, one of the season's crucial events. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. Opens Friday. (Zachary Woolfe)
'I DUE FOSCARI' The Los Angeles Opera has retrenched artistically in recent seasons, having taken a huge chance on Achim Freyer's ambitious, often brilliant production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle. This year the only divergence from the standard repertory is this rarely performed tale of political and personal intrigue in 15th-century Venice, which is being mounted for the company's general director, the tenor Plácido Domingo, as he takes another step on his controversial path through Verdi's baritone roles. He is joined by the tenor Francesco Meli and the soprano Marina Poplavskaya; James Conlon, the company's music director, conducts. Opens Saturday. Los Angeles Opera, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, (213) 972-8001, laopera.com. (Z.W.)
NATE WOOLEY When this avant-garde trumpeter played part of his mesmerizing ''Seven Storey Mountain'' at Issue Project Room in June, he used a trumpet without a mouthpiece, amplifying it to create breathy, lightly pitched, sometimes squawking, sometimes almost spoken sounds that whispered over a dense shimmer of other instruments. He returns, again under the auspices of Issue Project Room, with another of the instrument's innovators, Mazen Kerbaj, for an evening of solos and duets. Sept. 19. Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral, 113 Remsen Street, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Alan Gilbert and the orchestra have restructured the opening of their season so that it no longer begins with a gala concert, however frothy. (That happens on Sept. 27, with Itzhak Perlman playing morsels by Massenet and Kreisler, and Mr. Gilbert adding Respighi's ''Fountains of Rome'' and ''Pines of Rome.'') Instead the season opens with a substantial subscription program: Gyorgy Kurtag's ''... quasi una fantasia ...''; Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Leif Ove Andsnes as soloist; and Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' You may run into ''The Rite'' a lot this season, in anticipation of the 100th anniversary of its scandalous premiere in May. (Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic also open their subscription season with it on Sept. 28.) But in this case it may be as much a matter of Mr. Gilbert's wanting to continue honing his interpretation of a thorny classic that he also performed in March, with the Juilliard Orchestra. Sept. 19-22. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
COMPOSER PORTRAITS This invaluable series -- the centerpiece of the Miller Theater's programming, established by George Steel and carried through admirably by his success sor as director of the theater, Melissa Smey, with, bless her, a greater concentration on women -- has generally featured living composers. But it starts this year with a nod to the centenary of John Cage: a program of Cage (and Pierre Boulez's ''Marteau Sans Maître'') with Steven Schick conducting the International Contemporary Ensemble. Other composers featured this season at the Miller are Jonathan Harvey, Olga Neuwirth, Sofia Gubaidulina, Enno Poppe, Rebecca Saunders, Oliver Knussen and Julio Estrada. The Composer Portraits series also goes on the road, to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, with programs devoted to Fred Lerdahl (Oct. 18) and Ms. Gubaidulina (March 21; a somewhat different program). Sept. 20. Miller Theater. (J.R.O.)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM The Met concert series, long a bastion of traditional classical music programming, sports a new face, as Limor Tomer, its new general manager, presents her first full season of programs. Here the Wordless Music orchestra joins the Danish art-rock group Efterklang in songs from that band's new album, ''Piramida.'' Page 33. Sept. 22. (J.R.O.)
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Nothing is easy for this ensemble as it searches for a music director to succeed James Levine, who resigned in 2011. Last September the prime candidates seemed to be Riccardo Chailly and Andris Nelsons, and both were well represented in that season's programming. But Mr. Chailly had to cancel because of a heart arrhythmia; Mr. Nelsons, because of the birth of his child. Mr. Chailly must surely be out of the running now, the orchestra having struggled through no end of health crises with Mr. Levine. Mr. Nelsons, who caught up with the orchestra at Tanglewood this summer and is scheduled to appear in Boston this season (Jan. 31; Feb. 1-2, 5), still seems to be a front-runner, though he just extended his contract as music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in England through the 2014-15 season. Other names currently circulating include those of Vladimir Jurowski, who makes his Boston Symphony debut in October (11-13), and -- a dark horse -- Esa-Pekka Salonen, who is not scheduled to conduct the Boston Symphony this season. The season opens here with Itzhak Perlman conducting a program of Beethoven in which he also performs the two violin romances. It seems safe to say that he harbors no ambitions to become the orchestra's music director. Sept. 22. Symphony Hall, (617) 266-1200 or (888) 266-1200, bso.org. (J.R.O.)
'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' How can you tell that a singer and a composer are riding high at the Metropolitan Opera? When they are given two opening nights in a row. The star soprano Anna Netrebko, who opened the last season in the title role of ''Anna Bolena,'' takes on another Donizetti opera -- though not ''Maria Stuarda,'' the follow-up to ''Bolena,'' as Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager originally hoped. (That vehicle falls to the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato on New Year's Eve.) Instead Ms. Netrebko plays Adina in a new production of the classic comedy ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' which combines ample laughs with threads of melancholy and touching emotion. The tenor Matthew Polenzani plays the love-struck Nemorino; the charismatic baritone Mariusz Kwiecien is Sergeant Belcore, his rival for Adina's affections; and the bass Ambrogio Maestri (and later in the run, the winning Erwin Schrott) sings Dr. Dulcamara, the lovable quack who dispenses the supposed elixir of love. Bartlett Sher, whose Met productions can teeter between spirited and frenetic, directs; Maurizio Benini conducts the burbling, effortlessly charming score. Opens Sept. 24. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The great joy of the society's concerts is the interaction of up-and-coming musicians with established ones: a violinist like Benjamin Beilman, say, on the cusp of a major career, and the veteran flutist Ransom Wilson. Those two, along with a host of colleagues, will play an opening program of serenades by Mozart, Kodaly, Strauss and Dvorak, the introduction to a season that reaches from Bach's keyboard concertos (played by Jeremy Denk as part of the annual Baroque Festival in December) by way of 19th-century classics to the complete Shostakovich string quartets in March. Sept. 24. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
'DOG DAYS' David T. Little, a percussionist with a composerly predilection for the theater, presents an example, ''Dog Days,'' as part of the Peak Performances series at Montclair State University (with another, ''Soldier Songs,'' to follow from Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now in January). Page 35. Opens Sept 29. Kasser Theater, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org. (J.R.O.)
GREEN MUSIC CENTER If ever there was a concert hall worth emulating, it is the Musikverein in Vienna, and the designers of Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood studied it well. If ever there was an indoor-outdoor concert hall worth emulating, it is Ozawa Hall, and those same designers -- notably the architect, William Rawn and the acoustician Lawrence Kirkegaard -- were recruited to do likewise with a 1,400-seat hall on the campus of Sonoma State University. An infusion of funds from Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of the board of Carnegie Hall, and his wife, Joan Weill, gave it a name, Weill Hall. (So is it Tanglewood West or Carnegie West?) The opening weekend includes a recital by the pianist Lang Lang and a concert by the Santa Rosa Symphony, conducted by its music director, Bruno Ferrandis, and others. Sept. 29-30. Green Music Center, Rohnert Park, Calif., (866) 955-6040, gmc.sonoma.edu. (J.R.O.)
'THE RITE OF SPRING' AT 100 This season-long festival gets a jump on the centennial of the masterpiece that not only defined Stravinsky's career -- more in subsequent performances than in its tempestuous premiere on May 29, 1913 -- but also set the course for much of 20th-century music, on into the 21st. The celebration opens here with ''The Seasons,'' by Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky commissioned for the occasion and performed by the cellist Y0-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble. Mr. Yanov-Yanovsky adapts folk tunes used by Stravinsky in ''The Rite.'' Later events include multiple staged interpretations of the work, notably the Joffrey Ballet's attempt at a ''literal re-creation'' of the original choreography (March 23-24) and a new Basil Twist rendering with puppets (April 12-13). Valery Gergiev conducts the Mariinsky Orchestra in two concerts, the second culminating in ''The Rite'' (Oct. 29-30, after a scholarly conference on ''Reassessing 'The Rite,''' Oct. 25-28), and Giancarlo Guerrero leads the Cleveland Orchestra in a program featuring Stravinsky's ''Petrouchka'' (March 17). Actually, the festival isn't quite season-long, ending in late April, before the actual anniversary. Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Carolina Performing Arts, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, (919) 843-3333. theriteofspringat100.org. (J.R.O.)
OCTOBER
'THE PRISMATIC DEBUSSY' New York City's major cultural institutions have largely ignored the 150th anniversary of the birth of Debussy, so the Eastman School of Music is picking up the slack with a series of concerts exploring his multifaceted output, held in conjunction with lectures, films and exhibitions. Oct. 1-27. Eastman School of Music, Rochester, (585) 274-1100, esm.rochester.edu/debussy. (Z.W.)
CECILIA BARTOLI ''Steffani's star isn't in the ascendant,'' says the heroine (a musicologist!) of the Venice-based mystery writer Donna Leon's novel ''The Jewels of Paradise,'' to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press in October. Well, the star of Agostino Steffani -- ''composer and bishop, musician and diplomat,'' in Ms. Leon's words -- may soon rise, at least by a blip. As EMI Classics tries to ride the coattails of E.L. James's steamy potboiler ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' with an album of works mentioned in the book (there will be no quotations from that book here, nor any endorsement of that recording), Decca takes a more imaginative approach to a publishing tie-in with Ms. Bartoli's latest project, ''Mission,'' a two-disc set of arias and other works by Steffani. Ms. Leon and Ms. Bartoli are said to be friends, and they evidently shared scholarly groundwork in conjuring Steffani's personage and reviving his music. Ms. Leon's protagonist, hired to sort through newly discovered documents left behind by Steffani, recalls tunes of his that she has heard: ''What was that heartbreaking lament, something about 'Dal mio petto'?'' And Ms. Bartoli sings a good many of them, including that one, from the opera ''Niobe.'' As with her previous album ''Sacrificium: The Art of the Castrati,'' Ms. Bartoli strikes an androgynous pose, this time as a bald-pated, crucifix-clutching (and per Ms. Leon, castrated?) Steffani for the cover art. Oct. 2. Decca. (J.R.O.)
CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA This year the great Chicagoans fill the coveted spot opening the Carnegie Hall season. It is the start of the orchestra's third year under the music director Riccardo Muti, who has had the ensemble playing with characteristic sheen and power through the eclectic programs he favors. The three-night stand at Carnegie veers from Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' on opening night -- no one is better than Mr. Muti at ratcheting up the drama in vocal and choral works -- to music of Wagner, Franck, Dvorak, Martucci, Respighi and the young composer-D.J. Mason Bates. Oct 3-5. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
TWOSENSE All-stars from the All-Stars. The brilliant and searching Lisa Moore was the founding pianist of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, a position she held until 2008, and Ashley Bathgate is the group's current cellist. The two came together in 2010 as a commissioning and performing duo devoted to pairing new works and the classics. This program features premieres by Ryan Brown, Daniel Felsenfeld and Hannah Lash. Oct. 4. Roulette, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org. (Z.W.)
EMANUEL AX As artist in residence with the New York Philharmonic this season, the beloved pianist makes a move many of us have long been waiting for, taking up music of Bach in concert: here, the Keyboard Concerto in D minor (BWV 1052). In addition, he shows his marvelous versatility by working on an opposite fringe of the standard repertory, with Schoenberg's Piano Concerto. Alan Gilbert conducts the program, which also includes Mozart's ''Linz'' Sympony. Oct. 4-6. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
MINSOO SOHN The Honens International Piano Competition in Calgary, Alberta, which has developed a better track record than most, has been trying to beef up its international presence in recent years. In April, it held quarterfinals in New York for this year's competition, which concludes in Calgary in October. It has also started a record label to feature its winners, and Mr. Sohn, the 2006 prize laureate, made a big impression with a release of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations,'' which he now brings to New York along with variations by Brahms and Webern. Page 35. Oct 6. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
'LA FINTA GIARDINIERA' René Jacobs's recordings of Mozart's operas bring back some of the thrill that must have attended these works when they were new; his ''Nozze di Figaro,'' in particular, truly does make you hear that work as if for the first time. (Who knew that that critical commonplace could ever be deserved?) ''La Finta Giardiniera,'' one of Mozart's earliest operas, has long hovered in semiobscurity -- not a true rarity but not often performed, either -- despite its gorgeous music and acute libretto. Mr. Jacobs and the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra are sure to locate both its uproarious farce and its core of melancholy. The only downside of a new installment in the series is that it gets that much closer to coming to an end. Oct. 9. Harmonia Mundi. (Z.W.)
GREAT MUSIC IN A GREAT SPACE The conductor and organist Kent Tritle, best known for Sacred Music in a Sacred Space, the acclaimed, longstanding series he founded at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, revived a similarly named series presented in earlier years at St. John the Divine, when he moved there during the last season. Here he conducts the Cathedral Choir and Orchestra in Bach's certifiably great Mass in B minor. Oct. 10. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, (866) 811-4111, stjohndivine.org. (J.R.O)
RENÉE ANNE LOUPRETTE This excellent organist, who like Kent Tritle left her position at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola and is now at Trinity Wall Street, inaugurates another new feature in Trinity's suddenly resurgent music program: Pipes at One, a series of 40-minute midday organ recitals (by her and others) on the beautifully restored Schlicker organ at St. Paul's Chapel. No repertory has been announced yet; trust Ms. Louprette to make it worth your while. Oct. 3. (J.R.O.)
'MOBY-DICK' The first products of the David Gockley leadership at the San Francisco Opera, which began in 2006, showed little of the enterprise that characterized Mr. Gockley's 33 years at the Houston Grand Opera. But this season represents something of a breakthrough for Mr. Gockley and the company. Jake Heggie's adaptation of ''Moby-Dick,'' Herman Melville's masterpiece, had its premiere at the Dallas Opera in 2010 and is the first of three operas by living American composers being presented. (Nolan Gasser's family-friendly ''Secret Garden'' has its premiere on March 1, and Mark Adamo's ''Gospel of Mary Magdalene'' opens on June 19.) These are not the most adventurous composers working in opera today, but taken together their works add up to a considerable and refreshing commitment to the art form's present and future. Opens Oct. 10. War Memorial Opera House, (413) 864-3330, sfopera.com. (Z.W.)
NIELSEN PROJECT One of Alan Gilbert's marquee initiatives as he gets deeper into his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic is a series of concerts and recordings over a number of years exploring the six symphonies and three concertos of the underappreciated Danish composer Carl Nielsen. Having spent time with some of the symphonies, Mr. Gilbert turns his attention this season to the concertos for flute (with the orchestra's principal, Robert Langevin) and violin (with the guest soloist Nikolaj Znaider) in a program with Tchaikovsky's grand Second Symphony, the ''Little Russian.'' Oct. 10-13. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA Some of us recall the founding of this conductorless ensemble as if it were yesterday and still sort of wonder (despite the continuing success of the 62-year-old Prague Chamber Orchestra, among other conductor-free groups) whether the noble experiment will succeed. Well don't look now, but Orpheus, having recorded more than 70 albums, celebrates its 40th anniversary this season. Evidently it is here to stay. Its first program offers Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' Overture; ''Earth Echoes,'' a song cycle by Augusta Read Thomas, sung by the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke and the baritone Nathan Gunn; and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, which the orchestra has performed numerous ... er, never. It's a great piece, Orpheus; you'll love it. Carnegie Hall. Oct. 11. (J.R.O.)
'WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE' There will be a bittersweet quality to this new production of Oliver Knussen's captivating opera based on the beloved, bracing children's book by Maurice Sendak, who died in May. Brilliantly juxtaposed with Ravel's ''Mother Goose,'' it is being presented as part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's sweeping commitment to new and recent opera under its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, who conducts a cast that includes Claire Booth and Susan Bickley. The production is by the British director and video artist Netia Jones, who will conjure up animations based on Sendak's classic illustrations. (Ms. Jones is well practiced in Mr. Knussen's take on Sendak, having created a version of the operatic ''Higglety Pigglety Pop'' this summer at the Tanglewood Festival in Massachusetts.) Oct. 11-14. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com. (Z.W.)
YANNICK NÉZET-SÉGUIN Finally! Four years after the departure of Christoph Eschenbach as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and two years after it was announced that Mr. Nézet-Séguin (whom, for obvious reasons, the orchestra has been marketing on a first-name basis) would succeed him, the once fabulous Philadelphians again have a music director. Happily, they had expert musical guidance in the interim from an eminently capable and devoted principal conductor, Charles Dutoit, who maintained a high level of artistic achievement as administrative chaos swirled around him. (That included a period without music director, executive director or board chairman, and a 2011 filing for bankruptcy protection, from which the orchestra emerged in late July.) The delay, it turns out, had a good, or at least opportune, side, allowing the orchestra now to cloak Mr. Nézet-Séguin in the mantle of messiah, since it was just 100 years ago that Leopold Stokowski, who had a huge formative influence on the orchestra, arrived. Let the comparisons begin, in a gala concert featuring the soprano Renée Fleming and anchored by Brahms's Fourth Symphony. Oct. 18. Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org. (J.R.O.)
MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA It has been a tough time financially for American orchestras, and several of them had yet to negotiate new contracts with the players by press time (others including the Cleveland Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra). In addition, the Minnesota Orchestra faces a season of wandering as its Orchestra Hall is being renovated. (New Yorkers can only envy the resolve: what would a year or two of imaginative wandering by the Philharmonic matter if we could solve the Avery Fisher Hall Problem once and for all?) Osmo Vanska has worked artistic wonders as the orchestra's music director, and he can probably be counted on to steer it through these extracurricular shoals as well. He opens the season with a program of Elgar, Rachmaninoff (Piano Concerto No. 3, with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist) and Respighi at the orchestra's temporary home. Oct. 18-20. Auditorium at the Convention Center, Minnesota, (612) 371-5656, minnesotaorchestra.org. (J.R.O.)
WORLD ORCHESTRA FOR PEACE This international assemblage of star players, founded in 1995 by the conductor Georg Solti and conducted here by Valery Gergiev, who is widely active in New York over the next two weeks, celebrates the Solti centennial. The program includes excerpts of operas by Mozart and Verdi, with the soprano Angela Gheorghiu and the bass René Pape, Strauss's ''Don Juan'' and Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra (which Solti conducted with a particular, Hungarian flair). Oct. 19. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
LES ARTS FLORISSANTS Before this peerless Baroque-music ensemble and its director, William Christie, bring their production of Marc-Antoine Charpentier's ''David et Jonathas'' to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in mid-April, they offer a teaser of sorts with rare performances of three of Charpentier's impassioned sacred motets. A week later members of the group join the terrific student ensemble Juilliard415 for Handel's glorious oratorio ''Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno'' (''The Triumph of Time and Truth''). Alice Tully Hall. Oct. 19, 27. (Z.W.)
'GLASS AT 75' As we said, no end of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' this season: here the four-hand piano version, played by Maki Namekawa and Dennis Russell Davies, and given historical context between works by Debussy -- ''En Blanc et Noir,'' actually composed two years after ''The Rite,'' in 1915 -- and Philip Glass, the ostensible subject of the program. Oct. 21. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, (212) 685-0008, ext. 560, themorgan.org. (J.R.O.)
NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG Celebrating its 25th anniversary, this worthy enterprise opens its season with a program timed with an eye toward the election, ''Mr. Gershwin Goes to Washington.'' It's actually Mr. Gershwins, plural: an evening of satire drawn from George and Ira Gershwin's songs about politics, directed and adapted by Laurence Maslon. The featured artists are the sopranos Anne-Carolyn Bird and Lauren Worsham and the pianists Steven Blier, the festival's artistic director, and Joseph Thalken. A tease in the season announcement promises that ''a distinguished member of the political news media will be the surprise guest narrator.'' We're all a-twit. (And so as not to spoil the surprise when the program itself goes to Washington a couple of days later, the narrator there will be different.) Oct. 20. Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan. Oct. 22. Terrace Theater, Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, (212) 501-3330, nyfos.org. (J.R.O.)
LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Here is Valery Gergiev again, with one of his own orchestras. The London Symphony is making much of the the 100th anniversary of its first North American appearance, claiming that it was ''the first European orchestra to visit the United States and Canada.'' (It was originally booked for the fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic, whose delay forced the players to board a smaller ship; they were already in St. Louis when they learned of the disaster.) Not that the programming particularly reflects the occasion. It is all Brahms: the Symphonies Nos. 2 and 4, the Violin Concerto (with James Ehnes as soloist), the Piano Concerto No. 1 (with Denis Matsuev) and the ''Tragic Overture.'' It might all seem more special if Kurt Masur were not scheduled to conduct two weeks of Brahms (Symphonies Nos. 2-4, Double Concerto) with the New York Philharmonic in the same hall in early November. (Whether an increasingly frail Mr. Masur can endure all of that is another matter.) Oct. 22, 24. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'THE TEMPEST' New York is kept mostly up-to-date with the orchestral and solo piano music of the mercurial English composer Thomas Adès, but his masterly 2004 Shakespeare adaptation, one of the most praised operas of the 21st century, is just now receiving its New York premiere. It is one of the vanishingly few contemporary operas to receive the Metropolitan Opera's imprimatur, and the company is giving it a brilliant, mostly young cast. Mr. Adès conducts. The only element to give pause is the director, Robert Lepage, whose production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle was roundly dismissed by critics. Whether he can return to his roots as a darling of the theatrical avant-garde may be the biggest question of the Met season. Page 33. Opens Oct. 23. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA The brilliant young conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin has so far been best known in New York for his opera performances: memorably galvanic takes on Bizet's ''Carmen'' and Gounod's ''Faust'' at the Metropolitan Opera. For his first Carnegie Hall appearance as music director of the marvelous Philadelphians, he works to his dramatic strengths, offering Verdi's operatic-scale, hellfire-breathing Requiem, with the orchestra joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir. The soloists are the only real difficulty, since two of the four -- the febrile soprano Marina Poplavskaya and the often ailing tenor Rolando Villazón -- have a way of polarizing opera fans. But this is Mr. Nézet-Séguin's chance to shine and, perhaps, to fuel speculation that he eventually may be a candidate to replace James Levine as the Met's music director. Oct. 23. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
WHITE LIGHT FESTIVAL When this festival began in 2010 as an exploration of transcendence, it seemed more a personal statement by its creator, Jane Moss, the artistic director of Lincoln Center, than any particular sign of the times. But with themes of spirituality having recently taken hold at festivals in Salzburg, Austria, and Lucerne, Switzerland, and elsewhere, Ms. Moss seems to have caught the beginnings of an international wave, to whatever extent she did not herself set it in motion. The festival opens with a free program, ''Without Shadows,'' featuring Kiran Ahluwalia, a Punjabi vocalist, with Indian percussion and contemporary instruments. Oct. 23. David Rubinstein Atrium. (J.R.O.)
ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Flexibility is a rare commodity in the programming of major orchestras and concert halls, especially when international appearances are involved. Planning is done far in advance, and there are too many moving parts to allow much change. But the Israel Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta, its music director for life, who made a strong showing in the Salzburg Festival's Spiritual Overture in July with two programs based mostly in Judaism, decided to build quickly on that success. They set aside the big pieces originally scheduled for this appearance (Hindemith's ''Mathis der Maler'' and Brahms's First Symphony) and replaced them with works from their first festival concert: Schoenberg's ''Kol Nidre'' and Noam Sheriff's ''Mechaye Hametim'' (''Revival of the Dead''), a Holocaust remembrance. Both are choral works, and the switch was doable because the chorus used in Salzburg was the Collegiate Chorale of New York, and the baritone Thomas Hampson was available (or made himself available) to reprise his roles. The flexibility could not be complete, since the orchestra had a commitment to another soloist, the young pianist Yuja Wang, and few will object to hearing her perform Mendelssohn's First Piano Concerto. But the cost is Mr. Hampson's searing interpretation of Mahler's ''Kindertotenlieder'' (''Songs on the Death of Children''), which, though composed as a personal statement 40 years before the Holocaust, made for a better thematic fit. Oct. 25. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
GABRIEL KAHANE An emblem of a generation of composers who work eagerly and beautifully in multiple genres, Mr. Kahane is a noted composer of pop music, concert works and musical theater. (His ''February House'' recently completed a run at the Public Theater.) In ''Don't Even Listen'' he is joined by the vocalist Shara Worden and the young string quartet Brooklyn Rider for a program that encompasses works old and new, including a premiere (''The Fiction Issue'') and songs by Cee Lo Green, Schubert, Schumann, Sufjan Stevens and Mr. Kahane himself. Oct. 25. Zankel Hall. (Z.W.)
'OUT COLD'/'ZIPPO SONGS' Bigger, in the arts, is not lately better. With more and more music, dance and theater conceived on a chamber scale, it is only natural to want smaller spaces for them. This season the Brooklyn Academy of Music unveils its new Richard B. Fisher Building, designed for performances more intimate than those in its older theaters. One of the early offerings is this program of two song cycles by Phil Kline, best known for his widely performed, ambulatory piece for the winter holidays, ''Unsilent Night,'' in which both audience and recorded sound source travel around. ''Zippo Songs'' (2003), with texts from lines inscribed on the sides of Zippo lighters by American G.I.'s in Vietnam, will be heard in a new arrangement for string quintet, piano and percussion, and the new ''Out Cold'' has Schubert's ''Winterreise'' meet some of Frank Sinatra's wintriest recordings for a reflection on introversion and isolation. The longtime Kline collaborator Theo Bleckmann sings alongside the well-regarded American Contemporary Music Ensemble in stagings directed by Emma Griffin. Oct. 25-27. BAM Fisher. (Z.W.)
BRITTEN CENTENNIAL Few enjoy the rote attention that composers tend to get paid in major anniversary years, but the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center seems sincere in its season-long tribute to Benjamin Britten, who was born a century ago, in 1913, and whose chamber music is among the most distinguished parts of his wide-ranging output. In three fascinating programs the Escher String Quartet juxtaposes Britten's quartets with a variety of repertory: first with the Baroque and Beethoven, then with fellow British composers and finally with other quartets composed during and after World War II. A final concert featuring various artists offers a rich selection of Britten's music, including the adorable ''Insect Pieces'' for oboe and piano; the sublime mini-opera canticle ''Abraham and Isaac,'' featuring the countertenor Daniel Taylor and the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey; and the eloquent Cello Sonata, with David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, the society's artistic directors. There are few gifts to the city this year as sweet as the immersion in this music that the society is offering. Oct. 25, Feb. 28, May 2. Rose Studio. May 10. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The Philadelphia Orchestra is not the only ensemble celebrating a Stokowski legacy this season. The maestro founded the American Symphony to perform at Carnegie Hall in 1962, after the New York Philharmonic had decamped for Lincoln Center. Now the American Symphony, which returned to Carnegie after a long absence in 2010, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with an outsize concert conducted by its music director of the last two decades, the intrepid Leon Botstein. It opens with the first work Stokowski performed with the ensemble, his own arrangement of ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' and also includes Ives's Fourth Symphony, whose premiere Stokowski and the orchestra presented in 1965, 11 years after Ives's death. The program, also featuring the Collegiate Chorale, is filled out with Mahler's gargantuan ''Symphony of a Thousand,'' typically given as a concert in itself. True the symphonies add up to only 90 minutes in time, but in weight? For this concert, ticket prices are being rolled back to 1962 levels, from $1.50 to $7, and no question, it's a lot of bang for your buck-fifty. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
MARLIS PETERSEN For her New York recital debut this coolly intelligent soprano, best known to New York audiences for stepping in for Natalie Dessay in a new production of Ambroise Thomas's ''Hamlet'' in 2010, brings a program focused on Goethe's concept of the eternal feminine. The music ranges from the core of classic lieder -- Beethoven, Schubert, Wolf, Schumann -- to 20th-century masters like Hanns Eisler and Walter Braunfels. She is joined by the pianist Jendrik Springer. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
DJ SPOOKY And here is the personification of the new concert programming at the Metropolitan Museum: Paul D. Miller, a k a DJ Spooky, That Subliminal Kid, an artist in residence for the season. Here he presents a screening of the 1956 film ''Madame Freedom'' with a rescoring for string quartet. Page 33. Oct. 26. Metropolitan Museum. (J.R.O.)
ANDRAS SCHIFF With this pianist playing Bach, you almost needn't say more. Whereas other pianists perform Bach, some of them magnificently, Mr. Schiff seems to embody him, so thoroughly has he internalized the music and so freely does he let it unfold. Here, beginning a two-season comprehensive Bach Project in various New York halls, he plays ''The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Books 1 and 2. Page 35. 92nd Street Y. Oct. 27, Nov. 1. (J.R.O.)
ANGELA HEWITT Bachians may think they had died and gone to heaven. To tide them over between Mr. Schiff's ''Well-Tempered'' recitals, Ms. Hewitt, one of those pianists who perform Bach's music magnificently, offers the ''Goldberg'' Variations, and you can listen with beer in hand: in H.L. Mencken's words, Bach's ''natural solvent.'' Page 35. Oct. 28. Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lprnyc.com. (J.R.O.)
ELGAR, CARTER CELLO CONCERTOS Jacqueline du Pré's recording of the Elgar Cello Concerto with her husband, Daniel Barenboim, wasn't her best take on her signature work; that honor goes to the album she made with John Barbirolli. But her collaboration with Mr. Barenboim remains a potent mixture of the personal and the artistic. So it is major news indeed that Mr. Barenboim has now made another recording of the grand, lyrical work, 25 years after du Pré's untimely death, and with another female cellist: the richly gifted Alisa Weilerstein. The orchestra is the Berlin Staatskapelle, and the Elgar is intriguingly paired with another grand cello concerto, Elliott Carter's shivering, heaving, bursting addition to the repertory, from 2000. Oct. 30. Decca. (Z.W.)
MARIINSKY ORCHESTRA And here is Valery Gergiev again, with his other orchestra, fresh from presenting two concerts at the Carolina Performing Arts festival The Rite of Spring at 100, where they performed the title work. No Stravinsky here: Mr. Gergiev and his St. Petersburg troops offer a suite from Rodion Shchedrin's ''Little Humpbacked Horse,'' Shostakovich's Symphony No. 6 and Strauss's ''Heldenleben.'' Oct. 31. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
NOVEMBER
LIQUID MUSIC The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra -- assuming that the ensemble itself is still liquid by then, given reports of financial constraints and threats to its full-time status -- will offer a new series of six boundary-crossing programs, beginning, as the presidential election approaches, with the performance artist Laurie Anderson's politically tinged ''Dirtday!'' Other programs feature guest artists of many alt-classical stripes mingling with members of the orchestra at locations in St. Paul, mostly the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Center. Nov. 2-3. Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, (651) 291-1144. thespco.org/liquidmusic. (J.R.O.)
VOICES FROM LATIN AMERICA With Clive Gillinson as its executive and artistic director, Carnegie has made a specialty of organizing major citywide festivals, often on international themes. Here is another. The Carnegie performances open with an evening by the popular artist Gilberto Gil, one of the artistic advisers (along with Gustavo Dudamel, Osvaldo Golijov and Chucho Valdés). Strictly classical music will play a relatively small part in the festival (which runs through Dec. 11), aside from concerts by the New Juilliard Ensemble, the Ensemble ACJW and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela. Nov. 8. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' The director David Alden, whose politically charged, vividly theatrical productions have been praised and debated since the 1980s, worked briefly at the Met early in his career, refurbishing productions of Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and Berg's ''Wozzeck.'' But he makes his real company debut with this seething Verdi work about betrayal at a royal court. It was set to star the soprano Karita Mattila, but she pulled out in May, after deciding that the role no longer fitted her voice, and was replaced by Sondra Radvanovsky, a stalwart of the Met's Verdi wing. Marcelo Álvarez, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Kathleen Kim also star, and the cast is rounded out by the veteran Dolora Zajick as Ulrica. Fabio Luisi conducts. Opens Nov. 8. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
VOX FESTIVAL One of the New York City Opera's signature offerings, this laboratory for full-orchestra readings of excerpts from contemporary American operas has been constricted to just six works on a single day, but it continues nevertheless. Now presented in conjunction with the service organization Opera America, this season's festival will feature works by the downtown favorite John Zorn (a ''mystery play'' based on the life and work of Hildegard von Bingen), Moto Osada, Christopher Weiss, Evan Meier, James Stepleton (''The Awakening,'' based on the Kate Chopin novella) and Osnat Netzer. Nov. 8. N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, La Guardia Place at Washington Square South, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET Second to none in French repertory, this pianist -- long unfairly known more for his sartorial choices than for his musical ones -- gives a recital devoted to Debussy, who, though celebrating his 150th birthday, is largely ignored this year by New York's cultural institutions. Nov. 10. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA These days the orchestra tends to alternate in New York between making big statements -- as with its Bruckner symphonies at the Lincoln Center Festival last year and its concert performance of Strauss's opera ''Salome'' at Carnegie Hall in May -- and slipping in and out relatively modestly. Here it sets down on the way to one of its regular Miami residencies, with Franz Welser-Möst, its music director, conducting works by Beethoven (Symphony No. 4, ''Grosse Fuge''), Matthias Pintscher (''Chute d'Étoiles,'' in its New York premiere) and Scriabin (''Poem of Ecstasy''). Mr. Welser-Möst reserves his big New York statement this season for the Vienna Philhamonic's Carnegie weekend in March. Nov. 13. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
BERNARDA FINK For date night with a sophisticated singing fan, look no further: there are few artists more eloquent and elegant than this Argentine mezzo-soprano, who will sing some of Dvorak's ''Biblical Songs,'' which are included on her astonishingly lovely, spirited recent recording of that composer's songs and duets on Harmonia Mundi. The program, with Anthony Spiri as pianist, also includes Schumann's ''Lenau Lieder'' and songs by Mahler. Nov. 14. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
'LA CLEMENZA DI TITO' The conductor Harry Bicket, a Baroque specialist, has been responsible for some of the most scintillating and lively Met performances in recent seasons. After leading a run of this long-underrated Mozart opera in 2008, he returns to it now with an even better cast: Lucy Crowe, Barbara Frittoli, Elina Garanca, Kate Lindsey and Giuseppe Filianoti. Opens Nov. 16. Metropolitan Opera. (Z.W.)
ORCHESTRA RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE John Eliot Gardiner made a big impression with his crack period-instrument orchestra in four symphonies of Beethoven last season at Carnegie. All you need to know now is that his Monteverdi Choir is sure to be just as fine, and that's a good thing, since Mr. Gardiner is reaching for the sky with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony one night and his ''Missa Solemnis'' the next. Not to be missed. Nov. 16-17. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
JOYCE DIDONATO This assured and radiantly good-natured American mezzo-soprano will take on the title role of Donizetti's ''Maria Stuarda'' at the Met on New Year's Eve. But before that bel canto milestone she ventures earlier in a Baroque program called ''Drama Queens'' (also the title of her new recording), which includes tours de force by Handel, Monteverdi, Gluck, Hasse and others, with Alan Curtis leading Il Complesso Barocco. Nov. 18. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA In 2009 Esa-Pekka Salonen ended his transformative run as the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic to, he said, concentrate on composing. But thankfully for audiences, he has not abandoned conducting at all; he even took over the helm of this great ensemble, which arrives at Lincoln Center for two nights: first Mahler's Ninth Symphony and then, even more exciting, a concert performance of Berg's opera ''Wozzeck,'' with luxury casting: the baritone Simon Keenlyside and the soprano Angela Denoke. If anyone can find the sensuality and drama of Berg's pathbreaking score, it is Mr. Salonen. Nov. 18-19. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY To celebrate its 50th anniversary, this worthy ensemble does not diverge from its time-tested formula of offering Carnegie Hall exposure to gifted young performers, conductors and composers. For the anniversary -- also the hall debut of its new music director, Joshua Gersen -- the orchestra will play works by Shostakovich and Ludwig Wilhelm Maurer, Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony and a premiere by Gabriel Zucker. Nov. 25. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'THE PEONY PAVILION' The latest changes in the Met Museum's concert programming stem largely from a desire to tie it more closely to exhibitions, as with this staging of the 16th-century Chinese opera, presented in connection with the exhibition ''Chinese Gardens: Palace Pavilions, Scholars' Studios, Rustic Retreats.'' Conceived for presentation in a garden in Shanghai, the production will be staged in the small Astor Court and relayed live from there in high definition to the overflow audience in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. Tan Dun, the director, has shaved some 18 hours off the opera -- as presented in all its glory in the stunning production by Chen Shi-Zheng at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1999, and elsewhere in the years following -- bringing it down to a mere 70 minutes, while presumably retaining a goodly measure of that glory. Metropolitan Museum. Nov. 30. (J.R.O.)
DECEMBER
OLGA NEUWIRTH This Austrian composer may be part of Melissa Smey's campaign to bring more women into the fold of the Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series, as here. Ms. Neuwirth can do big and brash and bold with the best of them. Page 35. Dec. 6. Miller Theater. (J.R.O.)
SIMÓN BOLÍVAR ORCHESTRA OF VENEZUELA El Sistema, Venezuela's storied music education system, has many success stories but none quite as astonishing as that of the conductor Gustavo Dudamel, who rocketed through the program to stardom and the music directorship of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He has brought to prominence with him the youthful Bolívar ensemble, whose two-night stand is part of Carnegie Hall's Voices of Latin America festival. The repertory, including works by composers like Silvestre Revueltas, Esteban Benzecry and Heitor Villa-Lobos, is almost never done here, and it is sure to be galvanizing: few conductors draw visceral excitement out of an orchestra -- especially these young charges -- the way Mr. Dudamel does. Dec. 10-11. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'MESSIAH' There are so many excellent New York performances of this great Handel oratorio at Christmastime that it is impossible to predict which will be best over all, whatever that may mean. But John Scott's is sure to rank high among the contenders, and it is typically the most lovable, with the superbly trained St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys holding forth in festive red cassocks before the church's intricately sculptured altarpiece. (The ailing pipe organ is another story, with pleas for contributions sure to be stuffed into the program.) James Richman's Concert Royal, on period instruments, fills out a sound worthy of the magnificent space. Dec. 11, 13. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org. (In other notable performances of ''Messiah,'' Julian Wachner conducts the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at Trinity Church on Dec. 9 and at Alice Tully Hall on Dec. 12; Kent Tritle conducts the amateur Oratorio Society of New York at Carnegie Hall on Dec. 17 and the professional Musica Sacra, also at Carnegie, on Dec. 20 and 22; and Emmanuelle Haïm conducts the New York Choral Artists and the New York Philharmonic from Dec. 18 to Dec. 22.) (J.R.O.)
'LES TROYENS' James Levine, the Met's ailing music director, has long been a champion of Berlioz's sprawling, shining masterpiece, so his absence from the podium for this revival of Francesca Zambello's production is particularly painful. Fabio Luisi will replace him, leading a cast that includes the deeply sympathetic mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the spurned queen Dido, the tenor Marcello Giordani in the high-reaching role of Aeneas and Deborah Voigt, fresh from trying out the epic Brünnhilde in Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, as the desperate prophetess Cassandra. But one of the vocal pleasures may be in a minor role: the excellent bass Kwangchul Youn as Narbal. Opens Dec. 13. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'CHRISTMAS ORATORIO' Here, in Bach's six-pack of Christmas cantatas, is a welcome change of pace from Philippe Herreweghe and his Collegium Vocale Gent Choir and Orchestra, whom we are used to hearing in Bach's somber Passions (no bad thing, to be sure). It should be entertaining as well as uplifting to catch them in a jubilant mood. Dec. 15. Alice Tully Hall. (In another notable performance of Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio,'' as part of Trinity Wall Street's 12th Night Festival, Julian Wachner and the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra, who last season presented each of the six component cantatas on the appropriate day of the liturgical calendar, will this year divide them differently, with midday performances of Nos. 1 and 2 on Jan. 3, and Nos. 3 and 4 on Jan. 4, all at St. Paul's Chapel; and Nos. 5 and 6 on Jan. 5, at Trinity Church.) (J.R.O.)
'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' The Met, of late, has offered tightened versions of certain productions as family-friendly entertainments for the holiday season, and Bartlett Sher's antic version of Rossini's classic is an ideal choice. The company has not stinted on this year's cast, which features the charming up-and-coming stars Isabel Leonard, Alek Shrader, Rodion Pogossov and Jordan Bisch. The conductor Yves Abel's work at the house has always had stylish spirit. Opens Dec. 18. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
CONTACT! Last year's installment of the New York Philharmonic's series of new and recent music felt staler than in the past, but this concert is a return to form, with premieres of works by Andy Akiho and Jude Vaclavik as well as the first New York performances of ''Try,'' by the noted young composer Andrew Norman, and Jacob Druckman's ''Counterpoise.'' Jayce Ogren, well practiced in contemporary music, conducts, and the vocal soloist is the brilliant soprano Elizabeth Futral. Dec. 21. Metropolitan Museum. Dec. 22. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS Delightful pluck! On the day a Mayan text projects as the ''end date'' of the Mayan calendar (whatever that may mean for the world at large), Harold Rosenbaum, his excellent professional choir and the Orchestra of St. Luke's propose to pick up the pieces with a performance of Haydn's great oratorio ''The Creation.'' Haydn's resounding C major burst of light can undoubtedly be counted on to set the cosmos aright once again. Dec. 21. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'MARIA STUARDA' Another New Year's Eve, another starring role for the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato at the Met. Last year Ms. DiDonato led a sterling cast in the Baroque pastiche ''The Enchanted Island.'' Now she takes on the diva role of the embittered Mary Stuart in Donizetti's riveting melodrama, part of that composer's trilogy of operas based, however loosely, on the lives of Tudor queens. The Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, had originally intended for all three of the operas to be directed by David McVicar and to star the soprano Anna Netrebko; Mr. McVicar is still on for ''Maria Stuarda'' and the third, ''Roberto Devereux,'' next season, but Ms. Netrebko decided that ''Anna Bolena'' was it for her, clearing the way for Ms. DiDonato. She will be joined by a cast of rising stars: Elza van den Heever (as Mary's rival, Elizabeth), Francesco Meli, Joshua Hopkins and Matthew Rose. Maurizio Benini conducts. Opens Dec. 31. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
JANUARY
GREEN MOUNTAIN PROJECT The soprano Jolle Greenleaf and the violinist and conductor Scott Metcalfe have made Monteverdi a welcome fixture of the new year in New York. In 2010 and 2011, they presented the towering 1610 Vespers, and this year they produced a 1640 Vespers, something of a pastiche. Now it is back to 1610 and back to the church where it all began. A happy new year indeed. Jan. 2-3. Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (646) 470-5809, tenetnyc.com. (J.R.O.)
PROTOTYPE: OPERA/THEATER/NOW Though New York City Opera's Vox Festival will continue this year, albeit curtailed in size and scope, as a laboratory for new operas, this new festival aims to add to the city's range of performances of contemporary work. Organized by Here Arts Center in SoHo and Beth Morrison, an adventurous arts presenter, the two weeks will feature a commissioned premiere -- ''Sumeida's Song,'' by the rising young composer Mohammed Fairouz -- as well as David T. Little's ''Soldier Songs,'' directed by Yuval Sharon, and other readings, presentations, concerts and panels. Jan. 9-19. Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, (212) 352-3101, prototypefestival.org. (Z.W.)
BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA There are few better marriages of conductor and orchestra than Ivan Fischer and his alert, exciting ensemble. Frequent guests of Lincoln Center, they come this year with a varied program: Shostakovich's ''Suite for Variety Orchestra,'' Bernstein's ''Serenade'' (based on Plato's ''Symposium'' and featuring the violinist Janine Jansen) and Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2. Jan. 20. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
'DOUBT' Reeling from the recession, opera companies across America are playing it safe. But the Minnesota Opera -- which has, in Minneapolis and St. Paul, communities used to adventurous culture -- continues to program new work and thoughtful, theatrical productions of the classics. Next year brings this major commission composed by Douglas J. Cuomo, with a libretto by John Patrick Shanley, based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The cast features the huge-voiced soprano Christine Brewer, in one of her too-rare operatic turns, as well as Denyce Graves, Matthew Worth and Adriana Zabala. Christopher Franklin conducts, and Kevin Newbury directs. Opens Jan. 26. Minnesota Opera, Ordway, St. Paul, (612) 333-6669, mnopera.org. (Z.W.)
'RIGOLETTO' This one might cause a ruckus. For his Metropolitan Opera debut, the director Michael Mayer (Broadway's ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' and ''Spring Awakening'') places Verdi's great opera in Rat Pack-era Las Vegas, with a set by Christine Jones and the Duke cast as a sleazy Sinatra-type entertainer. Met audiences have tended to be doubtful about such updatings, but the previous production, from 1989, never inspired much affection, and if anyone can sell a difficult concept it is the excellent opening-night cast: the soprano Diana Damrau, the tenor Piotr Beczala and the baritone Zeljko Lucic. (Lisette Oropesa, Vittorio Grigolo and George Gagnidze take over later in the run.) Opens Jan. 28. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
MARC-ANDRÉ HAMELIN Everything this pianist plays, he plays well. And it's a good thing, since he plays almost everything. He began his career exploring the virtuosic fringes of the repertory and has gradually moved toward the center. His program here ranges from Bach to Mr. Hamelin's own Variations on a Theme by Paganini (in its New York premiere) and also includes works by Debussy, Rachmaninoff and Busoni. Jan. 30. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
WEST-EASTERN DIVAN ORCHESTRA Daniel Barenboim performing Beethoven at Carnegie is nothing new. But this time he brings his orchestra of young Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs to play all the symphonies. There is little in the sound of their recently released recordings of the works that would make you sense either youth or diversity. Seeing them in action should be a different matter, Jan. 30-31, Feb 2-3, Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
OPERA LAFAYETTE Sometimes this intrepid company's wanderings through the thickets of the French operatic repertory can yield great pleasures, and sometimes they remind you that there are reasons obscurities are obscure. Ah, but life's a crap shoot like that. Will ''Lalla Roukh,'' an Orientalist fantasia by Félicien David that wowed the Opéra Comique in 1862, hold up today as any more than a curiosity? We shall see. In any case, Ryan Brown's conducting is always spirited, and the production, by Bernard Deletré, incorporates the acclaimed Indian-dance troupe Kalanidhi Dance. Jan. 31. Rose Theater. (Z.W.)
FEBRUARY
OSVALDO GOLIJOV Mr. Golijov is Carnegie Hall's composer in residence this season, and a concert in its Making Music series, which offers commentary from composers as well as their music, could offer fascinating insights if the right questions are asked and answered. It is a chance to explore the methodology of a composer whose acquisitive methods have recently been called into question, to the point that some have accused him of plagiarism. The program, performed by the St. Lawrence String Quartet, the Zankel Band and others, includes the New York premiere of Mr. Golijov's ''Qohelet'' (more widely known under the spelling ''Koholet''), a Carnegie co-commission and one of the works that was challenged. Mr. Golijov altered it as a result. So what is the whole story? Feb. 4. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S It was a significant coup for this ensemble, excellent though it is, to secure the fast-rising Pablo Heras-Casado as its new principal conductor. He leads the orchestra for the first time at Carnegie Hall since his appointment in a program of the central repertory: Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture, Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 (with Christian Zacharias as soloist), Hans Zender's orchestrations of five Debussy preludes and the lighter, leaner 1841 version of Schumann's Fourth Symphony. All these are distant from the Baroque and new music in which Mr. Heras-Casado has long specialized. The orchestra has bet that his charisma and energy will outweigh his relative inexperience; it may be good for both him and the band that he will get to work with these fine players to refine his interpretations of the standards. Feb. 7. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA Mariss Jansons -- the principal conductor of both this ensemble and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and thus a regular commuter between Amsterdam and Munich -- turns 70 in January and seems to have emerged from several health crises of recent decades in fine fettle. Oh, he may still suffer from jet lag, but he certainly doesn't seem fazed. He takes the Bavarians to Tokyo to perform all the Beethoven symphonies in late November. Here he presents good variety in programs well gauged to show off this great orchestra's and Mr. Jansons's own versatility: in one, Bartok's Second Violin Concerto, with Leonidas Kavakos as soloist, and Mahler's First Symphony; in the other, Strauss's ''Death and Transfiguration'' (Mr. Jansons may feel that he has lived it) and Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. Feb. 13-14. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'PARSIFAL' Appearing a bit earlier than its traditional place around the Easter season, Wagner's final and perhaps deepest music drama arrives in New York in a new production by François Girard after a practice run at the Lyon Opera, where its scenic requirements -- a stage-filling sea of blood, for one thing -- strained the company's technical capabilities to the breaking point. Presumably those challenges will be a walk in the park for a Met recently tested by the mechanical headaches of Robert Lepage's Wagner ''Ring'' cycle. And blood aside, the house is fielding a remarkably strong cast: Jonas Kaufmann, seemingly born for the title role, as well as Katarina Dalayman, Peter Mattei, René Pape and Evgeny Nikitin, making his first New York appearance since his withdrawal from the Bayreuth Festival after the bizarre discovery that one of his tattoos resembled, at one point, a swastika. Daniele Gatti's deliberate, expansive take on the opera has polarized audiences in the past, but a little more time spent with singers of this quality wouldn't be too bad a fate. Opens Feb. 15. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'POWDER HER FACE' It's a sign of the composer Thomas Adès's rise to the top of his field that both his operas are being performed in New York this season. The Met's production of his sweeping version of ''The Tempest,'' opening in October, will doubtless grab more attention, but the chamber work ''Powder Her Face,'' about a 1960s sex scandal involving the Duchess of Argyll, has raunchily intimate charm. It's an opera that in content and scale wouldn't make much sense at the Met, so it's an ideal opening act for a New York City Opera, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two of its four productions, that is trying to define itself artistically after a listless last season. Jay Scheib directs; Jonathan Stockhammer, a specialist in contemporary opera, conducts. Opens Feb. 15. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. (Z.W.)
'DON CARLO' When Lorin Maazel returned to the Met podium for a run of Wagner's ''Walküre'' in 2008 it was the first time he had conducted at the company since the early 1960s. It's a far smaller gap this time, as he leads Verdi's dark masterpiece and an experienced cast that includes Barbara Frittoli, Anna Smirnova, Ramón Vargas, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Eric Halfvarson and Ferruccio Furlanetto, who scored a personal coup as Philip II when Nicholas Hytner's production was new in 2010. Opens Feb. 22. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'RADAMISTO' Harry Bicket has that rarest and best of gifts for an early-music specialist: the ability to make regular opera orchestras play with the snap of a period-instrument band. But there is still something special that happens when he leads his own English Concert, which will be joined for one of Handel's lesser-known masterworks by a fine cast that includes the veteran countertenor David Daniels, Brenda Rae, Patricia Bardon, Joélle Harvey and Luca Pisaroni. It is the first in a series of concert performances of Baroque operas at the hall by Mr. Bicket and the ensemble in coming seasons, so there's much to look forward to. Feb. 24. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'THE TURN OF THE SCREW' The New York City Opera finally has the right idea. This beleaguered company has learned that it's a losing battle to go head to head with the Met in terms of repertory and production style, and smarter to compete with the city's smaller, more nimble companies. To that end, it is opening its season with two intimate-scale operas that would have been naturals from, say, Gotham Chamber Opera: Thomas Adès's ''Powder Her Face'' and this intensely creepy work by Britten, both performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The conductor is the versatile Jayce Ogren; the director is Sam Buntrock, whose Broadway production of ''Sunday in the Park With George'' used lighting and projections with fluid ease. The cast had not been announced at press time. Opens Feb. 24. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. (Z.W.)
MARCH
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Happiness is conducting two of the world's greatest orchestras at Carnegie Hall in one season. Franz Welser-Möst, having dropped in with his own Cleveland Orchestra in November, now leads an orchestra that -- though proudly independent -- is his in another sense, he being Austrian. The three programs include symphonies by Dvorak (No. 7), Schubert (No. 6) and Bruckner (No. 4); songs by Richard Strauss, sung by the tenor Herbert Lippert; Berg's Violin Concerto, played by Frank Peter Zimmermann; and a work by the contemporary German Jörg Widmann. March 1-3. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
JENNIFER KOH You may see Ms. Koh early in the season, since she is enacting the frizzy-haired, fiddle-playing title character of Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's ''Einstein on the Beach'' in some performances (Sept. 14-16) of the Brooklyn Academy production. Here, in the second installment of her three-part multiyear series Bach and Beyond, she occupies the stage alone and presumably without fright wig, playing solo violin works by Bartok and Phil Kline, in addition to Bach. (A recording of the first part is to be released in October by Cedille Records.) March 2. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
'FRANCESCA DA RIMINI' The Met reserves runs of Riccardo Zandonai's infectiously dramatic verismo rarity for divas it really believes in. It was last mounted in the 1980s for Renata Scotto, and this new revival is a major endorsement of the soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek, a favorite in London whose New York career is just getting started. (She also joins the Met Orchestra for Wagner's ''Wesendonck Lieder'' at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 14.) Her co-star, the tenor Marcello Giordani, is ardent but inconsistent, two adjectives that also apply to the conductor, Marco Armiliato. But when Ms. Westbroek is in her groove, she is as thrilling as large stretches of Zandonai's score. Opens March 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
THE BACH VARIATIONS The early-music specialist Masaaki Suzuki and his Bach Collegium Japan and Yale Schola Cantorum join the New York Philharmonic in opening its monthlong festival. The program is built on a lovely idea, juxtaposing works by Bach with near counterparts by his great revivalist, Mendelssohn. (From each comes a Magnificat in D.) March 6-9. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'LA PASIÓN SEGÚN SAN MARCOS' As a sort of belated appendage to its festival Voices From Latin America, Carnegie Hall devotes its choral institute this season to Osvaldo Golijov's magnum opus. In the culminating performance, Robert Spano conducts the Orquesta la Pasión, members of the Schola Cantorum de Venezuela and choruses from area high schools. March 10. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Lincoln Center's Great Performers series, having presented the London Symphony and the Philharmonia Orchestra in the fall, completes its minifestival of major London orchestras. Vladimir Jurowski, the orchestra's principal conductor, presents two programs: first Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1, with Vadim Repin as soloist, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 5; then Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4, with Hélène Grimaud as soloist, and Mahler's Symphony No. 5. March 10-11. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
MASS IN B MINOR Happily, major American orchestras have been rediscovering Bach and the Baroque, having largely conceded that repertory to early-music specialists for several decades. The New York Philharmonic had a leg up with Kurt Masur as its music director through the 1990s. Coming from a long tenure in Leipzig, Germany, where Bach spent his last 27 years, Mr. Masur brought Bach's major choral works to the orchestra with some regularity and in 1998 even imported the choir of St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, which Bach had directed, for a ''St. Matthew Passion.'' It is good to see Alan Gilbert pick up the mantle here as part of a major Philharmonic series, the Bach Variations, with the New York Choral Artists and stellar vocal soloists: Dorothea Röschmann, Anne Sofie von Otter, Steve Davislim and Eric Owens. March 13-16. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' This season Renée Fleming has a coveted Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, for which she has programmed two recitals, including a battle of the divas alongside the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, and a concert with the New York Philharmonic. But the centerpiece is a semistaged concert performance of this gauzily lyrical André Previn opera, with Blanche DuBois created as a vehicle for Ms. Fleming, first performed in 1998. The work hasn't been heard much since, though it is being revived on March 26 at Lyric Opera of Chicago, where Ms. Fleming is the creative consultant. The Carnegie performance, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's under Patrick Summers, is a test run of sorts for that Chicago stand, featuring the same excellent supporting cast: Susanna Phillips, Teddy Tahu Rhodes and Anthony Dean Griffey. March 14. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY After this gloriously adventurous ensemble's American Mavericks festival last year at Carnegie Hall, which featured work from some of the out-there corners of the repertory, it will be a fascinating shift to hear it in the standards, in which the orchestra and its music director, Michael Tilson Thomas, also shine. The first night's program pairs Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 (with the brilliant Yuja Wang as soloist) and Brahms's First Symphony with the New York premiere of a work by Samuel Carl Adams, and the second concert features the Ninth Symphony of Mahler, a Thomas favorite. March 20-21. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
CARTER BREY New York Philharmonic audiences have been blessed, hearing Mr. Brey regularly since he became the orchestra's principal cellist in 1996. But the pleasure has been mixed, because he had to cut back sharply on his solo career to do it. In a substantial bit of payback, the Philharmonic puts Mr. Brey forward to perform Bach's six unaccompanied cello suites as part of its Bach Variations festival. Expect him to shine. March 27. Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, 65th Street and Central Park West, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org. (J.R.O.)
LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC At its premiere in Los Angeles in May, John Adams's oratorio ''The Gospel According to the Other Mary'' badly lagged dramatically, but many moments of its protean, searching score showed a mature composer at the height of his powers. The Philharmonic and its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, bring the work to New York with the same excellent soloists -- Tamara Mumford, Kelley O'Connor and Russell Thomas -- and a new element: a staging by the theater artist Peter Sellars, who collaborated with Mr. Adams on the libretto. The next evening's concert features Claude Vivier's ''Zipangu,'' for strings, ''La Mer'' by Debussy and Stravinsky's ''Firebird,'' the kind of vividly dramatic work at which Mr. Dudamel excels. March 27-28. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' Ivan Fischer's conducting appearances in New York invariably yield fine performances, but in recent years they have also become genuine events. In 2010 Mr. Fischer presented all the Beethoven symphonies, half on period instruments, half on modern; in 2011 he offered Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' in his own staging; and in April he led Mozart's Requiem with choristers intermingled among the orchestra to give the players a better feel for the text. Bach's great Passion is to be sure an event in itself, and no unusual twists have been announced -- yet. Mr. Fischer conducts Musica Sacra and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, with soloists including Dominique Labelle, John Tessier and Hanno Müller-Brachmann. March 28. Carnegie Hall. (In other notable performances of the ''St. Matthew Passion,'' John Scott conducts the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and Concert Royal at St. Thomas Church on March 21, and Julian Wachner conducts the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at Trinity Church on March 24.) (J.R.O.)
APRILIt is
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In all the rampant speculation about who might succeed James Levine as the orchestra's music director, the name Daniele Gatti seems to have receded. Mr. Gatti is a gifted and experienced maestro in midcareer and seems not to be overcommitted by the standards of conductors today, despite major posts at the Orchestre National de France and the Zurich Opera. In this series, after a mixed program conducted by Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, a veteran who has given the orchestra yeoman service during its transition, the second and third programs are conducted by Mr. Gatti. Though there is no reason to expect anything but excellent performances, it will be hard not to wonder what Mr. Levine might have done with Mahler's Third Symphony, one of his great specialties, this time around in the second program, or what he might have made of the third, all Wagner. Certainly, on each of these terrains, Mr. Gatti will be held to the highest standard, by orchestra and public alike. April 3-5. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'GIULIO CESARE' It's tough being the final new Met production of the year. With everyone exhausted and attention flagging, you tend, like Rodney Dangerfield, to get no respect. It doesn't help that David McVicar's version of this Handel masterpiece, which puts a colorful colonial-era, Neo-Classical spin on the ancient Egyptian setting, has already been captured on DVD. But the Met's cast -- David Daniels in the title role, Natalie Dessay as Cleopatra and the excellent Alice Coote as Sesto -- is of interest, and the conductor, Harry Bicket, is a pro at this repertory. The Met orchestra plays its heart out for him. Opens April 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'GESUALDO REFLECTIONS' The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is best known for the classics; its concerts are the place to go when you want a Beethoven quartet played with dependable polish. But the society also has a relatively unheralded, consistently creative and excellent new-music series in Lincoln Center's intimate Kaplan Penthouse. The highlight, though it doesn't take place at the penthouse, is a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the birth of the brilliant and murderous composer Carlo Gesualdo featuring the Antioch Chamber Ensemble, the pianist Soyeon Kate Lee and the Brentano String Quartet. In keeping with Gesualdo's experimental music, centuries ahead of its time, the program juxtaposes his work with 21st-century responses -- by Bruce Adolphe, Brett Dean, David Gompper and Wolfgang Rihm -- for various chamber forces. April 4. Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org. (Z.W.)
'DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN' There will be a degree of deja vu as the Met brings back Robert Lepage's version of Wagner's epic masterpiece for the first time as a piece of the repertory, after the rollout of the full cycle last season. For the three cycles Deborah Voigt and Katarina Dalayman still alternate as Brünnhilde; Jay Hunter Morris's bright-voiced Siegfried still gets his turn, as does Hans-Peter König's memorably rich Hagen; and the enormous planks of Mr. Lepage's machine still rotate impassively. The question will be whether and how the spectacle suffers without the intensity provided by some of last season's stars: Bryn Terfel, Jonas Kaufmann, Eva-Maria Westbroek and Waltraud Meier. Fabio Luisi conducts. Cycles open on April 6 and 25 and May 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'MOSÈ IN EGITTO' Rossini's serious operas still don't receive the productions they deserve; they are long and not easy to cast. But they have irresistible grandeur. Now the New York City Opera offers a super-rare staging of the Italian original at City Center, the company's original home. The production is directed by Michael Counts, the visually eclectic creator of City Opera's ''Monodramas'' evening; we'll see how he handles the climactic parting of the Red Sea. (Projections, credited to Ada Whitney/Beehive, will presumably play a role.) Jayce Ogren, City Opera's man for all seasons, conducts. Opens April 14. New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
DRESDEN STAATSKAPELLE It will be fascinating to catch up with this orchestra and itsprincipal conductor, Christian Thielemann, in view of the jockeying for power going on at European festivals. After Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic announced that they would leave the Salzburg Easter Festival next spring in favor of an event in Baden-Baden, Germany, Mr. Thielemann and the Staatskapelle were quick to move in. The Berlin Philharmonic sounded in splendid shape at Carnegie in February, and this season, just weeks after that Salzburg appearance, it is the Staatskapelle's turn in programs of Brahms (''Academic Festival Overture''; Violin Concerto, with Lisa Batiashvili as soloist; Symphony No. 4) and Bruckner (Symphony No. 8). April 17, 19. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'TRISTAN UND ISOLDE' The acclaimed Swedish dramatic soprano Nina Stemme, who set Carnegie Hall ablaze as Strauss's Salome with Franz Welser-Möst and the Cleveland Orchestra in May, has said that her way in life is ''to hurry slowly.'' She has held back in establishing a career in the United States, and she will take up Wagner's Isolde at the Met only in the 2016-17 season. American Wagnerites will undoubtedly flock to Houston to hear her do it sooner. Ben Heppner is scheduled to sing Tristan, but you may recall that he gave the Met fits in the role in 2008, claiming illness and showing up for only the last of six planned performances. Christof Loy directs, and Patrick Summers conducts. If it all comes together, it should be worth the trip. Opens April 18. Houston Grand Opera, Wortham Center, (713) 228-6737, houstongrandopera.org. (J.R.O.)
'LA PÉRICHOLE' Christopher Alden's dreamlike production of Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte'' was the bright spot in the New York City Opera's uninspired last season, the latest in a series of memorable shows the director has made for the company in recent years. He now turns his attention to a seemingly unlikely work: this farcical operetta by Offenbach about a Peruvian street singer who triangulates between her true love and a Spanish official. (Another frothy opera, Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus,'' is also on Mr. Alden's agenda this year, with a production opening in October at the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto.) Mr. Alden has a gift for bringing out the darkness and sophistication in the unlikeliest of places and pieces. Opens April 21. New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
'WAR REQUIEM' Of the many commemorations of Benjamin Britten's centennial here in 2013, this performance of a consummate masterpiece, a pacifist statement mingling the text of the Requiem Mass with poetry of Wilfred Owen, will undoubtedly be one of the more imposing, with Kent Tritle conducting the 200-voice Oratorio Society of New York, itself celebrating its 140th anniversary. The vocal soloists are the excellent Emalie Savoy, soprano; John Matthew Myers, tenor; and Jesse Blumberg, baritone. April 22. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
SWEDISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA New York admirers of the Swedish soprano Nina Stemme who cannot catch that ''Tristan und Isolde'' in Houston must content themselves with this catchall concert, in which she will perform songs of Berlioz, Brahms, Wagner, Grieg, Sibelius, Strauss and Weill. In addition, Thomas Dausgaard conducts the fine ensemble in works or parts of works by Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Elgar, Sibelius and Ravel. April 25. Alice Tully Hall. (J.R.O.)
STRAVINSKY SACRED WORKS Julian Wachner continues his emphasis on more or less contemporary fare this season with the Trinity Choir and Novus NY devoting a weekend to the complete sacred works by a restless master. Stravinsky essentially announced modernism in music with his ''Rite of Spring'' in 1913, then looked back over his shoulder with a Neo-Classicism largely of his own invention and finally found his way to the spare, serialist aesthetic that dominates in many of the works here. Rightly, the majestic ''Symphony of Psalms'' crowns the affair. April 26-27 at Trinity Church. April 28 at St. Paul's Chapel. (J.R.O.)
YALE IN NEW YORK This four-concert series concludes with a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Paul Hindemith, ''Prankster and Master'': a Yale professor for the 13 years before his death and an astonishingly prolific composer and champion of useful music (Gebrauchsmusik) most of whose works have largely fallen into disuse. The current faculty members Boris Berman, pianist, and Ettore Causa, violist, and members of the Yale Philharmonia perform works of Hindemith including the sure-to-be-immortal ''Overture to 'The Flying Dutchman' as Played at Sight by a Second-Rate Concert Orchestra at the Village Well at 7 O'Clock in the Morning,'' for string quartet. April 28. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
MAY
'DIALOGUES DES CARMÉLITES' Some critics, including Anthony Tommasini in The New York Times, have called for the Met to appoint a director of productions, who would work with the general manager, Peter Gelb, and the music director, whoever that may be, to plot the company's theatrical direction. (S0 far Mr. Gelb has resisted the idea.) The last time something like that happened was when John Dexter filled the position in the late 1970s and early '80s. Audiences are periodically reminded of that brief golden age for theater at the Met when Dexter's productions are revived; though more than 30 years old, their elegance and intelligence shine through, as in his spectacular yet subtle take on Britten's ''Billy Budd,'' performed last season. One of Dexter's finest shows was his ''Dialogues des Carmélites,'' as unadorned and inspired as Poulenc's score. This revival has a fine cast, including Isabel Leonard, Patricia Racette, Erin Morley, Elizabeth Bishop and Paul Appleby, conducted by Louis Langrée. Opens May 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK The fascinating program ''London's Musical Bridge: The Enlightened English'' pairs works by 18th-century native English composers with counterparts by Germans who had settled in London: thus, suites by John Avison and Handel, overtures by William Boyce and Johann Christian Bach, and sinfonias by Thomas Arne and Frederick William Herschel. Herschel, in his day job as astronomer, discovered the planet Uranus: enlightened indeed. May 4. First Church of Christ, Scientist, Central Park West at 68th Street, (212) 280-0330. earlymusicny.org. (J.R.O.)
SPRING FOR MUSIC This annual festival of North American orchestras, conceived by top music professionals to encourage and reward adventurous programming, has in its first two seasons effectively filled what it has shown to be a valuable niche: giving Carnegie Hall-exposure to ensembles showing initiative, several of which might otherwise never have found their way there. Carlos Kalmar and the Oregon Symphony -- who made the biggest splash in 2011 with a program they have since recorded for the Pentatone label, ''Music for a Time of War'' -- present a wide-ranging collection of works by Schubert, Ravel, Schoenberg, Kurt Weill and the Thai composer Narong Prangcharoen (May 9). Also returning to the festival, which mandates a year off between appearances, are David Alan Miller and the Albany Symphony Orchestra, who presented a program centered on spirituals in 2011 and now play another American program, with works by Gershwin, Morton Gould and John Harbison (May 7). In addition, Marin Alsop conducts the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra; JoAnn Falletta, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; Leonard Slatkin, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra; and Christoph Eschenbach, the National Symphony Orchestra. May 6-11. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
DETROIT SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA To single out the oddest of the Spring for Music programs: Leonard Slatkin conducts Ives's Symphonies Nos. 1 through 4, a notion utterly logical on its surface yet, given the ear-twisting complexities in much of the music, utterly bizarre. Not even counting however many intermissions and stage changes, the program runs well over two hours. But will Mr. Slatkin be able to resist adding an encore: say, Ives's attempt at a monster sequel, the ''Universe Symphony,'' which the Nashville Symphony performed in the completion by Larry Austin at Spring for Music this year? May 10. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
TOKYO STRING QUARTET Though the personnel has shifted in recent years, it was still quite a brand, established over 43 years of excellent performance (and kudos to Kazuhide Isomura, the violist, who saw it all). Now the quartet has decided to quit while still near the top. It has picked excellent collaborative works to go out with, both in this concert (Schubert's resolutely sunny String Quintet, with the cellist Lynn Harrell) and in its penultimate recording (Brahms's late, mellow Clarinet Quintet, with the clarinetist Jon Manasse), to be released by Harmonia Mundi in November. But the quartet takes final leave on its own, both here on stage, with works by Haydn and Bartok (the Sixth Quartet, his last), and on disc, with works of Dvorak and Smetana, scheduled for release in 2013. May 11. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' Looking around and noting the decided paucity of quality opera in its city, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, never an ensemble to rest on its laurels, is improbably turning itself into a de facto opera company. It is focusing on new and recent works but also unveiling a series of staged performances of Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte's three classic operas, conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and featuring sets and costumes by noted architects and fashion designers. Last year ''Don Giovanni'' was promising, but the logistics, with the orchestra far above and behind the singers, were a work in progress. For this year's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' the setup will be adjusted for a production designed by Jean Nouvel and Azzedine Alaïa and starring Christopher Maltmann and Dorothea Röschmann. May 17, 19, 23, 25. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com. (Z.W.)
'GILBERT'S PLAYLIST' If four programs in May and June are being put forward as Alan Gilbert's playlist, you have to wonder what that implies about the rest of his season with the New York Philharmonic. Rote? Required? But questions about the marketing strategy don't detract from the quality and creativity of the work he is offering under that unfortunate title. First come jazz-inflected works by Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Copland and Wynton Marsalis, played alongside the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, then Dallapiccola's stark one-act opera ''Il Prigioniero'' (featuring Gerald Finley and Patricia Racette), sharing a bill with Lisa Batiashvili in Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1. Mr. Gilbert offers his new arrangement of Wagner, ''A Ring Journey,'' with Christopher Rouse's ''Seeing,'' featuring the pianist Emanuel Ax. Finally, to close the season, Doug Fitch, who has collaborated with Mr. Gilbert and the orchestra in recent seasons, directs and designs an evening of Stravinsky ballets (''The Fairy's Kiss'' and ''Petrouchka'') with Karole Armitage creating choreography for the New York City Ballet dancer Sara Mearns. May 31-June 29. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
JUNE
STOKOWSKI CELEBRATION Now the gloves are off. Mr. Nézet-Séguin, for all practical purposes, embodies Stokowski, as the Philadelphia Orchestra returns to its treasured but acoustically flawed old home, the Academy of Music. In three days of intensive programming, he conducts Brahms's First Symphony and Dvorak's Ninth, Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade'' and works by Ippolitov-Ivanov and Wagner, an audience-choice program and repertory from the animated Disney film ''Fantasia.'' But in the film, Stokowski got to shake hands with Mickey Mouse. How do you replicate that, Mr. Nézet-Séguin? June 21-23. Academy of Music, Philadelphia, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org. (J.R.O.)

LE POÈME HARMONIQUE New Yorkers have done well in recent years to make the acquaintance of L'Arpeggiata, a Paris-based ensemble that combines the highest level of early-music artistry and imagination with shifting degrees of theatricality. Now another fine French-based early-music group, which likes additionally to perform by candlelight if not in total darkness, receives its most prominent New York exposure to date, opening the season of the Miller Theater at Columbia University. The program, ''Venezia,'' is predictably heavy on works by Monteverdi, less predictably so on works by Francesco Manelli. Then again, Le Poème, like L'Arpeggiata, seems to put little premium on predictability. Just keep an open mind, and revel in the unexpected. Wednesday, Friday. (James R. Oestreich) 
TWELVE IN '12 Though by now it has been reduced to Nine in '12. Julian Wachner's music program at Trinity Wall Street, which did spectacular service in the first half of last season, especially for the Sept. 11 anniversary commemorations, only to be suspended for much of the second half for a re-evaluation of finances and purpose, is back and seeking new challenges. Under Mr. Wachner the program has become a hotbed of early music, especially with the Trinity Choir's Bach at One series at St. Paul's Chapel (which resumes on Oct. 1). Now, expanding the activities of Trinity's instrumental ensemble Novus NY, Mr. Wachner plans to make contemporary music an equal partner. Here, in a series of hourlong midday concerts, he opens the Trinity season with works by Pulitzer Prize-winning composers of the last dozen years. The first program, scheduled for last Thursday, offered works of Steven Stucky, Zhou Long and Paul Moravec. This week's concert features Jennifer Higdon, David Lang and John Corigliano. Still to come are Kevin Puts, Yehudi Wyner, John Adams, Henry Brant, Steve Reich and Ornette Coleman. Thursday (also Sept. 20, 27). Trinity Church. (J.R.O.)
'EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH' There have been many great operas, but only a few have redefined the very meaning of the art form. Of that select group, Monteverdi's ''Orfeo'' and Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' receive regular performances, but Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's 1976 masterpiece, ''Einstein on the Beach,'' which stretched the bounds of duration and plotlessness, is more talked about than seen. That makes this revival of the original production, part of an international tour honoring Mr. Glass's 75th birthday, one of the season's crucial events. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. Opens Friday. (Zachary Woolfe)
'I DUE FOSCARI' The Los Angeles Opera has retrenched artistically in recent seasons, having taken a huge chance on Achim Freyer's ambitious, often brilliant production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle. This year the only divergence from the standard repertory is this rarely performed tale of political and personal intrigue in 15th-century Venice, which is being mounted for the company's general director, the tenor Plácido Domingo, as he takes another step on his controversial path through Verdi's baritone roles. He is joined by the tenor Francesco Meli and the soprano Marina Poplavskaya; James Conlon, the company's music director, conducts. Opens Saturday. Los Angeles Opera, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, (213) 972-8001, laopera.com. (Z.W.)
NATE WOOLEY When this avant-garde trumpeter played part of his mesmerizing ''Seven Storey Mountain'' at Issue Project Room in June, he used a trumpet without a mouthpiece, amplifying it to create breathy, lightly pitched, sometimes squawking, sometimes almost spoken sounds that whispered over a dense shimmer of other instruments. He returns, again under the auspices of Issue Project Room, with another of the instrument's innovators, Mazen Kerbaj, for an evening of solos and duets. Sept. 19. Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral, 113 Remsen Street, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Alan Gilbert and the orchestra have restructured the opening of their season so that it no longer begins with a gala concert, however frothy. (That happens on Sept. 27, with Itzhak Perlman playing morsels by Massenet and Kreisler, and Mr. Gilbert adding Respighi's ''Fountains of Rome'' and ''Pines of Rome.'') Instead the season opens with a substantial subscription program: Gyorgy Kurtag's ''... quasi una fantasia ...''; Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Leif Ove Andsnes as soloist; and Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' You may run into ''The Rite'' a lot this season, in anticipation of the 100th anniversary of its scandalous premiere in May. (Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic also open their subscription season with it on Sept. 28.) But in this case it may be as much a matter of Mr. Gilbert's wanting to continue honing his interpretation of a thorny classic that he also performed in March, with the Juilliard Orchestra. Sept. 19-22. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
COMPOSER PORTRAITS This invaluable series -- the centerpiece of the Miller Theater's programming, established by George Steel and carried through admirably by his success sor as director of the theater, Melissa Smey, with, bless her, a greater concentration on women -- has generally featured living composers. But it starts this year with a nod to the centenary of John Cage: a program of Cage (and Pierre Boulez's ''Marteau Sans Maître'') with Steven Schick conducting the International Contemporary Ensemble. Other composers featured this season at the Miller are Jonathan Harvey, Olga Neuwirth, Sofia Gubaidulina, Enno Poppe, Rebecca Saunders, Oliver Knussen and Julio Estrada. The Composer Portraits series also goes on the road, to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, with programs devoted to Fred Lerdahl (Oct. 18) and Ms. Gubaidulina (March 21; a somewhat different program). Sept. 20. Miller Theater. (J.R.O.)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM The Met concert series, long a bastion of traditional classical music programming, sports a new face, as Limor Tomer, its new general manager, presents her first full season of programs. Here the Wordless Music orchestra joins the Danish art-rock group Efterklang in songs from that band's new album, ''Piramida.'' Page 33. Sept. 22. (J.R.O.)
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Nothing is easy for this ensemble as it searches for a music director to succeed James Levine, who resigned in 2011. Last September the prime candidates seemed to be Riccardo Chailly and Andris Nelsons, and both were well represented in that season's programming. But Mr. Chailly had to cancel because of a heart arrhythmia; Mr. Nelsons, because of the birth of his child. Mr. Chailly must surely be out of the running now, the orchestra having struggled through no end of health crises with Mr. Levine. Mr. Nelsons, who caught up with the orchestra at Tanglewood this summer and is scheduled to appear in Boston this season (Jan. 31; Feb. 1-2, 5), still seems to be a front-runner, though he just extended his contract as music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in England through the 2014-15 season. Other names currently circulating include those of Vladimir Jurowski, who makes his Boston Symphony debut in October (11-13), and -- a dark horse -- Esa-Pekka Salonen, who is not scheduled to conduct the Boston Symphony this season. The season opens here with Itzhak Perlman conducting a program of Beethoven in which he also performs the two violin romances. It seems safe to say that he harbors no ambitions to become the orchestra's music director. Sept. 22. Symphony Hall, (617) 266-1200 or (888) 266-1200, bso.org. (J.R.O.)
'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' How can you tell that a singer and a composer are riding high at the Metropolitan Opera? When they are given two opening nights in a row. The star soprano Anna Netrebko, who opened the last season in the title role of ''Anna Bolena,'' takes on another Donizetti opera -- though not ''Maria Stuarda,'' the follow-up to ''Bolena,'' as Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager originally hoped. (That vehicle falls to the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato on New Year's Eve.) Instead Ms. Netrebko plays Adina in a new production of the classic comedy ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' which combines ample laughs with threads of melancholy and touching emotion. The tenor Matthew Polenzani plays the love-struck Nemorino; the charismatic baritone Mariusz Kwiecien is Sergeant Belcore, his rival for Adina's affections; and the bass Ambrogio Maestri (and later in the run, the winning Erwin Schrott) sings Dr. Dulcamara, the lovable quack who dispenses the supposed elixir of love. Bartlett Sher, whose Met productions can teeter between spirited and frenetic, directs; Maurizio Benini conducts the burbling, effortlessly charming score. Opens Sept. 24. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The great joy of the society's concerts is the interaction of up-and-coming musicians with established ones: a violinist like Benjamin Beilman, say, on the cusp of a major career, and the veteran flutist Ransom Wilson. Those two, along with a host of colleagues, will play an opening program of serenades by Mozart, Kodaly, Strauss and Dvorak, the introduction to a season that reaches from Bach's keyboard concertos (played by Jeremy Denk as part of the annual Baroque Festival in December) by way of 19th-century classics to the complete Shostakovich string quartets in March. Sept. 24. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
'DOG DAYS' David T. Little, a percussionist with a composerly predilection for the theater, presents an example, ''Dog Days,'' as part of the Peak Performances series at Montclair State University (with another, ''Soldier Songs,'' to follow from Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now in January). Page 35. Opens Sept 29. Kasser Theater, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org. (J.R.O.)
GREEN MUSIC CENTER If ever there was a concert hall worth emulating, it is the Musikverein in Vienna, and the designers of Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood studied it well. If ever there was an indoor-outdoor concert hall worth emulating, it is Ozawa Hall, and those same designers -- notably the architect, William Rawn and the acoustician Lawrence Kirkegaard -- were recruited to do likewise with a 1,400-seat hall on the campus of Sonoma State University. An infusion of funds from Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of the board of Carnegie Hall, and his wife, Joan Weill, gave it a name, Weill Hall. (So is it Tanglewood West or Carnegie West?) The opening weekend includes a recital by the pianist Lang Lang and a concert by the Santa Rosa Symphony, conducted by its music director, Bruno Ferrandis, and others. Sept. 29-30. Green Music Center, Rohnert Park, Calif., (866) 955-6040, gmc.sonoma.edu. (J.R.O.)
'THE RITE OF SPRING' AT 100 This season-long festival gets a jump on the centennial of the masterpiece that not only defined Stravinsky's career -- more in subsequent performances than in its tempestuous premiere on May 29, 1913 -- but also set the course for much of 20th-century music, on into the 21st. The celebration opens here with ''The Seasons,'' by Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky commissioned for the occasion and performed by the cellist Y0-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble. Mr. Yanov-Yanovsky adapts folk tunes used by Stravinsky in ''The Rite.'' Later events include multiple staged interpretations of the work, notably the Joffrey Ballet's attempt at a ''literal re-creation'' of the original choreography (March 23-24) and a new Basil Twist rendering with puppets (April 12-13). Valery Gergiev conducts the Mariinsky Orchestra in two concerts, the second culminating in ''The Rite'' (Oct. 29-30, after a scholarly conference on ''Reassessing 'The Rite,''' Oct. 25-28), and Giancarlo Guerrero leads the Cleveland Orchestra in a program featuring Stravinsky's ''Petrouchka'' (March 17). Actually, the festival isn't quite season-long, ending in late April, before the actual anniversary. Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Carolina Performing Arts, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, (919) 843-3333. theriteofspringat100.org. (J.R.O.)
OCTOBER
'THE PRISMATIC DEBUSSY' New York City's major cultural institutions have largely ignored the 150th anniversary of the birth of Debussy, so the Eastman School of Music is picking up the slack with a series of concerts exploring his multifaceted output, held in conjunction with lectures, films and exhibitions. Oct. 1-27. Eastman School of Music, Rochester, (585) 274-1100, esm.rochester.edu/debussy. (Z.W.)
CECILIA BARTOLI ''Steffani's star isn't in the ascendant,'' says the heroine (a musicologist!) of the Venice-based mystery writer Donna Leon's novel ''The Jewels of Paradise,'' to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press in October. Well, the star of Agostino Steffani -- ''composer and bishop, musician and diplomat,'' in Ms. Leon's words -- may soon rise, at least by a blip. As EMI Classics tries to ride the coattails of E.L. James's steamy potboiler ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' with an album of works mentioned in the book (there will be no quotations from that book here, nor any endorsement of that recording), Decca takes a more imaginative approach to a publishing tie-in with Ms. Bartoli's latest project, ''Mission,'' a two-disc set of arias and other works by Steffani. Ms. Leon and Ms. Bartoli are said to be friends, and they evidently shared scholarly groundwork in conjuring Steffani's personage and reviving his music. Ms. Leon's protagonist, hired to sort through newly discovered documents left behind by Steffani, recalls tunes of his that she has heard: ''What was that heartbreaking lament, something about 'Dal mio petto'?'' And Ms. Bartoli sings a good many of them, including that one, from the opera ''Niobe.'' As with her previous album ''Sacrificium: The Art of the Castrati,'' Ms. Bartoli strikes an androgynous pose, this time as a bald-pated, crucifix-clutching (and per Ms. Leon, castrated?) Steffani for the cover art. Oct. 2. Decca. (J.R.O.)
CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA This year the great Chicagoans fill the coveted spot opening the Carnegie Hall season. It is the start of the orchestra's third year under the music director Riccardo Muti, who has had the ensemble playing with characteristic sheen and power through the eclectic programs he favors. The three-night stand at Carnegie veers from Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' on opening night -- no one is better than Mr. Muti at ratcheting up the drama in vocal and choral works -- to music of Wagner, Franck, Dvorak, Martucci, Respighi and the young composer-D.J. Mason Bates. Oct 3-5. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
TWOSENSE All-stars from the All-Stars. The brilliant and searching Lisa Moore was the founding pianist of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, a position she held until 2008, and Ashley Bathgate is the group's current cellist. The two came together in 2010 as a commissioning and performing duo devoted to pairing new works and the classics. This program features premieres by Ryan Brown, Daniel Felsenfeld and Hannah Lash. Oct. 4. Roulette, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org. (Z.W.)
EMANUEL AX As artist in residence with the New York Philharmonic this season, the beloved pianist makes a move many of us have long been waiting for, taking up music of Bach in concert: here, the Keyboard Concerto in D minor (BWV 1052). In addition, he shows his marvelous versatility by working on an opposite fringe of the standard repertory, with Schoenberg's Piano Concerto. Alan Gilbert conducts the program, which also includes Mozart's ''Linz'' Sympony. Oct. 4-6. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
MINSOO SOHN The Honens International Piano Competition in Calgary, Alberta, which has developed a better track record than most, has been trying to beef up its international presence in recent years. In April, it held quarterfinals in New York for this year's competition, which concludes in Calgary in October. It has also started a record label to feature its winners, and Mr. Sohn, the 2006 prize laureate, made a big impression with a release of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations,'' which he now brings to New York along with variations by Brahms and Webern. Page 35. Oct 6. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
'LA FINTA GIARDINIERA' René Jacobs's recordings of Mozart's operas bring back some of the thrill that must have attended these works when they were new; his ''Nozze di Figaro,'' in particular, truly does make you hear that work as if for the first time. (Who knew that that critical commonplace could ever be deserved?) ''La Finta Giardiniera,'' one of Mozart's earliest operas, has long hovered in semiobscurity -- not a true rarity but not often performed, either -- despite its gorgeous music and acute libretto. Mr. Jacobs and the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra are sure to locate both its uproarious farce and its core of melancholy. The only downside of a new installment in the series is that it gets that much closer to coming to an end. Oct. 9. Harmonia Mundi. (Z.W.)
GREAT MUSIC IN A GREAT SPACE The conductor and organist Kent Tritle, best known for Sacred Music in a Sacred Space, the acclaimed, longstanding series he founded at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, revived a similarly named series presented in earlier years at St. John the Divine, when he moved there during the last season. Here he conducts the Cathedral Choir and Orchestra in Bach's certifiably great Mass in B minor. Oct. 10. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, (866) 811-4111, stjohndivine.org. (J.R.O)
RENÉE ANNE LOUPRETTE This excellent organist, who like Kent Tritle left her position at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola and is now at Trinity Wall Street, inaugurates another new feature in Trinity's suddenly resurgent music program: Pipes at One, a series of 40-minute midday organ recitals (by her and others) on the beautifully restored Schlicker organ at St. Paul's Chapel. No repertory has been announced yet; trust Ms. Louprette to make it worth your while. Oct. 3. (J.R.O.)
'MOBY-DICK' The first products of the David Gockley leadership at the San Francisco Opera, which began in 2006, showed little of the enterprise that characterized Mr. Gockley's 33 years at the Houston Grand Opera. But this season represents something of a breakthrough for Mr. Gockley and the company. Jake Heggie's adaptation of ''Moby-Dick,'' Herman Melville's masterpiece, had its premiere at the Dallas Opera in 2010 and is the first of three operas by living American composers being presented. (Nolan Gasser's family-friendly ''Secret Garden'' has its premiere on March 1, and Mark Adamo's ''Gospel of Mary Magdalene'' opens on June 19.) These are not the most adventurous composers working in opera today, but taken together their works add up to a considerable and refreshing commitment to the art form's present and future. Opens Oct. 10. War Memorial Opera House, (413) 864-3330, sfopera.com. (Z.W.)
NIELSEN PROJECT One of Alan Gilbert's marquee initiatives as he gets deeper into his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic is a series of concerts and recordings over a number of years exploring the six symphonies and three concertos of the underappreciated Danish composer Carl Nielsen. Having spent time with some of the symphonies, Mr. Gilbert turns his attention this season to the concertos for flute (with the orchestra's principal, Robert Langevin) and violin (with the guest soloist Nikolaj Znaider) in a program with Tchaikovsky's grand Second Symphony, the ''Little Russian.'' Oct. 10-13. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA Some of us recall the founding of this conductorless ensemble as if it were yesterday and still sort of wonder (despite the continuing success of the 62-year-old Prague Chamber Orchestra, among other conductor-free groups) whether the noble experiment will succeed. Well don't look now, but Orpheus, having recorded more than 70 albums, celebrates its 40th anniversary this season. Evidently it is here to stay. Its first program offers Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' Overture; ''Earth Echoes,'' a song cycle by Augusta Read Thomas, sung by the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke and the baritone Nathan Gunn; and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, which the orchestra has performed numerous ... er, never. It's a great piece, Orpheus; you'll love it. Carnegie Hall. Oct. 11. (J.R.O.)
'WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE' There will be a bittersweet quality to this new production of Oliver Knussen's captivating opera based on the beloved, bracing children's book by Maurice Sendak, who died in May. Brilliantly juxtaposed with Ravel's ''Mother Goose,'' it is being presented as part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's sweeping commitment to new and recent opera under its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, who conducts a cast that includes Claire Booth and Susan Bickley. The production is by the British director and video artist Netia Jones, who will conjure up animations based on Sendak's classic illustrations. (Ms. Jones is well practiced in Mr. Knussen's take on Sendak, having created a version of the operatic ''Higglety Pigglety Pop'' this summer at the Tanglewood Festival in Massachusetts.) Oct. 11-14. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com. (Z.W.)
YANNICK NÉZET-SÉGUIN Finally! Four years after the departure of Christoph Eschenbach as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and two years after it was announced that Mr. Nézet-Séguin (whom, for obvious reasons, the orchestra has been marketing on a first-name basis) would succeed him, the once fabulous Philadelphians again have a music director. Happily, they had expert musical guidance in the interim from an eminently capable and devoted principal conductor, Charles Dutoit, who maintained a high level of artistic achievement as administrative chaos swirled around him. (That included a period without music director, executive director or board chairman, and a 2011 filing for bankruptcy protection, from which the orchestra emerged in late July.) The delay, it turns out, had a good, or at least opportune, side, allowing the orchestra now to cloak Mr. Nézet-Séguin in the mantle of messiah, since it was just 100 years ago that Leopold Stokowski, who had a huge formative influence on the orchestra, arrived. Let the comparisons begin, in a gala concert featuring the soprano Renée Fleming and anchored by Brahms's Fourth Symphony. Oct. 18. Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org. (J.R.O.)
MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA It has been a tough time financially for American orchestras, and several of them had yet to negotiate new contracts with the players by press time (others including the Cleveland Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra). In addition, the Minnesota Orchestra faces a season of wandering as its Orchestra Hall is being renovated. (New Yorkers can only envy the resolve: what would a year or two of imaginative wandering by the Philharmonic matter if we could solve the Avery Fisher Hall Problem once and for all?) Osmo Vanska has worked artistic wonders as the orchestra's music director, and he can probably be counted on to steer it through these extracurricular shoals as well. He opens the season with a program of Elgar, Rachmaninoff (Piano Concerto No. 3, with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist) and Respighi at the orchestra's temporary home. Oct. 18-20. Auditorium at the Convention Center, Minnesota, (612) 371-5656, minnesotaorchestra.org. (J.R.O.)
WORLD ORCHESTRA FOR PEACE This international assemblage of star players, founded in 1995 by the conductor Georg Solti and conducted here by Valery Gergiev, who is widely active in New York over the next two weeks, celebrates the Solti centennial. The program includes excerpts of operas by Mozart and Verdi, with the soprano Angela Gheorghiu and the bass René Pape, Strauss's ''Don Juan'' and Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra (which Solti conducted with a particular, Hungarian flair). Oct. 19. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
LES ARTS FLORISSANTS Before this peerless Baroque-music ensemble and its director, William Christie, bring their production of Marc-Antoine Charpentier's ''David et Jonathas'' to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in mid-April, they offer a teaser of sorts with rare performances of three of Charpentier's impassioned sacred motets. A week later members of the group join the terrific student ensemble Juilliard415 for Handel's glorious oratorio ''Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno'' (''The Triumph of Time and Truth''). Alice Tully Hall. Oct. 19, 27. (Z.W.)
'GLASS AT 75' As we said, no end of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' this season: here the four-hand piano version, played by Maki Namekawa and Dennis Russell Davies, and given historical context between works by Debussy -- ''En Blanc et Noir,'' actually composed two years after ''The Rite,'' in 1915 -- and Philip Glass, the ostensible subject of the program. Oct. 21. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, (212) 685-0008, ext. 560, themorgan.org. (J.R.O.)
NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG Celebrating its 25th anniversary, this worthy enterprise opens its season with a program timed with an eye toward the election, ''Mr. Gershwin Goes to Washington.'' It's actually Mr. Gershwins, plural: an evening of satire drawn from George and Ira Gershwin's songs about politics, directed and adapted by Laurence Maslon. The featured artists are the sopranos Anne-Carolyn Bird and Lauren Worsham and the pianists Steven Blier, the festival's artistic director, and Joseph Thalken. A tease in the season announcement promises that ''a distinguished member of the political news media will be the surprise guest narrator.'' We're all a-twit. (And so as not to spoil the surprise when the program itself goes to Washington a couple of days later, the narrator there will be different.) Oct. 20. Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan. Oct. 22. Terrace Theater, Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, (212) 501-3330, nyfos.org. (J.R.O.)
LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Here is Valery Gergiev again, with one of his own orchestras. The London Symphony is making much of the the 100th anniversary of its first North American appearance, claiming that it was ''the first European orchestra to visit the United States and Canada.'' (It was originally booked for the fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic, whose delay forced the players to board a smaller ship; they were already in St. Louis when they learned of the disaster.) Not that the programming particularly reflects the occasion. It is all Brahms: the Symphonies Nos. 2 and 4, the Violin Concerto (with James Ehnes as soloist), the Piano Concerto No. 1 (with Denis Matsuev) and the ''Tragic Overture.'' It might all seem more special if Kurt Masur were not scheduled to conduct two weeks of Brahms (Symphonies Nos. 2-4, Double Concerto) with the New York Philharmonic in the same hall in early November. (Whether an increasingly frail Mr. Masur can endure all of that is another matter.) Oct. 22, 24. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'THE TEMPEST' New York is kept mostly up-to-date with the orchestral and solo piano music of the mercurial English composer Thomas Adès, but his masterly 2004 Shakespeare adaptation, one of the most praised operas of the 21st century, is just now receiving its New York premiere. It is one of the vanishingly few contemporary operas to receive the Metropolitan Opera's imprimatur, and the company is giving it a brilliant, mostly young cast. Mr. Adès conducts. The only element to give pause is the director, Robert Lepage, whose production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle was roundly dismissed by critics. Whether he can return to his roots as a darling of the theatrical avant-garde may be the biggest question of the Met season. Page 33. Opens Oct. 23. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA The brilliant young conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin has so far been best known in New York for his opera performances: memorably galvanic takes on Bizet's ''Carmen'' and Gounod's ''Faust'' at the Metropolitan Opera. For his first Carnegie Hall appearance as music director of the marvelous Philadelphians, he works to his dramatic strengths, offering Verdi's operatic-scale, hellfire-breathing Requiem, with the orchestra joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir. The soloists are the only real difficulty, since two of the four -- the febrile soprano Marina Poplavskaya and the often ailing tenor Rolando Villazón -- have a way of polarizing opera fans. But this is Mr. Nézet-Séguin's chance to shine and, perhaps, to fuel speculation that he eventually may be a candidate to replace James Levine as the Met's music director. Oct. 23. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
WHITE LIGHT FESTIVAL When this festival began in 2010 as an exploration of transcendence, it seemed more a personal statement by its creator, Jane Moss, the artistic director of Lincoln Center, than any particular sign of the times. But with themes of spirituality having recently taken hold at festivals in Salzburg, Austria, and Lucerne, Switzerland, and elsewhere, Ms. Moss seems to have caught the beginnings of an international wave, to whatever extent she did not herself set it in motion. The festival opens with a free program, ''Without Shadows,'' featuring Kiran Ahluwalia, a Punjabi vocalist, with Indian percussion and contemporary instruments. Oct. 23. David Rubinstein Atrium. (J.R.O.)
ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Flexibility is a rare commodity in the programming of major orchestras and concert halls, especially when international appearances are involved. Planning is done far in advance, and there are too many moving parts to allow much change. But the Israel Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta, its music director for life, who made a strong showing in the Salzburg Festival's Spiritual Overture in July with two programs based mostly in Judaism, decided to build quickly on that success. They set aside the big pieces originally scheduled for this appearance (Hindemith's ''Mathis der Maler'' and Brahms's First Symphony) and replaced them with works from their first festival concert: Schoenberg's ''Kol Nidre'' and Noam Sheriff's ''Mechaye Hametim'' (''Revival of the Dead''), a Holocaust remembrance. Both are choral works, and the switch was doable because the chorus used in Salzburg was the Collegiate Chorale of New York, and the baritone Thomas Hampson was available (or made himself available) to reprise his roles. The flexibility could not be complete, since the orchestra had a commitment to another soloist, the young pianist Yuja Wang, and few will object to hearing her perform Mendelssohn's First Piano Concerto. But the cost is Mr. Hampson's searing interpretation of Mahler's ''Kindertotenlieder'' (''Songs on the Death of Children''), which, though composed as a personal statement 40 years before the Holocaust, made for a better thematic fit. Oct. 25. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
GABRIEL KAHANE An emblem of a generation of composers who work eagerly and beautifully in multiple genres, Mr. Kahane is a noted composer of pop music, concert works and musical theater. (His ''February House'' recently completed a run at the Public Theater.) In ''Don't Even Listen'' he is joined by the vocalist Shara Worden and the young string quartet Brooklyn Rider for a program that encompasses works old and new, including a premiere (''The Fiction Issue'') and songs by Cee Lo Green, Schubert, Schumann, Sufjan Stevens and Mr. Kahane himself. Oct. 25. Zankel Hall. (Z.W.)
'OUT COLD'/'ZIPPO SONGS' Bigger, in the arts, is not lately better. With more and more music, dance and theater conceived on a chamber scale, it is only natural to want smaller spaces for them. This season the Brooklyn Academy of Music unveils its new Richard B. Fisher Building, designed for performances more intimate than those in its older theaters. One of the early offerings is this program of two song cycles by Phil Kline, best known for his widely performed, ambulatory piece for the winter holidays, ''Unsilent Night,'' in which both audience and recorded sound source travel around. ''Zippo Songs'' (2003), with texts from lines inscribed on the sides of Zippo lighters by American G.I.'s in Vietnam, will be heard in a new arrangement for string quintet, piano and percussion, and the new ''Out Cold'' has Schubert's ''Winterreise'' meet some of Frank Sinatra's wintriest recordings for a reflection on introversion and isolation. The longtime Kline collaborator Theo Bleckmann sings alongside the well-regarded American Contemporary Music Ensemble in stagings directed by Emma Griffin. Oct. 25-27. BAM Fisher. (Z.W.)
BRITTEN CENTENNIAL Few enjoy the rote attention that composers tend to get paid in major anniversary years, but the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center seems sincere in its season-long tribute to Benjamin Britten, who was born a century ago, in 1913, and whose chamber music is among the most distinguished parts of his wide-ranging output. In three fascinating programs the Escher String Quartet juxtaposes Britten's quartets with a variety of repertory: first with the Baroque and Beethoven, then with fellow British composers and finally with other quartets composed during and after World War II. A final concert featuring various artists offers a rich selection of Britten's music, including the adorable ''Insect Pieces'' for oboe and piano; the sublime mini-opera canticle ''Abraham and Isaac,'' featuring the countertenor Daniel Taylor and the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey; and the eloquent Cello Sonata, with David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, the society's artistic directors. There are few gifts to the city this year as sweet as the immersion in this music that the society is offering. Oct. 25, Feb. 28, May 2. Rose Studio. May 10. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The Philadelphia Orchestra is not the only ensemble celebrating a Stokowski legacy this season. The maestro founded the American Symphony to perform at Carnegie Hall in 1962, after the New York Philharmonic had decamped for Lincoln Center. Now the American Symphony, which returned to Carnegie after a long absence in 2010, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with an outsize concert conducted by its music director of the last two decades, the intrepid Leon Botstein. It opens with the first work Stokowski performed with the ensemble, his own arrangement of ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' and also includes Ives's Fourth Symphony, whose premiere Stokowski and the orchestra presented in 1965, 11 years after Ives's death. The program, also featuring the Collegiate Chorale, is filled out with Mahler's gargantuan ''Symphony of a Thousand,'' typically given as a concert in itself. True the symphonies add up to only 90 minutes in time, but in weight? For this concert, ticket prices are being rolled back to 1962 levels, from $1.50 to $7, and no question, it's a lot of bang for your buck-fifty. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
MARLIS PETERSEN For her New York recital debut this coolly intelligent soprano, best known to New York audiences for stepping in for Natalie Dessay in a new production of Ambroise Thomas's ''Hamlet'' in 2010, brings a program focused on Goethe's concept of the eternal feminine. The music ranges from the core of classic lieder -- Beethoven, Schubert, Wolf, Schumann -- to 20th-century masters like Hanns Eisler and Walter Braunfels. She is joined by the pianist Jendrik Springer. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
DJ SPOOKY And here is the personification of the new concert programming at the Metropolitan Museum: Paul D. Miller, a k a DJ Spooky, That Subliminal Kid, an artist in residence for the season. Here he presents a screening of the 1956 film ''Madame Freedom'' with a rescoring for string quartet. Page 33. Oct. 26. Metropolitan Museum. (J.R.O.)
ANDRAS SCHIFF With this pianist playing Bach, you almost needn't say more. Whereas other pianists perform Bach, some of them magnificently, Mr. Schiff seems to embody him, so thoroughly has he internalized the music and so freely does he let it unfold. Here, beginning a two-season comprehensive Bach Project in various New York halls, he plays ''The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Books 1 and 2. Page 35. 92nd Street Y. Oct. 27, Nov. 1. (J.R.O.)
ANGELA HEWITT Bachians may think they had died and gone to heaven. To tide them over between Mr. Schiff's ''Well-Tempered'' recitals, Ms. Hewitt, one of those pianists who perform Bach's music magnificently, offers the ''Goldberg'' Variations, and you can listen with beer in hand: in H.L. Mencken's words, Bach's ''natural solvent.'' Page 35. Oct. 28. Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lprnyc.com. (J.R.O.)
ELGAR, CARTER CELLO CONCERTOS Jacqueline du Pré's recording of the Elgar Cello Concerto with her husband, Daniel Barenboim, wasn't her best take on her signature work; that honor goes to the album she made with John Barbirolli. But her collaboration with Mr. Barenboim remains a potent mixture of the personal and the artistic. So it is major news indeed that Mr. Barenboim has now made another recording of the grand, lyrical work, 25 years after du Pré's untimely death, and with another female cellist: the richly gifted Alisa Weilerstein. The orchestra is the Berlin Staatskapelle, and the Elgar is intriguingly paired with another grand cello concerto, Elliott Carter's shivering, heaving, bursting addition to the repertory, from 2000. Oct. 30. Decca. (Z.W.)
MARIINSKY ORCHESTRA And here is Valery Gergiev again, with his other orchestra, fresh from presenting two concerts at the Carolina Performing Arts festival The Rite of Spring at 100, where they performed the title work. No Stravinsky here: Mr. Gergiev and his St. Petersburg troops offer a suite from Rodion Shchedrin's ''Little Humpbacked Horse,'' Shostakovich's Symphony No. 6 and Strauss's ''Heldenleben.'' Oct. 31. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
NOVEMBER
LIQUID MUSIC The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra -- assuming that the ensemble itself is still liquid by then, given reports of financial constraints and threats to its full-time status -- will offer a new series of six boundary-crossing programs, beginning, as the presidential election approaches, with the performance artist Laurie Anderson's politically tinged ''Dirtday!'' Other programs feature guest artists of many alt-classical stripes mingling with members of the orchestra at locations in St. Paul, mostly the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Center. Nov. 2-3. Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, (651) 291-1144. thespco.org/liquidmusic. (J.R.O.)
VOICES FROM LATIN AMERICA With Clive Gillinson as its executive and artistic director, Carnegie has made a specialty of organizing major citywide festivals, often on international themes. Here is another. The Carnegie performances open with an evening by the popular artist Gilberto Gil, one of the artistic advisers (along with Gustavo Dudamel, Osvaldo Golijov and Chucho Valdés). Strictly classical music will play a relatively small part in the festival (which runs through Dec. 11), aside from concerts by the New Juilliard Ensemble, the Ensemble ACJW and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela. Nov. 8. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' The director David Alden, whose politically charged, vividly theatrical productions have been praised and debated since the 1980s, worked briefly at the Met early in his career, refurbishing productions of Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and Berg's ''Wozzeck.'' But he makes his real company debut with this seething Verdi work about betrayal at a royal court. It was set to star the soprano Karita Mattila, but she pulled out in May, after deciding that the role no longer fitted her voice, and was replaced by Sondra Radvanovsky, a stalwart of the Met's Verdi wing. Marcelo Álvarez, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Kathleen Kim also star, and the cast is rounded out by the veteran Dolora Zajick as Ulrica. Fabio Luisi conducts. Opens Nov. 8. Metropolitan Opera House.

VOX FESTIVAL One of the New York City Opera's signature offerings, this laboratory for full-orchestra readings of excerpts from contemporary American operas has been constricted to just six works on a single day, but it continues nevertheless. Now presented in conjunction with the service organization Opera America, this season's festival will feature works by the downtown favorite John Zorn (a ''mystery play'' based on the life and work of Hildegard von Bingen), Moto Osada, Christopher Weiss, Evan Meier, James Stepleton (''The Awakening,'' based on the Kate Chopin novella) and Osnat Netzer. Nov. 8. N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, La Guardia Place at Washington Square South, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET Second to none in French repertory, this pianist -- long unfairly known more for his sartorial choices than for his musical ones -- gives a recital devoted to Debussy, who, though celebrating his 150th birthday, is largely ignored this year by New York's cultural institutions. Nov. 10. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA These days the orchestra tends to alternate in New York between making big statements -- as with its Bruckner symphonies at the Lincoln Center Festival last year and its concert performance of Strauss's opera ''Salome'' at Carnegie Hall in May -- and slipping in and out relatively modestly. Here it sets down on the way to one of its regular Miami residencies, with Franz Welser-Möst, its music director, conducting works by Beethoven (Symphony No. 4, ''Grosse Fuge''), Matthias Pintscher (''Chute d'Étoiles,'' in its New York premiere) and Scriabin (''Poem of Ecstasy''). Mr. Welser-Möst reserves his big New York statement this season for the Vienna Philhamonic's Carnegie weekend in March. Nov. 13. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
BERNARDA FINK For date night with a sophisticated singing fan, look no further: there are few artists more eloquent and elegant than this Argentine mezzo-soprano, who will sing some of Dvorak's ''Biblical Songs,'' which are included on her astonishingly lovely, spirited recent recording of that composer's songs and duets on Harmonia Mundi. The program, with Anthony Spiri as pianist, also includes Schumann's ''Lenau Lieder'' and songs by Mahler. Nov. 14. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
'LA CLEMENZA DI TITO' The conductor Harry Bicket, a Baroque specialist, has been responsible for some of the most scintillating and lively Met performances in recent seasons. After leading a run of this long-underrated Mozart opera in 2008, he returns to it now with an even better cast: Lucy Crowe, Barbara Frittoli, Elina Garanca, Kate Lindsey and Giuseppe Filianoti. Opens Nov. 16. Metropolitan Opera. (Z.W.)
ORCHESTRA RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE John Eliot Gardiner made a big impression with his crack period-instrument orchestra in four symphonies of Beethoven last season at Carnegie. All you need to know now is that his Monteverdi Choir is sure to be just as fine, and that's a good thing, since Mr. Gardiner is reaching for the sky with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony one night and his ''Missa Solemnis'' the next. Not to be missed. Nov. 16-17. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
JOYCE DIDONATO This assured and radiantly good-natured American mezzo-soprano will take on the title role of Donizetti's ''Maria Stuarda'' at the Met on New Year's Eve. But before that bel canto milestone she ventures earlier in a Baroque program called ''Drama Queens'' (also the title of her new recording), which includes tours de force by Handel, Monteverdi, Gluck, Hasse and others, with Alan Curtis leading Il Complesso Barocco. Nov. 18. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA In 2009 Esa-Pekka Salonen ended his transformative run as the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic to, he said, concentrate on composing. But thankfully for audiences, he has not abandoned conducting at all; he even took over the helm of this great ensemble, which arrives at Lincoln Center for two nights: first Mahler's Ninth Symphony and then, even more exciting, a concert performance of Berg's opera ''Wozzeck,'' with luxury casting: the baritone Simon Keenlyside and the soprano Angela Denoke. If anyone can find the sensuality and drama of Berg's pathbreaking score, it is Mr. Salonen. Nov. 18-19. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY To celebrate its 50th anniversary, this worthy ensemble does not diverge from its time-tested formula of offering Carnegie Hall exposure to gifted young performers, conductors and composers. For the anniversary -- also the hall debut of its new music director, Joshua Gersen -- the orchestra will play works by Shostakovich and Ludwig Wilhelm Maurer, Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony and a premiere by Gabriel Zucker. Nov. 25. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'THE PEONY PAVILION' The latest changes in the Met Museum's concert programming stem largely from a desire to tie it more closely to exhibitions, as with this staging of the 16th-century Chinese opera, presented in connection with the exhibition ''Chinese Gardens: Palace Pavilions, Scholars' Studios, Rustic Retreats.'' Conceived for presentation in a garden in Shanghai, the production will be staged in the small Astor Court and relayed live from there in high definition to the overflow audience in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. Tan Dun, the director, has shaved some 18 hours off the opera -- as presented in all its glory in the stunning production by Chen Shi-Zheng at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1999, and elsewhere in the years following -- bringing it down to a mere 70 minutes, while presumably retaining a goodly measure of that glory. Metropolitan Museum. Nov. 30. (J.R.O.)
DECEMBER
OLGA NEUWIRTH This Austrian composer may be part of Melissa Smey's campaign to bring more women into the fold of the Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series, as here. Ms. Neuwirth can do big and brash and bold with the best of them. Page 35. Dec. 6. Miller Theater. (J.R.O.)
SIMÓN BOLÍVAR ORCHESTRA OF VENEZUELA El Sistema, Venezuela's storied music education system, has many success stories but none quite as astonishing as that of the conductor Gustavo Dudamel, who rocketed through the program to stardom and the music directorship of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He has brought to prominence with him the youthful Bolívar ensemble, whose two-night stand is part of Carnegie Hall's Voices of Latin America festival. The repertory, including works by composers like Silvestre Revueltas, Esteban Benzecry and Heitor Villa-Lobos, is almost never done here, and it is sure to be galvanizing: few conductors draw visceral excitement out of an orchestra -- especially these young charges -- the way Mr. Dudamel does. Dec. 10-11. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'MESSIAH' There are so many excellent New York performances of this great Handel oratorio at Christmastime that it is impossible to predict which will be best over all, whatever that may mean. But John Scott's is sure to rank high among the contenders, and it is typically the most lovable, with the superbly trained St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys holding forth in festive red cassocks before the church's intricately sculptured altarpiece. (The ailing pipe organ is another story, with pleas for contributions sure to be stuffed into the program.) James Richman's Concert Royal, on period instruments, fills out a sound worthy of the magnificent space. Dec. 11, 13. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org. (In other notable performances of ''Messiah,'' Julian Wachner conducts the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at Trinity Church on Dec. 9 and at Alice Tully Hall on Dec. 12; Kent Tritle conducts the amateur Oratorio Society of New York at Carnegie Hall on Dec. 17 and the professional Musica Sacra, also at Carnegie, on Dec. 20 and 22; and Emmanuelle Haïm conducts the New York Choral Artists and the New York Philharmonic from Dec. 18 to Dec. 22.) (J.R.O.)
'LES TROYENS' James Levine, the Met's ailing music director, has long been a champion of Berlioz's sprawling, shining masterpiece, so his absence from the podium for this revival of Francesca Zambello's production is particularly painful. Fabio Luisi will replace him, leading a cast that includes the deeply sympathetic mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the spurned queen Dido, the tenor Marcello Giordani in the high-reaching role of Aeneas and Deborah Voigt, fresh from trying out the epic Brünnhilde in Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, as the desperate prophetess Cassandra. But one of the vocal pleasures may be in a minor role: the excellent bass Kwangchul Youn as Narbal. Opens Dec. 13. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'CHRISTMAS ORATORIO' Here, in Bach's six-pack of Christmas cantatas, is a welcome change of pace from Philippe Herreweghe and his Collegium Vocale Gent Choir and Orchestra, whom we are used to hearing in Bach's somber Passions (no bad thing, to be sure). It should be entertaining as well as uplifting to catch them in a jubilant mood. Dec. 15. Alice Tully Hall. (In another notable performance of Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio,'' as part of Trinity Wall Street's 12th Night Festival, Julian Wachner and the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra, who last season presented each of the six component cantatas on the appropriate day of the liturgical calendar, will this year divide them differently, with midday performances of Nos. 1 and 2 on Jan. 3, and Nos. 3 and 4 on Jan. 4, all at St. Paul's Chapel; and Nos. 5 and 6 on Jan. 5, at Trinity Church.) (J.R.O.)
'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' The Met, of late, has offered tightened versions of certain productions as family-friendly entertainments for the holiday season, and Bartlett Sher's antic version of Rossini's classic is an ideal choice. The company has not stinted on this year's cast, which features the charming up-and-coming stars Isabel Leonard, Alek Shrader, Rodion Pogossov and Jordan Bisch. The conductor Yves Abel's work at the house has always had stylish spirit. Opens Dec. 18. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
CONTACT! Last year's installment of the New York Philharmonic's series of new and recent music felt staler than in the past, but this concert is a return to form, with premieres of works by Andy Akiho and Jude Vaclavik as well as the first New York performances of ''Try,'' by the noted young composer Andrew Norman, and Jacob Druckman's ''Counterpoise.'' Jayce Ogren, well practiced in contemporary music, conducts, and the vocal soloist is the brilliant soprano Elizabeth Futral. Dec. 21. Metropolitan Museum. Dec. 22. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS Delightful pluck! On the day a Mayan text projects as the ''end date'' of the Mayan calendar (whatever that may mean for the world at large), Harold Rosenbaum, his excellent professional choir and the Orchestra of St. Luke's propose to pick up the pieces with a performance of Haydn's great oratorio ''The Creation.'' Haydn's resounding C major burst of light can undoubtedly be counted on to set the cosmos aright once again. Dec. 21. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'MARIA STUARDA' Another New Year's Eve, another starring role for the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato at the Met. Last year Ms. DiDonato led a sterling cast in the Baroque pastiche ''The Enchanted Island.'' Now she takes on the diva role of the embittered Mary Stuart in Donizetti's riveting melodrama, part of that composer's trilogy of operas based, however loosely, on the lives of Tudor queens. The Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, had originally intended for all three of the operas to be directed by David McVicar and to star the soprano Anna Netrebko; Mr. McVicar is still on for ''Maria Stuarda'' and the third, ''Roberto Devereux,'' next season, but Ms. Netrebko decided that ''Anna Bolena'' was it for her, clearing the way for Ms. DiDonato. She will be joined by a cast of rising stars: Elza van den Heever (as Mary's rival, Elizabeth), Francesco Meli, Joshua Hopkins and Matthew Rose. Maurizio Benini conducts. Opens Dec. 31. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
JANUARY
GREEN MOUNTAIN PROJECT The soprano Jolle Greenleaf and the violinist and conductor Scott Metcalfe have made Monteverdi a welcome fixture of the new year in New York. In 2010 and 2011, they presented the towering 1610 Vespers, and this year they produced a 1640 Vespers, something of a pastiche. Now it is back to 1610 and back to the church where it all began. A happy new year indeed. Jan. 2-3. Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (646) 470-5809, tenetnyc.com. (J.R.O.)
PROTOTYPE: OPERA/THEATER/NOW Though New York City Opera's Vox Festival will continue this year, albeit curtailed in size and scope, as a laboratory for new operas, this new festival aims to add to the city's range of performances of contemporary work. Organized by Here Arts Center in SoHo and Beth Morrison, an adventurous arts presenter, the two weeks will feature a commissioned premiere -- ''Sumeida's Song,'' by the rising young composer Mohammed Fairouz -- as well as David T. Little's ''Soldier Songs,'' directed by Yuval Sharon, and other readings, presentations, concerts and panels. Jan. 9-19. Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, (212) 352-3101, prototypefestival.org. (Z.W.)
BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA There are few better marriages of conductor and orchestra than Ivan Fischer and his alert, exciting ensemble. Frequent guests of Lincoln Center, they come this year with a varied program: Shostakovich's ''Suite for Variety Orchestra,'' Bernstein's ''Serenade'' (based on Plato's ''Symposium'' and featuring the violinist Janine Jansen) and Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2. Jan. 20. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
'DOUBT' Reeling from the recession, opera companies across America are playing it safe. But the Minnesota Opera -- which has, in Minneapolis and St. Paul, communities used to adventurous culture -- continues to program new work and thoughtful, theatrical productions of the classics. Next year brings this major commission composed by Douglas J. Cuomo, with a libretto by John Patrick Shanley, based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The cast features the huge-voiced soprano Christine Brewer, in one of her too-rare operatic turns, as well as Denyce Graves, Matthew Worth and Adriana Zabala. Christopher Franklin conducts, and Kevin Newbury directs. Opens Jan. 26. Minnesota Opera, Ordway, St. Paul, (612) 333-6669, mnopera.org. (Z.W.)
'RIGOLETTO' This one might cause a ruckus. For his Metropolitan Opera debut, the director Michael Mayer (Broadway's ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' and ''Spring Awakening'') places Verdi's great opera in Rat Pack-era Las Vegas, with a set by Christine Jones and the Duke cast as a sleazy Sinatra-type entertainer. Met audiences have tended to be doubtful about such updatings, but the previous production, from 1989, never inspired much affection, and if anyone can sell a difficult concept it is the excellent opening-night cast: the soprano Diana Damrau, the tenor Piotr Beczala and the baritone Zeljko Lucic. (Lisette Oropesa, Vittorio Grigolo and George Gagnidze take over later in the run.) Opens Jan. 28. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
MARC-ANDRÉ HAMELIN Everything this pianist plays, he plays well. And it's a good thing, since he plays almost everything. He began his career exploring the virtuosic fringes of the repertory and has gradually moved toward the center. His program here ranges from Bach to Mr. Hamelin's own Variations on a Theme by Paganini (in its New York premiere) and also includes works by Debussy, Rachmaninoff and Busoni. Jan. 30. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
WEST-EASTERN DIVAN ORCHESTRA Daniel Barenboim performing Beethoven at Carnegie is nothing new. But this time he brings his orchestra of young Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs to play all the symphonies. There is little in the sound of their recently released recordings of the works that would make you sense either youth or diversity. Seeing them in action should be a different matter, Jan. 30-31, Feb 2-3, Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
OPERA LAFAYETTE Sometimes this intrepid company's wanderings through the thickets of the French operatic repertory can yield great pleasures, and sometimes they remind you that there are reasons obscurities are obscure. Ah, but life's a crap shoot like that. Will ''Lalla Roukh,'' an Orientalist fantasia by Félicien David that wowed the Opéra Comique in 1862, hold up today as any more than a curiosity? We shall see. In any case, Ryan Brown's conducting is always spirited, and the production, by Bernard Deletré, incorporates the acclaimed Indian-dance troupe Kalanidhi Dance. Jan. 31. Rose Theater. (Z.W.)
FEBRUARY
OSVALDO GOLIJOV Mr. Golijov is Carnegie Hall's composer in residence this season, and a concert in its Making Music series, which offers commentary from composers as well as their music, could offer fascinating insights if the right questions are asked and answered. It is a chance to explore the methodology of a composer whose acquisitive methods have recently been called into question, to the point that some have accused him of plagiarism. The program, performed by the St. Lawrence String Quartet, the Zankel Band and others, includes the New York premiere of Mr. Golijov's ''Qohelet'' (more widely known under the spelling ''Koholet''), a Carnegie co-commission and one of the works that was challenged. Mr. Golijov altered it as a result. So what is the whole story? Feb. 4. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S It was a significant coup for this ensemble, excellent though it is, to secure the fast-rising Pablo Heras-Casado as its new principal conductor. He leads the orchestra for the first time at Carnegie Hall since his appointment in a program of the central repertory: Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture, Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 (with Christian Zacharias as soloist), Hans Zender's orchestrations of five Debussy preludes and the lighter, leaner 1841 version of Schumann's Fourth Symphony. All these are distant from the Baroque and new music in which Mr. Heras-Casado has long specialized. The orchestra has bet that his charisma and energy will outweigh his relative inexperience; it may be good for both him and the band that he will get to work with these fine players to refine his interpretations of the standards. Feb. 7. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA Mariss Jansons -- the principal conductor of both this ensemble and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and thus a regular commuter between Amsterdam and Munich -- turns 70 in January and seems to have emerged from several health crises of recent decades in fine fettle. Oh, he may still suffer from jet lag, but he certainly doesn't seem fazed. He takes the Bavarians to Tokyo to perform all the Beethoven symphonies in late November. Here he presents good variety in programs well gauged to show off this great orchestra's and Mr. Jansons's own versatility: in one, Bartok's Second Violin Concerto, with Leonidas Kavakos as soloist, and Mahler's First Symphony; in the other, Strauss's ''Death and Transfiguration'' (Mr. Jansons may feel that he has lived it) and Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. Feb. 13-14. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'PARSIFAL' Appearing a bit earlier than its traditional place around the Easter season, Wagner's final and perhaps deepest music drama arrives in New York in a new production by François Girard after a practice run at the Lyon Opera, where its scenic requirements -- a stage-filling sea of blood, for one thing -- strained the company's technical capabilities to the breaking point. Presumably those challenges will be a walk in the park for a Met recently tested by the mechanical headaches of Robert Lepage's Wagner ''Ring'' cycle. And blood aside, the house is fielding a remarkably strong cast: Jonas Kaufmann, seemingly born for the title role, as well as Katarina Dalayman, Peter Mattei, René Pape and Evgeny Nikitin, making his first New York appearance since his withdrawal from the Bayreuth Festival after the bizarre discovery that one of his tattoos resembled, at one point, a swastika. Daniele Gatti's deliberate, expansive take on the opera has polarized audiences in the past, but a little more time spent with singers of this quality wouldn't be too bad a fate. Opens Feb. 15. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'POWDER HER FACE' It's a sign of the composer Thomas Adès's rise to the top of his field that both his operas are being performed in New York this season. The Met's production of his sweeping version of ''The Tempest,'' opening in October, will doubtless grab more attention, but the chamber work ''Powder Her Face,'' about a 1960s sex scandal involving the Duchess of Argyll, has raunchily intimate charm. It's an opera that in content and scale wouldn't make much sense at the Met, so it's an ideal opening act for a New York City Opera, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two of its four productions, that is trying to define itself artistically after a listless last season. Jay Scheib directs; Jonathan Stockhammer, a specialist in contemporary opera, conducts. Opens Feb. 15. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. (Z.W.)
'DON CARLO' When Lorin Maazel returned to the Met podium for a run of Wagner's ''Walküre'' in 2008 it was the first time he had conducted at the company since the early 1960s. It's a far smaller gap this time, as he leads Verdi's dark masterpiece and an experienced cast that includes Barbara Frittoli, Anna Smirnova, Ramón Vargas, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Eric Halfvarson and Ferruccio Furlanetto, who scored a personal coup as Philip II when Nicholas Hytner's production was new in 2010. Opens Feb. 22. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'RADAMISTO' Harry Bicket has that rarest and best of gifts for an early-music specialist: the ability to make regular opera orchestras play with the snap of a period-instrument band. But there is still something special that happens when he leads his own English Concert, which will be joined for one of Handel's lesser-known masterworks by a fine cast that includes the veteran countertenor David Daniels, Brenda Rae, Patricia Bardon, Joélle Harvey and Luca Pisaroni. It is the first in a series of concert performances of Baroque operas at the hall by Mr. Bicket and the ensemble in coming seasons, so there's much to look forward to. Feb. 24. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'THE TURN OF THE SCREW' The New York City Opera finally has the right idea. This beleaguered company has learned that it's a losing battle to go head to head with the Met in terms of repertory and production style, and smarter to compete with the city's smaller, more nimble companies. To that end, it is opening its season with two intimate-scale operas that would have been naturals from, say, Gotham Chamber Opera: Thomas Adès's ''Powder Her Face'' and this intensely creepy work by Britten, both performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The conductor is the versatile Jayce Ogren; the director is Sam Buntrock, whose Broadway production of ''Sunday in the Park With George'' used lighting and projections with fluid ease. The cast had not been announced at press time. Opens Feb. 24. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. (Z.W.)
MARCH
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Happiness is conducting two of the world's greatest orchestras at Carnegie Hall in one season. Franz Welser-Möst, having dropped in with his own Cleveland Orchestra in November, now leads an orchestra that -- though proudly independent -- is his in another sense, he being Austrian. The three programs include symphonies by Dvorak (No. 7), Schubert (No. 6) and Bruckner (No. 4); songs by Richard Strauss, sung by the tenor Herbert Lippert; Berg's Violin Concerto, played by Frank Peter Zimmermann; and a work by the contemporary German Jörg Widmann. March 1-3. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
JENNIFER KOH You may see Ms. Koh early in the season, since she is enacting the frizzy-haired, fiddle-playing title character of Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's ''Einstein on the Beach'' in some performances (Sept. 14-16) of the Brooklyn Academy production. Here, in the second installment of her three-part multiyear series Bach and Beyond, she occupies the stage alone and presumably without fright wig, playing solo violin works by Bartok and Phil Kline, in addition to Bach. (A recording of the first part is to be released in October by Cedille Records.) March 2. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
'FRANCESCA DA RIMINI' The Met reserves runs of Riccardo Zandonai's infectiously dramatic verismo rarity for divas it really believes in. It was last mounted in the 1980s for Renata Scotto, and this new revival is a major endorsement of the soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek, a favorite in London whose New York career is just getting started. (She also joins the Met Orchestra for Wagner's ''Wesendonck Lieder'' at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 14.) Her co-star, the tenor Marcello Giordani, is ardent but inconsistent, two adjectives that also apply to the conductor, Marco Armiliato. But when Ms. Westbroek is in her groove, she is as thrilling as large stretches of Zandonai's score. Opens March 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
THE BACH VARIATIONS The early-music specialist Masaaki Suzuki and his Bach Collegium Japan and Yale Schola Cantorum join the New York Philharmonic in opening its monthlong festival. The program is built on a lovely idea, juxtaposing works by Bach with near counterparts by his great revivalist, Mendelssohn. (From each comes a Magnificat in D.) March 6-9. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'LA PASIÓN SEGÚN SAN MARCOS' As a sort of belated appendage to its festival Voices From Latin America, Carnegie Hall devotes its choral institute this season to Osvaldo Golijov's magnum opus. In the culminating performance, Robert Spano conducts the Orquesta la Pasión, members of the Schola Cantorum de Venezuela and choruses from area high schools. March 10. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Lincoln Center's Great Performers series, having presented the London Symphony and the Philharmonia Orchestra in the fall, completes its minifestival of major London orchestras. Vladimir Jurowski, the orchestra's principal conductor, presents two programs: first Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1, with Vadim Repin as soloist, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 5; then Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4, with Hélène Grimaud as soloist, and Mahler's Symphony No. 5. March 10-11. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
MASS IN B MINOR Happily, major American orchestras have been rediscovering Bach and the Baroque, having largely conceded that repertory to early-music specialists for several decades. The New York Philharmonic had a leg up with Kurt Masur as its music director through the 1990s. Coming from a long tenure in Leipzig, Germany, where Bach spent his last 27 years, Mr. Masur brought Bach's major choral works to the orchestra with some regularity and in 1998 even imported the choir of St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, which Bach had directed, for a ''St. Matthew Passion.'' It is good to see Alan Gilbert pick up the mantle here as part of a major Philharmonic series, the Bach Variations, with the New York Choral Artists and stellar vocal soloists: Dorothea Röschmann, Anne Sofie von Otter, Steve Davislim and Eric Owens. March 13-16. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' This season Renée Fleming has a coveted Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, for which she has programmed two recitals, including a battle of the divas alongside the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, and a concert with the New York Philharmonic. But the centerpiece is a semistaged concert performance of this gauzily lyrical André Previn opera, with Blanche DuBois created as a vehicle for Ms. Fleming, first performed in 1998. The work hasn't been heard much since, though it is being revived on March 26 at Lyric Opera of Chicago, where Ms. Fleming is the creative consultant. The Carnegie performance, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's under Patrick Summers, is a test run of sorts for that Chicago stand, featuring the same excellent supporting cast: Susanna Phillips, Teddy Tahu Rhodes and Anthony Dean Griffey. March 14. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY After this gloriously adventurous ensemble's American Mavericks festival last year at Carnegie Hall, which featured work from some of the out-there corners of the repertory, it will be a fascinating shift to hear it in the standards, in which the orchestra and its music director, Michael Tilson Thomas, also shine. The first night's program pairs Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 (with the brilliant Yuja Wang as soloist) and Brahms's First Symphony with the New York premiere of a work by Samuel Carl Adams, and the second concert features the Ninth Symphony of Mahler, a Thomas favorite. March 20-21. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
CARTER BREY New York Philharmonic audiences have been blessed, hearing Mr. Brey regularly since he became the orchestra's principal cellist in 1996. But the pleasure has been mixed, because he had to cut back sharply on his solo career to do it. In a substantial bit of payback, the Philharmonic puts Mr. Brey forward to perform Bach's six unaccompanied cello suites as part of its Bach Variations festival. Expect him to shine. March 27. Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, 65th Street and Central Park West, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org. (J.R.O.)
LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC At its premiere in Los Angeles in May, John Adams's oratorio ''The Gospel According to the Other Mary'' badly lagged dramatically, but many moments of its protean, searching score showed a mature composer at the height of his powers. The Philharmonic and its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, bring the work to New York with the same excellent soloists -- Tamara Mumford, Kelley O'Connor and Russell Thomas -- and a new element: a staging by the theater artist Peter Sellars, who collaborated with Mr. Adams on the libretto. The next evening's concert features Claude Vivier's ''Zipangu,'' for strings, ''La Mer'' by Debussy and Stravinsky's ''Firebird,'' the kind of vividly dramatic work at which Mr. Dudamel excels. March 27-28. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' Ivan Fischer's conducting appearances in New York invariably yield fine performances, but in recent years they have also become genuine events. In 2010 Mr. Fischer presented all the Beethoven symphonies, half on period instruments, half on modern; in 2011 he offered Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' in his own staging; and in April he led Mozart's Requiem with choristers intermingled among the orchestra to give the players a better feel for the text. Bach's great Passion is to be sure an event in itself, and no unusual twists have been announced -- yet. Mr. Fischer conducts Musica Sacra and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, with soloists including Dominique Labelle, John Tessier and Hanno Müller-Brachmann. March 28. Carnegie Hall. (In other notable performances of the ''St. Matthew Passion,'' John Scott conducts the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and Concert Royal at St. Thomas Church on March 21, and Julian Wachner conducts the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at Trinity Church on March 24.) (J.R.O.)
APRILIt is
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In all the rampant speculation about who might succeed James Levine as the orchestra's music director, the name Daniele Gatti seems to have receded. Mr. Gatti is a gifted and experienced maestro in midcareer and seems not to be overcommitted by the standards of conductors today, despite major posts at the Orchestre National de France and the Zurich Opera. In this series, after a mixed program conducted by Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, a veteran who has given the orchestra yeoman service during its transition, the second and third programs are conducted by Mr. Gatti. Though there is no reason to expect anything but excellent performances, it will be hard not to wonder what Mr. Levine might have done with Mahler's Third Symphony, one of his great specialties, this time around in the second program, or what he might have made of the third, all Wagner. Certainly, on each of these terrains, Mr. Gatti will be held to the highest standard, by orchestra and public alike. April 3-5. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'GIULIO CESARE' It's tough being the final new Met production of the year. With everyone exhausted and attention flagging, you tend, like Rodney Dangerfield, to get no respect. It doesn't help that David McVicar's version of this Handel masterpiece, which puts a colorful colonial-era, Neo-Classical spin on the ancient Egyptian setting, has already been captured on DVD. But the Met's cast -- David Daniels in the title role, Natalie Dessay as Cleopatra and the excellent Alice Coote as Sesto -- is of interest, and the conductor, Harry Bicket, is a pro at this repertory. The Met orchestra plays its heart out for him. Opens April 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'GESUALDO REFLECTIONS' The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is best known for the classics; its concerts are the place to go when you want a Beethoven quartet played with dependable polish. But the society also has a relatively unheralded, consistently creative and excellent new-music series in Lincoln Center's intimate Kaplan Penthouse. The highlight, though it doesn't take place at the penthouse, is a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the birth of the brilliant and murderous composer Carlo Gesualdo featuring the Antioch Chamber Ensemble, the pianist Soyeon Kate Lee and the Brentano String Quartet. In keeping with Gesualdo's experimental music, centuries ahead of its time, the program juxtaposes his work with 21st-century responses -- by Bruce Adolphe, Brett Dean, David Gompper and Wolfgang Rihm -- for various chamber forces. April 4. Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org. (Z.W.)
'DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN' There will be a degree of deja vu as the Met brings back Robert Lepage's version of Wagner's epic masterpiece for the first time as a piece of the repertory, after the rollout of the full cycle last season. For the three cycles Deborah Voigt and Katarina Dalayman still alternate as Brünnhilde; Jay Hunter Morris's bright-voiced Siegfried still gets his turn, as does Hans-Peter König's memorably rich Hagen; and the enormous planks of Mr. Lepage's machine still rotate impassively. The question will be whether and how the spectacle suffers without the intensity provided by some of last season's stars: Bryn Terfel, Jonas Kaufmann, Eva-Maria Westbroek and Waltraud Meier. Fabio Luisi conducts. Cycles open on April 6 and 25 and May 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'MOSÈ IN EGITTO' Rossini's serious operas still don't receive the productions they deserve; they are long and not easy to cast. But they have irresistible grandeur. Now the New York City Opera offers a super-rare staging of the Italian original at City Center, the company's original home. The production is directed by Michael Counts, the visually eclectic creator of City Opera's ''Monodramas'' evening; we'll see how he handles the climactic parting of the Red Sea. (Projections, credited to Ada Whitney/Beehive, will presumably play a role.) Jayce Ogren, City Opera's man for all seasons, conducts. Opens April 14. New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
DRESDEN STAATSKAPELLE It will be fascinating to catch up with this orchestra and itsprincipal conductor, Christian Thielemann, in view of the jockeying for power going on at European festivals. After Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic announced that they would leave the Salzburg Easter Festival next spring in favor of an event in Baden-Baden, Germany, Mr. Thielemann and the Staatskapelle were quick to move in. The Berlin Philharmonic sounded in splendid shape at Carnegie in February, and this season, just weeks after that Salzburg appearance, it is the Staatskapelle's turn in programs of Brahms (''Academic Festival Overture''; Violin Concerto, with Lisa Batiashvili as soloist; Symphony No. 4) and Bruckner (Symphony No. 8). April 17, 19. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'TRISTAN UND ISOLDE' The acclaimed Swedish dramatic soprano Nina Stemme, who set Carnegie Hall ablaze as Strauss's Salome with Franz Welser-Möst and the Cleveland Orchestra in May, has said that her way in life is ''to hurry slowly.'' She has held back in establishing a career in the United States, and she will take up Wagner's Isolde at the Met only in the 2016-17 season. American Wagnerites will undoubtedly flock to Houston to hear her do it sooner. Ben Heppner is scheduled to sing Tristan, but you may recall that he gave the Met fits in the role in 2008, claiming illness and showing up for only the last of six planned performances. Christof Loy directs, and Patrick Summers conducts. If it all comes together, it should be worth the trip. Opens April 18. Houston Grand Opera, Wortham Center, (713) 228-6737, houstongrandopera.org. (J.R.O.)
'LA PÉRICHOLE' Christopher Alden's dreamlike production of Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte'' was the bright spot in the New York City Opera's uninspired last season, the latest in a series of memorable shows the director has made for the company in recent years. He now turns his attention to a seemingly unlikely work: this farcical operetta by Offenbach about a Peruvian street singer who triangulates between her true love and a Spanish official. (Another frothy opera, Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus,'' is also on Mr. Alden's agenda this year, with a production opening in October at the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto.) Mr. Alden has a gift for bringing out the darkness and sophistication in the unlikeliest of places and pieces. Opens April 21. New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
'WAR REQUIEM' Of the many commemorations of Benjamin Britten's centennial here in 2013, this performance of a consummate masterpiece, a pacifist statement mingling the text of the Requiem Mass with poetry of Wilfred Owen, will undoubtedly be one of the more imposing, with Kent Tritle conducting the 200-voice Oratorio Society of New York, itself celebrating its 140th anniversary. The vocal soloists are the excellent Emalie Savoy, soprano; John Matthew Myers, tenor; and Jesse Blumberg, baritone. April 22. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
SWEDISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA New York admirers of the Swedish soprano Nina Stemme who cannot catch that ''Tristan und Isolde'' in Houston must content themselves with this catchall concert, in which she will perform songs of Berlioz, Brahms, Wagner, Grieg, Sibelius, Strauss and Weill. In addition, Thomas Dausgaard conducts the fine ensemble in works or parts of works by Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Elgar, Sibelius and Ravel. April 25. Alice Tully Hall. (J.R.O.)
STRAVINSKY SACRED WORKS Julian Wachner continues his emphasis on more or less contemporary fare this season with the Trinity Choir and Novus NY devoting a weekend to the complete sacred works by a restless master. Stravinsky essentially announced modernism in music with his ''Rite of Spring'' in 1913, then looked back over his shoulder with a Neo-Classicism largely of his own invention and finally found his way to the spare, serialist aesthetic that dominates in many of the works here. Rightly, the majestic ''Symphony of Psalms'' crowns the affair. April 26-27 at Trinity Church. April 28 at St. Paul's Chapel. (J.R.O.)
YALE IN NEW YORK This four-concert series concludes with a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Paul Hindemith, ''Prankster and Master'': a Yale professor for the 13 years before his death and an astonishingly prolific composer and champion of useful music (Gebrauchsmusik) most of whose works have largely fallen into disuse. The current faculty members Boris Berman, pianist, and Ettore Causa, violist, and members of the Yale Philharmonia perform works of Hindemith including the sure-to-be-immortal ''Overture to 'The Flying Dutchman' as Played at Sight by a Second-Rate Concert Orchestra at the Village Well at 7 O'Clock in the Morning,'' for string quartet. April 28. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
MAY
'DIALOGUES DES CARMÉLITES' Some critics, including Anthony Tommasini in The New York Times, have called for the Met to appoint a director of productions, who would work with the general manager, Peter Gelb, and the music director, whoever that may be, to plot the company's theatrical direction. (S0 far Mr. Gelb has resisted the idea.) The last time something like that happened was when John Dexter filled the position in the late 1970s and early '80s. Audiences are periodically reminded of that brief golden age for theater at the Met when Dexter's productions are revived; though more than 30 years old, their elegance and intelligence shine through, as in his spectacular yet subtle take on Britten's ''Billy Budd,'' performed last season. One of Dexter's finest shows was his ''Dialogues des Carmélites,'' as unadorned and inspired as Poulenc's score. This revival has a fine cast, including Isabel Leonard, Patricia Racette, Erin Morley, Elizabeth Bishop and Paul Appleby, conducted by Louis Langrée. Opens May 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK The fascinating program ''London's Musical Bridge: The Enlightened English'' pairs works by 18th-century native English composers with counterparts by Germans who had settled in London: thus, suites by John Avison and Handel, overtures by William Boyce and Johann Christian Bach, and sinfonias by Thomas Arne and Frederick William Herschel. Herschel, in his day job as astronomer, discovered the planet Uranus: enlightened indeed. May 4. First Church of Christ, Scientist, Central Park West at 68th Street, (212) 280-0330. earlymusicny.org. (J.R.O.)
SPRING FOR MUSIC This annual festival of North American orchestras, conceived by top music professionals to encourage and reward adventurous programming, has in its first two seasons effectively filled what it has shown to be a valuable niche: giving Carnegie Hall-exposure to ensembles showing initiative, several of which might otherwise never have found their way there. Carlos Kalmar and the Oregon Symphony -- who made the biggest splash in 2011 with a program they have since recorded for the Pentatone label, ''Music for a Time of War'' -- present a wide-ranging collection of works by Schubert, Ravel, Schoenberg, Kurt Weill and the Thai composer Narong Prangcharoen (May 9). Also returning to the festival, which mandates a year off between appearances, are David Alan Miller and the Albany Symphony Orchestra, who presented a program centered on spirituals in 2011 and now play another American program, with works by Gershwin, Morton Gould and John Harbison (May 7). In addition, Marin Alsop conducts the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra; JoAnn Falletta, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; Leonard Slatkin, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra; and Christoph Eschenbach, the National Symphony Orchestra. May 6-11. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
DETROIT SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA To single out the oddest of the Spring for Music programs: Leonard Slatkin conducts Ives's Symphonies Nos. 1 through 4, a notion utterly logical on its surface yet, given the ear-twisting complexities in much of the music, utterly bizarre. Not even counting however many intermissions and stage changes, the program runs well over two hours. But will Mr. Slatkin be able to resist adding an encore: say, Ives's attempt at a monster sequel, the ''Universe Symphony,'' which the Nashville Symphony performed in the completion by Larry Austin at Spring for Music this year? May 10. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
TOKYO STRING QUARTET Though the personnel has shifted in recent years, it was still quite a brand, established over 43 years of excellent performance (and kudos to Kazuhide Isomura, the violist, who saw it all). Now the quartet has decided to quit while still near the top. It has picked excellent collaborative works to go out with, both in this concert (Schubert's resolutely sunny String Quintet, with the cellist Lynn Harrell) and in its penultimate recording (Brahms's late, mellow Clarinet Quintet, with the clarinetist Jon Manasse), to be released by Harmonia Mundi in November. But the quartet takes final leave on its own, both here on stage, with works by Haydn and Bartok (the Sixth Quartet, his last), and on disc, with works of Dvorak and Smetana, scheduled for release in 2013. May 11. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' Looking around and noting the decided paucity of quality opera in its city, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, never an ensemble to rest on its laurels, is improbably turning itself into a de facto opera company. It is focusing on new and recent works but also unveiling a series of staged performances of Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte's three classic operas, conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and featuring sets and costumes by noted architects and fashion designers. Last year ''Don Giovanni'' was promising, but the logistics, with the orchestra far above and behind the singers, were a work in progress. For this year's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' the setup will be adjusted for a production designed by Jean Nouvel and Azzedine Alaïa and starring Christopher Maltmann and Dorothea Röschmann. May 17, 19, 23, 25. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com. (Z.W.)
'GILBERT'S PLAYLIST' If four programs in May and June are being put forward as Alan Gilbert's playlist, you have to wonder what that implies about the rest of his season with the New York Philharmonic. Rote? Required? But questions about the marketing strategy don't detract from the quality and creativity of the work he is offering under that unfortunate title. First come jazz-inflected works by Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Copland and Wynton Marsalis, played alongside the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, then Dallapiccola's stark one-act opera ''Il Prigioniero'' (featuring Gerald Finley and Patricia Racette), sharing a bill with Lisa Batiashvili in Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1. Mr. Gilbert offers his new arrangement of Wagner, ''A Ring Journey,'' with Christopher Rouse's ''Seeing,'' featuring the pianist Emanuel Ax. Finally, to close the season, Doug Fitch, who has collaborated with Mr. Gilbert and the orchestra in recent seasons, directs and designs an evening of Stravinsky ballets (''The Fairy's Kiss'' and ''Petrouchka'') with Karole Armitage creating choreography for the New York City Ballet dancer Sara Mearns. May 31-June 29. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
JUNE
STOKOWSKI CELEBRATION Now the gloves are off. Mr. Nézet-Séguin, for all practical purposes, embodies Stokowski, as the Philadelphia Orchestra returns to its treasured but acoustically flawed old home, the Academy of Music. In three days of intensive programming, he conducts Brahms's First Symphony and Dvorak's Ninth, Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade'' and works by Ippolitov-Ivanov and Wagner, an audience-choice program and repertory from the animated Disney film ''Fantasia.'' But in the film, Stokowski got to shake hands with Mickey Mouse. How do you replicate that, Mr. Nézet-Séguin? June 21-23. Academy of Music, Philadelphia, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org. (J.R.O.)

HEADLINE: The Weatherman Is Not a Moron

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
From the inside, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction looked like a cross between a submarine command center and a Goldman Sachs trading floor. Twenty minutes outside Washington, it consisted mainly of sleek workstations manned by meteorologists working an armada of flat-screen monitors with maps of every conceivable type of weather data for every corner of the country. The center is part of the National Weather Service, which Ulysses S. Grant created under the War Department. Even now, it remains true to those roots. Many of its meteorologists have a background in the armed services, and virtually all speak with the precision of former officers. 
They also seem to possess a high-frequency-trader's skill for managing risk. Expert meteorologists are forced to arbitrage a torrent of information to make their predictions as accurate as possible. After receiving weather forecasts generated by supercomputers, they interpret and parse them by, among other things, comparing them with various conflicting models or what their colleagues are seeing in the field or what they already know about certain weather patterns -- or, often, all of the above. From station to station, I watched as meteorologists sifted through numbers and called other forecasters to compare notes, while trading instant messages about matters like whether the chance of rain in Tucson should be 10 or 20 percent. As the information continued to flow in, I watched them draw on their maps with light pens, painstakingly adjusting the contours of temperature gradients produced by the computers -- 15 miles westward over the Mississippi Delta or 30 miles northward into Lake Erie -- in order to bring them one step closer to accuracy.
These meteorologists are dealing with a small fraction of the 2.5 quintillion bytes of information that, I.B.M. estimates, we generate each day. That's the equivalent of the entire printed collection of the Library of Congress about three times per second. Google now accesses more than 20 billion Web pages a day; the processing speed of an iPad rivals that of last generation's most powerful supercomputers. All that information ought to help us plan our lives and profitably predict the world's course. In 2008, Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired magazine, wrote optimistically of the era of Big Data. So voluminous were our databases and so powerful were our computers, he claimed, that there was no longer much need for theory, or even the scientific method. At the time, it was hard to disagree.
But if prediction is the truest way to put our information to the test, we have not scored well. In November 2007, economists in the Survey of Professional Forecasters -- examining some 45,000 economic-data series -- foresaw less than a 1-in-500 chance of an economic meltdown as severe as the one that would begin one month later. Attempts to predict earthquakes have continued to envisage disasters that never happened and failed to prepare us for those, like the 2011 disaster in Japan, that did.
The one area in which our predictions are making extraordinary progress, however, is perhaps the most unlikely field. Jim Hoke, a director with 32 years experience at the National Weather Service, has heard all the jokes about weather forecasting, like Larry David's jab on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' that weathermen merely forecast rain to keep everyone else off the golf course. And to be sure, these slick-haired and/or short-skirted local weather forecasters are sometimes wrong. A study of TV meteorologists in Kansas City found that when they said there was a 100 percent chance of rain, it failed to rain at all one-third of the time.
But watching the local news is not the best way to assess the growing accuracy of forecasting (more on this later). It's better to take the long view. In 1972, the service's high-temperature forecast missed by an average of six degrees when made three days in advance. Now it's down to three degrees. More stunning, in 1940, the chance of an American being killed by lightning was about 1 in 400,000. Today it's 1 in 11 million. This is partly because of changes in living patterns (more of our work is done indoors), but it's also because better weather forecasts have helped us prepare.
Perhaps the most impressive gains have been in hurricane forecasting. Just 25 years ago, when the National Hurricane Center tried to predict where a hurricane would hit three days in advance of landfall, it missed by an average of 350 miles. If Hurricane Isaac, which made its unpredictable path through the Gulf of Mexico last month, had occurred in the late 1980s, the center might have projected landfall anywhere from Houston to Tallahassee, canceling untold thousands of business deals, flights and picnics in between -- and damaging its reputation when the hurricane zeroed in hundreds of miles away. Now the average miss is only about 100 miles.
Why are weather forecasters succeeding when other predictors fail? It's because long ago they came to accept the imperfections in their knowledge. That helped them understand that even the most sophisticated computers, combing through seemingly limitless data, are painfully ill equipped to predict something as dynamic as weather all by themselves. So as fields like economics began relying more on Big Data, meteorologists recognized that data on its own isn't enough.
The I.B.M. Bluefire supercomputer in the basement of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., is so large that it essentially creates its own weather. The 77 trillion calculations that Bluefire makes each second, in its mass of blinking lights and coaxial cable, generate so much radiant energy that it requires a liquid cooling system. The room where Bluefire resides is as drafty as a minor-league hockey rink, and it's loud enough that hearing protection is suggested.
The 11 cabinets that hold the supercomputer are long and narrow and look like space-age port-a-potties. When I mentioned this to Rich Loft, the director of technology development for NCAR, he was not amused. To him, this computer represents the front line in an age-old struggle to predict our environment. ''You go back to Chaco Canyon or Stonehenge,'' Loft said, ''and people realized they could predict the shortest day of the year and the longest day -- that the moon moved in predictable ways. But there are things an ancient man couldn't predict: ambush from some kind of animal, a flash flood or a thunderstorm.''
For centuries, meteorologists relied on statistical tables based on historical averages -- it rains about 45 percent of the time in London in March, for instance -- to predict the weather. But these statistics are useless on a day-to-day level. Jan. 12, 1888, was a relatively warm day on the Great Plains until the temperature dropped almost 30 degrees in a matter of hours and a blinding snowstorm hit. More than a hundred children died of hypothermia on their way home from school that day. Knowing the average temperature for a January day in Topeka wouldn't have helped much in a case like that.
The holy grail of meteorology, scientists realized, was dynamic weather prediction -- programs that simulate the physical systems that produce clouds and cold fronts, windy days in Chicago and the morning fog over San Francisco as they occur. Theoretically, the laws that govern the physics of the weather are fairly simple. In 1814, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace postulated that the movement of every particle in the universe should be predictable as long as meteorologists could know the position of all those particles and how fast they are moving. Unfortunately, the number of molecules in the earth's atmosphere is perhaps on the order of 100 tredecillion, which is a 1 followed by 44 zeros. To make perfect weather predictions, we would not only have to account for all of those molecules, but we would also need to solve equations for all 100 tredecillion of them at once.
The most intuitive way to simplify the problem was to break the atmosphere down into a finite series of boxes, or what meteorologists variously refer to as a matrix, a lattice or a grid. The earliest credible attempt at this, according to Loft, was made in 1916 by an English physicist named Lewis Fry Richardson, who wanted to determine the weather over northern Germany on May 20, 1910. This was not technically a prediction, because the date was some six years in the past, but Richardson treated it that way, and he had a lot of data: a series of observations of temperature, barometric pressures and wind speeds that had been gathered by the German government. And as a pacifist serving a volunteer ambulance unit in northern France, he also had a lot of time on his hands. So Richardson broke Germany down into a series of two-dimensional boxes, each measuring three degrees of latitude by three degrees of longitude. Then he went to work trying to solve the equations that governed the weather in each square and how they might affect weather in the adjacent ones.
Richardson's experiment failed miserably. It ''predicted'' a dramatic rise in barometric pressure that hadn't occurred and produced strange-looking weather patterns that didn't resemble any seen in Germany before or since. Had he made a computational error? Were his equations buggy? It was hard to say. Even the most devoted weather nerds weren't eager to solve differential equations for months on end to double-check his work for one day in one country six years in the past.
What Richardson needed, he thought, was more manpower. He envisioned a weather-forecasting center with some 64,000 meteorologists, all working simultaneously to have the computational speed to make accurate weather forecasts in real time. His dream came to fruition (sort of) in 1950, when the first computer weather forecast was tried by the mathematician John von Neumann and a team of scientists at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. They used a machine that could make about 5,000 calculations a second, which was quite possibly as fast as 64,000 men. Alas, 5,000 calculations a second was no match for the weather. As it turned out, their forecast wasn't much better than a random guess.
Our views about predictability are inherently flawed. Take something that is often seen as the epitome of randomness, like a coin toss. While it may at first appear that there's no way to tell whether a coin is going to come up heads or tails, a group of mathematicians at Stanford is able to predict the outcome virtually 100 percent of the time, provided that they use a special machine to flip it. The machine does not cheat -- it flips the coin the exact same way (the same height, with the same strength and torque) over and over again -- and the coin is fair. Under those conditions, there is no randomness at all.
The reason that we view coin flips as unpredictable is because when we toss them, we're never able to reproduce the exact same motion. A similar phenomenon applies to the weather. In the late 1950s, the renowned M.I.T. mathematician Edward Lorenz was toiling away in his original profession as a meteorologist. Then, in the tradition of Alexander Fleming and penicillin or the New York Knicks and Jeremy Lin, he made a major discovery purely by accident. At the time, Lorenz and his team were trying to advance the use of computer models in weather prediction. They were getting somewhere, or so they thought, until the computer started spitting out contradictory results. Lorenz and his colleagues began with what they believed were exactly the same data and ran what they thought was exactly the same code; still, the program somehow forecast clear skies over Colorado in one run and a thunderstorm in the next.
After spending weeks double-checking their hardware and trying to debug their code, Lorenz and his team discovered that their data weren't exactly the same. The numbers had been rounded off in the third decimal place. Instead of having the barometric pressure in one corner of their grid read 29.5168, for example, it might instead read 29.517. This couldn't make that much of a difference, could it? Actually, Lorenz realized, it could, and he devoted the rest of his career to studying strange behaviors like these by developing a branch of mathematics called chaos theory, the most basic tenet of which is described in the title of his breakthrough 1972 paper, ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?'' In other words, a small change in initial conditions can produce a large and unexpected divergence in outcomes.
Chaos theory does not imply that the behavior of the system is literally random. It just means that certain types of systems are very hard to predict. If you know the exact conditions of a coin as it leaves someone's hand, you can -- with the right laboratory equipment -- predict, almost perfectly, which side it will land on. And yet the slightest disturbance to that motion can change a coin toss from being almost wholly predictable to almost wholly unpredictable.
The problem with weather is that our knowledge of its initial conditions is highly imperfect, both in theory and practice. A meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told me that it wasn't unheard-of for a careless forecaster to send in a 50-degree reading as 500 degrees. The more fundamental issue, though, is that we can observe our surroundings with only a certain degree of precision. No thermometer is perfect, and it isn't physically possible to stick one into every molecule in the atmosphere.
Weather also has two additional properties that make forecasting even more difficult. First, weather is nonlinear, meaning that it abides by exponential rather than by arithmetic relationships. Second, it's dynamic -- its behavior at one point in time influences its behavior in the future. Imagine that we're supposed to be taking the sum of 5 and 5, but we keyed in the second number as 6 by mistake. That will give us an answer of 11 instead of 10. We'll be wrong, but not by much; addition, as a linear operation, is pretty forgiving. Exponential operations, however, extract a lot more punishment when there are inaccuracies in our data. If instead of taking 5^5 -- which should be 3,125 -- we instead take 5^6, we wind up with an answer of 15,625. This problem quickly compounds when the process is dynamic, because outputs at one stage of the process become our inputs in the next.
Given how daunting the challenge was, it must have been tempting to give up on the idea of building a dynamic weather model altogether. A thunderstorm might have remained roughly as unpredictable as an earthquake. But by embracing the uncertainty of the problem, their predictions started to make progress. ''What may have distinguished [me] from those that proceeded,'' Lorenz later reflected in ''The Essence of Chaos,'' his 1993 book, ''was the idea that chaos was something to be sought rather than avoided.''
Perhaps because chaos theory has been a part of meteorological thinking for nearly four decades, professional weather forecasters have become comfortable treating uncertainty the way a stock trader or poker player might. When weather.gov says that there's a 20 percent chance of rain in Central Park, it's because the National Weather Service recognizes that our capacity to measure and predict the weather is accurate only up to a point. ''The forecasters look at lots of different models: Euro, Canadian, our model -- there's models all over the place, and they don't tell the same story,'' Ben Kyger, a director of operations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me. ''Which means they're all basically wrong.'' The National Weather Service forecasters who adjusted temperature gradients with their light pens were merely interpreting what was coming out of those models and making adjustments themselves. ''I've learned to live with it, and I know how to correct for it,'' Kyger said. ''My whole career might be based on how to interpret what it's telling me.''
Despite their astounding ability to crunch numbers in nanoseconds, there are still things that computers can't do, contends Hoke at the National Weather Service. They are especially bad at seeing the big picture when it comes to weather. They are also too literal, unable to recognize the pattern once it's subjected to even the slightest degree of manipulation. Supercomputers, for instance, aren't good at forecasting atmospheric details in the center of storms. One particular model, Hoke said, tends to forecast precipitation too far south by around 100 miles under certain weather conditions in the Eastern United States. So whenever forecasters see that situation, they know to forecast the precipitation farther north.
But there are literally countless other areas in which weather models fail in more subtle ways and rely on human correction. Perhaps the computer tends to be too conservative on forecasting nighttime rainfalls in Seattle when there's a low-pressure system in Puget Sound. Perhaps it doesn't know that the fog in Acadia National Park in Maine will clear up by sunrise if the wind is blowing in one direction but can linger until midmorning if it's coming from another. These are the sorts of distinctions that forecasters glean over time as they learn to work around potential flaws in the computer's forecasting model, in the way that a skilled pool player can adjust to the dead spots on the table at his local bar.
Among the National Weather Service's detailed records is a thorough comparison of how well the computers are doing by themselves alongside the value that humans are contributing. According to the agency's statistics, humans improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts by about 25 percent over the computer guidance alone. They improve the temperature forecasts by about 10 percent. Humans are good enough, in fact, that when the organization's Cray supercomputer burned down, in 1999, their high-temperature forecasts remained remarkably accurate. ''You almost can't have a meeting without someone mentioning the glory days of the Cray fire,'' Kyger said, pointing to a mangled, half-burnt piece of the computer that was proudly displayed in the office where I met him. ''If you weren't here for that, you really weren't part of the brotherhood.''
Still, most people take their forecasts for granted. Like a baseball umpire, a weather forecaster rarely gets credit for getting the call right. Last summer, meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center were tipped off to something serious when nearly all their computer models indicated that a fierce storm was going to be climbing the Northeast Corridor. The eerily similar results between models helped the center amplify its warning for Hurricane Irene well before it touched down on the Atlantic shore, prompting thousands to evacuate their homes. To many, particularly in New York, Irene was viewed as a media-manufactured nonevent, but that was largely because the Hurricane Center nailed its forecast. Six years earlier, the National Weather Service also made a nearly perfect forecast of Hurricane Katrina, anticipating its exact landfall almost 60 hours in advance. If public officials hadn't bungled the evacuation of New Orleans, the death toll might have been remarkably low.
In a time when forecasters of all types make overconfident proclamations about political, economic or natural events, uncertainty is a tough sell. It's much easier to hawk overconfidence, no matter if it's any good. A long-term study of political forecasts conducted by Philip Tetlock, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, found that when political experts described an event as being absolutely certain, it failed to transpire an astonishing 25 percent of the time.
The Weather Service has struggled over the years with how much to let the public in on what it doesn't exactly know. In April 1997, Grand Forks, N.D., was threatened by the flooding Red River, which bisects the city. Snowfall had been especially heavy in the Great Plains that winter, and the service, anticipating runoff as the snow melted, predicted that the Red would crest to 49 feet, close to the record. Because the levees in Grand Forks were built to handle a flood of 52 feet, a small miss in the forecast could prove catastrophic. The margin of error on the Weather Service's forecast -- based on how well its flood forecasts had done in the past -- implied about a 35 percent chance of the levees' being topped.
The waters, in fact, crested to 54 feet. It was well within the forecast's margin of error, but enough to overcome the levees and spill more than two miles into the city. Cleanup costs ran into the billions of dollars, and more than 75 percent of the city's homes were damaged or destroyed. Unlike a hurricane or an earthquake, the Grand Forks flood may have been preventable. The city's flood walls could have been reinforced using sandbags. It might also have been possible to divert the overflow into depopulated areas. But the Weather Service had explicitly avoided communicating the uncertainty in its forecast to the public, emphasizing only the 49-foot prediction. The forecasters later told researchers that they were afraid the public might lose confidence in the forecast if they had conveyed any uncertainty.
Since then, the National Weather Service has come to recognize the importance of communicating the uncertainty in its forecasts as completely as possible. ''Uncertainty is the fundamental component of weather prediction,'' said Max Mayfield, an Air Force veteran who ran the National Hurricane Center when Katrina hit. ''No forecast is complete without some description of that uncertainty.'' Under Mayfield's guidance, the National Hurricane Center began to pay much more attention to how it presents its forecasts. Instead of just showing a single track line for a hurricane's predicted path, their charts prominently feature a cone of uncertainty, which many in the business call ''the cone of chaos.''
Unfortunately, this cautious message can be undercut by private-sector forecasters. Catering to the demands of viewers can mean intentionally running the risk of making forecasts less accurate. For many years, the Weather Channel avoided forecasting an exact 50 percent chance of rain, which might seem wishy-washy to consumers. Instead, it rounded up to 60 or down to 40. In what may be the worst-kept secret in the business, numerous commercial weather forecasts are also biased toward forecasting more precipitation than will actually occur. (In the business, this is known as the wet bias.) For years, when the Weather Channel said there was a 20 percent chance of rain, it actually rained only about 5 percent of the time.
People don't mind when a forecaster predicts rain and it turns out to be a nice day. But if it rains when it isn't supposed to, they curse the weatherman for ruining their picnic. ''If the forecast was objective, if it has zero bias in precipitation,'' Bruce Rose, a former vice president for the Weather Channel, said, ''we'd probably be in trouble.''
The National Weather Service, on the other hand, takes plenty of blame when its cautious forecasts seem retrospectively unwarranted. I was reminded of this when I arrived in Tampa for the Republican National Convention. The city was briefly in Hurricane Isaac's cone of chaos before the storm took a westward tack. The airport and roads were remarkably quiet, no doubt because some reporters and delegates (and thousands of tourists) heeded caution and stayed home. When I so much as mentioned the weather forecast, my taxi driver turned and launched into a series of obscenities.

LE POÈME HARMONIQUE New Yorkers have done well in recent years to make the acquaintance of L'Arpeggiata, a Paris-based ensemble that combines the highest level of early-music artistry and imagination with shifting degrees of theatricality. Now another fine French-based early-music group, which likes additionally to perform by candlelight if not in total darkness, receives its most prominent New York exposure to date, opening the season of the Miller Theater at Columbia University. The program, ''Venezia,'' is predictably heavy on works by Monteverdi, less predictably so on works by Francesco Manelli. Then again, Le Poème, like L'Arpeggiata, seems to put little premium on predictability. Just keep an open mind, and revel in the unexpected. Wednesday, Friday. (James R. Oestreich) 
TWELVE IN '12 Though by now it has been reduced to Nine in '12. Julian Wachner's music program at Trinity Wall Street, which did spectacular service in the first half of last season, especially for the Sept. 11 anniversary commemorations, only to be suspended for much of the second half for a re-evaluation of finances and purpose, is back and seeking new challenges. Under Mr. Wachner the program has become a hotbed of early music, especially with the Trinity Choir's Bach at One series at St. Paul's Chapel (which resumes on Oct. 1). Now, expanding the activities of Trinity's instrumental ensemble Novus NY, Mr. Wachner plans to make contemporary music an equal partner. Here, in a series of hourlong midday concerts, he opens the Trinity season with works by Pulitzer Prize-winning composers of the last dozen years. The first program, scheduled for last Thursday, offered works of Steven Stucky, Zhou Long and Paul Moravec. This week's concert features Jennifer Higdon, David Lang and John Corigliano. Still to come are Kevin Puts, Yehudi Wyner, John Adams, Henry Brant, Steve Reich and Ornette Coleman. Thursday (also Sept. 20, 27). Trinity Church. (J.R.O.)
'EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH' There have been many great operas, but only a few have redefined the very meaning of the art form. Of that select group, Monteverdi's ''Orfeo'' and Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' receive regular performances, but Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's 1976 masterpiece, ''Einstein on the Beach,'' which stretched the bounds of duration and plotlessness, is more talked about than seen. That makes this revival of the original production, part of an international tour honoring Mr. Glass's 75th birthday, one of the season's crucial events. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. Opens Friday. (Zachary Woolfe)
'I DUE FOSCARI' The Los Angeles Opera has retrenched artistically in recent seasons, having taken a huge chance on Achim Freyer's ambitious, often brilliant production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle. This year the only divergence from the standard repertory is this rarely performed tale of political and personal intrigue in 15th-century Venice, which is being mounted for the company's general director, the tenor Plácido Domingo, as he takes another step on his controversial path through Verdi's baritone roles. He is joined by the tenor Francesco Meli and the soprano Marina Poplavskaya; James Conlon, the company's music director, conducts. Opens Saturday. Los Angeles Opera, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, (213) 972-8001, laopera.com. (Z.W.)
NATE WOOLEY When this avant-garde trumpeter played part of his mesmerizing ''Seven Storey Mountain'' at Issue Project Room in June, he used a trumpet without a mouthpiece, amplifying it to create breathy, lightly pitched, sometimes squawking, sometimes almost spoken sounds that whispered over a dense shimmer of other instruments. He returns, again under the auspices of Issue Project Room, with another of the instrument's innovators, Mazen Kerbaj, for an evening of solos and duets. Sept. 19. Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral, 113 Remsen Street, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Alan Gilbert and the orchestra have restructured the opening of their season so that it no longer begins with a gala concert, however frothy. (That happens on Sept. 27, with Itzhak Perlman playing morsels by Massenet and Kreisler, and Mr. Gilbert adding Respighi's ''Fountains of Rome'' and ''Pines of Rome.'') Instead the season opens with a substantial subscription program: Gyorgy Kurtag's ''... quasi una fantasia ...''; Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Leif Ove Andsnes as soloist; and Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' You may run into ''The Rite'' a lot this season, in anticipation of the 100th anniversary of its scandalous premiere in May. (Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic also open their subscription season with it on Sept. 28.) But in this case it may be as much a matter of Mr. Gilbert's wanting to continue honing his interpretation of a thorny classic that he also performed in March, with the Juilliard Orchestra. Sept. 19-22. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
COMPOSER PORTRAITS This invaluable series -- the centerpiece of the Miller Theater's programming, established by George Steel and carried through admirably by his success sor as director of the theater, Melissa Smey, with, bless her, a greater concentration on women -- has generally featured living composers. But it starts this year with a nod to the centenary of John Cage: a program of Cage (and Pierre Boulez's ''Marteau Sans Maître'') with Steven Schick conducting the International Contemporary Ensemble. Other composers featured this season at the Miller are Jonathan Harvey, Olga Neuwirth, Sofia Gubaidulina, Enno Poppe, Rebecca Saunders, Oliver Knussen and Julio Estrada. The Composer Portraits series also goes on the road, to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, with programs devoted to Fred Lerdahl (Oct. 18) and Ms. Gubaidulina (March 21; a somewhat different program). Sept. 20. Miller Theater. (J.R.O.)
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM The Met concert series, long a bastion of traditional classical music programming, sports a new face, as Limor Tomer, its new general manager, presents her first full season of programs. Here the Wordless Music orchestra joins the Danish art-rock group Efterklang in songs from that band's new album, ''Piramida.'' Page 33. Sept. 22. (J.R.O.)
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Nothing is easy for this ensemble as it searches for a music director to succeed James Levine, who resigned in 2011. Last September the prime candidates seemed to be Riccardo Chailly and Andris Nelsons, and both were well represented in that season's programming. But Mr. Chailly had to cancel because of a heart arrhythmia; Mr. Nelsons, because of the birth of his child. Mr. Chailly must surely be out of the running now, the orchestra having struggled through no end of health crises with Mr. Levine. Mr. Nelsons, who caught up with the orchestra at Tanglewood this summer and is scheduled to appear in Boston this season (Jan. 31; Feb. 1-2, 5), still seems to be a front-runner, though he just extended his contract as music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in England through the 2014-15 season. Other names currently circulating include those of Vladimir Jurowski, who makes his Boston Symphony debut in October (11-13), and -- a dark horse -- Esa-Pekka Salonen, who is not scheduled to conduct the Boston Symphony this season. The season opens here with Itzhak Perlman conducting a program of Beethoven in which he also performs the two violin romances. It seems safe to say that he harbors no ambitions to become the orchestra's music director. Sept. 22. Symphony Hall, (617) 266-1200 or (888) 266-1200, bso.org. (J.R.O.)
'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' How can you tell that a singer and a composer are riding high at the Metropolitan Opera? When they are given two opening nights in a row. The star soprano Anna Netrebko, who opened the last season in the title role of ''Anna Bolena,'' takes on another Donizetti opera -- though not ''Maria Stuarda,'' the follow-up to ''Bolena,'' as Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager originally hoped. (That vehicle falls to the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato on New Year's Eve.) Instead Ms. Netrebko plays Adina in a new production of the classic comedy ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' which combines ample laughs with threads of melancholy and touching emotion. The tenor Matthew Polenzani plays the love-struck Nemorino; the charismatic baritone Mariusz Kwiecien is Sergeant Belcore, his rival for Adina's affections; and the bass Ambrogio Maestri (and later in the run, the winning Erwin Schrott) sings Dr. Dulcamara, the lovable quack who dispenses the supposed elixir of love. Bartlett Sher, whose Met productions can teeter between spirited and frenetic, directs; Maurizio Benini conducts the burbling, effortlessly charming score. Opens Sept. 24. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The great joy of the society's concerts is the interaction of up-and-coming musicians with established ones: a violinist like Benjamin Beilman, say, on the cusp of a major career, and the veteran flutist Ransom Wilson. Those two, along with a host of colleagues, will play an opening program of serenades by Mozart, Kodaly, Strauss and Dvorak, the introduction to a season that reaches from Bach's keyboard concertos (played by Jeremy Denk as part of the annual Baroque Festival in December) by way of 19th-century classics to the complete Shostakovich string quartets in March. Sept. 24. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
'DOG DAYS' David T. Little, a percussionist with a composerly predilection for the theater, presents an example, ''Dog Days,'' as part of the Peak Performances series at Montclair State University (with another, ''Soldier Songs,'' to follow from Prototype: Opera/Theater/Now in January). Page 35. Opens Sept 29. Kasser Theater, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org. (J.R.O.)
GREEN MUSIC CENTER If ever there was a concert hall worth emulating, it is the Musikverein in Vienna, and the designers of Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood studied it well. If ever there was an indoor-outdoor concert hall worth emulating, it is Ozawa Hall, and those same designers -- notably the architect, William Rawn and the acoustician Lawrence Kirkegaard -- were recruited to do likewise with a 1,400-seat hall on the campus of Sonoma State University. An infusion of funds from Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of the board of Carnegie Hall, and his wife, Joan Weill, gave it a name, Weill Hall. (So is it Tanglewood West or Carnegie West?) The opening weekend includes a recital by the pianist Lang Lang and a concert by the Santa Rosa Symphony, conducted by its music director, Bruno Ferrandis, and others. Sept. 29-30. Green Music Center, Rohnert Park, Calif., (866) 955-6040, gmc.sonoma.edu. (J.R.O.)
'THE RITE OF SPRING' AT 100 This season-long festival gets a jump on the centennial of the masterpiece that not only defined Stravinsky's career -- more in subsequent performances than in its tempestuous premiere on May 29, 1913 -- but also set the course for much of 20th-century music, on into the 21st. The celebration opens here with ''The Seasons,'' by Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky commissioned for the occasion and performed by the cellist Y0-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble. Mr. Yanov-Yanovsky adapts folk tunes used by Stravinsky in ''The Rite.'' Later events include multiple staged interpretations of the work, notably the Joffrey Ballet's attempt at a ''literal re-creation'' of the original choreography (March 23-24) and a new Basil Twist rendering with puppets (April 12-13). Valery Gergiev conducts the Mariinsky Orchestra in two concerts, the second culminating in ''The Rite'' (Oct. 29-30, after a scholarly conference on ''Reassessing 'The Rite,''' Oct. 25-28), and Giancarlo Guerrero leads the Cleveland Orchestra in a program featuring Stravinsky's ''Petrouchka'' (March 17). Actually, the festival isn't quite season-long, ending in late April, before the actual anniversary. Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Carolina Performing Arts, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, (919) 843-3333. theriteofspringat100.org. (J.R.O.)
OCTOBER
'THE PRISMATIC DEBUSSY' New York City's major cultural institutions have largely ignored the 150th anniversary of the birth of Debussy, so the Eastman School of Music is picking up the slack with a series of concerts exploring his multifaceted output, held in conjunction with lectures, films and exhibitions. Oct. 1-27. Eastman School of Music, Rochester, (585) 274-1100, esm.rochester.edu/debussy. (Z.W.)
CECILIA BARTOLI ''Steffani's star isn't in the ascendant,'' says the heroine (a musicologist!) of the Venice-based mystery writer Donna Leon's novel ''The Jewels of Paradise,'' to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press in October. Well, the star of Agostino Steffani -- ''composer and bishop, musician and diplomat,'' in Ms. Leon's words -- may soon rise, at least by a blip. As EMI Classics tries to ride the coattails of E.L. James's steamy potboiler ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' with an album of works mentioned in the book (there will be no quotations from that book here, nor any endorsement of that recording), Decca takes a more imaginative approach to a publishing tie-in with Ms. Bartoli's latest project, ''Mission,'' a two-disc set of arias and other works by Steffani. Ms. Leon and Ms. Bartoli are said to be friends, and they evidently shared scholarly groundwork in conjuring Steffani's personage and reviving his music. Ms. Leon's protagonist, hired to sort through newly discovered documents left behind by Steffani, recalls tunes of his that she has heard: ''What was that heartbreaking lament, something about 'Dal mio petto'?'' And Ms. Bartoli sings a good many of them, including that one, from the opera ''Niobe.'' As with her previous album ''Sacrificium: The Art of the Castrati,'' Ms. Bartoli strikes an androgynous pose, this time as a bald-pated, crucifix-clutching (and per Ms. Leon, castrated?) Steffani for the cover art. Oct. 2. Decca. (J.R.O.)
CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA This year the great Chicagoans fill the coveted spot opening the Carnegie Hall season. It is the start of the orchestra's third year under the music director Riccardo Muti, who has had the ensemble playing with characteristic sheen and power through the eclectic programs he favors. The three-night stand at Carnegie veers from Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' on opening night -- no one is better than Mr. Muti at ratcheting up the drama in vocal and choral works -- to music of Wagner, Franck, Dvorak, Martucci, Respighi and the young composer-D.J. Mason Bates. Oct 3-5. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
TWOSENSE All-stars from the All-Stars. The brilliant and searching Lisa Moore was the founding pianist of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, a position she held until 2008, and Ashley Bathgate is the group's current cellist. The two came together in 2010 as a commissioning and performing duo devoted to pairing new works and the classics. This program features premieres by Ryan Brown, Daniel Felsenfeld and Hannah Lash. Oct. 4. Roulette, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org. (Z.W.)
EMANUEL AX As artist in residence with the New York Philharmonic this season, the beloved pianist makes a move many of us have long been waiting for, taking up music of Bach in concert: here, the Keyboard Concerto in D minor (BWV 1052). In addition, he shows his marvelous versatility by working on an opposite fringe of the standard repertory, with Schoenberg's Piano Concerto. Alan Gilbert conducts the program, which also includes Mozart's ''Linz'' Sympony. Oct. 4-6. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
MINSOO SOHN The Honens International Piano Competition in Calgary, Alberta, which has developed a better track record than most, has been trying to beef up its international presence in recent years. In April, it held quarterfinals in New York for this year's competition, which concludes in Calgary in October. It has also started a record label to feature its winners, and Mr. Sohn, the 2006 prize laureate, made a big impression with a release of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations,'' which he now brings to New York along with variations by Brahms and Webern. Page 35. Oct 6. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
'LA FINTA GIARDINIERA' René Jacobs's recordings of Mozart's operas bring back some of the thrill that must have attended these works when they were new; his ''Nozze di Figaro,'' in particular, truly does make you hear that work as if for the first time. (Who knew that that critical commonplace could ever be deserved?) ''La Finta Giardiniera,'' one of Mozart's earliest operas, has long hovered in semiobscurity -- not a true rarity but not often performed, either -- despite its gorgeous music and acute libretto. Mr. Jacobs and the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra are sure to locate both its uproarious farce and its core of melancholy. The only downside of a new installment in the series is that it gets that much closer to coming to an end. Oct. 9. Harmonia Mundi. (Z.W.)
GREAT MUSIC IN A GREAT SPACE The conductor and organist Kent Tritle, best known for Sacred Music in a Sacred Space, the acclaimed, longstanding series he founded at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, revived a similarly named series presented in earlier years at St. John the Divine, when he moved there during the last season. Here he conducts the Cathedral Choir and Orchestra in Bach's certifiably great Mass in B minor. Oct. 10. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, (866) 811-4111, stjohndivine.org. (J.R.O)
RENÉE ANNE LOUPRETTE This excellent organist, who like Kent Tritle left her position at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola and is now at Trinity Wall Street, inaugurates another new feature in Trinity's suddenly resurgent music program: Pipes at One, a series of 40-minute midday organ recitals (by her and others) on the beautifully restored Schlicker organ at St. Paul's Chapel. No repertory has been announced yet; trust Ms. Louprette to make it worth your while. Oct. 3. (J.R.O.)
'MOBY-DICK' The first products of the David Gockley leadership at the San Francisco Opera, which began in 2006, showed little of the enterprise that characterized Mr. Gockley's 33 years at the Houston Grand Opera. But this season represents something of a breakthrough for Mr. Gockley and the company. Jake Heggie's adaptation of ''Moby-Dick,'' Herman Melville's masterpiece, had its premiere at the Dallas Opera in 2010 and is the first of three operas by living American composers being presented. (Nolan Gasser's family-friendly ''Secret Garden'' has its premiere on March 1, and Mark Adamo's ''Gospel of Mary Magdalene'' opens on June 19.) These are not the most adventurous composers working in opera today, but taken together their works add up to a considerable and refreshing commitment to the art form's present and future. Opens Oct. 10. War Memorial Opera House, (413) 864-3330, sfopera.com. (Z.W.)
NIELSEN PROJECT One of Alan Gilbert's marquee initiatives as he gets deeper into his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic is a series of concerts and recordings over a number of years exploring the six symphonies and three concertos of the underappreciated Danish composer Carl Nielsen. Having spent time with some of the symphonies, Mr. Gilbert turns his attention this season to the concertos for flute (with the orchestra's principal, Robert Langevin) and violin (with the guest soloist Nikolaj Znaider) in a program with Tchaikovsky's grand Second Symphony, the ''Little Russian.'' Oct. 10-13. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA Some of us recall the founding of this conductorless ensemble as if it were yesterday and still sort of wonder (despite the continuing success of the 62-year-old Prague Chamber Orchestra, among other conductor-free groups) whether the noble experiment will succeed. Well don't look now, but Orpheus, having recorded more than 70 albums, celebrates its 40th anniversary this season. Evidently it is here to stay. Its first program offers Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' Overture; ''Earth Echoes,'' a song cycle by Augusta Read Thomas, sung by the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke and the baritone Nathan Gunn; and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, which the orchestra has performed numerous ... er, never. It's a great piece, Orpheus; you'll love it. Carnegie Hall. Oct. 11. (J.R.O.)
'WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE' There will be a bittersweet quality to this new production of Oliver Knussen's captivating opera based on the beloved, bracing children's book by Maurice Sendak, who died in May. Brilliantly juxtaposed with Ravel's ''Mother Goose,'' it is being presented as part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's sweeping commitment to new and recent opera under its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, who conducts a cast that includes Claire Booth and Susan Bickley. The production is by the British director and video artist Netia Jones, who will conjure up animations based on Sendak's classic illustrations. (Ms. Jones is well practiced in Mr. Knussen's take on Sendak, having created a version of the operatic ''Higglety Pigglety Pop'' this summer at the Tanglewood Festival in Massachusetts.) Oct. 11-14. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com. (Z.W.)
YANNICK NÉZET-SÉGUIN Finally! Four years after the departure of Christoph Eschenbach as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and two years after it was announced that Mr. Nézet-Séguin (whom, for obvious reasons, the orchestra has been marketing on a first-name basis) would succeed him, the once fabulous Philadelphians again have a music director. Happily, they had expert musical guidance in the interim from an eminently capable and devoted principal conductor, Charles Dutoit, who maintained a high level of artistic achievement as administrative chaos swirled around him. (That included a period without music director, executive director or board chairman, and a 2011 filing for bankruptcy protection, from which the orchestra emerged in late July.) The delay, it turns out, had a good, or at least opportune, side, allowing the orchestra now to cloak Mr. Nézet-Séguin in the mantle of messiah, since it was just 100 years ago that Leopold Stokowski, who had a huge formative influence on the orchestra, arrived. Let the comparisons begin, in a gala concert featuring the soprano Renée Fleming and anchored by Brahms's Fourth Symphony. Oct. 18. Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org. (J.R.O.)
MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA It has been a tough time financially for American orchestras, and several of them had yet to negotiate new contracts with the players by press time (others including the Cleveland Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra). In addition, the Minnesota Orchestra faces a season of wandering as its Orchestra Hall is being renovated. (New Yorkers can only envy the resolve: what would a year or two of imaginative wandering by the Philharmonic matter if we could solve the Avery Fisher Hall Problem once and for all?) Osmo Vanska has worked artistic wonders as the orchestra's music director, and he can probably be counted on to steer it through these extracurricular shoals as well. He opens the season with a program of Elgar, Rachmaninoff (Piano Concerto No. 3, with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist) and Respighi at the orchestra's temporary home. Oct. 18-20. Auditorium at the Convention Center, Minnesota, (612) 371-5656, minnesotaorchestra.org. (J.R.O.)
WORLD ORCHESTRA FOR PEACE This international assemblage of star players, founded in 1995 by the conductor Georg Solti and conducted here by Valery Gergiev, who is widely active in New York over the next two weeks, celebrates the Solti centennial. The program includes excerpts of operas by Mozart and Verdi, with the soprano Angela Gheorghiu and the bass René Pape, Strauss's ''Don Juan'' and Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra (which Solti conducted with a particular, Hungarian flair). Oct. 19. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
LES ARTS FLORISSANTS Before this peerless Baroque-music ensemble and its director, William Christie, bring their production of Marc-Antoine Charpentier's ''David et Jonathas'' to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in mid-April, they offer a teaser of sorts with rare performances of three of Charpentier's impassioned sacred motets. A week later members of the group join the terrific student ensemble Juilliard415 for Handel's glorious oratorio ''Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno'' (''The Triumph of Time and Truth''). Alice Tully Hall. Oct. 19, 27. (Z.W.)
'GLASS AT 75' As we said, no end of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' this season: here the four-hand piano version, played by Maki Namekawa and Dennis Russell Davies, and given historical context between works by Debussy -- ''En Blanc et Noir,'' actually composed two years after ''The Rite,'' in 1915 -- and Philip Glass, the ostensible subject of the program. Oct. 21. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, (212) 685-0008, ext. 560, themorgan.org. (J.R.O.)
NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG Celebrating its 25th anniversary, this worthy enterprise opens its season with a program timed with an eye toward the election, ''Mr. Gershwin Goes to Washington.'' It's actually Mr. Gershwins, plural: an evening of satire drawn from George and Ira Gershwin's songs about politics, directed and adapted by Laurence Maslon. The featured artists are the sopranos Anne-Carolyn Bird and Lauren Worsham and the pianists Steven Blier, the festival's artistic director, and Joseph Thalken. A tease in the season announcement promises that ''a distinguished member of the political news media will be the surprise guest narrator.'' We're all a-twit. (And so as not to spoil the surprise when the program itself goes to Washington a couple of days later, the narrator there will be different.) Oct. 20. Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan. Oct. 22. Terrace Theater, Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, (212) 501-3330, nyfos.org. (J.R.O.)
LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Here is Valery Gergiev again, with one of his own orchestras. The London Symphony is making much of the the 100th anniversary of its first North American appearance, claiming that it was ''the first European orchestra to visit the United States and Canada.'' (It was originally booked for the fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic, whose delay forced the players to board a smaller ship; they were already in St. Louis when they learned of the disaster.) Not that the programming particularly reflects the occasion. It is all Brahms: the Symphonies Nos. 2 and 4, the Violin Concerto (with James Ehnes as soloist), the Piano Concerto No. 1 (with Denis Matsuev) and the ''Tragic Overture.'' It might all seem more special if Kurt Masur were not scheduled to conduct two weeks of Brahms (Symphonies Nos. 2-4, Double Concerto) with the New York Philharmonic in the same hall in early November. (Whether an increasingly frail Mr. Masur can endure all of that is another matter.) Oct. 22, 24. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'THE TEMPEST' New York is kept mostly up-to-date with the orchestral and solo piano music of the mercurial English composer Thomas Adès, but his masterly 2004 Shakespeare adaptation, one of the most praised operas of the 21st century, is just now receiving its New York premiere. It is one of the vanishingly few contemporary operas to receive the Metropolitan Opera's imprimatur, and the company is giving it a brilliant, mostly young cast. Mr. Adès conducts. The only element to give pause is the director, Robert Lepage, whose production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle was roundly dismissed by critics. Whether he can return to his roots as a darling of the theatrical avant-garde may be the biggest question of the Met season. Page 33. Opens Oct. 23. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA The brilliant young conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin has so far been best known in New York for his opera performances: memorably galvanic takes on Bizet's ''Carmen'' and Gounod's ''Faust'' at the Metropolitan Opera. For his first Carnegie Hall appearance as music director of the marvelous Philadelphians, he works to his dramatic strengths, offering Verdi's operatic-scale, hellfire-breathing Requiem, with the orchestra joined by the Westminster Symphonic Choir. The soloists are the only real difficulty, since two of the four -- the febrile soprano Marina Poplavskaya and the often ailing tenor Rolando Villazón -- have a way of polarizing opera fans. But this is Mr. Nézet-Séguin's chance to shine and, perhaps, to fuel speculation that he eventually may be a candidate to replace James Levine as the Met's music director. Oct. 23. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
WHITE LIGHT FESTIVAL When this festival began in 2010 as an exploration of transcendence, it seemed more a personal statement by its creator, Jane Moss, the artistic director of Lincoln Center, than any particular sign of the times. But with themes of spirituality having recently taken hold at festivals in Salzburg, Austria, and Lucerne, Switzerland, and elsewhere, Ms. Moss seems to have caught the beginnings of an international wave, to whatever extent she did not herself set it in motion. The festival opens with a free program, ''Without Shadows,'' featuring Kiran Ahluwalia, a Punjabi vocalist, with Indian percussion and contemporary instruments. Oct. 23. David Rubinstein Atrium. (J.R.O.)
ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Flexibility is a rare commodity in the programming of major orchestras and concert halls, especially when international appearances are involved. Planning is done far in advance, and there are too many moving parts to allow much change. But the Israel Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta, its music director for life, who made a strong showing in the Salzburg Festival's Spiritual Overture in July with two programs based mostly in Judaism, decided to build quickly on that success. They set aside the big pieces originally scheduled for this appearance (Hindemith's ''Mathis der Maler'' and Brahms's First Symphony) and replaced them with works from their first festival concert: Schoenberg's ''Kol Nidre'' and Noam Sheriff's ''Mechaye Hametim'' (''Revival of the Dead''), a Holocaust remembrance. Both are choral works, and the switch was doable because the chorus used in Salzburg was the Collegiate Chorale of New York, and the baritone Thomas Hampson was available (or made himself available) to reprise his roles. The flexibility could not be complete, since the orchestra had a commitment to another soloist, the young pianist Yuja Wang, and few will object to hearing her perform Mendelssohn's First Piano Concerto. But the cost is Mr. Hampson's searing interpretation of Mahler's ''Kindertotenlieder'' (''Songs on the Death of Children''), which, though composed as a personal statement 40 years before the Holocaust, made for a better thematic fit. Oct. 25. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
GABRIEL KAHANE An emblem of a generation of composers who work eagerly and beautifully in multiple genres, Mr. Kahane is a noted composer of pop music, concert works and musical theater. (His ''February House'' recently completed a run at the Public Theater.) In ''Don't Even Listen'' he is joined by the vocalist Shara Worden and the young string quartet Brooklyn Rider for a program that encompasses works old and new, including a premiere (''The Fiction Issue'') and songs by Cee Lo Green, Schubert, Schumann, Sufjan Stevens and Mr. Kahane himself. Oct. 25. Zankel Hall. (Z.W.)
'OUT COLD'/'ZIPPO SONGS' Bigger, in the arts, is not lately better. With more and more music, dance and theater conceived on a chamber scale, it is only natural to want smaller spaces for them. This season the Brooklyn Academy of Music unveils its new Richard B. Fisher Building, designed for performances more intimate than those in its older theaters. One of the early offerings is this program of two song cycles by Phil Kline, best known for his widely performed, ambulatory piece for the winter holidays, ''Unsilent Night,'' in which both audience and recorded sound source travel around. ''Zippo Songs'' (2003), with texts from lines inscribed on the sides of Zippo lighters by American G.I.'s in Vietnam, will be heard in a new arrangement for string quintet, piano and percussion, and the new ''Out Cold'' has Schubert's ''Winterreise'' meet some of Frank Sinatra's wintriest recordings for a reflection on introversion and isolation. The longtime Kline collaborator Theo Bleckmann sings alongside the well-regarded American Contemporary Music Ensemble in stagings directed by Emma Griffin. Oct. 25-27. BAM Fisher. (Z.W.)
BRITTEN CENTENNIAL Few enjoy the rote attention that composers tend to get paid in major anniversary years, but the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center seems sincere in its season-long tribute to Benjamin Britten, who was born a century ago, in 1913, and whose chamber music is among the most distinguished parts of his wide-ranging output. In three fascinating programs the Escher String Quartet juxtaposes Britten's quartets with a variety of repertory: first with the Baroque and Beethoven, then with fellow British composers and finally with other quartets composed during and after World War II. A final concert featuring various artists offers a rich selection of Britten's music, including the adorable ''Insect Pieces'' for oboe and piano; the sublime mini-opera canticle ''Abraham and Isaac,'' featuring the countertenor Daniel Taylor and the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey; and the eloquent Cello Sonata, with David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, the society's artistic directors. There are few gifts to the city this year as sweet as the immersion in this music that the society is offering. Oct. 25, Feb. 28, May 2. Rose Studio. May 10. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The Philadelphia Orchestra is not the only ensemble celebrating a Stokowski legacy this season. The maestro founded the American Symphony to perform at Carnegie Hall in 1962, after the New York Philharmonic had decamped for Lincoln Center. Now the American Symphony, which returned to Carnegie after a long absence in 2010, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with an outsize concert conducted by its music director of the last two decades, the intrepid Leon Botstein. It opens with the first work Stokowski performed with the ensemble, his own arrangement of ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' and also includes Ives's Fourth Symphony, whose premiere Stokowski and the orchestra presented in 1965, 11 years after Ives's death. The program, also featuring the Collegiate Chorale, is filled out with Mahler's gargantuan ''Symphony of a Thousand,'' typically given as a concert in itself. True the symphonies add up to only 90 minutes in time, but in weight? For this concert, ticket prices are being rolled back to 1962 levels, from $1.50 to $7, and no question, it's a lot of bang for your buck-fifty. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
MARLIS PETERSEN For her New York recital debut this coolly intelligent soprano, best known to New York audiences for stepping in for Natalie Dessay in a new production of Ambroise Thomas's ''Hamlet'' in 2010, brings a program focused on Goethe's concept of the eternal feminine. The music ranges from the core of classic lieder -- Beethoven, Schubert, Wolf, Schumann -- to 20th-century masters like Hanns Eisler and Walter Braunfels. She is joined by the pianist Jendrik Springer. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
DJ SPOOKY And here is the personification of the new concert programming at the Metropolitan Museum: Paul D. Miller, a k a DJ Spooky, That Subliminal Kid, an artist in residence for the season. Here he presents a screening of the 1956 film ''Madame Freedom'' with a rescoring for string quartet. Page 33. Oct. 26. Metropolitan Museum. (J.R.O.)
ANDRAS SCHIFF With this pianist playing Bach, you almost needn't say more. Whereas other pianists perform Bach, some of them magnificently, Mr. Schiff seems to embody him, so thoroughly has he internalized the music and so freely does he let it unfold. Here, beginning a two-season comprehensive Bach Project in various New York halls, he plays ''The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' Books 1 and 2. Page 35. 92nd Street Y. Oct. 27, Nov. 1. (J.R.O.)
ANGELA HEWITT Bachians may think they had died and gone to heaven. To tide them over between Mr. Schiff's ''Well-Tempered'' recitals, Ms. Hewitt, one of those pianists who perform Bach's music magnificently, offers the ''Goldberg'' Variations, and you can listen with beer in hand: in H.L. Mencken's words, Bach's ''natural solvent.'' Page 35. Oct. 28. Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lprnyc.com. (J.R.O.)
ELGAR, CARTER CELLO CONCERTOS Jacqueline du Pré's recording of the Elgar Cello Concerto with her husband, Daniel Barenboim, wasn't her best take on her signature work; that honor goes to the album she made with John Barbirolli. But her collaboration with Mr. Barenboim remains a potent mixture of the personal and the artistic. So it is major news indeed that Mr. Barenboim has now made another recording of the grand, lyrical work, 25 years after du Pré's untimely death, and with another female cellist: the richly gifted Alisa Weilerstein. The orchestra is the Berlin Staatskapelle, and the Elgar is intriguingly paired with another grand cello concerto, Elliott Carter's shivering, heaving, bursting addition to the repertory, from 2000. Oct. 30. Decca. (Z.W.)
MARIINSKY ORCHESTRA And here is Valery Gergiev again, with his other orchestra, fresh from presenting two concerts at the Carolina Performing Arts festival The Rite of Spring at 100, where they performed the title work. No Stravinsky here: Mr. Gergiev and his St. Petersburg troops offer a suite from Rodion Shchedrin's ''Little Humpbacked Horse,'' Shostakovich's Symphony No. 6 and Strauss's ''Heldenleben.'' Oct. 31. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
NOVEMBER
LIQUID MUSIC The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra -- assuming that the ensemble itself is still liquid by then, given reports of financial constraints and threats to its full-time status -- will offer a new series of six boundary-crossing programs, beginning, as the presidential election approaches, with the performance artist Laurie Anderson's politically tinged ''Dirtday!'' Other programs feature guest artists of many alt-classical stripes mingling with members of the orchestra at locations in St. Paul, mostly the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Center. Nov. 2-3. Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, (651) 291-1144. thespco.org/liquidmusic. (J.R.O.)
VOICES FROM LATIN AMERICA With Clive Gillinson as its executive and artistic director, Carnegie has made a specialty of organizing major citywide festivals, often on international themes. Here is another. The Carnegie performances open with an evening by the popular artist Gilberto Gil, one of the artistic advisers (along with Gustavo Dudamel, Osvaldo Golijov and Chucho Valdés). Strictly classical music will play a relatively small part in the festival (which runs through Dec. 11), aside from concerts by the New Juilliard Ensemble, the Ensemble ACJW and the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela. Nov. 8. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' The director David Alden, whose politically charged, vividly theatrical productions have been praised and debated since the 1980s, worked briefly at the Met early in his career, refurbishing productions of Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and Berg's ''Wozzeck.'' But he makes his real company debut with this seething Verdi work about betrayal at a royal court. It was set to star the soprano Karita Mattila, but she pulled out in May, after deciding that the role no longer fitted her voice, and was replaced by Sondra Radvanovsky, a stalwart of the Met's Verdi wing. Marcelo Álvarez, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Kathleen Kim also star, and the cast is rounded out by the veteran Dolora Zajick as Ulrica. Fabio Luisi conducts. Opens Nov. 8. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
VOX FESTIVAL One of the New York City Opera's signature offerings, this laboratory for full-orchestra readings of excerpts from contemporary American operas has been constricted to just six works on a single day, but it continues nevertheless. Now presented in conjunction with the service organization Opera America, this season's festival will feature works by the downtown favorite John Zorn (a ''mystery play'' based on the life and work of Hildegard von Bingen), Moto Osada, Christopher Weiss, Evan Meier, James Stepleton (''The Awakening,'' based on the Kate Chopin novella) and Osnat Netzer. Nov. 8. N.Y.U. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, La Guardia Place at Washington Square South, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET Second to none in French repertory, this pianist -- long unfairly known more for his sartorial choices than for his musical ones -- gives a recital devoted to Debussy, who, though celebrating his 150th birthday, is largely ignored this year by New York's cultural institutions. Nov. 10. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA These days the orchestra tends to alternate in New York between making big statements -- as with its Bruckner symphonies at the Lincoln Center Festival last year and its concert performance of Strauss's opera ''Salome'' at Carnegie Hall in May -- and slipping in and out relatively modestly. Here it sets down on the way to one of its regular Miami residencies, with Franz Welser-Möst, its music director, conducting works by Beethoven (Symphony No. 4, ''Grosse Fuge''), Matthias Pintscher (''Chute d'Étoiles,'' in its New York premiere) and Scriabin (''Poem of Ecstasy''). Mr. Welser-Möst reserves his big New York statement this season for the Vienna Philhamonic's Carnegie weekend in March. Nov. 13. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
BERNARDA FINK For date night with a sophisticated singing fan, look no further: there are few artists more eloquent and elegant than this Argentine mezzo-soprano, who will sing some of Dvorak's ''Biblical Songs,'' which are included on her astonishingly lovely, spirited recent recording of that composer's songs and duets on Harmonia Mundi. The program, with Anthony Spiri as pianist, also includes Schumann's ''Lenau Lieder'' and songs by Mahler. Nov. 14. Alice Tully Hall. (Z.W.)
'LA CLEMENZA DI TITO' The conductor Harry Bicket, a Baroque specialist, has been responsible for some of the most scintillating and lively Met performances in recent seasons. After leading a run of this long-underrated Mozart opera in 2008, he returns to it now with an even better cast: Lucy Crowe, Barbara Frittoli, Elina Garanca, Kate Lindsey and Giuseppe Filianoti. Opens Nov. 16. Metropolitan Opera. (Z.W.)
ORCHESTRA RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE John Eliot Gardiner made a big impression with his crack period-instrument orchestra in four symphonies of Beethoven last season at Carnegie. All you need to know now is that his Monteverdi Choir is sure to be just as fine, and that's a good thing, since Mr. Gardiner is reaching for the sky with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony one night and his ''Missa Solemnis'' the next. Not to be missed. Nov. 16-17. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
JOYCE DIDONATO This assured and radiantly good-natured American mezzo-soprano will take on the title role of Donizetti's ''Maria Stuarda'' at the Met on New Year's Eve. But before that bel canto milestone she ventures earlier in a Baroque program called ''Drama Queens'' (also the title of her new recording), which includes tours de force by Handel, Monteverdi, Gluck, Hasse and others, with Alan Curtis leading Il Complesso Barocco. Nov. 18. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA In 2009 Esa-Pekka Salonen ended his transformative run as the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic to, he said, concentrate on composing. But thankfully for audiences, he has not abandoned conducting at all; he even took over the helm of this great ensemble, which arrives at Lincoln Center for two nights: first Mahler's Ninth Symphony and then, even more exciting, a concert performance of Berg's opera ''Wozzeck,'' with luxury casting: the baritone Simon Keenlyside and the soprano Angela Denoke. If anyone can find the sensuality and drama of Berg's pathbreaking score, it is Mr. Salonen. Nov. 18-19. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY To celebrate its 50th anniversary, this worthy ensemble does not diverge from its time-tested formula of offering Carnegie Hall exposure to gifted young performers, conductors and composers. For the anniversary -- also the hall debut of its new music director, Joshua Gersen -- the orchestra will play works by Shostakovich and Ludwig Wilhelm Maurer, Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony and a premiere by Gabriel Zucker. Nov. 25. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'THE PEONY PAVILION' The latest changes in the Met Museum's concert programming stem largely from a desire to tie it more closely to exhibitions, as with this staging of the 16th-century Chinese opera, presented in connection with the exhibition ''Chinese Gardens: Palace Pavilions, Scholars' Studios, Rustic Retreats.'' Conceived for presentation in a garden in Shanghai, the production will be staged in the small Astor Court and relayed live from there in high definition to the overflow audience in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. Tan Dun, the director, has shaved some 18 hours off the opera -- as presented in all its glory in the stunning production by Chen Shi-Zheng at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1999, and elsewhere in the years following -- bringing it down to a mere 70 minutes, while presumably retaining a goodly measure of that glory. Metropolitan Museum. Nov. 30. (J.R.O.)
DECEMBER
OLGA NEUWIRTH This Austrian composer may be part of Melissa Smey's campaign to bring more women into the fold of the Miller Theater's Composer Portraits series, as here. Ms. Neuwirth can do big and brash and bold with the best of them. Page 35. Dec. 6. Miller Theater. (J.R.O.)
SIMÓN BOLÍVAR ORCHESTRA OF VENEZUELA El Sistema, Venezuela's storied music education system, has many success stories but none quite as astonishing as that of the conductor Gustavo Dudamel, who rocketed through the program to stardom and the music directorship of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He has brought to prominence with him the youthful Bolívar ensemble, whose two-night stand is part of Carnegie Hall's Voices of Latin America festival. The repertory, including works by composers like Silvestre Revueltas, Esteban Benzecry and Heitor Villa-Lobos, is almost never done here, and it is sure to be galvanizing: few conductors draw visceral excitement out of an orchestra -- especially these young charges -- the way Mr. Dudamel does. Dec. 10-11. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'MESSIAH' There are so many excellent New York performances of this great Handel oratorio at Christmastime that it is impossible to predict which will be best over all, whatever that may mean. But John Scott's is sure to rank high among the contenders, and it is typically the most lovable, with the superbly trained St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys holding forth in festive red cassocks before the church's intricately sculptured altarpiece. (The ailing pipe organ is another story, with pleas for contributions sure to be stuffed into the program.) James Richman's Concert Royal, on period instruments, fills out a sound worthy of the magnificent space. Dec. 11, 13. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org. (In other notable performances of ''Messiah,'' Julian Wachner conducts the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at Trinity Church on Dec. 9 and at Alice Tully Hall on Dec. 12; Kent Tritle conducts the amateur Oratorio Society of New York at Carnegie Hall on Dec. 17 and the professional Musica Sacra, also at Carnegie, on Dec. 20 and 22; and Emmanuelle Haïm conducts the New York Choral Artists and the New York Philharmonic from Dec. 18 to Dec. 22.) (J.R.O.)
'LES TROYENS' James Levine, the Met's ailing music director, has long been a champion of Berlioz's sprawling, shining masterpiece, so his absence from the podium for this revival of Francesca Zambello's production is particularly painful. Fabio Luisi will replace him, leading a cast that includes the deeply sympathetic mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the spurned queen Dido, the tenor Marcello Giordani in the high-reaching role of Aeneas and Deborah Voigt, fresh from trying out the epic Brünnhilde in Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, as the desperate prophetess Cassandra. But one of the vocal pleasures may be in a minor role: the excellent bass Kwangchul Youn as Narbal. Opens Dec. 13. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'CHRISTMAS ORATORIO' Here, in Bach's six-pack of Christmas cantatas, is a welcome change of pace from Philippe Herreweghe and his Collegium Vocale Gent Choir and Orchestra, whom we are used to hearing in Bach's somber Passions (no bad thing, to be sure). It should be entertaining as well as uplifting to catch them in a jubilant mood. Dec. 15. Alice Tully Hall. (In another notable performance of Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio,'' as part of Trinity Wall Street's 12th Night Festival, Julian Wachner and the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra, who last season presented each of the six component cantatas on the appropriate day of the liturgical calendar, will this year divide them differently, with midday performances of Nos. 1 and 2 on Jan. 3, and Nos. 3 and 4 on Jan. 4, all at St. Paul's Chapel; and Nos. 5 and 6 on Jan. 5, at Trinity Church.) (J.R.O.)
'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' The Met, of late, has offered tightened versions of certain productions as family-friendly entertainments for the holiday season, and Bartlett Sher's antic version of Rossini's classic is an ideal choice. The company has not stinted on this year's cast, which features the charming up-and-coming stars Isabel Leonard, Alek Shrader, Rodion Pogossov and Jordan Bisch. The conductor Yves Abel's work at the house has always had stylish spirit. Opens Dec. 18. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
CONTACT! Last year's installment of the New York Philharmonic's series of new and recent music felt staler than in the past, but this concert is a return to form, with premieres of works by Andy Akiho and Jude Vaclavik as well as the first New York performances of ''Try,'' by the noted young composer Andrew Norman, and Jacob Druckman's ''Counterpoise.'' Jayce Ogren, well practiced in contemporary music, conducts, and the vocal soloist is the brilliant soprano Elizabeth Futral. Dec. 21. Metropolitan Museum. Dec. 22. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Z.W.)
NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS Delightful pluck! On the day a Mayan text projects as the ''end date'' of the Mayan calendar (whatever that may mean for the world at large), Harold Rosenbaum, his excellent professional choir and the Orchestra of St. Luke's propose to pick up the pieces with a performance of Haydn's great oratorio ''The Creation.'' Haydn's resounding C major burst of light can undoubtedly be counted on to set the cosmos aright once again. Dec. 21. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'MARIA STUARDA' Another New Year's Eve, another starring role for the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato at the Met. Last year Ms. DiDonato led a sterling cast in the Baroque pastiche ''The Enchanted Island.'' Now she takes on the diva role of the embittered Mary Stuart in Donizetti's riveting melodrama, part of that composer's trilogy of operas based, however loosely, on the lives of Tudor queens. The Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, had originally intended for all three of the operas to be directed by David McVicar and to star the soprano Anna Netrebko; Mr. McVicar is still on for ''Maria Stuarda'' and the third, ''Roberto Devereux,'' next season, but Ms. Netrebko decided that ''Anna Bolena'' was it for her, clearing the way for Ms. DiDonato. She will be joined by a cast of rising stars: Elza van den Heever (as Mary's rival, Elizabeth), Francesco Meli, Joshua Hopkins and Matthew Rose. Maurizio Benini conducts. Opens Dec. 31. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
JANUARY
GREEN MOUNTAIN PROJECT The soprano Jolle Greenleaf and the violinist and conductor Scott Metcalfe have made Monteverdi a welcome fixture of the new year in New York. In 2010 and 2011, they presented the towering 1610 Vespers, and this year they produced a 1640 Vespers, something of a pastiche. Now it is back to 1610 and back to the church where it all began. A happy new year indeed. Jan. 2-3. Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (646) 470-5809, tenetnyc.com. (J.R.O.)
PROTOTYPE: OPERA/THEATER/NOW Though New York City Opera's Vox Festival will continue this year, albeit curtailed in size and scope, as a laboratory for new operas, this new festival aims to add to the city's range of performances of contemporary work. Organized by Here Arts Center in SoHo and Beth Morrison, an adventurous arts presenter, the two weeks will feature a commissioned premiere -- ''Sumeida's Song,'' by the rising young composer Mohammed Fairouz -- as well as David T. Little's ''Soldier Songs,'' directed by Yuval Sharon, and other readings, presentations, concerts and panels. Jan. 9-19. Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, (212) 352-3101, prototypefestival.org. (Z.W.)
BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA There are few better marriages of conductor and orchestra than Ivan Fischer and his alert, exciting ensemble. Frequent guests of Lincoln Center, they come this year with a varied program: Shostakovich's ''Suite for Variety Orchestra,'' Bernstein's ''Serenade'' (based on Plato's ''Symposium'' and featuring the violinist Janine Jansen) and Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2. Jan. 20. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
'DOUBT' Reeling from the recession, opera companies across America are playing it safe. But the Minnesota Opera -- which has, in Minneapolis and St. Paul, communities used to adventurous culture -- continues to program new work and thoughtful, theatrical productions of the classics. Next year brings this major commission composed by Douglas J. Cuomo, with a libretto by John Patrick Shanley, based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The cast features the huge-voiced soprano Christine Brewer, in one of her too-rare operatic turns, as well as Denyce Graves, Matthew Worth and Adriana Zabala. Christopher Franklin conducts, and Kevin Newbury directs. Opens Jan. 26. Minnesota Opera, Ordway, St. Paul, (612) 333-6669, mnopera.org. (Z.W.)
'RIGOLETTO' This one might cause a ruckus. For his Metropolitan Opera debut, the director Michael Mayer (Broadway's ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' and ''Spring Awakening'') places Verdi's great opera in Rat Pack-era Las Vegas, with a set by Christine Jones and the Duke cast as a sleazy Sinatra-type entertainer. Met audiences have tended to be doubtful about such updatings, but the previous production, from 1989, never inspired much affection, and if anyone can sell a difficult concept it is the excellent opening-night cast: the soprano Diana Damrau, the tenor Piotr Beczala and the baritone Zeljko Lucic. (Lisette Oropesa, Vittorio Grigolo and George Gagnidze take over later in the run.) Opens Jan. 28. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
MARC-ANDRÉ HAMELIN Everything this pianist plays, he plays well. And it's a good thing, since he plays almost everything. He began his career exploring the virtuosic fringes of the repertory and has gradually moved toward the center. His program here ranges from Bach to Mr. Hamelin's own Variations on a Theme by Paganini (in its New York premiere) and also includes works by Debussy, Rachmaninoff and Busoni. Jan. 30. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
WEST-EASTERN DIVAN ORCHESTRA Daniel Barenboim performing Beethoven at Carnegie is nothing new. But this time he brings his orchestra of young Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs to play all the symphonies. There is little in the sound of their recently released recordings of the works that would make you sense either youth or diversity. Seeing them in action should be a different matter, Jan. 30-31, Feb 2-3, Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
OPERA LAFAYETTE Sometimes this intrepid company's wanderings through the thickets of the French operatic repertory can yield great pleasures, and sometimes they remind you that there are reasons obscurities are obscure. Ah, but life's a crap shoot like that. Will ''Lalla Roukh,'' an Orientalist fantasia by Félicien David that wowed the Opéra Comique in 1862, hold up today as any more than a curiosity? We shall see. In any case, Ryan Brown's conducting is always spirited, and the production, by Bernard Deletré, incorporates the acclaimed Indian-dance troupe Kalanidhi Dance. Jan. 31. Rose Theater. (Z.W.)
FEBRUARY
OSVALDO GOLIJOV Mr. Golijov is Carnegie Hall's composer in residence this season, and a concert in its Making Music series, which offers commentary from composers as well as their music, could offer fascinating insights if the right questions are asked and answered. It is a chance to explore the methodology of a composer whose acquisitive methods have recently been called into question, to the point that some have accused him of plagiarism. The program, performed by the St. Lawrence String Quartet, the Zankel Band and others, includes the New York premiere of Mr. Golijov's ''Qohelet'' (more widely known under the spelling ''Koholet''), a Carnegie co-commission and one of the works that was challenged. Mr. Golijov altered it as a result. So what is the whole story? Feb. 4. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S It was a significant coup for this ensemble, excellent though it is, to secure the fast-rising Pablo Heras-Casado as its new principal conductor. He leads the orchestra for the first time at Carnegie Hall since his appointment in a program of the central repertory: Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture, Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 (with Christian Zacharias as soloist), Hans Zender's orchestrations of five Debussy preludes and the lighter, leaner 1841 version of Schumann's Fourth Symphony. All these are distant from the Baroque and new music in which Mr. Heras-Casado has long specialized. The orchestra has bet that his charisma and energy will outweigh his relative inexperience; it may be good for both him and the band that he will get to work with these fine players to refine his interpretations of the standards. Feb. 7. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA Mariss Jansons -- the principal conductor of both this ensemble and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and thus a regular commuter between Amsterdam and Munich -- turns 70 in January and seems to have emerged from several health crises of recent decades in fine fettle. Oh, he may still suffer from jet lag, but he certainly doesn't seem fazed. He takes the Bavarians to Tokyo to perform all the Beethoven symphonies in late November. Here he presents good variety in programs well gauged to show off this great orchestra's and Mr. Jansons's own versatility: in one, Bartok's Second Violin Concerto, with Leonidas Kavakos as soloist, and Mahler's First Symphony; in the other, Strauss's ''Death and Transfiguration'' (Mr. Jansons may feel that he has lived it) and Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. Feb. 13-14. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'PARSIFAL' Appearing a bit earlier than its traditional place around the Easter season, Wagner's final and perhaps deepest music drama arrives in New York in a new production by François Girard after a practice run at the Lyon Opera, where its scenic requirements -- a stage-filling sea of blood, for one thing -- strained the company's technical capabilities to the breaking point. Presumably those challenges will be a walk in the park for a Met recently tested by the mechanical headaches of Robert Lepage's Wagner ''Ring'' cycle. And blood aside, the house is fielding a remarkably strong cast: Jonas Kaufmann, seemingly born for the title role, as well as Katarina Dalayman, Peter Mattei, René Pape and Evgeny Nikitin, making his first New York appearance since his withdrawal from the Bayreuth Festival after the bizarre discovery that one of his tattoos resembled, at one point, a swastika. Daniele Gatti's deliberate, expansive take on the opera has polarized audiences in the past, but a little more time spent with singers of this quality wouldn't be too bad a fate. Opens Feb. 15. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'POWDER HER FACE' It's a sign of the composer Thomas Adès's rise to the top of his field that both his operas are being performed in New York this season. The Met's production of his sweeping version of ''The Tempest,'' opening in October, will doubtless grab more attention, but the chamber work ''Powder Her Face,'' about a 1960s sex scandal involving the Duchess of Argyll, has raunchily intimate charm. It's an opera that in content and scale wouldn't make much sense at the Met, so it's an ideal opening act for a New York City Opera, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two of its four productions, that is trying to define itself artistically after a listless last season. Jay Scheib directs; Jonathan Stockhammer, a specialist in contemporary opera, conducts. Opens Feb. 15. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. (Z.W.)
'DON CARLO' When Lorin Maazel returned to the Met podium for a run of Wagner's ''Walküre'' in 2008 it was the first time he had conducted at the company since the early 1960s. It's a far smaller gap this time, as he leads Verdi's dark masterpiece and an experienced cast that includes Barbara Frittoli, Anna Smirnova, Ramón Vargas, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Eric Halfvarson and Ferruccio Furlanetto, who scored a personal coup as Philip II when Nicholas Hytner's production was new in 2010. Opens Feb. 22. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'RADAMISTO' Harry Bicket has that rarest and best of gifts for an early-music specialist: the ability to make regular opera orchestras play with the snap of a period-instrument band. But there is still something special that happens when he leads his own English Concert, which will be joined for one of Handel's lesser-known masterworks by a fine cast that includes the veteran countertenor David Daniels, Brenda Rae, Patricia Bardon, Joélle Harvey and Luca Pisaroni. It is the first in a series of concert performances of Baroque operas at the hall by Mr. Bicket and the ensemble in coming seasons, so there's much to look forward to. Feb. 24. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
'THE TURN OF THE SCREW' The New York City Opera finally has the right idea. This beleaguered company has learned that it's a losing battle to go head to head with the Met in terms of repertory and production style, and smarter to compete with the city's smaller, more nimble companies. To that end, it is opening its season with two intimate-scale operas that would have been naturals from, say, Gotham Chamber Opera: Thomas Adès's ''Powder Her Face'' and this intensely creepy work by Britten, both performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The conductor is the versatile Jayce Ogren; the director is Sam Buntrock, whose Broadway production of ''Sunday in the Park With George'' used lighting and projections with fluid ease. The cast had not been announced at press time. Opens Feb. 24. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. (Z.W.)
MARCH
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Happiness is conducting two of the world's greatest orchestras at Carnegie Hall in one season. Franz Welser-Möst, having dropped in with his own Cleveland Orchestra in November, now leads an orchestra that -- though proudly independent -- is his in another sense, he being Austrian. The three programs include symphonies by Dvorak (No. 7), Schubert (No. 6) and Bruckner (No. 4); songs by Richard Strauss, sung by the tenor Herbert Lippert; Berg's Violin Concerto, played by Frank Peter Zimmermann; and a work by the contemporary German Jörg Widmann. March 1-3. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
JENNIFER KOH You may see Ms. Koh early in the season, since she is enacting the frizzy-haired, fiddle-playing title character of Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's ''Einstein on the Beach'' in some performances (Sept. 14-16) of the Brooklyn Academy production. Here, in the second installment of her three-part multiyear series Bach and Beyond, she occupies the stage alone and presumably without fright wig, playing solo violin works by Bartok and Phil Kline, in addition to Bach. (A recording of the first part is to be released in October by Cedille Records.) March 2. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
'FRANCESCA DA RIMINI' The Met reserves runs of Riccardo Zandonai's infectiously dramatic verismo rarity for divas it really believes in. It was last mounted in the 1980s for Renata Scotto, and this new revival is a major endorsement of the soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek, a favorite in London whose New York career is just getting started. (She also joins the Met Orchestra for Wagner's ''Wesendonck Lieder'' at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 14.) Her co-star, the tenor Marcello Giordani, is ardent but inconsistent, two adjectives that also apply to the conductor, Marco Armiliato. But when Ms. Westbroek is in her groove, she is as thrilling as large stretches of Zandonai's score. Opens March 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
THE BACH VARIATIONS The early-music specialist Masaaki Suzuki and his Bach Collegium Japan and Yale Schola Cantorum join the New York Philharmonic in opening its monthlong festival. The program is built on a lovely idea, juxtaposing works by Bach with near counterparts by his great revivalist, Mendelssohn. (From each comes a Magnificat in D.) March 6-9. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'LA PASIÓN SEGÚN SAN MARCOS' As a sort of belated appendage to its festival Voices From Latin America, Carnegie Hall devotes its choral institute this season to Osvaldo Golijov's magnum opus. In the culminating performance, Robert Spano conducts the Orquesta la Pasión, members of the Schola Cantorum de Venezuela and choruses from area high schools. March 10. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Lincoln Center's Great Performers series, having presented the London Symphony and the Philharmonia Orchestra in the fall, completes its minifestival of major London orchestras. Vladimir Jurowski, the orchestra's principal conductor, presents two programs: first Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1, with Vadim Repin as soloist, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 5; then Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4, with Hélène Grimaud as soloist, and Mahler's Symphony No. 5. March 10-11. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
MASS IN B MINOR Happily, major American orchestras have been rediscovering Bach and the Baroque, having largely conceded that repertory to early-music specialists for several decades. The New York Philharmonic had a leg up with Kurt Masur as its music director through the 1990s. Coming from a long tenure in Leipzig, Germany, where Bach spent his last 27 years, Mr. Masur brought Bach's major choral works to the orchestra with some regularity and in 1998 even imported the choir of St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, which Bach had directed, for a ''St. Matthew Passion.'' It is good to see Alan Gilbert pick up the mantle here as part of a major Philharmonic series, the Bach Variations, with the New York Choral Artists and stellar vocal soloists: Dorothea Röschmann, Anne Sofie von Otter, Steve Davislim and Eric Owens. March 13-16. Avery Fisher Hall. (J.R.O.)
'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' This season Renée Fleming has a coveted Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, for which she has programmed two recitals, including a battle of the divas alongside the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, and a concert with the New York Philharmonic. But the centerpiece is a semistaged concert performance of this gauzily lyrical André Previn opera, with Blanche DuBois created as a vehicle for Ms. Fleming, first performed in 1998. The work hasn't been heard much since, though it is being revived on March 26 at Lyric Opera of Chicago, where Ms. Fleming is the creative consultant. The Carnegie performance, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's under Patrick Summers, is a test run of sorts for that Chicago stand, featuring the same excellent supporting cast: Susanna Phillips, Teddy Tahu Rhodes and Anthony Dean Griffey. March 14. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY After this gloriously adventurous ensemble's American Mavericks festival last year at Carnegie Hall, which featured work from some of the out-there corners of the repertory, it will be a fascinating shift to hear it in the standards, in which the orchestra and its music director, Michael Tilson Thomas, also shine. The first night's program pairs Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 (with the brilliant Yuja Wang as soloist) and Brahms's First Symphony with the New York premiere of a work by Samuel Carl Adams, and the second concert features the Ninth Symphony of Mahler, a Thomas favorite. March 20-21. Carnegie Hall. (Z.W.)
CARTER BREY New York Philharmonic audiences have been blessed, hearing Mr. Brey regularly since he became the orchestra's principal cellist in 1996. But the pleasure has been mixed, because he had to cut back sharply on his solo career to do it. In a substantial bit of payback, the Philharmonic puts Mr. Brey forward to perform Bach's six unaccompanied cello suites as part of its Bach Variations festival. Expect him to shine. March 27. Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, 65th Street and Central Park West, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org. (J.R.O.)
LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC At its premiere in Los Angeles in May, John Adams's oratorio ''The Gospel According to the Other Mary'' badly lagged dramatically, but many moments of its protean, searching score showed a mature composer at the height of his powers. The Philharmonic and its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, bring the work to New York with the same excellent soloists -- Tamara Mumford, Kelley O'Connor and Russell Thomas -- and a new element: a staging by the theater artist Peter Sellars, who collaborated with Mr. Adams on the libretto. The next evening's concert features Claude Vivier's ''Zipangu,'' for strings, ''La Mer'' by Debussy and Stravinsky's ''Firebird,'' the kind of vividly dramatic work at which Mr. Dudamel excels. March 27-28. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' Ivan Fischer's conducting appearances in New York invariably yield fine performances, but in recent years they have also become genuine events. In 2010 Mr. Fischer presented all the Beethoven symphonies, half on period instruments, half on modern; in 2011 he offered Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' in his own staging; and in April he led Mozart's Requiem with choristers intermingled among the orchestra to give the players a better feel for the text. Bach's great Passion is to be sure an event in itself, and no unusual twists have been announced -- yet. Mr. Fischer conducts Musica Sacra and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, with soloists including Dominique Labelle, John Tessier and Hanno Müller-Brachmann. March 28. Carnegie Hall. (In other notable performances of the ''St. Matthew Passion,'' John Scott conducts the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and Concert Royal at St. Thomas Church on March 21, and Julian Wachner conducts the Trinity Choir and Baroque Orchestra at Trinity Church on March 24.) (J.R.O.)
APRILIt is
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In all the rampant speculation about who might succeed James Levine as the orchestra's music director, the name Daniele Gatti seems to have receded. Mr. Gatti is a gifted and experienced maestro in midcareer and seems not to be overcommitted by the standards of conductors today, despite major posts at the Orchestre National de France and the Zurich Opera. In this series, after a mixed program conducted by Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos, a veteran who has given the orchestra yeoman service during its transition, the second and third programs are conducted by Mr. Gatti. Though there is no reason to expect anything but excellent performances, it will be hard not to wonder what Mr. Levine might have done with Mahler's Third Symphony, one of his great specialties, this time around in the second program, or what he might have made of the third, all Wagner. Certainly, on each of these terrains, Mr. Gatti will be held to the highest standard, by orchestra and public alike. April 3-5. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'GIULIO CESARE' It's tough being the final new Met production of the year. With everyone exhausted and attention flagging, you tend, like Rodney Dangerfield, to get no respect. It doesn't help that David McVicar's version of this Handel masterpiece, which puts a colorful colonial-era, Neo-Classical spin on the ancient Egyptian setting, has already been captured on DVD. But the Met's cast -- David Daniels in the title role, Natalie Dessay as Cleopatra and the excellent Alice Coote as Sesto -- is of interest, and the conductor, Harry Bicket, is a pro at this repertory. The Met orchestra plays its heart out for him. Opens April 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'GESUALDO REFLECTIONS' The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is best known for the classics; its concerts are the place to go when you want a Beethoven quartet played with dependable polish. But the society also has a relatively unheralded, consistently creative and excellent new-music series in Lincoln Center's intimate Kaplan Penthouse. The highlight, though it doesn't take place at the penthouse, is a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the birth of the brilliant and murderous composer Carlo Gesualdo featuring the Antioch Chamber Ensemble, the pianist Soyeon Kate Lee and the Brentano String Quartet. In keeping with Gesualdo's experimental music, centuries ahead of its time, the program juxtaposes his work with 21st-century responses -- by Bruce Adolphe, Brett Dean, David Gompper and Wolfgang Rihm -- for various chamber forces. April 4. Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org. (Z.W.)
'DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN' There will be a degree of deja vu as the Met brings back Robert Lepage's version of Wagner's epic masterpiece for the first time as a piece of the repertory, after the rollout of the full cycle last season. For the three cycles Deborah Voigt and Katarina Dalayman still alternate as Brünnhilde; Jay Hunter Morris's bright-voiced Siegfried still gets his turn, as does Hans-Peter König's memorably rich Hagen; and the enormous planks of Mr. Lepage's machine still rotate impassively. The question will be whether and how the spectacle suffers without the intensity provided by some of last season's stars: Bryn Terfel, Jonas Kaufmann, Eva-Maria Westbroek and Waltraud Meier. Fabio Luisi conducts. Cycles open on April 6 and 25 and May 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
'MOSÈ IN EGITTO' Rossini's serious operas still don't receive the productions they deserve; they are long and not easy to cast. But they have irresistible grandeur. Now the New York City Opera offers a super-rare staging of the Italian original at City Center, the company's original home. The production is directed by Michael Counts, the visually eclectic creator of City Opera's ''Monodramas'' evening; we'll see how he handles the climactic parting of the Red Sea. (Projections, credited to Ada Whitney/Beehive, will presumably play a role.) Jayce Ogren, City Opera's man for all seasons, conducts. Opens April 14. New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
DRESDEN STAATSKAPELLE It will be fascinating to catch up with this orchestra and itsprincipal conductor, Christian Thielemann, in view of the jockeying for power going on at European festivals. After Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic announced that they would leave the Salzburg Easter Festival next spring in favor of an event in Baden-Baden, Germany, Mr. Thielemann and the Staatskapelle were quick to move in. The Berlin Philharmonic sounded in splendid shape at Carnegie in February, and this season, just weeks after that Salzburg appearance, it is the Staatskapelle's turn in programs of Brahms (''Academic Festival Overture''; Violin Concerto, with Lisa Batiashvili as soloist; Symphony No. 4) and Bruckner (Symphony No. 8). April 17, 19. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
'TRISTAN UND ISOLDE' The acclaimed Swedish dramatic soprano Nina Stemme, who set Carnegie Hall ablaze as Strauss's Salome with Franz Welser-Möst and the Cleveland Orchestra in May, has said that her way in life is ''to hurry slowly.'' She has held back in establishing a career in the United States, and she will take up Wagner's Isolde at the Met only in the 2016-17 season. American Wagnerites will undoubtedly flock to Houston to hear her do it sooner. Ben Heppner is scheduled to sing Tristan, but you may recall that he gave the Met fits in the role in 2008, claiming illness and showing up for only the last of six planned performances. Christof Loy directs, and Patrick Summers conducts. If it all comes together, it should be worth the trip. Opens April 18. Houston Grand Opera, Wortham Center, (713) 228-6737, houstongrandopera.org. (J.R.O.)
'LA PÉRICHOLE' Christopher Alden's dreamlike production of Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte'' was the bright spot in the New York City Opera's uninspired last season, the latest in a series of memorable shows the director has made for the company in recent years. He now turns his attention to a seemingly unlikely work: this farcical operetta by Offenbach about a Peruvian street singer who triangulates between her true love and a Spanish official. (Another frothy opera, Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus,'' is also on Mr. Alden's agenda this year, with a production opening in October at the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto.) Mr. Alden has a gift for bringing out the darkness and sophistication in the unlikeliest of places and pieces. Opens April 21. New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com. (Z.W.)
'WAR REQUIEM' Of the many commemorations of Benjamin Britten's centennial here in 2013, this performance of a consummate masterpiece, a pacifist statement mingling the text of the Requiem Mass with poetry of Wilfred Owen, will undoubtedly be one of the more imposing, with Kent Tritle conducting the 200-voice Oratorio Society of New York, itself celebrating its 140th anniversary. The vocal soloists are the excellent Emalie Savoy, soprano; John Matthew Myers, tenor; and Jesse Blumberg, baritone. April 22. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
SWEDISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA New York admirers of the Swedish soprano Nina Stemme who cannot catch that ''Tristan und Isolde'' in Houston must content themselves with this catchall concert, in which she will perform songs of Berlioz, Brahms, Wagner, Grieg, Sibelius, Strauss and Weill. In addition, Thomas Dausgaard conducts the fine ensemble in works or parts of works by Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Elgar, Sibelius and Ravel. April 25. Alice Tully Hall. (J.R.O.)
STRAVINSKY SACRED WORKS Julian Wachner continues his emphasis on more or less contemporary fare this season with the Trinity Choir and Novus NY devoting a weekend to the complete sacred works by a restless master. Stravinsky essentially announced modernism in music with his ''Rite of Spring'' in 1913, then looked back over his shoulder with a Neo-Classicism largely of his own invention and finally found his way to the spare, serialist aesthetic that dominates in many of the works here. Rightly, the majestic ''Symphony of Psalms'' crowns the affair. April 26-27 at Trinity Church. April 28 at St. Paul's Chapel. (J.R.O.)
YALE IN NEW YORK This four-concert series concludes with a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Paul Hindemith, ''Prankster and Master'': a Yale professor for the 13 years before his death and an astonishingly prolific composer and champion of useful music (Gebrauchsmusik) most of whose works have largely fallen into disuse. The current faculty members Boris Berman, pianist, and Ettore Causa, violist, and members of the Yale Philharmonia perform works of Hindemith including the sure-to-be-immortal ''Overture to 'The Flying Dutchman' as Played at Sight by a Second-Rate Concert Orchestra at the Village Well at 7 O'Clock in the Morning,'' for string quartet. April 28. Zankel Hall. (J.R.O.)
MAY
'DIALOGUES DES CARMÉLITES' Some critics, including Anthony Tommasini in The New York Times, have called for the Met to appoint a director of productions, who would work with the general manager, Peter Gelb, and the music director, whoever that may be, to plot the company's theatrical direction. (S0 far Mr. Gelb has resisted the idea.) The last time something like that happened was when John Dexter filled the position in the late 1970s and early '80s. Audiences are periodically reminded of that brief golden age for theater at the Met when Dexter's productions are revived; though more than 30 years old, their elegance and intelligence shine through, as in his spectacular yet subtle take on Britten's ''Billy Budd,'' performed last season. One of Dexter's finest shows was his ''Dialogues des Carmélites,'' as unadorned and inspired as Poulenc's score. This revival has a fine cast, including Isabel Leonard, Patricia Racette, Erin Morley, Elizabeth Bishop and Paul Appleby, conducted by Louis Langrée. Opens May 4. Metropolitan Opera House. (Z.W.)
EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK The fascinating program ''London's Musical Bridge: The Enlightened English'' pairs works by 18th-century native English composers with counterparts by Germans who had settled in London: thus, suites by John Avison and Handel, overtures by William Boyce and Johann Christian Bach, and sinfonias by Thomas Arne and Frederick William Herschel. Herschel, in his day job as astronomer, discovered the planet Uranus: enlightened indeed. May 4. First Church of Christ, Scientist, Central Park West at 68th Street, (212) 280-0330. earlymusicny.org. (J.R.O.)
SPRING FOR MUSIC This annual festival of North American orchestras, conceived by top music professionals to encourage and reward adventurous programming, has in its first two seasons effectively filled what it has shown to be a valuable niche: giving Carnegie Hall-exposure to ensembles showing initiative, several of which might otherwise never have found their way there. Carlos Kalmar and the Oregon Symphony -- who made the biggest splash in 2011 with a program they have since recorded for the Pentatone label, ''Music for a Time of War'' -- present a wide-ranging collection of works by Schubert, Ravel, Schoenberg, Kurt Weill and the Thai composer Narong Prangcharoen (May 9). Also returning to the festival, which mandates a year off between appearances, are David Alan Miller and the Albany Symphony Orchestra, who presented a program centered on spirituals in 2011 and now play another American program, with works by Gershwin, Morton Gould and John Harbison (May 7). In addition, Marin Alsop conducts the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra; JoAnn Falletta, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra; Leonard Slatkin, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra; and Christoph Eschenbach, the National Symphony Orchestra. May 6-11. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
DETROIT SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA To single out the oddest of the Spring for Music programs: Leonard Slatkin conducts Ives's Symphonies Nos. 1 through 4, a notion utterly logical on its surface yet, given the ear-twisting complexities in much of the music, utterly bizarre. Not even counting however many intermissions and stage changes, the program runs well over two hours. But will Mr. Slatkin be able to resist adding an encore: say, Ives's attempt at a monster sequel, the ''Universe Symphony,'' which the Nashville Symphony performed in the completion by Larry Austin at Spring for Music this year? May 10. Carnegie Hall. (J.R.O.)
TOKYO STRING QUARTET Though the personnel has shifted in recent years, it was still quite a brand, established over 43 years of excellent performance (and kudos to Kazuhide Isomura, the violist, who saw it all). Now the quartet has decided to quit while still near the top. It has picked excellent collaborative works to go out with, both in this concert (Schubert's resolutely sunny String Quintet, with the cellist Lynn Harrell) and in its penultimate recording (Brahms's late, mellow Clarinet Quintet, with the clarinetist Jon Manasse), to be released by Harmonia Mundi in November. But the quartet takes final leave on its own, both here on stage, with works by Haydn and Bartok (the Sixth Quartet, his last), and on disc, with works of Dvorak and Smetana, scheduled for release in 2013. May 11. 92nd Street Y. (J.R.O.)
'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' Looking around and noting the decided paucity of quality opera in its city, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, never an ensemble to rest on its laurels, is improbably turning itself into a de facto opera company. It is focusing on new and recent works but also unveiling a series of staged performances of Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte's three classic operas, conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and featuring sets and costumes by noted architects and fashion designers. Last year ''Don Giovanni'' was promising, but the logistics, with the orchestra far above and behind the singers, were a work in progress. For this year's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' the setup will be adjusted for a production designed by Jean Nouvel and Azzedine Alaïa and starring Christopher Maltmann and Dorothea Röschmann. May 17, 19, 23, 25. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com. (Z.W.)
'GILBERT'S PLAYLIST' If four programs in May and June are being put forward as Alan Gilbert's playlist, you have to wonder what that implies about the rest of his season with the New York Philharmonic. Rote? Required? But questions about the marketing strategy don't detract from the quality and creativity of the work he is offering under that unfortunate title. First come jazz-inflected works by Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Copland and Wynton Marsalis, played alongside the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, then Dallapiccola's stark one-act opera ''Il Prigioniero'' (featuring Gerald Finley and Patricia Racette), sharing a bill with Lisa Batiashvili in Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1. Mr. Gilbert offers his new arrangement of Wagner, ''A Ring Journey,'' with Christopher Rouse's ''Seeing,'' featuring the pianist Emanuel Ax. Finally, to close the season, Doug Fitch, who has collaborated with Mr. Gilbert and the orchestra in recent seasons, directs and designs an evening of Stravinsky ballets (''The Fairy's Kiss'' and ''Petrouchka'') with Karole Armitage creating choreography for the New York City Ballet dancer Sara Mearns. May 31-June 29. Avery Fisher Hall. (Z.W.)
JUNE
STOKOWSKI CELEBRATION Now the gloves are off. Mr. Nézet-Séguin, for all practical purposes, embodies Stokowski, as the Philadelphia Orchestra returns to its treasured but acoustically flawed old home, the Academy of Music. In three days of intensive programming, he conducts Brahms's First Symphony and Dvorak's Ninth, Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade'' and works by Ippolitov-Ivanov and Wagner, an audience-choice program and repertory from the animated Disney film ''Fantasia.''

EMBERS OF WARThe Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam
By Fredrik LogevallIllustrated. 839 pp. Random House. $40.
During the Casablanca conference in January 1943, Franklin Roosevelt spoke bitterly to his son about European imperialism: ''Don't think for a moment, Elliott, that Americans would be dying in the Pacific tonight if it hadn't been for the shortsighted greed of the French and the British and the Dutch.'' Earlier, he had spoken openly to the White House correspondents: ''There has never been, there isn't now and there never will be, any race of people on earth fit to serve as masters over their fellow men. . . . We believe that any nationality, no matter how small, has the inherent right to its own nationhood.'' That was the core of the Atlantic Charter in 1941, which both Churchill and Roosevelt signed. It called on ''the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.'' 
Four years later, with the war over and Roosevelt dead, the new president entered office knowing little about how his predecessor saw the future of the world. Harry Truman ignored the anticolonial passages of the Atlantic Charter (just as Churchill did) and supported the continuation of imperialism among the great powers -- a decision that helped the French government to restore its hold on the empire. That included its lost colony: Vietnam. Over time, that decision led to what George F. Kennan once called ''the most disastrous of all America's undertakings over the whole 200 years of its history.''
Fredrik Logevall's excellent book ''Choosing War'' (1999) chronicled the American escalation of the Vietnam War in the early 1960s. With ''Embers of War,'' he has written an even more impressive book about the French conflict in Vietnam and the beginning of the American one -- from the end of World War II to the beginning of the second Vietnam War in 1959. It is the most comprehensive history of that time. Logevall, a professor of history at Cornell University, has drawn from many years of previous scholarship as well as his own. And he has produced a powerful portrait of the terrible and futile French war from which Americans learned little as they moved toward their own engagement in Vietnam.
Logevall begins with the efforts of Ho Chi Minh, who spent his life trying to bring independence to his country. He fought alongside Americans in the battle against Japan during World War II, and he hoped to build an independent Vietnamese nation with American support. But since Ho's Viet Minh party was both nationalist and Communist, American support in the deepening cold war was impossible. By 1946, Ho was already planning for a war to drive the French out. But the weak and frequently changing French governments had other ideas. They set out to restore Vietnam as a colony of France, and they did so with the financial help of the United States. The French insisted that without Vietnam their economy would collapse. But they wanted more than money. They wanted to secure what they considered the greatness of ''eternal France,'' which included its colonial enterprises.
The French campaign was a long and ugly conflict that lasted almost a decade. It reached its apex in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu, a remote area surrounded by hills in the North, where the French believed they could ''withstand any kind of attack the Viet Minh are capable of launching.'' The long siege of Dien Bien Phu could have gone either way, but the French underestimated the power of the Viet Minh and lost. By the end, 110,000 French troops were dead -- about twice the number of American deaths in the second Vietnam War. Approximately 200,000 Viet Minh soldiers were killed, along with 125,000 civilians. By 1955, the French had left Vietnam for good, abandoning what they had once considered the jewel of their empire.
Logevall is not only skilled at describing the war. He is also adept at explaining the diplomacy of Vietnam during the 1950s. There was internal disagreement during the Geneva Conference of 1954 about what role the United States should play once the French left. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (who participated in the convention only briefly) believed that America should take the place of the French and continue the war. But Eisenhower, who understood what battle was like, refused to send American troops into Vietnam. Instead, he agreed with others at the Geneva Conference to partition the country -- leaving the North under the government of Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh, and the South under Ngo Dinh Diem, an aristocratic Catholic who hoped to create a Western regime with strong ties to the United States. In 1956, there were to be elections to reunite the country under a single government -- elections that never took place.
In the meantime, each side would withdraw its troops from the territory of the other. But both sides could leave behind their supporters to work (presumably peacefully) for victory in the coming elections. That meant that while the Viet Minh had to remove its troops from the South, it did not have to take out its ''cadres,'' its cells of political supporters. They would soon become the guerrilla soldiers who began attacks on the Diem regime.
Eisenhower has long been admired for his refusal to go to war in Vietnam. But Logevall makes clear that he was far from a peacekeeper. He did not want to send American troops into Vietnam, but he was also determined not to allow South Vietnam to fall. For a time, Diem seemed a powerful and successful leader, able to stop any efforts by the Viet Minh to conquer the South. And for a time, Diem was a hero to Americans -- revered by leaders in Washington and by much of the American public. But the more success he had, the more resolved Ho was to undermine him. By 1959, Viet Minh soldiers were infiltrating the South and escalating the violence in South Vietnam. When Eisenhower left office, there were about 1,000 American ''advisers'' (almost all of them military men), with many more to come.
North Vietnam's goal of uniting the nation faced obstacles of its own. It was hampered by Ho's harsh and unpopular land reform, which he ultimately abandoned. It was damaged by the many Northerners who fled -- among them Vietnamese Catholics -- fearing they would be persecuted if they stayed. Even so, the Viet Minh continued, slowly and cautiously, to create a military in the South that would fight against the most powerful nation in the world. As early as 1957, while Diem was still popular, reporters discovered that 452 village officials had died in one year, assassinated by Viet Minh leaders who took charge in their place. It was only the beginning of the unraveling of the South.
Bernard Fall -- a highly respected historian of the struggle over Vietnam -- once commented on the futility of the two wars. The Americans, he said, were ''dreaming different dreams than the French but walking in the same footsteps.'' In 1959, there weren't many in Washington who imagined they would make the same mistakes the French had made. For a time the Americans believed they could stabilize the new South Vietnam. But only a few years later, they slowly began to realize that they were entering their own quagmire.

HEADLINE: The Weatherman Is Not a Moron

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
From the inside, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction looked like a cross between a submarine command center and a Goldman Sachs trading floor. Twenty minutes outside Washington, it consisted mainly of sleek workstations manned by meteorologists working an armada of flat-screen monitors with maps of every conceivable type of weather data for every corner of the country. The center is part of the National Weather Service, which Ulysses S. Grant created under the War Department. Even now, it remains true to those roots. Many of its meteorologists have a background in the armed services, and virtually all speak with the precision of former officers. 
They also seem to possess a high-frequency-trader's skill for managing risk. Expert meteorologists are forced to arbitrage a torrent of information to make their predictions as accurate as possible. After receiving weather forecasts generated by supercomputers, they interpret and parse them by, among other things, comparing them with various conflicting models or what their colleagues are seeing in the field or what they already know about certain weather patterns -- or, often, all of the above. From station to station, I watched as meteorologists sifted through numbers and called other forecasters to compare notes, while trading instant messages about matters like whether the chance of rain in Tucson should be 10 or 20 percent. As the information continued to flow in, I watched them draw on their maps with light pens, painstakingly adjusting the contours of temperature gradients produced by the computers -- 15 miles westward over the Mississippi Delta or 30 miles northward into Lake Erie -- in order to bring them one step closer to accuracy.
These meteorologists are dealing with a small fraction of the 2.5 quintillion bytes of information that, I.B.M. estimates, we generate each day. That's the equivalent of the entire printed collection of the Library of Congress about three times per second. Google now accesses more than 20 billion Web pages a day; the processing speed of an iPad rivals that of last generation's most powerful supercomputers. All that information ought to help us plan our lives and profitably predict the world's course. In 2008, Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired magazine, wrote optimistically of the era of Big Data. So voluminous were our databases and so powerful were our computers, he claimed, that there was no longer much need for theory, or even the scientific method. At the time, it was hard to disagree.
But if prediction is the truest way to put our information to the test, we have not scored well. In November 2007, economists in the Survey of Professional Forecasters -- examining some 45,000 economic-data series -- foresaw less than a 1-in-500 chance of an economic meltdown as severe as the one that would begin one month later. Attempts to predict earthquakes have continued to envisage disasters that never happened and failed to prepare us for those, like the 2011 disaster in Japan, that did.
The one area in which our predictions are making extraordinary progress, however, is perhaps the most unlikely field. Jim Hoke, a director with 32 years experience at the National Weather Service, has heard all the jokes about weather forecasting, like Larry David's jab on ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' that weathermen merely forecast rain to keep everyone else off the golf course. And to be sure, these slick-haired and/or short-skirted local weather forecasters are sometimes wrong. A study of TV meteorologists in Kansas City found that when they said there was a 100 percent chance of rain, it failed to rain at all one-third of the time.
But watching the local news is not the best way to assess the growing accuracy of forecasting (more on this later). It's better to take the long view. In 1972, the service's high-temperature forecast missed by an average of six degrees when made three days in advance. Now it's down to three degrees. More stunning, in 1940, the chance of an American being killed by lightning was about 1 in 400,000. Today it's 1 in 11 million. This is partly because of changes in living patterns (more of our work is done indoors), but it's also because better weather forecasts have helped us prepare.
Perhaps the most impressive gains have been in hurricane forecasting. Just 25 years ago, when the National Hurricane Center tried to predict where a hurricane would hit three days in advance of landfall, it missed by an average of 350 miles. If Hurricane Isaac, which made its unpredictable path through the Gulf of Mexico last month, had occurred in the late 1980s, the center might have projected landfall anywhere from Houston to Tallahassee, canceling untold thousands of business deals, flights and picnics in between -- and damaging its reputation when the hurricane zeroed in hundreds of miles away. Now the average miss is only about 100 miles.
Why are weather forecasters succeeding when other predictors fail? It's because long ago they came to accept the imperfections in their knowledge. That helped them understand that even the most sophisticated computers, combing through seemingly limitless data, are painfully ill equipped to predict something as dynamic as weather all by themselves. So as fields like economics began relying more on Big Data, meteorologists recognized that data on its own isn't enough.
The I.B.M. Bluefire supercomputer in the basement of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., is so large that it essentially creates its own weather. The 77 trillion calculations that Bluefire makes each second, in its mass of blinking lights and coaxial cable, generate so much radiant energy that it requires a liquid cooling system. The room where Bluefire resides is as drafty as a minor-league hockey rink, and it's loud enough that hearing protection is suggested.
The 11 cabinets that hold the supercomputer are long and narrow and look like space-age port-a-potties. When I mentioned this to Rich Loft, the director of technology development for NCAR, he was not amused. To him, this computer represents the front line in an age-old struggle to predict our environment. ''You go back to Chaco Canyon or Stonehenge,'' Loft said, ''and people realized they could predict the shortest day of the year and the longest day -- that the moon moved in predictable ways. But there are things an ancient man couldn't predict: ambush from some kind of animal, a flash flood or a thunderstorm.''
For centuries, meteorologists relied on statistical tables based on historical averages -- it rains about 45 percent of the time in London in March, for instance -- to predict the weather. But these statistics are useless on a day-to-day level. Jan. 12, 1888, was a relatively warm day on the Great Plains until the temperature dropped almost 30 degrees in a matter of hours and a blinding snowstorm hit. More than a hundred children died of hypothermia on their way home from school that day. Knowing the average temperature for a January day in Topeka wouldn't have helped much in a case like that.
The holy grail of meteorology, scientists realized, was dynamic weather prediction -- programs that simulate the physical systems that produce clouds and cold fronts, windy days in Chicago and the morning fog over San Francisco as they occur. Theoretically, the laws that govern the physics of the weather are fairly simple. In 1814, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace postulated that the movement of every particle in the universe should be predictable as long as meteorologists could know the position of all those particles and how fast they are moving. Unfortunately, the number of molecules in the earth's atmosphere is perhaps on the order of 100 tredecillion, which is a 1 followed by 44 zeros. To make perfect weather predictions, we would not only have to account for all of those molecules, but we would also need to solve equations for all 100 tredecillion of them at once.
The most intuitive way to simplify the problem was to break the atmosphere down into a finite series of boxes, or what meteorologists variously refer to as a matrix, a lattice or a grid. The earliest credible attempt at this, according to Loft, was made in 1916 by an English physicist named Lewis Fry Richardson, who wanted to determine the weather over northern Germany on May 20, 1910. This was not technically a prediction, because the date was some six years in the past, but Richardson treated it that way, and he had a lot of data: a series of observations of temperature, barometric pressures and wind speeds that had been gathered by the German government. And as a pacifist serving a volunteer ambulance unit in northern France, he also had a lot of time on his hands. So Richardson broke Germany down into a series of two-dimensional boxes, each measuring three degrees of latitude by three degrees of longitude. Then he went to work trying to solve the equations that governed the weather in each square and how they might affect weather in the adjacent ones.
Richardson's experiment failed miserably. It ''predicted'' a dramatic rise in barometric pressure that hadn't occurred and produced strange-looking weather patterns that didn't resemble any seen in Germany before or since. Had he made a computational error? Were his equations buggy? It was hard to say. Even the most devoted weather nerds weren't eager to solve differential equations for months on end to double-check his work for one day in one country six years in the past.
What Richardson needed, he thought, was more manpower. He envisioned a weather-forecasting center with some 64,000 meteorologists, all working simultaneously to have the computational speed to make accurate weather forecasts in real time. His dream came to fruition (sort of) in 1950, when the first computer weather forecast was tried by the mathematician John von Neumann and a team of scientists at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. They used a machine that could make about 5,000 calculations a second, which was quite possibly as fast as 64,000 men. Alas, 5,000 calculations a second was no match for the weather. As it turned out, their forecast wasn't much better than a random guess.
Our views about predictability are inherently flawed. Take something that is often seen as the epitome of randomness, like a coin toss. While it may at first appear that there's no way to tell whether a coin is going to come up heads or tails, a group of mathematicians at Stanford is able to predict the outcome virtually 100 percent of the time, provided that they use a special machine to flip it. The machine does not cheat -- it flips the coin the exact same way (the same height, with the same strength and torque) over and over again -- and the coin is fair. Under those conditions, there is no randomness at all.
The reason that we view coin flips as unpredictable is because when we toss them, we're never able to reproduce the exact same motion. A similar phenomenon applies to the weather. In the late 1950s, the renowned M.I.T. mathematician Edward Lorenz was toiling away in his original profession as a meteorologist. Then, in the tradition of Alexander Fleming and penicillin or the New York Knicks and Jeremy Lin, he made a major discovery purely by accident. At the time, Lorenz and his team were trying to advance the use of computer models in weather prediction. They were getting somewhere, or so they thought, until the computer started spitting out contradictory results. Lorenz and his colleagues began with what they believed were exactly the same data and ran what they thought was exactly the same code; still, the program somehow forecast clear skies over Colorado in one run and a thunderstorm in the next.
After spending weeks double-checking their hardware and trying to debug their code, Lorenz and his team discovered that their data weren't exactly the same. The numbers had been rounded off in the third decimal place. Instead of having the barometric pressure in one corner of their grid read 29.5168, for example, it might instead read 29.517. This couldn't make that much of a difference, could it? Actually, Lorenz realized, it could, and he devoted the rest of his career to studying strange behaviors like these by developing a branch of mathematics called chaos theory, the most basic tenet of which is described in the title of his breakthrough 1972 paper, ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?'' In other words, a small change in initial conditions can produce a large and unexpected divergence in outcomes.
Chaos theory does not imply that the behavior of the system is literally random. It just means that certain types of systems are very hard to predict. If you know the exact conditions of a coin as it leaves someone's hand, you can -- with the right laboratory equipment -- predict, almost perfectly, which side it will land on. And yet the slightest disturbance to that motion can change a coin toss from being almost wholly predictable to almost wholly unpredictable.
The problem with weather is that our knowledge of its initial conditions is highly imperfect, both in theory and practice. A meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told me that it wasn't unheard-of for a careless forecaster to send in a 50-degree reading as 500 degrees. The more fundamental issue, though, is that we can observe our surroundings with only a certain degree of precision. No thermometer is perfect, and it isn't physically possible to stick one into every molecule in the atmosphere.
Weather also has two additional properties that make forecasting even more difficult. First, weather is nonlinear, meaning that it abides by exponential rather than by arithmetic relationships. Second, it's dynamic -- its behavior at one point in time influences its behavior in the future. Imagine that we're supposed to be taking the sum of 5 and 5, but we keyed in the second number as 6 by mistake. That will give us an answer of 11 instead of 10. We'll be wrong, but not by much; addition, as a linear operation, is pretty forgiving. Exponential operations, however, extract a lot more punishment when there are inaccuracies in our data. If instead of taking 5^5 -- which should be 3,125 -- we instead take 5^6, we wind up with an answer of 15,625. This problem quickly compounds when the process is dynamic, because outputs at one stage of the process become our inputs in the next.
Given how daunting the challenge was, it must have been tempting to give up on the idea of building a dynamic weather model altogether. A thunderstorm might have remained roughly as unpredictable as an earthquake. But by embracing the uncertainty of the problem, their predictions started to make progress. ''What may have distinguished [me] from those that proceeded,'' Lorenz later reflected in ''The Essence of Chaos,'' his 1993 book, ''was the idea that chaos was something to be sought rather than avoided.''
Perhaps because chaos theory has been a part of meteorological thinking for nearly four decades, professional weather forecasters have become comfortable treating uncertainty the way a stock trader or poker player might. When weather.gov says that there's a 20 percent chance of rain in Central Park, it's because the National Weather Service recognizes that our capacity to measure and predict the weather is accurate only up to a point. ''The forecasters look at lots of different models: Euro, Canadian, our model -- there's models all over the place, and they don't tell the same story,'' Ben Kyger, a director of operations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me. ''Which means they're all basically wrong.'' The National Weather Service forecasters who adjusted temperature gradients with their light pens were merely interpreting what was coming out of those models and making adjustments themselves. ''I've learned to live with it, and I know how to correct for it,'' Kyger said. ''My whole career might be based on how to interpret what it's telling me.''
Despite their astounding ability to crunch numbers in nanoseconds, there are still things that computers can't do, contends Hoke at the National Weather Service. They are especially bad at seeing the big picture when it comes to weather. They are also too literal, unable to recognize the pattern once it's subjected to even the slightest degree of manipulation. Supercomputers, for instance, aren't good at forecasting atmospheric details in the center of storms. One particular model, Hoke said, tends to forecast precipitation too far south by around 100 miles under certain weather conditions in the Eastern United States. So whenever forecasters see that situation, they know to forecast the precipitation farther north.
But there are literally countless other areas in which weather models fail in more subtle ways and rely on human correction. Perhaps the computer tends to be too conservative on forecasting nighttime rainfalls in Seattle when there's a low-pressure system in Puget Sound. Perhaps it doesn't know that the fog in Acadia National Park in Maine will clear up by sunrise if the wind is blowing in one direction but can linger until midmorning if it's coming from another. These are the sorts of distinctions that forecasters glean over time as they learn to work around potential flaws in the computer's forecasting model, in the way that a skilled pool player can adjust to the dead spots on the table at his local bar.
Among the National Weather Service's detailed records is a thorough comparison of how well the computers are doing by themselves alongside the value that humans are contributing. According to the agency's statistics, humans improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts by about 25 percent over the computer guidance alone. They improve the temperature forecasts by about 10 percent. Humans are good enough, in fact, that when the organization's Cray supercomputer burned down, in 1999, their high-temperature forecasts remained remarkably accurate. ''You almost can't have a meeting without someone mentioning the glory days of the Cray fire,'' Kyger said, pointing to a mangled, half-burnt piece of the computer that was proudly displayed in the office where I met him. ''If you weren't here for that, you really weren't part of the brotherhood.''
Still, most people take their forecasts for granted. Like a baseball umpire, a weather forecaster rarely gets credit for getting the call right. Last summer, meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center were tipped off to something serious when nearly all their computer models indicated that a fierce storm was going to be climbing the Northeast Corridor. The eerily similar results between models helped the center amplify its warning for Hurricane Irene well before it touched down on the Atlantic shore, prompting thousands to evacuate their homes. To many, particularly in New York, Irene was viewed as a media-manufactured nonevent, but that was largely because the Hurricane Center nailed its forecast. Six years earlier, the National Weather Service also made a nearly perfect forecast of Hurricane Katrina, anticipating its exact landfall almost 60 hours in advance. If public officials hadn't bungled the evacuation of New Orleans, the death toll might have been remarkably low.
In a time when forecasters of all types make overconfident proclamations about political, economic or natural events, uncertainty is a tough sell. It's much easier to hawk overconfidence, no matter if it's any good. A long-term study of political forecasts conducted by Philip Tetlock, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, found that when political experts described an event as being absolutely certain, it failed to transpire an astonishing 25 percent of the time.
The Weather Service has struggled over the years with how much to let the public in on what it doesn't exactly know. In April 1997, Grand Forks, N.D., was threatened by the flooding Red River, which bisects the city. Snowfall had been especially heavy in the Great Plains that winter, and the service, anticipating runoff as the snow melted, predicted that the Red would crest to 49 feet, close to the record. Because the levees in Grand Forks were built to handle a flood of 52 feet, a small miss in the forecast could prove catastrophic. The margin of error on the Weather Service's forecast -- based on how well its flood forecasts had done in the past -- implied about a 35 percent chance of the levees' being topped.
The waters, in fact, crested to 54 feet. It was well within the forecast's margin of error, but enough to overcome the levees and spill more than two miles into the city. Cleanup costs ran into the billions of dollars, and more than 75 percent of the city's homes were damaged or destroyed. Unlike a hurricane or an earthquake, the Grand Forks flood may have been preventable. The city's flood walls could have been reinforced using sandbags. It might also have been possible to divert the overflow into depopulated areas. But the Weather Service had explicitly avoided communicating the uncertainty in its forecast to the public, emphasizing only the 49-foot prediction. The forecasters later told researchers that they were afraid the public might lose confidence in the forecast if they had conveyed any uncertainty.
Since then, the National Weather Service has come to recognize the importance of communicating the uncertainty in its forecasts as completely as possible. ''Uncertainty is the fundamental component of weather prediction,'' said Max Mayfield, an Air Force veteran who ran the National Hurricane Center when Katrina hit. ''No forecast is complete without some description of that uncertainty.'' Under Mayfield's guidance, the National Hurricane Center began to pay much more attention to how it presents its forecasts. Instead of just showing a single track line for a hurricane's predicted path, their charts prominently feature a cone of uncertainty, which many in the business call ''the cone of chaos.''
Unfortunately, this cautious message can be undercut by private-sector forecasters. Catering to the demands of viewers can mean intentionally running the risk of making forecasts less accurate. For many years, the Weather Channel avoided forecasting an exact 50 percent chance of rain, which might seem wishy-washy to consumers. Instead, it rounded up to 60 or down to 40. In what may be the worst-kept secret in the business, numerous commercial weather forecasts are also biased toward forecasting more precipitation than will actually occur. (In the business, this is known as the wet bias.) For years, when the Weather Channel said there was a 20 percent chance of rain, it actually rained only about 5 percent of the time.
People don't mind when a forecaster predicts rain and it turns out to be a nice day. But if it rains when it isn't supposed to, they curse the weatherman for ruining their picnic. ''If the forecast was objective, if it has zero bias in precipitation,'' Bruce Rose, a former vice president for the Weather Channel, said, ''we'd probably be in trouble.''
The National Weather Service, on the other hand, takes plenty of blame when its cautious forecasts seem retrospectively unwarranted. I was reminded of this when I arrived in Tampa for the Republican National Convention. The city was briefly in Hurricane Isaac's cone of chaos before the storm took a westward tack. The airport and roads were remarkably quiet, no doubt because some reporters and delegates (and thousands of tourists) heeded caution and stayed home. When I so much as mentioned the weather forecast, my taxi driver turned and launched into a series of obscenities.

HEADLINE: In a Swirl of Excess, No Guilt Included

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C.
''HEY, it's Anderson Cooper!''
Early Friday morning, about 90 minutes after President Obama finished his acceptance speech a few blocks away, a little slice of hell was breaking loose in front of the Ritz-Carlton.
As mobs of delegates, donors and Democratic Usual Suspects were flooding out of the Time Warner Cable Arena, Mr. Cooper was trying to flee without notice from the free bar and restaurant, the CNN Grill, that his network had established for the week. It was one of several troughs within a few blocks of one another where seemingly anyone with rudimentary door-talking skills could freely nourish and inebriate himself. Eat and drink free, and maybe catch a picture of Anderson Cooper? This could be fun.
Unless you're Mr. Cooper, at this wee-hours moment at least: with 1 a.m. approaching, the host of CNN's ''Anderson Cooper 360'' emerged from the grill looking exhausted, with his head ducked. He tried to cross the street. Cue hell. 
''Anderson, stop, Anderson!'' a lunging woman yelled, and within seconds a hungry mob of a dozen iPhone paparazzi was chasing in a hot camera-pointing pursuit. ''Just one picture, please, please,'' shouted one stampeder, knocking a convention delegate to the ground. Mr. Cooper did his own 360 and headed to the safety of the Ritz, where the full-on decadence and celebrity culture of the modern political convention had been on eloquent display in the lobby all week. So much for hell.
This was the week's culminating wee-hours scene: Mr. Cooper rushing through the mob, past the Democratic money maven Orin Kramer, who stood a few feet from where the actress Eva Longoria had just breezed through, and where Senator John Kerry, who himself had just finished a big speech, was now ducking into the lobby men's room.
The wood-paneled tables of the lobby bar were veritable table-hops for signature Democrats. The hard-covered liquor and snacks menu resembled a book. Orders being discussed: milk chocolate fondue, mini lobster rolls with shaved asparagus and a $420 bottle of Louis Roederer Champagne.
It was difficult to inch along the main convention drags in Charlotte last week, as in Tampa, Fla., the week before, without concluding that we are living in fat, prosperous times, and forgetting that the national economy has lagged for years and that large numbers of Americans are feeling deep contempt for the two major political parties. Never mind all that. Political conventions are about big speeches, funny hats and packed swag bags, and they are also moneyed and decadent affairs. To wit: the rolling party at the Ritz bar, spilling into the adjacent BLT Steak restaurant.
''This is our temporary Gucci Gulch,'' said Rick Williams, a Democratic lobbyist in from Nashville, christening the Ritz scene in honor of the seminal book about the Washington lobbying culture of the 1980s. He was plunked down Wednesday at a wooden table, picking at a Caesar salad.
Mr. Williams was just sitting here, by the way, not actually staying there. Nor was Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, who had just approached, parking himself under a silver wire structure hanging from the ceiling. He called the gilded tableau before him, ''The crème brûlée, the tiramisù of our party.'' This would make us hungry, except that we were just coming from the Bloomberg buffet, or was it that Huffington Post ''Oasis,'' or that brunch put on by those lobbyists, or that trade group -- I forget which one.
Indeed, there was nothing stopping the Democrats, the purported party of the middle class, from enjoying the sweeter One-Percenty parts of life last week. Not here, not last week, at this festival of pinstriped populism, packed swag bags and congressmen clutching Ritz-monogrammed umbrellas while bolting the arena on Tuesday before the first lady's speech. (Representative John Larson of Connecticut, busted!)
You can always tell the real players, the real overlords, by The Walk. Not so much by their entourages or the number of earpieces around them or the size of their silvery little lapel pins (smaller the pin, bigger the deal). But by their brisk and purposeful gait through the Ritz-Carlton lobby.
Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and Wall Street sovereign, still has The Walk. Late Wednesday afternoon, he was moving through the bar looking tired. But he still drew the ''Hey, isn't that Bob Rubin?'' stares.
''You can always tell by the way they move, that sense of purpose,'' said Jeff Smith, a former Missouri state senator who ran afoul of campaign finance laws and wound up in jail for a year. Mr. Smith never got to Washington, in other words, and now he's teaching public policy at the New School in New York. As he spoke, Terry McAuliffe, the notable Democratic money man who presumably emerged from the womb doing The Walk, was blitzing through in the lobby, waving to everyone.
''Hey, Terry!'' someone yelled at him, and he detoured past the table-hopping former congressman from Tennessee, Harold Ford, now a regular on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe.'' Mr. Smith was introduced to Mr. McAuliffe.
''I used to date one of your biggest fans,'' Mr. Smith said to Mr. McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, ''and I'm pretty sure the feeling is mutual.''
''Who is that?'' Mr. McAuliffe asked. ''Hillary?''
No, it was Mr. McAuliffe's former press aide, now working on the president's re-election campaign. Mr. Smith and Mr. McAuliffe posed for a photo and the latter Walked on. A few seconds later, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon headed onto a nearby elevator and waved. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota walked in via the coffee shop (Bar Cocoa). There was the former governor of Ohio, Ted Strickland, holding court on a far couch, and Senator Chris Coons of Delaware (a k a The Guy Who Got to Run Against Christine O'Donnell in 2010), who would soon be heading to dinner at BLT Steak, where Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack would be dining, also, with the actor Jeff Bridges. By 6 o'clock, eight Democratic congressmen populated the lobby and bar, while another trickle of senators headed to a reception upstairs. One Bob Schieffer was coming through, a Tom Brokaw, a Piers Morgan, a Paul Begala, and dozens of super-donors, lobbyists, super-staffers, assorted coat-holders and other people on TV (''Hey, Chris Matthews, can I get a picture?'').
''I am exhausted,'' said Heather Podesta, a Democratic super-lobbyist, who was wearing a multicolored silk suit that looked as if it were spray-painted on. ''Graffiti-inspired,'' she called the outfit. She plopped down at a Ritz table for a few minutes. She is trying to stay on her best behavior after being quoted in a Reuters article that described Charlotte as a ''second-tier city.'' ''It's grim,'' she said in the article. ''Going to the Nascar Hall of Fame isn't reason enough to be in Charlotte.'' People noticed that, local people, and not happy ones.
''Now I'm being good,'' she said, picking from a bowl of sesame-crusted almonds. After a few minutes, she tried to haul herself to another reception, this one at the home of Erskine Bowles, the former chief of staff in the Clinton White House. Suddenly, the dull power roar of the lobby was interrupted by disjointed yells. A group of about a dozen pink-clad protesters was moving through the lobby. They were now singing something -- hard to make out the words -- to the tune of ''Hit the Road, Jack'' before breaking into a chant of ''Get Money Out of Politics'' as they were led out, briskly, by security guards.
It's always a little fraught with Democrats. Beneath the shiny surfaces, this was also true in Charlotte. They were celebrating themselves in a rough economy, renominating a president who has been accused (up and down, at the Republican self-love-counterpart in Tampa) of someone who punishes success. If you're a Democrat, and sneering about the tax breaks you say Mitt Romney wants to give ''the wealthiest Americans, like him,'' shouldn't you be at least sheepish about these lavish things? You have to ask.
The responses are typically nonapologetic but can carry a slight whiff of defensiveness. ''Working people should also be able to experience the good things in life,'' said Dolores Huerta, the civil rights champion and co-founder of the United Farm Workers with César Chávez. She was at a late-night reception Monday hosted by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, standing a few feet from a bar made of ice and bathed in emerald green lighting. ''Except for that ice bar, I don't think this is all that ostentatious,'' Ms. Huerta said as a waiter walked by, carrying a tray of mint chocolate macaroons. ''The little guy should be able to enjoy this too.''
In other words, Charlotte was a No Guilt Zone, liberal or otherwise. ''Do too many shrimp die on a week like this? Yes, probably,'' said Tony Podesta, the Democratic mega-lobbyist and Heather's husband. He was wearing a tan suit and laceless red sneakers at a brunch reception that he and Heather were hosting Tuesday -- their second in two days -- at an art museum near the arena. Mr. Podesta, 68, was more shrugging than sheepish. And, as the head of a firm that lobbies for BP, whose crude has poisoned many a shrimp, his crustacean-friendly bona-fides are questionable.
Regardless, any hint of an apology tour was undetectable, especially in the presence of good food, powerful friends, well-fed and well-heeled clients -- all mainstays of this or any convention. Processions of congressman, ambassadors, lobbyists and donor types filed through to pay respects.
''I'm here to get Tony's blessing,'' said Rob McCoy, the state treasurer of Pennsylvania. Senators Ben Cardin of Maryland and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island walked by, as did the Democratic fund-raiser Patricia Duff, and the Wal-Mart government relations guy, Leslie Dach. The Podestas had made a preconvention ''tasting trip'' to Charlotte. They sampled from 30 local eateries to yield this day's decadent smorgasbord of bourbon chocolate truffles, cucumber slices topped with chicken salad and crab cakes slathered with peach chowchow.
The cuisine does make the Obama-era vilification of lobbyists go down much easier. That is for sure. Four years ago, in Denver, the Podestas made up Scarlett ''Ls'' -- for ''lobbyist'' -- as badges of defiance. Even sweeter defiance? Business is grand these days, and so are the Bloody Marys. Mr. Podesta's firm, the Podesta Group, is in line to have its best year ever, he said.
Ms. Podesta said the anti-lobbying trash talk did bother her for a time. ''It felt like I was in a cage,'' she said, as she had before. ''But the food was good.''
She shrugged, which as much as anything was the prevailing expression of any angst on display in Charlotte last week. That's the system. It might not be pretty, but you might as well eat, and better yet for free.
''Look, I need to raise money, just like most members of Congress do,'' said Representative Cohen, who on Wednesday afternoon was walking through the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton where, he reiterates, he was not staying. Senator Kerry, who was, walked out past him -- cellphone to ear, not to be bothered -- and into a waiting Suburban. Representative Cohen said he was being opposed in his Memphis-area district in November by a ''self-funder'' whom he said would spend $4 million to portray him as ''a hermaphrodite, poppy-growing Al Qaeda member.'' Yes, he would change the system if he could, absolutely, the congressman said. ''But I have to operate in the real world,'' he said, heading back into the Ritz-Carlton, if not the real world.

HEADLINE: Five Crucial Factors to Watch, Just 58 Days From the Election

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Seminole, Fla.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Two months before the election, President Obama and Mitt Romney agree on one thing: the collection of states where the race will be decided.
As Mr. Obama opened a two-day bus tour of Florida on Saturday, Mr. Romney set his sights on trying to put Virginia back in the Republican column. Television advertisements from both sides were filling the airwaves in those two vital states and six others from Nevada to New Hampshire, while outside groups supporting the candidates tested for traction elsewhere.
With the political conventions over, the battle to determine whether Mr. Obama will win re-election or Mr. Romney will become the 45th president of the United States is fully engaged. The race has been deadlocked, according to many measures, and each side was predicting that it would see no lift from its convention. That seems to have been true in Mr. Romney's case, while Mr. Obama's aides were hopeful that new polls due out this week would prove them wrong.
But for now, Mr. Obama may hold a slight edge because the race remains essentially tied, which means voter disappointment has not turned into a resounding call for his defeat despite the challenging economic climate. 
''Now, our friends at the other convention were more than happy to talk about what was wrong with America but not talking about what they'd do to make it right,'' he told supporters on Saturday in Seminole, Fla., only a few miles from the site of the Republican convention.
Mr. Romney, speaking to veterans in Virginia Beach on Saturday, referred to the disappointing jobs report released a day earlier. ''This week has not been a lot of good news,'' he said. ''But I'm here to tell you things are about to get a lot better.''
Presidential races take place on many levels, some easily visible, others more shrouded. As the clock runs down, both sides make tough decisions about which states to compete in and which to abandon. Advertising themes get tested and changed as strategists hunt frantically for the right appeals, and get-out-the-vote teams target wavering voters with tailored messages.
Behind closed doors, the candidates are preparing for the most crucial remaining events, the debates. And in courtrooms, lawyers are battling over who is on the ballot and who can vote.
Unforeseen events, economic or otherwise, could also still have a significant impact on the outcome of the race, much as the financial crisis did four years ago this fall.
Here are a few things to watch in the 58 days ahead:
Electoral Map
The roster of battleground states has not changed much, but one that Republicans had dearly hoped to put in play appears to have broken decisively: Pennsylvania. Mr. Romney spent time and money in the state, which voted Democratic in the last five presidential elections, but Republican strategists now say it seems out of reach.
Wisconsin, which has 10 electoral votes and is home to Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, may offer Mr. Romney the best chance to expand his options. Republicans have not won there since 1984, despite fighting hard in almost every election. Wisconsin was not one of the eight states where the Romney campaign placed its first flight of general election ads late last week, but one party strategist said, ''Keep watching.''
By this point, Mr. Romney had hoped to put at least a few more states into safer Republican territory. North Carolina, which Mr. Obama narrowly carried in 2008, is at the top of the list. But the state is still competitive enough that Mr. Romney and Republican groups feel compelled to keep advertising there, complicating their hopes of making Wisconsin and Michigan more competitive.
Some Democratic strategists say that winning Florida remains a reach for Mr. Obama, but his visit this weekend suggests that the White House has not given up and at a minimum will make Mr. Romney spend a lot more time and money in the state.
And Democrats say they are happily surprised by polls showing Mr. Obama running strong in Ohio, whose working-class voters have been exposed to heavy advertising portraying Mr. Romney as a job killer.
Debates
In a race that has featured little significant movement between the candidates, the three presidential debates this fall are taking on even greater importance.
For weeks, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have been preparing for their encounters on Oct. 3 in Denver; Oct. 16 in Hempstead, N.Y.; and Oct. 22 in Boca Raton, Fla.
With each passing debate, millions of Americans will probably cast their ballot, given the rise of early voting and balloting by mail in many Western states.
The president, whose advisers have known him to procrastinate before preparing for big moments, has been studying his rival's positions and statements from the primary campaign. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts will play the role of Mr. Romney in debate practice.
Mr. Romney may be a little further ahead in his preparations. His aides began putting blocks of time in his schedule shortly after he emerged from the primaries in the spring. He started formal practice sessions last week at a remote estate in Vermont, where Senator Rob Portman of Ohio played the role of Mr. Obama.
Tens of millions of people will watch the debates -- four years ago, viewership ranged from 52 million to 63 million -- almost certainly a much bigger television audience than the totals for the conventions.
Ads and Messages
After spending the spring and summer trying to turn Mr. Romney's success as a business executive from a positive to a negative, characterizing him as uncaring about the middle class, Mr. Obama's aides and allies intend to graft their portrayal onto specific policy areas.
They suggested that one attack, building on the president's argument that Mr. Romney intends essentially to privatize Medicare, would contend that the Republican ticket's next target would be another immensely popular program, Social Security.
In the past, Mr. Ryan has supported adding personal investment accounts to Social Security, a fundamental shift in the program that most Democrats say would leave the elderly vulnerable to unpredictable swings in the financial markets.
Having intently studied the 2004 race, when President George W. Bush won re-election after defining Mr. Kerry on his terms during the spring and summer, Mr. Obama's advisers are convinced that the most crucial advertising period is already over, and that they accomplished what they had to by introducing Mr. Romney to the nation as a rapacious capitalist.
Mr. Romney's team is betting that early ad spending is largely wasted, and that a final and furious campaign will move the race in his direction when it most counts. The campaign's belief is that continued disappointing economic data will feed its slogan, ''Obama Isn't Working,'' and give a new edge to the question that Mr. Romney is posing at every opportunity: ''Are you better off than you were four years ago?''
On Saturday, the Democratic ''super PAC'' Priorities USA Action released an advertising campaign highlighting a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that estimated that Mr. Romney's plans would raise taxes on the middle class while cutting them for the wealthy. The Romney campaign has said the finding is based on flawed assumptions.
Like the Democrats, Republicans say they intend to link their broader economic message to specific policies: cutting spending and reducing the national debt, working to ensure the solvency of Medicare for future generations, cutting expensive regulations and avoiding tax increases.
Over the next two months, residents of swing states will see ads on the issues that matter most to them: foreclosures in Nevada, Medicare in Florida, military spending in North Carolina and Virginia, and, especially from the Republicans, the federal budget deficit just about everywhere.
Mr. Obama and his supporters are telegraphing a new campaign intended to paint their opponents as pessimists betting against America, as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. put it on Thursday night.
''They are extremely pessimistic because they want to tamp down people's enthusiasm about the future,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina.
But if Democrats go too far in that direction, Republicans will be ready to pounce and call them out of touch with reality.
Ballots
There is one factor in the campaign that has yet to get much attention but could influence the outcome: third-party candidacies in many states, most notably that of former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee.
Mr. Johnson, who argued for free markets, fewer wars and the legalization of marijuana during his brief run for the 2012 Republican nomination, hardly shows up in polls. But he is on the ballot in more than three dozen states and is trying for more.
Mr. Johnson shares some of the cross-party appeal of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who complimented him publicly last week. Advisers said Mr. Johnson's potential for cutting into Mr. Romney's support was greatest in Florida, where Mr. Romney is basically tied with Mr. Obama, but could also have an impact in Arizona, Nevada, New Hampshire and North Carolina.
They said Mr. Johnson's potential to eat into Mr. Obama's support was greatest in Colorado, Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon and Wisconsin.
Republican officials have already tried to challenge Mr. Johnson's place on the ballot or are trying to in states including Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Many of the challenges have failed -- courts recently rejected efforts to throw him off the ballot in Virginia -- and Roger Stone, a Republican Party veteran who is advising Mr. Johnson, said he was optimistic that Mr. Johnson would qualify in all 50 states.
The Republican Party of Virginia also failed in a bid last week to remove former Representative Virgil Goode from the presidential ballot there. He is the nominee for the Constitution Party and could draw disaffected Tea Party adherents away from the Republican Party.
Money
For the first time since the advent of public financing after Watergate, neither major-party candidate will accept matching funds, forcing both to keep raising money right up until Election Day. That means Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have to build substantial room into their schedules for fund-raising, including more time than they would like traveling to places that are not competitive politically but are flush with wealthy donors, starting with New York and Los Angeles.
At the end of July, when the last official figures were available, Mr. Romney and the related Republican Party presidential committees had about $186 million on hand, compared with about $124 million for Mr. Obama and the Democrats. On Saturday, Mr. Obama wrote in a Twitter message that his convention had prompted 700,000 new donations to his campaign.
Still, Mr. Obama's advisers have expressed concerns that the Romney war chest, combined with well-financed Republican super PACs, will swamp them and Priorities USA Action when it comes to advertising. But much of the Obama campaign's money is going into its sophisticated voter-identification and get-out-the-vote operation, which is fully up and running, while Mr. Romney rushes to build his own.
''We have a strategic advantage on the ground -- the ability to turn our voters out and talk to persuadable voters -- and that's what we're going to do,'' said Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager.

HEADLINE: Obama, Stumping in Florida, Tries to Turn Focus to Medicare From Jobs

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Helene Cooper reported from Seminole, Fla., and Ashley Parker from Boston and Charlotte, N.C.

 BODY:
SEMINOLE, Fla. -- President Obama on Saturday began hammering away at the Republican ticket's plans for Medicare, using a campaign swing through Florida, with its large number of retired and elderly voters, to try to turn the page from anemic employment growth, his biggest weakness, to entitlements, a Democratic strength.
Kicking off a two-day bus tour through this perennial swing state, the president told a rally here that Mitt Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, had proposed overhauling Medicare and replacing it with a voucher system that could mean higher costs for beneficiaries. 
''Florida, you should know I will never turn Medicare into a voucher system,'' Mr. Obama said to rousing cheers from a crowd of 11,000 at St. Petersburg College, Seminole. ''No American should have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies.''
The president's advisers have indicated that they are eager to re-engage their opponents on their Medicare plan, while the Romney camp would prefer to talk about the economy. A government report on Friday showed that employers had eased up on hiring in August, adding just 96,000 jobs, compared with 141,000 in July. The unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent, but that was largely because of people leaving the work force entirely.
Mr. Romney has sought to blunt Mr. Obama's Medicare offensive with attacks of his own, something Obama advisers appeared to await eagerly.
''If they want to have a discussion about who do you trust on Medicare for the next 60 days as their central argument, you know we ought to send them an in-kind contribution,'' David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday. ''We're happy to have that discussion. We think people trust the president more on Medicare.''
The president grabbed that mantle on Saturday and ran with it. ''We will reform and strengthen Medicare,'' he told the rally, ''but we'll do it by reducing the costs of health care, not by dumping the costs on seniors.''
For good measure, he threw in several more lines in his stump speech aimed at older people, who he said ''are saving an average of $6,000 on prescription drugs because of Obamacare. And by the way, I do care.'' That was a reference to the name that Republicans have derisively given his health care overhaul. These days, the president has embraced the label with open arms.
''I like the name 'Obamacare,' '' he said, adding that Mr. Romney ''says he's going to repeal it. That's because Romney doesn't care.''
With 58 days to go until Election Day, the battle for seven or so fiercely contested swing states has intensified. No state is more crucial than Florida, with its 29 electoral votes and its diverse mix of conservative Southerners, Hispanics, African-Americans and elderly and Jewish voters.
Mr. Obama does not appear to have much of a shot with conservative Southerners, but he is fighting mightily for the rest. That is why his weekend bus tour was straddling the center of the state, in the territory that hosted the Republican National Convention two weeks ago. The campaign announced Saturday that former President Bill Clinton would stump for Mr. Obama in Miami and Orlando next week. Mr. Obama won Florida in 2008.
After Seminole, the president traveled up Interstate 4 toward Orlando, with a stop in Kissimmee. On Sunday, he was to head down to Melbourne and then West Palm Beach, ground zero for the Bush-Gore election recount of 2000.
As the crowd sustained a screaming standing ovation, Mr. Obama stood back and marveled. ''When the reception's this good, I just want to say thank you and leave the stage,'' he said. ''How can I top this?''

HEADLINE: Clinton Tells Russia That Sanctions Will Soon End

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged Saturday that the United States would soon lift cold-war-era trade sanctions on Russia, but she did not address human rights legislation in Congress that has so far stalled passage, infuriated the Kremlin and become an unexpected issue in the American presidential race.
Attending the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting here in place of the campaigning President Obama, Mrs. Clinton welcomed Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization last month. And she said that the United States must now normalize trade relations so that American businesses can reap the benefits of Russia's membership, including lower tariffs for American products. 
Although the sanctions included in the 1974 law known as Jackson-Vanik are waived each year and have no practical effect, they violate W.T.O. rules, which could allow Russia to retaliate against American businesses.
The effort to grant Russia normal trade status, however, has become entangled in legislation that would punish Russian officials accused of abusing human rights, denying them visas and freezing their assets. That has raised doubts that any agreement on lifting the Jackson-Vanik provisions can be reached before the November election.
The human rights bill, which has bipartisan support in both houses of Congress, is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in prison in 2009 after being prosecuted on charges that his supporters argue were manufactured to cover up official corruption.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential challenger, injected the issue into the campaign last week by issuing a statement saying that, as president, he would normalize trade with Russia only if the Magnitsky bill were enacted. The Obama administration, by contrast, has opposed the bill as too expansive and lobbied against mixing it with the trade issue, while expressing support for addressing rights abuses in Russia in some way.
The divisions over Russia as an issue in the American campaign came starkly into focus as Mrs. Clinton wrapped up a 10-day, six-nation trip to Asia that overlapped with the national party conventions at home.
The Romney campaign, in a statement, criticized ''the Obama administration's attempts to scuttle the Magnitsky bill and its overall reluctance to shine a light on human rights abuses in Russia and the Putin government's backsliding on democratic principles.''
President Vladimir V. Putin, the host of the conference, weighed in on the American campaign last week in an interview in which he praised Mr. Obama as ''a very honest man'' and rebuked Mr. Romney for calling Russia ''without question the No. 1 geopolitical foe'' of the United States.
Mr. Putin and other Russian officials have vehemently opposed the Magnitsky bill, warning of so-far-unspecified reciprocal measures if it is enacted into law.
Although Mrs. Clinton did not mention the Magnitsky legislation in public on Saturday, a senior State Department official said she raised the issue of human rights and recent moves by Russia to restrict nongovernmental organizations during a private breakfast of crepes and red caviar with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov.
At the news conference that followed, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the accomplishments of what the administration called the ''reset'' policy toward Russia.
''During the past three and a half years, the United States and Russia have deepened our cooperation to address shared challenges,'' she said, citing the New Start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons and Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization.
The Jackson-Vanik trade barriers were imposed to punish the Soviet Union for its restrictions on the emigration of Jews. Although the Jackson-Vanik provisions have been waived since the Soviet Union fell apart, their continued existence in American law would allow Russia to maintain higher duties on American products of its own choosing.
''We hope that the Congress will act on this important piece of legislation this month,'' Mrs. Clinton said in her main speech at the economic forum.
The administration has had tensions with Russia this year over Mr. Putin's re-election, the protests that followed and the government's intensifying crackdown on opponents, including three members of the punk band Pussy Riot, who were sentenced to two years in prison for a political protest in a cathedral. The United States has also been upset by Russia's refusal to support efforts intended to force President Bashar al-Assad from power in Syria to try to stop the war there.
None of those issues surfaced publicly here.
The trade issue was among several topics that Mrs. Clinton discussed with Mr. Putin in a private 15-minute meeting on Saturday evening before they attended a dinner with other leaders.
The senior State Department official said that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Putin also discussed Syria and efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program, as well as plans by the United States for a missile defense system in Europe that Russia opposes. The two then sat next to each other at dinner and chatted throughout the 90-minute meal about wildlife conservation; the Russian Far East; the Winter Olympics to be held in Sochi, Russia, in 2014; and other topics, the official said.
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lavrov announced modest agreements on noncontentious issues and sought to portray them as examples of what Mr. Lavrov called ''constructive cooperation.''
They signed a memorandum of understanding on scientific cooperation and rescue operations in Antarctica and issued two statements encouraging exchanges of regional trade delegations and establishing ties between national parks on either side of the Bering Strait.
''We are grateful for this and other opportunities to work more closely with Russia on areas of common concern that will deliver benefits to the people of both our nations,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
In their brief remarks, neither mentioned the pending human rights legislation in Congress.

HEADLINE: The Magic Is Gone

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
THE Obama era in American politics began almost exactly eight years ago in Boston, when a youthful Senate candidate's soaring speech to the Democratic National Convention stole the show from the actual Democratic nominee.
It ended, to all intents and purposes, last Thursday night in Charlotte, when a weary-seeming incumbent delivered perhaps the fourth-best major address at his own convention -- a plodding, hectoring speech that tacitly acknowledged that this White House is out of ideas, out of options and no longer the master of its fate.
The end of an era does not necessarily mean the end of a presidency. Barack Obama is still beloved by his supporters and regarded sympathetically by many swing voters. His Republican rival is a flawed candidate running an overcautious campaign. The memories of the Bush presidency's failures are still fresh enough to make even a stumbling Democratic administration seem as if it might be the lesser of two evils. 
But a re-elected Obama will be a permanently diminished Obama, with no magic left in his public persona and no mandate save to stay the current economic course. He may win the necessary electoral votes in November, but come February he will already essentially be a lame duck.
This reality has been apparent for some time, but the proceedings in Charlotte were highly clarifying. On Tuesday, Michelle Obama offered a moving apologia for her husband's character and leadership. On Wednesday, Bill Clinton smoothly defended Obama's domestic policy, and then sliced and diced the Republican alternative. On Thursday, Joe Biden issued a stinging populist attack on Mitt Romney, and a robust defense of his boss's decision-making chops.
All of these speeches appeared to set the president up to do more than just defend his own record and define his opponent as extreme and out-of-touch. By taking the fight to Romney, it seemed, they made it possible for Obama himself to advance a more positive agenda. By looking backward, they made it possible for him to look ahead.
But the president's actual speech did no such thing. The contrasts he drew with the Republicans were effective enough, but his positive agenda was mostly just a laundry list of easy targets -- hiring more teachers, increasing natural gas production, modest short-term deficit reduction -- rather than anything remotely transformative or new. By the time Obama was finished, Romney's tissue-thin acceptance speech looked almost rigorous by comparison.
As the president promised, so is he likely to deliver. An Obama second term could feature some sort of early deal on taxes and spending, because the expiration of the Bush tax cuts will give him a temporarily strengthened hand to play. But a comprehensive, Simpson-Bowles-style deficit deal seems even less likely than before -- let alone a deal on Medicare reform, where the two parties are now more polarized then ever. Likewise with liberal priorities like climate change legislation and immigration reform, which would require Democratic gains in Congress (and shifts in public opinion) that this campaign seems unlikely to produce.
As for the unemployed, maybe time and Ben Bernanke can help them, but there were no proposals of significance in the president's speech for how to speed up short-term economic growth. Nothing new about housing, or the payroll tax, or regulatory reform, or monetary policy -- nothing save an appeal for patience along what the president, in an almost Carteresque non-flourish, called the ''harder'' and ''longer'' road.
As The Washington Post's Ezra Klein noted after the speech, a vote for the president's meager agenda is effectively a vote for a kind of ''return to normalcy'' after the intense perturbations of the last four years. Clinton's high-profile convention role was appropriate, in a sense, because in the best-case scenario an Obama second term would return us to the legislative landscape of the late 1990s -- an era of small ball and incrementalism and modest forms of bipartisanship, in which politicians of both parties took credit for positive developments that they didn't actually control.
But we are not in the late 1990s anymore. There is nothing remotely ''normal'' about the unemployment rate we're enduring, or the long-term deficits we face, or the fact that the American birthrate has dropped below replacement level over the last five years. Or alternatively, if this is the new normal, then it's a normalcy that both citizens and politicians should aspire to swiftly leave behind.
So far, Mitt Romney has conspicuously failed to persuade voters that his party, which helped lead us into this mess, has learned enough and changed enough to lead us out of it.
But whatever happens in November, the president's own words have given us fair warning: We face a continuing crisis, and the liberalism of Barack Obama is no longer equal to the task.

HEADLINE: New Rules

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Shanghai
I JUST arrived in Shanghai, but I'm thinking about Estonia and wondering about something Presidents Clinton and Obama have been saying.
Wired magazine reported last week that public schools in Estonia are establishing a program for teaching first graders -- and kids in all other grades -- how to do computer programming. Wired said that the curriculum was created ''because of the difficulty Estonian companies face in hiring programmers. Estonia has a burgeoning tech industry thanks in part to the success of Skype, which was developed in Estonia in 2003.''
The news from Estonia prompted The Guardian newspaper of London to publish an online poll asking its readers: ''Children aged 7 to 16 are being given the opportunity to learn how to code in schools in Estonia, should U.K. school children be taught programming as part of their school day?'' It's fascinating to read about all this while visiting Shanghai, whose public school system in 2010 beat the rest of the world in math, science and reading in the global PISA exam of 15-year-olds. Will the Chinese respond by teaching programming to preschoolers? 
All of this made me think Obama should stop using the phrase -- first minted by Bill Clinton in 1992 -- that if you just ''work hard and play by the rules'' you should expect that the American system will deliver you a decent life and a chance for your children to have a better one. That mantra really resonates with me and, I am sure, with many voters. There is just one problem: It's out of date.
The truth is, if you want a decent job that will lead to a decent life today you have to work harder, regularly reinvent yourself, obtain at least some form of postsecondary education, make sure that you're engaged in lifelong learning and play by the rules. That's not a bumper sticker, but we terribly mislead people by saying otherwise.
Why? Because when Clinton first employed his phrase in 1992, the Internet was just emerging, virtually no one had e-mail and the cold war was just ending. In other words, we were still living in a closed system, a world of walls, which were just starting to come down. It was a world before Nafta and the full merger of globalization and the information technology revolution, a world in which unions and blue-collar manufacturing were still relatively strong, and where America could still write a lot of the rules that people played by.
That world is gone. It is now a more open system. Technology and globalization are wiping out lower-skilled jobs faster, while steadily raising the skill level required for new jobs. More than ever now, lifelong learning is the key to getting into, and staying in, the middle class.
There is a quote attributed to the futurist Alvin Toffler that captures this new reality: In the future ''illiteracy will not be defined by those who cannot read and write, but by those who cannot learn and relearn.'' Any form of standing still is deadly.
I covered the Republican convention, and I was impressed in watching my Times colleagues at how much their jobs have changed. Here's what a reporter does in a typical day: report, file for the Web edition, file for The International Herald Tribune, tweet, update for the Web edition, report more, track other people's tweets, do a Web-video spot and then write the story for the print paper. You want to be a Times reporter today? That's your day. You have to work harder and smarter and develop new skills faster.
Van Ton-Quinlivan, the vice chancellor for work force and economic development at the California Community Colleges System, explained to me the four basic skill sets out there today. The first are people who are ''ready now.'' That's people with exactly the right skills an employer is looking for at the right time. Employers will give the local labor market and schools the first chance at providing those people, but if they are not available they'll go the ''shortest distance to find them,'' she said, and today that could be anywhere in the world. Companies who can't find ''ready now'' will look for ''ready soon,'' people who, with limited training and on-the-job experience, can fit right in. If they can't find those, some will hire ''work ready.'' These are people with two or four years of postsecondary education who can be trained, but companies have shrinking budgets for that now and want public schools to do it. Last are the growing legions of the ''far from ready,'' people who dropped out or have only a high school diploma. Their prospects for a decent job are small, even if they are ready to ''work hard and play by the rules.''
Which is why if we ever get another stimulus it has to focus, in part, on getting more people more education. The unemployment rate today is 4.1 percent for people with four years of college, 6.6 percent for those with two years, 8.8 percent for high school graduates, and 12.0 percent for dropouts.
That's why I prefer the new mantra floated by Clinton at the Democratic convention, (which Obama has tried to fund): ''We have to prepare more Americans for the new jobs that are being created in a world fueled by new technology. That's why investments in our people'' -- in more community colleges, Pell grants and vocational-training classes -- ''are more important than ever.''

HEADLINE: Dispute on Costs Delays Opening Of 9/11 Museum

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A dispute between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over the $1 billion museum at ground zero has dragged on for so long that the museum will not open in time for the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks -- or even for the next one.
Aides to Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Cuomo have so far been unable to resolve their differences over which government agencies will pay the operating costs of the museum, which is intended to document the terrorist attacks of 2001 and honor the nearly 3,000 victims. The two sides also remain at odds over who will have oversight of the museum and the surrounding memorial.
The negotiations are further complicated because Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey must sign off on any agreement before it can take effect. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie together control the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center site. Mr. Bloomberg is chairman of the Sept. 11 foundation, which controls the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, and oversees commemorative events at the site. 
With work on the museum at a standstill for nearly a year, fund-raising and donations have fallen, and exhibits are gathering dust in fabrication shops in Buffalo and Santa Fe, N.M., according to museum executives.
The delay means that the museum may not open before construction on 1 World Trade Center, formerly known as the Freedom Tower, is finished in early 2014.
Aides to Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Cuomo said they hoped that the 11th anniversary, on Tuesday, might create pressure for a last-minute deal. Late last week, the two sides began circulating proposals to resolve the yearlong impasse.
Still, earlier agreements have fallen apart.
''It would be catastrophically sad if they can't find a solution,'' said Ira M. Millstein, a board member of the Sept. 11 foundation and a prominent commercial lawyer. ''They really ought to sit down in a room and look at each other. It can't be solved with e-mails.''
Other members of the board, whose relatives died in the attacks, said they would hold a demonstration on Monday if the officials did not break the deadlock.
Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Cuomo tried to bridge their differences last month when they agreed to establish an advisory committee to address disputes over the memorial, the museum and access to the site. But then a new dispute erupted over how much money the foundation would contribute to the museum's operating costs, and the plan for the advisory committee has not moved forward.
Last week, in a break with custom, Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie did not attend the foundation's annual fund-raising dinner at Cipriani Wall Street, where the comedian Stephen Colbert was the host.
Port Authority officials bought a table for the event, but hesitated to attend because they were concerned about the reception they would receive from foundation executives, given the looming anniversary and the tensions over the negotiations, according to authority and foundation officials. Ultimately, at least two midlevel authority executives did go.
The first hint of tensions occurred after the 10th anniversary commemoration, when reports surfaced that Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie were annoyed at Mr. Bloomberg and the foundation over restrictions on access to the memorial and the ceremony. The reports were later denied by aides to the two governors.
The dispute entered a new stage in June with a struggle over who would control the overall memorial.
The conflict over what many New Yorkers regard as a hallowed site carries political risks for the mayor and the governor.
Mr. Bloomberg has raised tens of millions of dollars for the museum and has contributed $15 million of his own money, but he may leave office at the end of 2013 with a legacy project in disarray. And Mr. Cuomo may be blamed for the standstill as talk of political dysfunction and a failed museum dominates news media coverage of the 11th anniversary.
The foundation, which has collected $450 million in private donations, estimates that it will take another year of construction work to complete the museum and two or three more months to install the exhibits and prepare for an opening.
Asked to explain the reasons for the impasse, Mr. Bloomberg's aides would say only that negotiations were continuing.
''The delay is hugely disappointing to family members of victims and the many stakeholders who have worked hard to curate the museum,'' said Julie Wood, a Bloomberg spokeswoman. ''But we are confident that the finished product will be the definitive historical accounting of that terrible day.''
Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said, ''They are working through complex financial and economic issues, but we are cautiously optimistic'' about an agreement.
The delay contrasts with advances on the rest of the site. The new signature skyscraper has reached its zenith at 104 floors, the mezzanine for the transportation hub is essentially complete, and the vehicle security center is nearing street level.
Officials say 4.5 million people have visited the Sept. 11 memorial since it opened a year ago. (The memorial covers eight acres at street level, while the 100,000-square-foot museum is seven floors below ground.)
The dispute over the museum represents a return to the political squabbling, delays and inaction that characterized the rebuilding of the 16-acre trade center site before 2008, when new leadership at the Port Authority forged an agreement on a construction plan.
But it also reflects the extraordinary costs of nearly every project at ground zero, including the skyscraper at 1 World Trade Center and the transportation center.
Under a 2006 agreement, the foundation was to raise $700 million to build the museum, including from private donations and state and federal money.
The Port Authority was responsible for building it and paying for hundreds of millions of dollars in related expenses. The authority is also required to formally lease or transfer the parcel to the foundation.
There has long been friction between the foundation and the authority over the rising costs of the project. The authority largely stopped construction after the 10th anniversary, arguing that the foundation owed it $150 million to $300 million.
Cuomo aides contended that the full cost of the museum had ballooned to $1.3 billion. The foundation countered that the Port Authority owed it more than $100 million because of the authority's failure to complete the museum in 2009, as originally promised.
Subsequent negotiations between the mayor's office and authority officials appointed by Mr. Cuomo reached what they thought was a tentative agreement in April 2012 in which the foundation agreed to pay the authority an additional $75 million and rent space at 1 World Trade Center.
But then Mr. Cuomo sought assurances that the foundation had a plan to cover the museum's $60 million operating budget, saying that he did not want the authority saddled with additional costs in the event of a shortfall.
In recognition of the enormous public investment in the museum, the governor also sought some oversight of the memorial and the museum.
Executives at the foundation viewed Mr. Cuomo's moves as a slap at Mr. Bloomberg, who became chairman and chief fund-raiser for the foundation in 2006.
Late last week, foundation board members said they were trying to step up pressure on Bloomberg and Cuomo officials to resolve the impasse.
''People walk up to the doors of the museum, and the doors are locked,'' said Christine A. Ferer, a board member whose husband, Neil D. Levin, the executive director of the Port Authority, died in the attack. ''Locked inside is the full story of 9/11.''

HEADLINE: This Year, a Weak Economy Is a Relative Term

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE unemployment rate is 8.1 percent, hiring has slowed to a trickle and the economy is weak. For a president seeking re-election, those are high hurdles.
In fact, if the maxim, ''It's the economy, stupid,'' still has any validity in American politics, it might seem that Barack Obama's goose is already cooked.
But that's not what the polls or prediction markets are showing. President Obama and Mitt Romney appear to be running neck-and-neck, and in major betting markets Mr. Obama is the heavy favorite. 
Has the economy lost some of its ability to influence politics?
Not at all, says Ray C. Fair, the Yale economics professor who uses economic data to predict presidential elections. As the final stretch of the campaign begins, Professor Fair's equations suggest that the economy is a liability for President Obama. But while the economy is weak, Professor Fair says, it's not all that weak, so his model is producing an emotionally unsatisfying result: based on the state of the economy alone, this election is just too close to call.
For a year in which a truly dismal economy sealed the electoral fate of an incumbent president, he says, look at 1980, when President Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan. In the nine months leading up to that election, per capita gross domestic product actually declined at an average annual rate of 3.7 percent, while inflation increased at an annual rate of 7.9 percent.
Professor Fair estimates that the comparable numbers for President Obama are G.D.P. growth of 1.62 percent and inflation of 1.51 percent. The low inflation rate is a plus for the president, while the mediocre G.D.P. growth rate is a problem -- though not a fatal one.
''You can quite properly call this economy 'weak,' '' he said, ''but it's nothing like what Carter faced.'' Mr. Reagan's overwhelming victory ''fit the economic picture perfectly,'' he said. ''This is a different situation.''
He added: ''If the economy were significantly weaker or significantly stronger -- if we were in a recession or if economic growth were really dramatically better -- we'd have a much clearer picture of who would win the election. But the economy remains in a range of mediocre growth. It puts us in the margin-of-error range.''
As he has done since that 1980 election, Mr. Fair has plugged economic data into a computer model that correlates presidential elections. What's fascinating about the model is that it disregards nearly everything except the strength of the economy -- yet produces reasonably accurate predictions. The relative appeal of the candidates and the issues of their campaigns play no part.
Based on data entered on July 27, the model projects that Mr. Obama will receive only 49.5 percent of the popular vote in November, one percentage point less than Mr. Romney -- but the equations have a ''standard error'' of 2.5 percent, he said. That means that based on the state of the economy alone, the model is showing that either candidate has a reasonable chance of winning.
Professor Fair's equations reflect the historical edge enjoyed by incumbents. This time around, while the economy is bad enough to essentially wipe out President Obama's advantage, it's not bad enough to kill his chances, the model suggests. (It's available for do-it-yourselfers on Professor Fair's Yale Web site.)
Professor Fair will compute a fresh prediction based on data available in late October, but at this stage the political probabilities aren't likely to shift very much, he says. ''It looks as though this will be a horse race, a very close one,'' he says.
He isn't the only one to rely on economic data for an election forecast. Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist at IHS Global Insights, a research firm in Boston, says his firm's projections, using proprietary methods and different economic variables, show that the president is in serious trouble.
The unemployment rate is ''a crucial variable that feeds into our equations,'' Mr. Gault said, and income growth, which also weighs heavily, is low. He estimates a mere 1.1 percent increase in per capita real income growth in the 12 months leading up to the election. The model projects that Mr. Obama will receive only 45.4 percent of the popular vote.
Mr. Gault doubts that the forecast will be borne out, however. ''The equation says that based on history, a president running with those sort of economic numbers would be expected to have trouble being re-elected. That may be right. But I think there's no doubt that the equation is underestimating President Obama's chances.''
The IHS model has an obvious limitation. It is based on data starting with 1948 and the election of Harry Truman, so it includes no period with economic circumstances as dire as those faced by President Obama at his inauguration in 2009. (Professor Fair's model, which he uses as a teaching device, includes all presidential elections going back to Woodrow Wilson's victory in 1916, and therefore encompasses the elections of the Great Depression.)
The Democrats today are arguing ''that the economy was in free fall when President Obama came into office and that it has gotten back on track under his leadership,'' Mr. Gault said. ''That might be effective. It's possible that this is the election that breaks the mold.''
Many polls suggest that voters find the president more likable than Mr. Romney, he said, and this, too, could be decisive.
TWO economists, David M. Rothschild of Microsoft Research and Patrick Hummel of Google, have created a model that includes political as well as economic data, and makes state-by-state predictions for the Electoral College. It, too, shows President Obama losing.
But as Election Day draws nearer, Mr. Rothschild has found, prediction markets like Intrade and Betfair, as well as public opinion polls, become increasingly accurate. He melds data from those sources with findings of his ''fundamental model'' on a Web site, PredictWise, and finds that President Obama is actually the favorite.
''The economy is important,'' Mr. Rothschild said. ''But it doesn't tell you everything.''

(13, 49) WALLANDER III: AN EVENT IN AUTUMN Kenneth Branagh, above, returns as Inspector Kurt Wallander, Henning Mankell's scruffy Swedish sleuth, in a new season of this ''Masterpiece Mystery!'' production. In this first of three episodes, a pregnant woman appears to have leapt to her death from a ferry. Or was she pushed? The case seems to have little effect on Wallander's new life with Vanja (Saskia Reeves). But then the couple discover the corpse of a woman who was murdered a decade ago on their property. And as the two investigations become entangled, a calamity strikes one of Wallander's colleagues, leading him to blame himself. Turns out he has a good reason to do so.

HEADLINE: Cutting The Deficit, With Compassion

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA D. ROMER. 
Christina D. Romer is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.

 BODY:
ASIDE from the empty chair that Clint Eastwood debated, the main prop at the Republican convention was a debt clock, highlighting the federal deficit and the growing national debt. The importance of dealing with the deficit will clearly be a major Republican theme this fall. So far, Democrats have mostly been playing defense on this issue by criticizing the Romney-Ryan approach. It's time for them to go on offense by putting their own plan front and center.
Thanks to former President George W. Bush -- remember the compassionate conservative? -- I have a good name for the fundamental principle that should guide the Democratic alternative: compassionate deficit reduction. The essence is to cut the deficit in a way that does as little harm as possible to people, jobs and economic opportunity. This principle was implicit in much of what President Obama proposed in his 2013 budget, and in what he said about the deficit at the Democratic convention on Thursday. But embracing it more explicitly would improve the substance of the president's plan, and make it easier to explain to voters. 
The first tenet is to go slowly. Investors are willing to lend to the United States at the lowest interest rates in our history. That gives us the ability to cut the deficit on our own timetable. We should pass a comprehensive, aggressive deficit reduction plan as soon as possible, but the actual spending cuts and tax increases should be phased in as the economy recovers.
Why is this the compassionate approach? Because immediate, extreme austerity would plunge us back into recession. The Congressional Budget Office set off alarm bells a few weeks ago when it said that going over the fiscal cliff -- a reference to the nearly $500 billion of automatic fiscal contraction scheduled for the start of 2013 -- would cause a rapid rise in unemployment. Well, duh.
A crude rule of thumb is that every $100 billion of deficit reduction will cost close to a million jobs in the near term. If that isn't a reason to move gradually, what is? But if you need another, just look at Europe.
A concrete way to adjust gradually is to pair serious long-run deficit reduction measures with equally serious, near-term jobs measures -- like a sizable short-run infrastructure program and a one-year continuation of the payroll tax cut for working families first passed in 2010. President Obama advocated both in his proposed American Jobs Act last September.
Even better would be to give businesses increasing employment a tax credit so large they couldn't help but notice it, and state and local governments a round of aid generous enough to finally stop the hemorrhaging of teacher jobs and essential government services.
A second feature of compassionate deficit reduction is well-designed tax reform that raises at least some additional revenue. Our budget problems are so large that solving them entirely through spending cuts would devastate the social safety net and slash investments essential for long-run growth and economic opportunity. So revenue increases must be part of the package.
President Obama has repeatedly urged Congress to let the Bush tax cuts expire for those earning more than $250,000 a year. Increasing rates on top earners is an obvious way to raise revenue from those who can afford it most.
Many experts also recommend raising revenue by lowering tax expenditures -- the roughly $1 trillion of deductions, credits and loopholes in the income tax code. Cutting tax expenditures would probably have fewer undesirable incentive effects than raising marginal tax rates. But it's important to move carefully. Many tax expenditures, like the mortgage interest deduction and the tuition credit, go to middle-class families. Cutting only those expenditures wouldn't be compassionate: it would shift tax burdens toward ordinary families already struggling to make ends meet.
One big tax expenditure benefiting the wealthy is the low tax rate on capital gains and dividends. The tax cuts of 2003 lowered the top rate on this income to 15 percent, far below the 35 percent top rate on other income. Compassionate deficit reduction requires a willingness to raise this preferential rate.
Government health care spending is a major cause of our terrifying long-run budget outlook. Any effective deficit plan has to slow that spending growth. But a compassionate plan would minimize risk to people, especially the most vulnerable.
The central question is whether Medicare and Medicaid should remain entitlement programs guaranteeing a certain amount of care, as Democrats believe, or become defined contribution programs in which federal spending is capped, as Republicans suggest.
Democrats have been forceful in explaining that if the federal contribution is limited and competition doesn't magically slow costs commensurately, individuals and states will have to pay more. With Medicare, if individuals couldn't pay the extra cost, they'd have to settle for less complete coverage and fewer benefits. With Medicaid, if states weren't willing to pay the extra cost, they'd have to throw people off the rolls.
But Democrats need to explain their own plans for slowing government health care spending. To start with, they shouldn't be defensive about having found $716 billion of Medicare savings as part of the health care reform legislation. They should explain, as former President Bill Clinton did in his speech on Wednesday, that these were reasonable changes that reduced overpayments to providers. They should ask Mitt Romney, who has vowed to roll back these reforms, why he wants to waste taxpayers' money.
Moreover, Democrats should explain that compassionate deficit reduction will involve more such reforms. Fortunately, there is much inefficiency in the current system, so it should be possible to cut costs without lowering benefits. But if we can't save enough money by reducing waste and finding better ways to provide care, we might have to consider more painful choices.
Making the wealthy pay a larger share of their Medicare costs, through further means-testing of benefits, would be one way to go. Gradually raising the Medicare eligibility age would be another. That may not sound like a winning message until you contrast it with the Republican plan, which trusts private insurers to decide how to cut costs.
Dealing with the deficit will require more than increasing revenue and reforming health care programs. We'll also have to cut other spending. Compassionate deficit reduction requires that we choose carefully what to trim.
Spending that protects children, such as money for school lunches and vaccinations, must be maintained. So should assistance for workers displaced by international trade and for veterans struggling to recover from combat wounds.
Democrats shouldn't be ashamed to advocate actually increasing spending that encourages opportunity and long-run growth. Aid for effective public education and Pell grants that help low-income students go to college aren't luxuries -- they are the building blocks of tomorrow's labor force and the foundation of the American dream. And spending on infrastructure and basic scientific research is essential for the growth of productivity and standards of living.
BUT to make support for good spending credible, compassionate deficit reducers should be specific about what they would cut. Personally, I'd start with agricultural price supports and subsidized crop insurance programs that mainly benefit large commercial farmers. High-speed rail might be next. (Sorry, Mr. Vice President.) And if the defense secretary says that there is $487 billion that can be safely cut from the Pentagon's budget over the next 10 years, we should listen to him.
Honest talk about the deficit is risky. Voters are more enthusiastic about the abstract notion of deficit reduction than about the painful details of accomplishing it. But deficit reduction is coming, and this election will most likely determine how it's done. Democrats owe it to the American people to detail their more compassionate approach so that voters can make an informed choice.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: The Benefits Trade-Off

 BODY:
Readers discuss how to preserve Medicare and Social Security.
To the Editor:
As a beneficiary of Social Security and Medicare for 16 years, I want our politicians to admit to two truths: Most of us recipients like both programs, but we know that some economies are in order to keep them sustainable as the large population of baby boomers becomes eligible. That means raising our monthly fees for these programs, limiting some benefits and raising taxes.
When politicians pander to our ''lower taxes'' preferences, they are failing to tell us the truth. I say: Let candidates be brave enough to propose details on the revision of these two programs and how to pay for them. Disagree as I must with much of Representative Paul D. Ryan's proposals, at least we know what to disagree with. He challenges Democrats to give us details of a better proposal.
We Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries are aware that we have to make some sacrifices if these programs are to be preserved for our children and grandchildren. O.K., tell us what sacrifices. And what fair distribution of sacrifice between the middle class and the megawealthy? 
When politicians fear losing our votes if they ask us for any sacrifice, they are failing us as leaders. We are beneficiaries of a past generation that sacrificed for us. It is time, candidates, to treat us as adults! Specify the difficult choices we need to join you in making.
DONALD W. SHRIVER Chatham, N.Y., Sept. 3, 2012
The writer, an ethicist, is president emeritus of Union Theological Seminary.
Readers React
The spirit of Mr. Shriver's suggestion is admirable, but his focus is both too broad and too narrow.
It is too broad because it lumps Social Security and Medicare together even though the problems facing them are not comparable. There are lots of alternatives that can keep the Social Security program healthy without imposing costs on people who can't bear them: means-testing benefits; getting rid of the ceiling on earnings subject to the tax; applying the tax to all individual income, not just earnings from work; or (my favorite) getting rid of the regressive payroll tax altogether and financing Social Security with a progressive tax on consumption, like the proposed USA Tax.
Medicare presents a much more difficult problem, and here Mr. Shriver's suggestion is too narrow. It's not just that the program is unsustainable, although it is. The more fundamental problem is that it doesn't make sense to have a separate program to provide care for older people like Mr. Shriver and me. We need a comprehensive national health care policy that addresses and balances the needs of the entire population.
A rational health care policy would place the highest priority on caring for the pregnant women, children and workers who are the future of our country, even at the cost of limiting care for the elderly to the preservation of productivity and quality of life and, when that's no longer practical, palliative care.
Bottom line: senior citizens who have significant income from sources other than Social Security, as well as younger folks who are well off, need to make relatively minor sacrifices to keep Social Security going, and senior citizens should be prepared to make significant sacrifices in health care to free up medical resources for the young.
JOHN QUINN Detroit, Sept. 5, 2012
Mr. Shriver says, ''We Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries are aware that we have to make some sacrifices if these programs are to be preserved for our children and grandchildren.''
We are?
Some of us old people think that it would be more humane for sacrifices to be made elsewhere. Let the rich sacrifice their tax breaks. Let the military sacrifice the part of its budget that supports wars when America has not been invaded. Let the space program sacrifice some of the money that goes toward exploring Mars. Let environmentalists sacrifice some of the money that goes toward preserving endangered piping plovers rather than endangered old people.
Wouldn't these be more humane measures than weakening the lifelines for the old and ill?
FELICIA NIMUE ACKERMAN Providence, R.I., Sept. 5, 2012
It has been estimated that a person retiring now will receive roughly three times in Medicare benefits what he or she paid in Medicare taxes. One equitable solution to the problems posed by Mr. Shriver would involve a gradual move toward a 1-to-1 ratio of benefits to outlays (as is typically true of Social Security). Any larger ratio means that current retirees are literally stealing (albeit legally) from the next generation.
WILLIAM VAUGHAN Jr. Chebeague Island, Me., Sept. 5, 2012
The willingness of people to make sacrifices, such as soldiers fighting a necessary war or first responders risking their lives in an emergency, is impressive. However, when the comfortable demand sacrifices from people who are already experiencing hardship, it is repugnant.
I know nothing of Mr. Shriver's personal situation, but I do know the data on the living standards of the elderly. The vast majority are not especially well off. For two thirds of people over age 65, their Social Security checks comprise more than half of their income. These checks average just over $1,200 a month.
Medicare is a problem of a broken health care system. The problem is not that seniors are getting too much in the sense that they are getting better care than people do in other countries; the problem is that we are paying too much for the care. If our per-person costs were anywhere close to what they are in countries with longer life expectancies than ours, we would be looking at huge budget surpluses, not deficits.
The sacrifices should come from the doctors and highly paid medical specialists, the drug companies and the hospital administrators. This is clear to anyone who looks at the data.
DEAN BAKER Co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research Washington, Sept. 5, 2012
Currently, individuals earning more than $110,100 do not pay Social Security taxes on income above that amount. Most poor and middle-class families pay 6.2 percent of their income in Social Security taxes; wealthy people making $1 million end up paying less than 1 percent.
We can strengthen Social Security with one simple tweak: make everyone, including millionaires and billionaires, pay Social Security taxes on all their income. Then we can determine whether other sacrifices are necessary.
Social Security is one of the great achievements of American democracy. It keeps tens of millions of Americans out of abject poverty and provides a secure economic cornerstone for millions of hard-working people.
ROBBY STERN Seattle, Sept. 5, 2012
The writer is president of Puget Sound Advocates for Retirement Action and chairman of Social Security Works -- Washington.
Mr. Shriver urges President Obama and Mitt Romney to specify the sacrifices that they will propose to Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries if they are elected. Good luck with that.
Both campaigns are focused on the voting in the battleground states, particularly Ohio and Florida, which will likely decide the contest. Voters in those states will be inundated with advertising in TV and other media with the same lack of specificity of the speeches that we have seen at both the Republican and Democratic conventions. It is the Battle of Big Money and sound bites concentrated in small venues.
Until that changes, party platforms, fact checkers and mainstream media will have little impact, even if they can decipher and describe the different proposals to keep both Medicare and Social Security sustainable.
LESTER J. TANNER New Rochelle, N. Y., Sept. 5, 2012
At the national level, there is almost no talk about shared sacrifice. What dominates is a debate over how much taxes the rich should pay to provide benefits for the non-rich. Where is the sharing in that?
There is a much better tone at the local level, where there really is discussion about how much we want to tax ourselves in property taxes in order to finance benefits for ourselves, such as the recently built family aquatics center in my town or the drainage improvement project currently blocking my street.
What we need at the national level is discussion of taxes on us for benefits for us, and not taxes on him for benefits for me.
JAMES G. RUSSELL Bellaire, Tex., Sept. 5, 2012
The Writer Responds
There is much for me to agree with in these thoughtful letters: Mr. Quinn's call for taxing all of our income, along with a comprehensive health care policy; Mr. Baker's note that doctors and hospitals must do some sacrificing (I would add insurance companies); and Ms. Ackerman's insistence that the whole federal budget must be in view (I hope she shares my view that paying for $3 trillion wars of choice should not take precedence over funding for national health care); and -- best of all -- the moral call of Mr. Russell that we distinguish between ''taxes on us for benefits for us'' versus ''taxes on him for benefits for me.''
But Mr. Vaughan's call for a 1-to-1 pay-in-pay-out policy for both programs is troubling, especially for Medicare. That policy conflicts with the very idea of insurance -- all pay equally before misfortune visits all unequally.
Like Mr. Quinn, I favor limiting ''heroic'' measures to keep me alive in the last three months of my life. A real national health care system would use my Medicare payments toward treatment of a 28-year-old who suffers from cancer. Taxation implies shared risk and shared citizenship.
''We're in this thing together,'' the Democrats were saying this week in Charlotte. My problem with both conventions, however, is that there was little mention of the tens of millions of uninsured Americans, most of them poorer than I am, who stand to get medical coverage under the new Affordable Care Act. It's the prime ethical dimension of that law. Until we get past the ''me and mine'' mind-set, we won't be talking to one another about our common good.

Dates and titles are subject to change, and all shows are subject to never actually making it on the air.
SEPTEMBER
WALLANDER (PBS, Sunday) Things seem to be looking up for the Swedish detective Kurt Wallander in Season 3: new house, new girlfriend. But it doesn't take long -- just a few minutes -- for violence, fear and guilt to set in. Kenneth Branagh returns as Wallander in three more BBC adaptations of Henning Mankell's novels, shown here as part of ''Masterpiece Mystery!''
THE CRIMSON PETAL AND THE WHITE (Encore, Monday) Romola Garai stars as the ambitious Victorian-era prostitute Sugar in this four-part BBC adaptation of Michael Faber's 2002 novel. The promising cast includes Shirley Henderson, Richard E. Grant and Gillian Anderson.
KATIE (Syndicated, Monday) After starring in the morning for NBC and in the evening for CBS, Katie Couric moves to the afternoon with ABC, which is distributing her new hourlong daytime chat show. (In New York it will appear on WABC, Channel 7, at 3 p.m.) Reunited with her ''Today'' show producer, Jeff Zucker, Ms. Couric immediately becomes the leading contender for Oprah Winfrey's extremely lucrative former throne. 
WAGNER'S DREAM (PBS, Monday) Susan Froemke directed this two-hour documentary about the making of Robert LePage's ''Ring'' cycle for the Metropolitan Opera, the introduction to a week of Wagner on PBS. From Tuesday through Friday films of the Metropolitan productions of the four operas will be shown, one per night, marking PBS's first broadcast of a full ''Ring'' cycle since 1990.
BOMB GIRLS (Reelz, Tuesday) Meg Tilly plays a woman who goes to work in a munitions factory during World War II in this Canadian series.
THE NEW NORMAL (NBC, Tuesday) This season's new series from Ryan Murphy (''Nip/Tuck,'' ''Glee,'' ''American Horror Story'') is a sitcom about a male couple who want a baby and the broke single mom who's going to have it for them. Ellen Barkin, in her first regular TV role, plays the surrogate mom's right-wing mother.
GUYS WITH KIDS (NBC, Wednesday) Three men and three babies: Anthony Anderson, Jesse Bradford and Zach Cregger play a pair of husbands and a divorcé dealing with diapers and the other threats that caring for toddlers present to their manhood.
BOARDWALK EMPIRE (HBO, next Sunday) Having killed off one of its central characters, Michael Pitt's Jimmy Darmody, in the Season 2 finale, HBO's Atlantic City gangster drama will add Bobby Cannavale as an interloping mobster from Chicago to open Season 3.
THE MOB DOCTOR (Fox, Sept. 17) Jordana Spiro (''My Boys,'' ''Harry's Law'') plays a brilliant surgeon -- aren't they all? -- who has to moonlight patching up mobsters because of her brother's gambling debts. The talented supporting cast includes Zach Gilford, Zeljko Ivanek and William Forsythe. Also starring: Chicago, the setting of at least three new network series, including ''Revolution'' and ''Chicago Fire.''
REVOLUTION (NBC, Sept. 17) This futuristic series takes place after a mysterious event has knocked out all technology, or electric power, or something like that. It's both post-apocalyptic survival story and Luddite wish fulfillment: no lights or heat but also no annoying tablets or cellphones. J. J. Abrams is a producer, but the show's creator is Eric Kripke, the man behind ''Supernatural''; the cast includes Billie Burke, Elizabeth Mitchell and Giancarlo Esposito.
DEATH AND THE CIVIL WAR (PBS, Sept. 18) Marking the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Antietam and its more than 20,000 killed or wounded, this documentary examines the impact of the Civil War's unthinkable death toll on the American psyche. The two-hour film was written and directed by Ric Burns based on the work of the historian Drew Gilpin Faust.
I'M CAROLYN PARKER: THE GOOD, THE MAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL (PBS, Sept. 20) Jonathan Demme's contribution to the Hurricane Katrina documentary genre is this account of a woman's five-year effort to rebuild her house in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans and to bring life back to her community. It will be broadcast in the ''P.O.V.'' documentary series a week after it opens for a limited release in theaters.
TREME (HBO, Sept. 23) David Simon's New Orleans drama returns for a third season, which means 10 more chances to watch Khandi Alexander, perhaps the most distinguished member of a very large club: deserving actors and actresses who have never been nominated for an Emmy.
WEEDS (Showtime, Sept. 23) An important series in the history of Showtime's original programming -- and a pretty good show for a season or two -- comes to an end after eight seasons. Jenji Kohan, the show's creator, has promised that former characters will reunite with Mary-Louise Parker and the rest of the cast in this series finale.
PARTNERS (CBS, Sept. 24) Said to be based on the lives of its creators, the ''Will & Grace'' auteurs David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, ''Partners'' is about a pair of best friends and artistic collaborators: straight Joe (David Krumholtz, ''Numb3rs'') and gay Louis (Michael Urie, ''Ugly Betty''). Joe becomes engaged in the pilot, testing the friendship and setting the stage for madcap misunderstandings.
SESAME STREET (PBS, Sept. 24) New features in the venerable show's 43rd season will include a series of 11-minute Elmo musicals.
BEN AND KATE (Fox, Sept. 25) Nat Faxon and Dakota Johnson (daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) play a lovable man-child and his responsible single-mom sister in this comedy from two producers who worked on the Fox hit ''New Girl.'' Lucy Punch, returning to American television (some of us remember her fondly as Holly Ellenbogen in ''The Class''), steals the pilot as the sister's British friend.
BRICKLEBERRY (Comedy Central, Sept. 25) This new animated series, paired on Tuesday nights with ''Tosh 2.0'' -- the comedian Daniel Tosh, fresh off his rape-joke controversy in July, is an executive producer -- features the rangers and nonhuman residents of the fictional Brickleberry National Park. Jellystone it isn't: the opening scene features a majestic array of animals copulating.
THE MINDY PROJECT (Fox, Sept. 25) This hotly anticipated comedy, created by and starring Mindy Kaling of ''The Office,'' sounds like it belongs on NBC on Thursday nights (and it's made by NBC's corporate-sibling studio, Universal Television). But Ms. Kaling's character here, a doctor with a messed-up love life, is softer -- the first thing the show does is establish her love of Meg Ryan romantic comedies. Chris Messina plays the rival doctor she's clearly meant to be with.
NCIS (CBS, Sept. 25) Television's highest-rated scripted show returns for its 10th season after setting off a bomb -- literally -- in its Season 9 cliffhanger. So far there's been no word of departures from the cast, though this is a show that carried out one of the most abrupt and coldblooded killings of a major character (Sasha Alexander's Caitlin Todd in Season 2) you're ever likely to see.
VEGAS (CBS, Sept. 25) Taking the vogue for 1960s settings and moving it west, this drama stars Dennis Quaid as Ralph Lamb, the real-life sheriff of Clark County, Nev., from 1961 to 1979. The pilot emphasizes Mr. Lamb's cowboy persona -- upset by low-flying airplanes, he charges across the runways of McCarran Field on horseback -- and his encounters with the Mafia, in the person of a gangster played by Michael Chiklis. Nicholas Pileggi (''Goodfellas,'' ''Casino'') is an executive producer and wrote the pilot with Greg Walker.
LAW & ORDER: SVU (NBC, Sept. 26) Prime time's longest-running drama begins its 14th season without Dann Florek, whose Captain Cragen had a ''Godfather II'' moment in last season's finale, waking up next to a dead prostitute. Adam Baldwin will step in for a few episodes as the interim captain.
THE NEIGHBORS (ABC, Sept. 26) The new family in a New Jersey subdivision learns that all of their neighbors are aliens who have adopted the names of famous Earth athletes. Created by Dan Fogelman, screenwriter of ''Cars'' and ''Crazy Stupid Love,'' this is the most offbeat of the fall's eight new network sitcoms by a Usain Bolt-size margin.
ELEMENTARY (CBS, Sept. 27) There's some chutzpah involved in introducing an updated Sherlock Holmes series, given that the BBC's ''Sherlock'' is one of the best new TV shows of the last few years. This American version stars Jonny Lee Miller of ''Trainspotting'' and ''Eli Stone'' as a Holmes who's living in New York after coming off drug rehab and Lucy Liu as his Watson, who has been hired by his father to keep an eye on him.
LAST RESORT (ABC, Sept. 27) Andre Braugher stars as the captain of an American submarine in this pre-apocalyptic drama. After declining to follow a suspicious order to fire on Pakistan, the captain and his crew take over a tropical island and hold the world hostage with their 18 nuclear missiles while trying to figure out what's gone wrong in Washington. As for the writers, they'll be figuring out how to keep that premise viable for more than a few episodes.
FRINGE (Fox, Sept. 28) One of the most sheerly entertaining shows on TV -- and a show a lot of allegedly educated people have never heard of -- embarks on its final 13-episode run. Olivia (Anna Torv), Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) begin the final battle against the fedora-wearing Observers, now abetted by Olivia and Peter's daughter, Etta.
MADE IN JERSEY (CBS, Sept. 28) Worlds, and perhaps stereotypes, collide as a first-year lawyer from a big Italian family in New Jersey (Janet Montgomery) goes to work for a high-class Manhattan firm. Kyle MacLachlan plays the blue-blooded founding partner, Donna Murphy plays the blue-fingernailed Italian mother.
TALES OF MASKED MAN (PBS, Sept. 28) Carlos Avila's documentary about the luchadores, the masked warriors of professional wrestling on both sides of the Mexico-United States border, opens Voces, PBS's annual celebration of Latino culture.
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (Nickelodeon, Sept. 29) Will reviving a comic-book franchise that's already been the basis of three series help revive Nickelodeon's fortunes in its long battle with Disney for kid-TV supremacy? Some high-profile actors -- Jason Biggs, Sean Astin -- will lend their voices to the sewer-dwelling heroes.
666 PARK AVENUE (ABC, Sept. 30) ''Revenge'' meets ''Rosemary's Baby,'' or at least that's what the marketing seems to promise. Rachael Taylor and Dave Annable play young arrivals from the Midwest who are offered jobs as managers of a historic Manhattan apartment building, but quickly discover that the building and its owner (Terry O'Quinn, flashing his scary eyes) have supernatural secrets.
CALL THE MIDWIFE (PBS, Sept. 30) When this period drama was shown on BBC earlier this year it averaged more viewers (8.7 million) than the first season of ''Downton Abbey'' on ITV in 2010 (8.4 million). PBS will now see if Americans respond as enthusiastically to the stories of young women working as midwives in the poorest parts of London in the 1950s. Jessica Raine leads a cast that includes Vanessa Redgrave, Pam Ferris (''Rosemary and Thyme''), Jenny Agutter and the comedian Miranda Hart.
THE GOOD WIFE (CBS, Sept. 30) The top-flight legal drama is embroiled in drama both on and off screen. As Season 4 begins, the firm's financial troubles grow worse (Nathan Lane guest-stars as a court-appointed trustee) while an armed Kalinda faces off with her ex-husband. Kristin Chenoweth, scheduled to have a recurring role as a reporter, will appear in just one episode because of a head injury she suffered while filming the season premiere.
HOMELAND (Showtime, Sept. 30) Last season's best new drama returns, with the resolution of a cliffhanger you don't see every season: how has Carrie (Claire Danes) weathered her electroconvulsive treatments? It's been a good year for cliffhangers at Showtime, actually. ''Dexter'' also returns this night, for its seventh season, and we'll learn how the serial killer of the title explains to his detective-sister why she found him plunging a knife into a man's heart.
THE SIMPSONS (Fox, Sept. 30) Extending its record as the longest-running prime-time scripted series, ''The Simpsons'' begins its 24th season.
OCTOBER

Kristof to meet female activists around the world working in areas like health care, education and economic empowerment for women. The two-night, four-hour program was inspired by Mr. Kristof and Sheryl Wu-Dunn's book ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide.''
AIRPORT 24/7: MIAMI (Travel, Oct. 2) Maybe this reality series featuring nine workers in various jobs at Miami International Airport will make you more understanding the next time you're stuck in a security line or your suitcase is lost. Or maybe not.
SEE DAD RUN (Nickelodeon, Oct. 6) Leading a series for the first time since ''Charles in Charge'' (1984-90), Scott Baio plays a sitcom star who becomes a stay-at-home dad when his own series ends and his wife goes back to work.
STEEL MAGNOLIAS (Lifetime, Oct. 7) The hairstyles at Truvy's salon may look a little different in this remake of the 1989 hit film, directed by Kenny Leon (''A Raisin in the Sun''). This time around the all-star cast includes Queen Latifah, Phylicia Rashad, Jill Scott and Alfre Woodard.
TITANIC: BLOOD AND STEEL (Encore, Oct. 8) The year's second Titanic mini-series (after ''Titanic'' on ABC) is a big-budget European production whose cast includes Derek Jacobi, Neve Campbell and, as J .P. Morgan, Chris Noth.
DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG (CW, Oct. 9) Joss Whedon's pioneering Web series, a musical horror spoof starring Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion, comes to television with its three parts edited into a one-hour broadcast.
ARROW (CW, Oct. 10) The producers Greg Berlanti (''Political Animals,'' the ''Green Lantern'' film) and Marc Guggenheim (''FlashForward,'' ''Eli Stone'') are behind this superhero series based on the Green Arrow comic books. Stephen Amell (''Private Practice'') stars.
CHICAGO FIRE (NBC, Oct. 10) In one of his infrequent forays outside the ''Law & Order'' universe, Dick Wolf is executive producer of this series about -- yes -- a Chicago firehouse. The firefighters include Jesse Spencer of ''House'' and David Eigenberg of ''Sex and the City,'' and their chief is played by the estimable Eamonn Walker (Kareem Said in ''Oz'').
NASHVILLE (ABC, Oct. 10) Having finished her one-season run in ''American Horror Story'' -- and earned an Emmy nomination for it -- Connie Britton now stars in this country-music drama created by Callie Khouri (''Thelma and Louise''). As a longtime star facing a sudden decline in popularity and a challenge from an unscrupulous ingénue, she's the Bette Davis to Hayden Panettiere's Anne Baxter.
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (CW, Oct. 11) Kristin Kreuk of ''Smallville'' is the beauty, a homicide detective haunted by her mother's death (would someone please count how many TV shows are playing the dead-mother card?), while the New Zealand actor Jay Ryan is the beast, a good-looking guy who turns super strong and scary when he gets angry. Together they'll solve cases and radiate sexual tension.
THE WALKING DEAD (AMC, Oct. 14) The top-flight British actor David Morrissey (''Thorne,'' ''State of Play'') joins AMC's bleak zombie series for its third season.
EMILY OWENS M.D. (CW, Oct. 16) Mamie Gummer, familiar from her guest role as the disingenuous lawyer Nancy Crozier on ''The Good Wife,'' stars in this lighthearted medical drama as an insecure intern at a Denver hospital. With ''Emily Owens'' joining the returning ''Hart of Dixie,'' doctor shows now represent 20 percent of CW's prime-time schedule.
UNDEREMPLOYED (MTV, Oct. 16) ''I Just Want My Pants Back'' didn't do so well, but MTV will take another shot at capturing the mind-set of the millennials with this hourlong dramedy from Craig Wright, creator of ''Dirty Sexy Money.'' Diego Boneta (''Rock of Ages'') leads a largely unknown cast playing five friends living in Chicago after college.
WORLD WITHOUT END (Reelz, Oct. 17) Cynthia Nixon and Miranda Richardson star in this eight-hour mini-series based on a Ken Follett novel, a sequel to ''The Pillars of the Earth'' (shown on Starz in 2010). Medieval action -- war, natural disaster, plague -- takes place two centuries after the building of the cathedral in ''Pillars.''
ETHEL (HBO, Oct. 18) Rory Kennedy, whose documentaries for HBO have included ''Ghosts of Abu Ghraib'' and ''Bobby Fischer Against the World,'' takes on a subject closer to home -- much closer to home: her mother, Ethel Kennedy, widow of Robert F. Kennedy.
COMMUNITY (NBC, Oct. 19) After its show runner, Dan Harmon, was let go in a highly publicized creator-rectomy, NBC's best comedy returns with a new writing-producing team and an ugly new time slot, 8:30 p.m. on Fridays.
HUNTED (Cinemax, Oct. 19) This British espionage series was created by Frank Spotnitz of ''X-Files'' fame and is a close cousin of ''Strike Back,'' also on Cinemax, which Mr. Spotnitz wrote for. Both employ the three S's of international action -- spying, shooting and sex -- but ''Hunted'' boasts Melissa George as its lethally sexy operative.
THE GIRL (HBO, Oct. 20) Toby Jones (''Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'') is Alfred Hitchcock and Sienna Miller (''Factory Girl'') is Tippi Hedren in this fictional account of the semi-abusive relationship between director and actress on the sets of ''The Birds'' and ''Marnie.''
ANGRY LITTLE ASIAN GIRL (MNet, Oct. 26) The actress and cartoonist Lela Lee's weekly comic becomes an animated TV series. Margaret Cho, whose 1990s sitcom ''All-American Girl'' will be part of the show's DNA, provides the voice of the angry little Asian girl's mother.
INDEPENDENT LENS (PBS, Oct. 29) The award-winning film series moves to Monday nights for its 11th season, opening with Macky Alston's documentary ''Love Free or Die,'' about the first openly gay Episcopal bishop, which won a special jury prize this year at the Sundance Film Festival.
NOVEMBER
MALIBU COUNTRY (ABC, Nov. 2) Having moved her family to Los Angeles in 2001 so she could star in the sitcom ''Reba,'' Reba McEntire now plays a woman who moves her family to Los Angeles so she can revive her singing career (and get away from the husband she's divorcing) in this new sitcom. Lily Tomlin plays the granny role in this ''Beverly Hillbillies'' update.
BROWNCOATS UNITE (Science, Nov. 11) Actors and writers from the short-lived, much-loved outer-space western ''Firefly'' will reminisce to mark the 10th anniversary of the show's debut on Fox (which was actually Dec. 20, 2002). There will also be a marathon of the 14-episode series. (''Browncoats'' refers to the freedom-fighter characters on ''Firefly'' and to the show's frighteningly devoted fans.)
CATFISH: THE TV SHOW (MTV, Nov. 12) In the 2010 documentary ''Catfish,'' Nev Shulman tried to persuade the directors to let him out of the film as it became clear that the online relationship Nev had been pursuing was not what it appeared to be. In this reality series, Mr. Shulman will lead others through that same on-camera journey, as they meet the people they've fallen in love with through the Internet.
UNTOLD HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES (Showtime, Nov. 12) Not much is known about Oliver Stone's 10-part documentary, which has been in the works for years and was announced for, and then pulled from, the 2011 New York Film Festival.
FRONTIER EARTH (Animal Planet, Nov. 13) Dave Salmoni hosts a six-part series that looks at rare animals like the killer whale and the Komodo dragon.
CROSSFIRE HURRICANE (HBO, Nov. 15) Directed by Brett Morgen (''The Kid Stays in the Picture''), this documentary about the Rolling Stones was made with the cooperation of the band and is labeled ''a new film from the Rolling Stones,'' so don't expect anything too controversial.
THE DUST BOWL (PBS, Nov. 18) Exhibiting an uncanny sense of timing, Ken Burns delivers a documentary that should have ecological, economic and cultural resonance in America's current climate.

The book takes a comprehensive look at prediction across 13 fields, ranging from sports betting to earthquake forecasting. Since 2009, I have been traveling the country to meet with experts and practitioners in each of these fields in an effort to uncover common bonds. The book asks an ambitious question: What makes predictions succeed or fail?
It was enlightening to speak with men and women at the forefront of science and technology. But I found that despite their best efforts, their predictions have often gone poorly:
[If] prediction is the truest way to put our information to the test, we have not scored well. In November 2007, economists in the Survey of Professional Forecasters - examining some 45,000 economic-data series - foresaw less than a 1-in-500 chance of an economic meltdown as severe as the one that would begin one month later. Attempts to predict earthquakes have continued to envisage disasters that never happened and failed to prepare us for those, like the 2011 disaster in Japan, that did.
The discipline of meteorology is an exception. Weather forecasts are better than they were 10 or 20 years ago.
A quarter-century ago, for instance, the average error in a hurricane forecast, made three days in advance of landfall, was about 350 miles. That meant that if you had a hurricane sitting in the Gulf of Mexico, it might just as easily hit Houston or Tallahassee, Fla. -- essentially the entire Gulf Coast was in play, making evacuation and planning all but impossible.
Today, although there are storms like Hurricane Isaac that are tricky for forecasters, the average miss is much less: only about 100 miles.
The article explores how weather forecasters have managed to achieve this, and what we might learn from them.
It is not a simple story, exactly. The book, like this blog, is detail-oriented. In fact, one of the arguments that it advances is that we are sometimes too willing to take elegantly written narratives as substitutes for a more uncertain truth.
But there is a healthy balance between computer modeling and human judgment in weather forecasting that is lacking in many other disciplines. Usually, we either take the output from poorly designed models too credulously (as in the case of the models that asserted mortgage-backed securities were incredibly safe investments), or we value our own subjective judgment much too highly (as in the case of baseball in the pre-'Moneyball' era.)
Weather forecasters, however, have an unusually good sense of the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches:
But there are literally countless other areas in which weather models fail in more subtle ways and rely on human correction. Perhaps the computer tends to be too conservative on forecasting nighttime rainfalls in Seattle when there's a low-pressure system in Puget Sound. Perhaps it doesn't know that the fog in Acadia National Park in Maine will clear up by sunrise if the wind is blowing in one direction but can linger until midmorning if it's coming from another. These are the sorts of distinctions that forecasters glean over time as they learn to work around potential flaws in the computer's forecasting model, in the way that a skilled pool player can adjust to the dead spots on the table at his local bar.
I hope that you will consider reading the article and the book.

HEADLINE: Documentary Takes a Business View of Street Drug Trade

BYLINE: MICHAEL CIEPLY


HIGHLIGHT: "How to Make Money Selling Drugs," a new documentary film, takes a businesslike look at the world of street drugs, offering professional advice to and assessing the prospects of low-level dealers. 

 BODY:
TORONTO - Films that take an outsider's view of business are routine at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2010, for instance, financial corruption was in vogue, as "Inside Job," "Client 9," and "Casino Jack" all exposed the seamy underside of Wall Street and the lobbying business.
But at least one picture turned the tables this year, by taking a businesslike look at an outsiders' world: street drugs.
In fact, "How to Make Money Selling Drugs, " a documentary directed by Matthew Cooke and produced by Bert Marcus and Adrian Grenier, pushed the boundaries of alternative economics by examining those who sell drugs and those who prosecute the dealers as parts of the same business.
And a big business it is.
The film pegs the annual income of an accomplished domestic drug importer - a notch or two below those who operate international cartels - at $100 million a year or more. It puts what it terms yearly revenue for the related prison industry at $50 billion - about five times the annual movie box-office sales in the United States and Canada. "This was born out of an economics class," said Mr. Cooke, who spoke outside a screening Sunday. During a summer session at Harvard, he explained, a professor analyzed the war on drugs as an instance of huge business failure, not unlike the airline and auto industries of a few years ago. Some years later, Mr. Cooke connected with Mr. Marcus, a former radio producer who now makes movies through his own production company and film finance fund. With Mr. Grenier, the actor best known for "Entourage," they decided to spin the professor's notion into something of their own.
 "How to Make Money Selling Drugs" starts at the bottom, giving professional advice to, and assessing the prospects of, street-level dealers who, by Mr. Cooke's reckoning, make minimum wage or less when they enter the business. But some quickly climb the ladder, organizing customer networks, supply chains, security apparatus and financial controls.
Prison is described as a cross between business school, where you get an education in market dynamics, and a giant job fair, where prospects are recruited for positions on the outside. Property forfeitures are examined as a financing mechanism for law enforcement. At the retail level, customer service is said to be paramount.
"Treat them like regular people," advises one former dealer who is interviewed in the film. He appears with stars like Susan Sarandon and Woody Harrelson, who oppose what they view as overly stringent drug laws, and famous drug figures like Freeway Rick Ross, who went to prison after building a robust cocaine trade in Los Angeles.
The film finds plenty of profit in the drug war. Yet fighting drugs is failing as an industry, the movie argues, because it requires a growing taxpayer subsidy, year after year.
As for the movie business, Mr. Marcus said he is weighing offers for distribution rights to the film, which is being represented by ICM Partners. It may be in commercial theaters this year, he said.

HEADLINE: Roll Call and CQ Today to Merge Into One Paper

BYLINE: CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY


HIGHLIGHT: In November, Roll Call and CQ Today will become a single daily newspaper called Roll Call and will merge both newsrooms, which have already been working alongside each other. 

 BODY:
As many Washington-area news outlets continue their hiring sprees to feed the appetite for political news, two political newspaper stalwarts, Roll Call and CQ Today, are following what recently has been a far more common path in journalism. They are cutting back and merging.
Starting Nov. 13, Roll Call and CQ Today will become a single daily newspaper called Roll Call and will merge both newsrooms, which have already been working alongside each other. Executives say the new publication will combine the kinds of gossipy items that Capitol Hill experts rely on Roll Call for with the deeper policy reporting and legislative schedule printed in CQ Today.
"Roll Call will become the news of Capitol Hill, but also have that policy element," said Beth Bronder, publisher of Roll Call.
The move is the final step in a three-year plan by the papers' owner, the Economist Group, to blend many elements of the two papers, except their names. 
The Economist, which bought Roll Call in 1992, created a company called CQ Roll Call in 2009 with its purchase of Congressional Quarterly.
At the time, Keith White, managing director of CQ Roll Call, said "the plan was not to merge into a daily newspaper" because both newspapers were holding their own.
"They were both in good financial shape," he said. "They were growing. They were doing well."
It made sense to print two papers, he said, because while young Capitol Hill staff members shifted to reading online more, silver-haired legislators liked to read print. Peter A. Anthony, senior vice president and publisher for CQ Roll Call's Advocacy and Engagement, said that he often spotted legislators carrying the paper editions under their arms and that older lobbyists wanted paper.
But CQ Roll Call executives noticed a shift in January 2011 when the House allowed tablets onto the floor. Soon even the biggest holdouts had moved to reading the news digitally.
When print advertising shrank to 10 percent of revenue in 2012 from 25 percent in 2009, CQ Roll Call executives were convinced it was time to merge the papers.
"The question came up whether it's worth it to print and deliver these copies every day," Ms. Bronder said. "Everything pointed to migrating the CQ Today folks to an online environment."

HEADLINE: Treasury to Cut A.I.G. Stake Below 50%

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Treasury Department said on Sunday that it planned to sell an additional $18 billion worth of shares in the American International Group, drastically reducing the government's stake in the bailed-out insurer. 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department said on Sunday that it was planning its biggest sale of shares in the American International Group to date, making the federal government a minority shareholder in the bailed-out insurer for the first time since it took control of the company four years ago.
With the sale of at least $18 billion worth of shares in A.I.G., a number that could grow to $20.7 billion if investors prove enthusiastic, the Treasury Department could reduce its holdings to as little as 15 percent from 53 percent.
Taking the government's stake in A.I.G. below 50 percent is the realization of a long-held goal by both the Obama administration and the company, helping to cut ties to one of the most controversial bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis. The Treasury Department expects to earn a profit on its investment in A.I.G., though it is unclear how large.
"This was always meant as a temporary measure," Henry T. C. Hu, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law at Austin, said. "The faster we can do this as a practical matter, the better for everyone involved."
Professor Hu described the A.I.G. bailout as one of the government's first major interventions in the economy and private enterprise, setting the stage for other major rescue operations.
The latest offering will take place during the heat of the electoral campaign, as the president seeks to defend the use of taxpayer money to save financial institutions like A.I.G.
Administration officials have long said that they would seek to sell off the holdings in private enterprises as quickly as possible, arguing that the government is not a natural long-term shareholder.
Regarded as one of the world's most powerful insurers by the fall of 2008, A.I.G. nearly crumbled under the weight of risky bets on mortgages as the debt markets soured. The Bush administration intervened with an unusual $182 billion lifeline to help stabilize the global financial sector.
In the process, it gained a roughly 92 percent stake in the insurer.
But the rescue plan was initially denounced by some critics as likely to cost the government billions, while also leading to a breakup of the company.
Four years later, the company has turned around. It has reported several consecutive quarterly profits, while seeing its stock rise more than 10 percent since the government began selling its holdings in May of last year.
The company's shares closed on Friday at $33.99, above the government's break-even price of about $28.73.
The offering announced Sunday will be the fifth sale of A.I.G. shares by the Treasury Department and is the latest effort by the government to unwind the A.I.G. rescue this year. Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that it had sold the last of a collection of risky bonds acquired from the insurer as part of the bailout. All told, the sale of those securities reaped about $9.4 billion for taxpayers.
Yet the government remains entangled in a number of other corporate rescues, including those of General Motors and Ally Financial. The remaining bailouts are expected to be largely unprofitable, especially those for the fallen mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
A.I.G. was initially expected to fall into that camp, subject to a fire sale of assets that would lead to its quick wind-down. But under Robert H. Benmosche, the insurer has instead focused on rebuilding its operations, becoming smaller and more cautious about keeping away from the risky bets that nearly caused its demise.
Since its bailout, the company has sought a more orderly sale of assets aimed at maximizing the prices it can fetch. Those include the divestiture of stakes in major international insurance operations like the AIA Group and the American Life Insurance Company.
And A.I.G. is preparing to raise more capital by staging an initial public offering for its aircraft leasing business, the International Lease Finance Corporation.
As part of the stock sale announced on Sunday, A.I.G. plans to buy back about $5 billion of the shares that Treasury is selling. Some of the proceeds will come from the company's sale last week of additional shares in AIA.
The reduction of the Treasury's stake below 50 percent is likely to bring about other changes for A.I.G. Its primary regulator will become the Federal Reserve, since the company owns a small banking unit. And it may become subject to potentially tougher rules governing its capital, affecting its ability to continue buying back stock.
The sale is being managed by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Push to Increase White House Oversight of Financial Regulators

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Under a bill that could curb the influence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the White House would receive explicit authority to influence the rule-making process at independent agencies. 

 BODY:
Financial regulators may face a new obstacle in their efforts to police Wall Street.
Lawmakers are pushing a bill that could curb the influence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other regulators, according to Congressional staff members and government watchdog groups.
The measure, which a Senate committee is planning to debate this month, aims to empower the president in the rule-writing process. The proposal would allow the White House to second-guess major rules and mandate that agencies carefully study the economic effects of new regulation. The change could, in effect, delay a number of rules for the financial industry.
Some legal experts say the White House already has ample authority to impose such demands on independent agencies like the S.E.C. But critics say that the bill would stymie financial reform and threaten the autonomy of regulators that operate outside the presidential cabinet.
"Those who support preserving the status quo where Wall Street regulates itself will find much to like in this legislation," said Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit government watchdog group.
The bill, introduced in the Senate last month, would offer a path to challenge the Dodd-Frank law, the sprawling regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Regulators have already encountered significant delays as the financial industry mounts legal challenges to the law.
The authors of the Senate bill - Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine - say they are not out to kill financial reform. Ms. Collins backed Dodd-Frank, and the lawmakers point to support among several Democrats, including their co-author, Mark Warner of Virginia.
"This is a bipartisan, consensus reform with broad support, and it will promote a more stable regulatory environment for economic growth and job creation," Mr. Portman said in a statement.
The bill's future is uncertain. Congress has little time to act during the election season, and the legislation is not on the Senate's official agenda. But some Congressional staff members say it is rapidly gaining steam.
The bill was assigned to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, overseen by Joseph Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. The committee has discussed putting the proposal on the agenda for a Sept. 20 meeting, according to staff members briefed on the matter. The committee, which will most likely release its schedule on Wednesday, could use that meeting to amend and vote on the bill.
As a last resort, lawmakers may also include the measure in a broader appropriations bill. Such a move would be the latest Congressional jab at financial regulation. The House has passed a series of bills to temper Dodd-Frank. And this spring, President Obama signed the bill known as the JOBS Act, for Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups, which loosened the rules surrounding initial public offerings as well as parts of a landmark settlement over stock research struck almost a decade ago.
Some regulators, sensing momentum around the new legislation, are resisting. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other financial regulators have raised concerns with lawmakers in recent days, in a bid to keep the bill off the Congressional docket, people briefed on the matter said. Regulators, whose cause is backed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform, say the legislation would upend their way of doing business.
Under the bill, current and future White Houses would receive explicit authority to influence the rule-making process at independent agencies, a collection of several dozen government bodies as varied as the Federal Communications Commission and the F.D.I.C., S.E.C. and C.F.T.C. The Federal Reserve is exempt.
The president, through an executive order, would be allowed to mandate at the minimum a 13-point test for rule-making. That includes finding "available alternatives to direct regulation," evaluating the "costs and the benefits," drafting "each rule to be simple and easy to understand" and periodically reviewing existing rules to make agencies "more effective or less burdensome."
For more "significant" rules - those that have an annual effect of at least $100 million on the economy - independent agencies would have to submit their proposals to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, an arm of the White House that acts as a sort of regulatory referee. A negative review from the office would delay a rule for up to three months and force an agency to explain its approach.
Despite the change, some legal experts say the bill will have no trouble passing Constitutional muster.
"It doesn't mean he can tell them how to decide, but it does mean they must consult with him - and that is the minimum required for the single executive the Constitution created," said Peter L. Strauss, the former general counsel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is now a professor of regulatory law at Columbia Law School. He added that he hoped "the bill will be enacted."
The president currently exercises such power only over cabinet agencies like the Treasury and Commerce departments. That power was gained from executive orders issued by both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
Proponents of the bill say they are aiming to close what they call a "loophole" for independent agencies, which have struggled at times to fully evaluate the costs of their rules. The bill tracks a recommendation made in a report this year by the president's jobs council.
But for years, Congress has balked before explicitly granting the White House such authority. Even Ms. Collins has questioned the approach, saying at a 2009 hearing that "the whole reason that Congress creates independent regulatory agencies is to insulate them from administration policies."
Critics of Wall Street say the bill is an unnecessary check on regulatory power. The S.E.C. and its fellow financial regulators, they say, already draft cost-benefit analyses. The futures trading commission also recently tapped the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to advise on some of its rules.
If Congress and the White House ramp up the requirements, that will translate into months of additional delays, advocates say. The bill, they argue, will also spur court battles over financial regulation, potentially handing Wall Street another victory.
"Corporate interests will likely use negative White House reviews as a new weapon for challenging independent agencies in court," Mr. Narang of Public Citizen said. "The bill could lead to increased litigation and greater regulatory uncertainty."

HEADLINE: A Sense of Waiting for Godot for Texas Democrats

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney will win Texas this year. Of that,there is no doubt. And Democrats will be left with another series of what-ifs. 

 BODY:
"It's only a matter of time."
For more than a decade, that thought has provided solace to the out-of-power Democrats who dream of turning Texas blue, much like it was before Ronald Reagan won the state in 1980. The appeal for Democrats is obvious. If President Obama, for example, were somehow able to carry Texas and its 38 electoral votes, the electoral math would become very difficult for Mitt Romney.
A Democratic-leaning Texas may seem like a dream, but for years such a shift has appeared almost inevitable. The Hispanic population in Texas (38 percent) is the second largest in the nation, and it is growing quickly. The African-American population (12 percent) has kept pace with the state's overall growth. And non-Hispanic whites have been shrinking as a share of the population.
In fact, sometime after 2000, non-Hispanic whites became a minority in the state. They now make up just 45 percent of the population, making Texas the only majority minority statethat reliably votes Republican.
Yet, for all the talk of a politically competitive state, the Republican grip on Texas has never loosened.
"We've had this discussion for 10 years now, and nothing has changed," Mr. Miller said.
"There's been a 'Waiting for Godot' nature in terms of Democrats and Latinos here," Mr. Hensen said.
All 29 statewide elective offices are held by Republicans, and Texas Democrats have been left with a series of if-onlys. the local party were better organized. national Democrats invested more money in the state. we could get a charismatic Hispanic candidate on the ballot. And, the most fundamental "if only" of them all: Hispanic turnout were stronger.
Poor turnout has dulled the impact of the state's Hispanic population at the ballot box. Hispanics may make up 38 percent of the population, but they have never exceeded 20 percent of the electorate in presidential elections, according to exit polls.
"Latino turnout is even lower here than it is in a lot of other places," Mr. Hensen said.
Hispanic turnout is creeping up incrementally, but the non-Hispanic white vote in Texas has become overwhelmingly Republican.
The political landscape in Texas is relatively straightforward. The Democratic strongholds are limited to the major cities -- Austin, El Paso, Dallas and to a lesser extent Houston and San Antonio -- and the heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley.
Republicans are dominant everywhere else, from suburbs to small towns to ranches and farms.
Each of the main cities has a different feel and contributes something unique to the state's economy. Houston is a center for health care and energy jobs. Austin, the capital, has a flourishing music scene and is a major center for technology start-ups. Dallas has a large African-American community (25 percent) and a little bit of everything economically.
Outside of the cities, Texas has several distinct regions. East Texas is much like northern Louisiana. It is mostly rural, religious and conservative. The Panhandle is also deeply conservative, but feels more like the Great Plains, Mr. Hensen said, and includes a streak of libertarianism.
West Central Texas around Midland and Odessa is the chief oil-producing region. Over all, Texas is among the nation's top energy-producing states, particularly in oil, natural gas and wind. The state's booming energy industries have helped its economy weather the Great Recession relatively well.
The Bellwether: Tarrant County
The Dallas-Fort Worth area is home to over six million people, and the two cities are often grouped together. But Tarrant County, which is home to Fort Worth, and Dallas County have separate identities. Dallas is more diverse than Fort Worth, a former cattle town that now revolves around industries like defense.
Non-Hispanic whites are still a slim majority in Tarrant County, which helps make it a much better statewide bellwether than Dallas County. Tarrant County exactly matched the statewide vote in 2008, and was just 1 percentage point more Republican in both 2004 and 2000.
The Bottom Line
There is little doubt that Mr. Romney will carry Texas. He is a 99 percent favorite in the state, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast.
But the long-term trend seems equally clear. Despite poor turnout, the Hispanic share of the electorate has steadily climbed, from 7 percent in 1984 to 20 percent in 2008, according to exit polls.
At the same time, the non-Hispanic white vote has consistently fallen. In 1984 it was 78 percent; by 2008 it was 63 percent.
The larger question is not if Texas will become more competitive, but when, both Mr. Hensen and Mr. Miller said. And that largely depends on whether Democrats can improve turnout among Hispanics. They have a few things working against them.
First, the Texas Democratic Party has been out of power for a long time, with few elections to truly contest. "The party in the state has really atrophied," Mr. Hensen said.
Second, Hispanic culture in Texas has so far not placed a high value on participating in the electoral process, Mr. Miller said.
Even if Texas Hispanics do start punching their weight, the Republicans could make efforts to win their support. Partisan allegiances among Hispanics could become more balanced.
Those obstacles notwithstanding, there is no doubt that as the minority population in Texas has grown, so too has the potential for the state to become less firmly Republican. And there are already signs of a possible future: Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio, a rising star in Democratic politics, gave the keynote address at the national convention in Charlotte, N.C.
But that Democratic comeback -- whether led by Mr. Castro or someone else -- may still be years away. In the meantime, Democrats will have to continue to wait.

HEADLINE: Romney Has Conciliatory Remarks on Obama and Health Overhaul

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO and JIM RUTENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney says there are parts of President Obama's health care reform that he likes. 

 BODY:
3:09 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney said Sunday that he would retain elements of President Obama's health care overhaul, blamed Republicans as much as Democrats for the "mistake" of agreeing to automatic cuts in military spending to avoid a fiscal crisis and acknowledged that Mr. Obama's national security strategy has made America in "some ways safer."
The remarks, made in an interview on the NBC News program "Meet The Press," seemed to mark the emergence of a less openly partisan, more general-election-oriented Republican nominee, who is intent on appealing to middle-of-the-road voters who have not yet made up their minds. At one point, Mr. Romney said that a speech on Thursday by the country's last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, had "elevated" the party's convention in Charlotte, N.C.
When the show's host, David Gregory, asked Mr. Romney what elements of Mr. Obama's health care program he would maintain, Mr. Romney said he would still require that insurance companies cover those with pre-existing conditions, just as the president's law has.
"I'm not getting rid of all of health care reform," Mr. Romney said, while emphasizing that he planned to replace the president's plan with his own. "There are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I'm going to put in place. One is to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage."
Mr. Romney, whose standing in several national polls improved slightly after the Republican convention in Tampa, said, "I'm in a better spot than I was before the convention."
"People got to see Ann and hear our story," Mr. Romney said, referring to this wife. "And the result of that is I'm better known, for better or for worse."
With the Federal Reserve contemplating actions to stimulate the economy, Mr. Romney registered his disapproval, saying that he did not think that "easing monetary policy is going to make a significant difference in the job market right now."
Mr. Romney, who has criticized the president over the rising federal debt, said he would seek to balance the budget in 8 to 10 years, perhaps after his own potential presidency would end. Any attempt to do so in a first term, Mr. Romney said, would have "a dramatic impact on the economy -- too dramatic."
Mr. Romney said he disagreed with a compromise made last year by the White House and Congressional Republicans that called for automatic cuts to military spending as a way to force a deal on deficit reduction.
"I thought it was a mistake on the part of the White House to propose it. I think it was a mistake for Republicans to go along with it," he said.
The interview provided another forum in which Mr. Romney was questioned about the omission in his convention speech of any mention of the war in Afghanistan. Mr. Romney seemed defensive when Mr. Gregory asked him about criticism from the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard -- and from others on both sides of the ideological divide --  that he did not speak about the conflict in accepting his party's nomination at the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla.
"The Weekly Standard took you to task in your convention speech for not mentioning the war in Afghanistan one time," Mr. Gregory asked. "Was that a mistake, with so much sacrifice in two wars over the period of this last decade?"
Mr. Romney answered, "You know, I find it interesting that people are curious about mentioning words in a speech as opposed to policy," noting that he had discussed the war in Afghanistan just before the convention, in a speech to the American Legion. "I went to the American Legion," he said, "and spoke with our veterans there and described my policy as it relates to Afghanistan and other foreign policy and our military."
When Mr. Gregory noted that his American Legion address did not have the same large audience as the convention speech  -- "tens of millions of people" -- Mr. Romney replied: "You know, what I've found is that wherever I go, I am speaking to tens of millions of people. Everything I say is picked up by you and by others, and that's the way it ought to be."
In leaving the war out of his convention address, Mr. Romney seemed to have left an opening for President Obama, who said in his own speech: "Tonight, we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harm's way. We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected. We will never forget you."
Pressed on his social views, Mr. Romney reiterated that he did not think that taxpayers should have to pay for abortions and that he wanted Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Reminded that he had once called himself a "severe" conservative, Mr. Romney seemed to play down that description. "I am as conservative as the Constitution," he said.
In an appearance in Melborune, Fla., Sunday, President Obama, picking up where former President Bill Clinton left off, said that the budget proposals offered by Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan do not add up.
The president was quick to jump on appearances by his Republican rivals on the Sunday morning talk shows, in which they were asked separately what loopholes they would close to pay for their proposed tax cuts. Neither of the men answered the question.
The relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Clinton started off rocky - Mr. Obama, after all, ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2008. But after Mr. Clinton's ringing endorsement of Mr. Obama in a well-received Democratic convention speech on Thursday, the president mentioned his Democratic predecessor at every stop on a bus tour of Florida over the weekend.
"President Clinton told us the single thing missing from my opponents' proposal was arithmetic," Mr. Obama told a rally here, to a burst of applause.
"When my opponents were asked about it today," Mr. Obama said, "it was like 2 plus 1 equals 5."

HEADLINE: Treasury To Reduce A.I.G. Stake Below 50%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
The Treasury Department said on Sunday that it was planning its biggest sale of shares in the American International Group to date, making the federal government a minority shareholder in the bailed-out insurer for the first time since it took control of the company four years ago.
With the sale of at least $18 billion worth of shares in A.I.G., a number that could grow to $20.7 billion if investors prove enthusiastic, the Treasury Department could reduce its holdings to as little as 15 percent from 53 percent. 
Taking the government's stake in A.I.G. below 50 percent is the realization of a long-held goal by both the Obama administration and the company, helping to cut ties to one of the most controversial bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis. The Treasury Department expects to earn a profit on its investment in A.I.G., though it is unclear how large.
"This was always meant as a temporary measure," Henry T. C. Hu, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law at Austin, said. "The faster we can do this as a practical matter, the better for everyone involved."
Professor Hu described the A.I.G. bailout as one of the government's first major interventions in the economy and private enterprise, setting the stage for other major rescue operations.
The latest offering will take place during the heat of the electoral campaign, as the president seeks to defend the use of taxpayer money to save financial institutions like A.I.G.
Administration officials have long said that they would seek to sell off the holdings in private enterprises as quickly as possible, arguing that the government is not a natural long-term shareholder.
Regarded as one of the world's most powerful insurers by the fall of 2008, A.I.G. nearly crumbled under the weight of risky bets on mortgages as the debt markets soured. The Bush administration intervened with an unusual $182 billion lifeline to help stabilize the global financial sector.
In the process, it gained a roughly 92 percent stake in the insurer.
But the rescue plan was initially denounced by some critics as likely to cost the government billions, while also leading to a breakup of the company.
Four years later, the company has turned around. It has reported several consecutive quarterly profits, while seeing its stock rise more than 10 percent since the government began selling its holdings in May of last year.
The company's shares closed on Friday at $33.99, above the government's break-even price of about $28.73.
The offering announced Sunday will be the fifth sale of A.I.G. shares by the Treasury Department and is the latest effort by the government to unwind the A.I.G. rescue this year. Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that it had sold the last of a collection of risky bonds acquired from the insurer as part of the bailout. All told, the sale of those securities reaped about $9.4 billion for taxpayers.
Yet the government remains entangled in a number of other corporate rescues, including those of General Motors and Ally Financial. The remaining bailouts are expected to be largely unprofitable, especially those for the fallen mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
A.I.G. was initially expected to fall into that camp, subject to a fire sale of assets that would lead to its quick wind-down. But under Robert H. Benmosche, the insurer has instead focused on rebuilding its operations, becoming smaller and more cautious about keeping away from the risky bets that nearly caused its demise.
Since its bailout, the company has sought a more orderly sale of assets aimed at maximizing the prices it can fetch. Those include the divestiture of stakes in major international insurance operations like the AIA Group and the American Life Insurance Company.
And A.I.G. is preparing to raise more capital by staging an initial public offering for its aircraft leasing business, the International Lease Finance Corporation.
As part of the stock sale announced on Sunday, A.I.G. plans to buy back about $5 billion of the shares that Treasury is selling. Some of the proceeds will come from the company's sale last week of additional shares in AIA.
The reduction of the Treasury's stake below 50 percent is likely to bring about other changes for A.I.G. Its primary regulator will become the Federal Reserve, since the company owns a small banking unit. And it may become subject to potentially tougher rules governing its capital, affecting its ability to continue buying back stock.
The sale is being managed by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.

HEADLINE: 'Rebecca' Is Delayed After Investor Dies

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
3:30 p.m. | Updated One of the most expensive - and troubled - musicals of the Broadway fall season, "Rebecca," is once again in limbo, with producers announcing on Saturday that a major investor in the show has died and they are in protracted talks with the estate to secure the promised money. The investor was responsible for an investment pool of $4.5 million for the musical, more than one third of its $12 million capitalization costs for Broadway, according to the producers, who declined to divulge the investor's name.
The investor, who lived in Europe, had been expected to provide $2 million for the show, and he had also secured pledges totaling $2.5 million from three other people. That money is still being sought as well. One of the "Rebecca" producers, Ben Sprecher, left for Britain on Sunday to continue the estate negotiations. 
As a result, rehearsals for "Rebecca" - which had been scheduled to start on Monday - will be delayed two weeks until Sept. 24. It is the second postponement to rattle the producers, cast and crew of "Rebecca," based on the Daphne du Maurier novel; last winter the producers announced that the show, which had been scheduled to open on Broadway in April, would be delayed until this fall because they had not been able to raise the $12 million budget in time, citing the bad economy. That delay cost the musical its leading actor and actress, who were set to play the main characters in "Rebecca," a mysterious Englishman and his new, second bride who is haunted by the memories of the first wife. (Those roles have since been re-cast.)
The latest postponement will push back the load-in of the show's elaborate set (which is already built) to its Broadway theater, the Broadhurst, by two weeks as well, and performance dates are sure to change; the producers said they would announce new dates for the start of preview performances and an opening night soon. "Rebecca" had been scheduled to begin previews on Oct. 30 and open on Nov. 18.
But that presumes that the show will go on, an outcome that is in doubt given the complications of securing a significant sum from an estate in just two weeks' time. If the musical's lead producers, Mr. Sprecher and Louise Forlenza, cannot nail down the money in that time, the cancellation or indefinite postponement of "Rebecca" is likely.
The producers declined to be interviewed on Saturday, but they said in a statement: "Since the tragic and sudden death of a major investor in early August, we have been working with the representatives of the estate to complete the committed investment. We had been reassured that the commitment would be honored, and have tried day and night to finalize this matter, but as of yet have been unable to do so, which has left us no choice but to delay the start of rehearsals for 'Rebecca' by two weeks. We are fiercely committed to resolving this issue as soon as possible and getting the production back on track in two weeks."Philip J. Smith, chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns the Broadhurst, said in a telephone interview on Saturday that Mr. Sprecher informed him a day earlier about the new delay and the latest in the negotiations with the investor's estate. "We want to be cooperative and let them work it out, but it's a very difficult, very unusual happening - I've been around here since 1950 and I've never seen a scenario quite like what's happened to 'Rebecca,'" Mr. Smith said. "Evidently the lawyers for the estate seem to be cooperating, so there's some hope, but estate business is very complicated and we just need to see what happens. But let's face it: there's a short window of time for this to be resolved."
The cast of "Rebecca" is led by Jill Paice ("The Woman in White") as a new wife, simply known as I, and Ryan Silverman (who has played Raoul in "The Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway) as her husband, Maxim de Winter. The show has music by Sylvester Levay, an original book and lyrics by Michael Kunze, English book adaptation Christopher Hampton, English lyrics by Mr. Hampton and Mr. Kunze, and direction by Tony Award winner Michael Blakemore ("Kiss Me, Kate") and Francesca Zambello ("The Little Mermaid").

HEADLINE: A Business View of Drug Dealing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
TORONTO - Films that take an outsider's view of business are routine at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2010, for instance, financial corruption was in vogue, as "Inside Job," "Client 9," and "Casino Jack" all exposed the seamy underside of Wall Street and the lobbying business. 
But at least one picture turned the tables this year, by taking a businesslike look at an outsiders' world: street drugs.
In fact, "How to Make Money Selling Drugs, " a documentary directed by Matthew Cooke and produced by Bert Marcus and Adrian Grenier, pushed the boundaries of alternative economics by examining those who sell drugs and those who prosecute the dealers as parts of the same business.
And a big business it is.
The film pegs the annual income of an accomplished domestic drug importer - a notch or two below those who operate international cartels - at $100 million a year or more. It puts what it terms yearly revenue for the related prison industry at $50 billion - about five times the annual movie box-office sales in the United States and Canada. "This was born out of an economics class," said Mr. Cooke, who spoke outside a screening Sunday. During a summer session at Harvard, he explained, a professor analyzed the war on drugs as an instance of huge business failure, not unlike the airline and auto industries of a few years ago. Some years later, Mr. Cooke connected with Mr. Marcus, a former radio producer who now makes movies through his own production company and film finance fund. With Mr. Grenier, the actor best known for "Entourage," they decided to spin the professor's notion into something of their own.
"How to Make Money Selling Drugs" starts at the bottom, giving professional advice to, and assessing the prospects of, street-level dealers who, by Mr. Cooke's reckoning, make minimum wage or less when they enter the business. But some quickly climb the ladder, organizing customer networks, supply chains, security apparatus and financial controls.
Prison is described as a cross between business school, where you get an education in market dynamics, and a giant job fair, where prospects are recruited for positions on the outside. Property forfeitures are examined as a financing mechanism for law enforcement. At the retail level, customer service is said to be paramount.
"Treat them like regular people," advises one former dealer who is interviewed in the film. He appears with stars like Susan Sarandon and Woody Harrelson, who oppose what they view as overly stringent drug laws, and famous drug figures like Freeway Rick Ross, who went to prison after building a robust cocaine trade in Los Angeles.
The film finds plenty of profit in the drug war. Yet fighting drugs is failing as an industry, the movie argues, because it requires a growing taxpayer subsidy, year after year.
As for the movie business, Mr. Marcus said he is weighing offers for distribution rights to the film, which is being represented by ICM Partners. It may be in commercial theaters this year, he said.

HEADLINE: Signing Up For Internet Becomes Civic Cause

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- With Google's promise last year to wire homes, schools, libraries and other public institutions in this city with the nation's fastest Internet connection, community leaders on the long forlorn, predominantly black east side were excited, seeing a potentially uplifting force. They anticipated new educational opportunities for their children and an incentive for developers to build in their communities.
But in July, Google announced a process in which only those areas where enough residents preregistered and paid a $10 deposit would get the service, Google Fiber. While nearly all of the affluent, mostly white neighborhoods here quickly got enough registrants, a broad swath of black communities lagged. The deadline to sign up was midnight Sunday.
The specter that many blacks in this city might not get access to this technology has inflamed the long racial divide here, stoking concern that it could deepen. 
''This is just one more example of people that are lower income, sometimes not higher educated people, being left behind,'' said Margaret May, the executive director of the neighborhood council in Ivanhoe, where the poverty rate was more than 46 percent in 2009. ''It makes me very sad.''
For generations, Kansas City has been riven by racial segregation that can still be seen, with a majority of blacks in the urban core confined to neighborhoods in the east. Troost Avenue has long been considered the dividing line, the result of both overt and secretive efforts to keep blacks out of white schools and housing areas and of historical patterns of population growth and settlement, said Micah Kubic, with the nonprofit Greater Kansas City Local Initiatives Support Corporation.
Nearly three in four people living east of Troost in Kansas City's urban center are black, according to an analysis of 2010 Census data by Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York City.
As recently as 15 to 20 years ago, black residents said, they did not venture west of Troost for fear of harassment from the police. Today, they complain that their schools are failing, crime is rampant and infrastructure is dilapidated.
''See all this filthiness?'' Vic, a 47-year-old lifelong resident of the east side who declined to give his last name, said as he stared at hip-high brush in a vacant lot. He expressed doubt about how much of an inroad Google Fiber would make. ''You can't get the neighborhood to come together to get this cleaned up,'' he said. ''How you going to get them to care about that?''
Convincing residents of the importance of Internet access -- to apply for jobs, do research, take classes and get information on government services -- was one of Google's primary challenges here. The service is currently being offered only here and in Kansas City, Kan. About 25 percent of homes in both cities do not have broadband, and 46 percent of blacks do not use the Internet.
Qualifying neighborhoods will get Internet service with speeds of up to a gigabit per second -- 100 times faster than the average broadband connection -- for $70 a month. Google is also offering a television service along with Internet for $120 a month. Schools, libraries, hospitals and other institutions in areas that qualify would receive gigabit connections for free.
But the feature most attractive to low-income areas is Google's offer of a free 5-megabit Internet connection for 7 years, but which requires a one-time $300 construction fee.
As of Sunday evening, only about 32 percent of people in the neighborhoods that qualified for Google Fiber were black, while just over 54 percent were white, according to Mr. Beveridge.
With almost all of Kansas City, Kan., including low-income areas, achieving their sign-up goals, Google's focus over the weekend was here in Missouri, where it worked with community groups to register people.
The dividing line of Troost ''certainly predated us,'' said Kevin Lo, the general manager of Google Access, which oversees the Fiber operation. ''It's unrealistic to expect that we can, in six weeks' time, close the gap.''
Yet Mr. Lo said helping close the digital divide was ''absolutely a core part of our mission.''
Google planned to announce on Monday that neighborhoods that did not qualify this time would have another opportunity to do so, though it did not say when. It also said it would offer grants to community groups in Kansas City to promote digital literacy.
On Saturday, Ms. May, the neighborhood council director, and Google workers set up a tent outside the Ivanhoe community center and urged passers-by to sign up, with the center using a private donation to pay the $10 deposits and giving out Rice Krispies treats. One woman who registered herself offered to register her neighbor's address as well.
Myron T. Moore, a neighborhood activist in Ivanhoe, walked door to door with a clipboard asking people to write down their name, address and telephone number so the council could sign them up and pay their deposit. When Melissa Gilmore, 34, said she did not live at the house where she had answered the door, Mr. Moore asked if she could sign up the people who did live there. They were not home, and Ms. Gilmore said she was not comfortable doing so, though she did give her own address.
Google rolled an ice cream truck through one area, as a woman on a loudspeaker enticed residents to register. Several Google workers walked alongside, answering questions and handing out brochures and ice cream sandwiches.
Advertisements ran all weekend on Hot 103 Jamz, a hip-hop and R&B radio station, urging people to sign up for the good of their communities, even if they were not going to get the service.
In some neighborhoods, residents feared that if the service were unavailable in their communities, property values would drop and their schools and hospitals may fall further behind those in affluent areas. Businesses that rely on technology might shun their communities, they said, denying them jobs and economic development opportunities.
''It's just one more step to the east side not being able to compete with the west,'' said Monsherry Terrell, 40, who lives in the east and runs an Internet shopping business.
During the sign-up, Google faced other practical problems. Many people did not have credit or debit cards, which were required to register, or e-mail addresses. And it failed to account for numerous vacant homes in some communities, so it lowered the number of registrants needed to qualify in those areas.
Many people in black neighborhoods had not heard about Google Fiber, and many who knew only had a vague understanding of it.
Three men pulled up to Ms. May's table in a white Ford Expedition, and one of them, Kevin Jackson, asked, ''What's that Google Fiber about?''
Mr. Jackson, 51, sighed when he found out that he would not be paid for signing up -- he initially mistook the offer to pay the $10 registration fee for him to mean he would be given $10. Still, Mr. Jackson relented and gave over his personal information after prodding from Ms. May. ''You're helping Ivanhoe,'' she said. ''This has a deeper meaning.''

HEADLINE: Fighting for Bangladesh Labor, And Ending Up in Pauper's Grave

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY; Julfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ASHULIA, Bangladesh -- His tiny office was lost among the hulking garment factories that churn out cargo pants or polo shirts for brands like Gap or Tommy Hilfiger, yet workers managed to find Aminul Islam. They came with problems. Unpaid wages. Abusive bosses. Mr. Islam, a labor organizer, fought for their rights.
Security forces found Mr. Islam, too. His phone was tapped, the police regularly harassed him, and domestic intelligence agents once abducted and beat him, his co-workers and family say. More than once, he was told his advocacy for workers was hurting a country where garment exports drive the domestic economy.
And then no one could find Mr. Islam. 
He disappeared April 4. Days later, his family discovered that he had been tortured and killed. His murder bore a grim familiarity in a country with a brutal legacy of politically motivated killings, and it raised a troubling question: Was he killed for trying to organize workers?
Five months later, Mr. Islam's killing remains under investigation. There have been no arrests in the case, and the police say they have made little progress.
On the day he disappeared, Mr. Islam was trying to resolve a labor impasse at factories that stitch shirts for Tommy Hilfiger, American Eagle and other global brands. Then an acquaintance arrived unexpectedly, accompanied by a woman in a veil. The man, now suspected of having ties to security agencies, had an urgent request, that Mr. Islam officiate at his wedding.
Mr. Islam rode off in a rickshaw to help him and was never seen again.
It is unclear if Mr. Islam was killed because of his work, and it is possible that he was killed for an altogether different motive. But his labor advocacy had collided with powerful interests in Bangladesh, now the second leading exporter of apparel in the world, after China. Cheap, nonunion labor is essential to the export formula in Bangladesh, where the minimum wage for garment workers is $37 a month. Unions are almost nonexistent in apparel factories.
Ordinarily, a murder in Bangladesh attracts little outside attention, but Mr. Islam's death has inspired a fledgling global campaign, with protests lodged by international labor groups and by European and American diplomats, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. This outside pressure is partly because so many global brands now use Bangladeshi factories. But Mr. Islam also worked for local labor groups affiliated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a connection to the American labor movement that has infused his death with geopolitical overtones.
For years, mutual suspicion has defined the relationship between the labor federation and the Bangladeshi establishment. Citing labor abuses, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is currently petitioning Washington to overturn trade preferences for Bangladesh, infuriating Bangladeshi leaders and casting suspicions on the domestic labor groups nurtured by the federation, including those where Mr. Islam worked.
''It was viewed as, 'Why are you trying to destroy our economy?' '' said Alonzo Suson, who runs an A.F.L.-C.I.O. training center in Dhaka known as the Solidarity Center. ''The federations that supported the A.F.L.-C.I.O. are viewed as not being loyal, as being traitors.''
Mr. Islam's work often made him a target. In 2010, after angry wage protests shook the country, the authorities charged Mr. Islam and two of his bosses with ''antistate'' activities. Harassment by police and intelligence agents became so intense that Mr. Islam's bosses sought a truce: a secret meeting was held between Mr. Islam and the director of the main domestic spying agency, the National Security Intelligence Agency, or N.S.I.
A senior government official, interviewed about the case, denied any involvement by the spying agency in Mr. Islam's death. But Mr. Islam's colleagues worry that the lack of progress on the case reflects a lack of commitment by the authorities on labor rights.
''Who is so powerful?'' asked Kalpona Akter, who had been Mr. Islam's boss and friend, ''that they killed Aminul -- yet is still untouchable?''
A Voice for Workers
Aminul Islam was a small man, barely 5 feet 4 inches tall, serious-minded and bearing the beard that signifies a devout Muslim. In February, he spent 40 days on a religious program canvassing villages and encouraging people to be better Muslims. In a Muslim nation, his piety brought him respect and lent him stature as a labor organizer.
He had started as a worker at the Shasha Denim garment factory in the teeming industrial zones ringing parts of Dhaka, the capital. The area is chockablock with factories. Trucks ramble down dirt roads or cracked highways, with traffic sometimes backing up for hours. At shift changes, hundreds of thousands of workers pour in and out of the nondescript concrete buildings that produce many of the clothes sold in American stores.
At Shasha Denim, Mr. Islam's co-workers elected him to a committee in 2005 to raise grievances with management. Within a year, the company had fired him. Undeterred, he took his case to court and won, only to see the factory owner invoke a legal provision allowing him to pay Mr. Islam a salary of about $30 a month without reinstating him in his job.
To learn about labor rights, Mr. Islam had attended workshops at the Solidarity Center in Dhaka. Affiliated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nonprofit Solidarity Center has 23 field offices on four continents. Bangladesh already had established labor federations, many of which are aligned with political parties and draw members from public sector industries. But the Solidarity Center has kept a distance from these unions, wary of their political affiliations and skeptical of their influence in the garment sector.
Instead, the Solidarity Center focused on a handful of newer labor federations and nonprofit groups led by younger labor leaders. By 2006, two of these groups had hired Mr. Islam as an organizer in Ashulia, one of the big industrial zones outside Dhaka.
''He was vocal, and he was fearless,'' said Ms. Akter, head of the Bangladesh Center for Workers Solidarity, a nonprofit labor group. ''Whenever workers came to him, he took them as his own case, as if it was his own pain.''
By 2010, business analysts were praising Bangladesh as a manufacturing power, and global brands rushed to take advantage of the country's rock-bottom labor costs. Workers, though, were seething. The monthly minimum wage for a garment worker was then about $21, not including overtime and bonuses. Inflation was soaring and protests began to spill out of factories in the industrial ring outside Dhaka.
Mr. Islam tried to act as a mediator, his co-workers say, imploring workers not to vandalize. He had already recruited a growing number of workers to join the labor groups affiliated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a trend noticed by intelligence officials. That April, Babul Akhter, head of one of the labor groups, said an N.S.I. agent warned him ''to refrain from'' discussing labor rights with workers or the agency would take ''strong action'' against them.
''Why are you guys, and Aminul, talking to them?'' Mr. Akhter recalled the agent asking him. ''He asked me, 'Do you have the right to do this work?' ''
As the 2010 protests continued, the authorities revoked the registration for the Bangladesh Center for Workers Solidarity, the nonprofit labor group that employed Mr. Islam. His bosses, Kalpona Akter and Babul Akhter, were arrested and accused of inciting worker riots, charges they denied and interpreted as a heavy-handed effort to shut down their organizing. Mr. Islam faced similar charges.
But the most brazen intimidation came that June, when Mr. Islam was abducted and tortured by a group of thugs, led by an N.S.I. agent, his family and colleagues say. He told co-workers that he had been taken north of Dhaka and beaten badly. He said the agent pressured him to sign a document incriminating his colleagues, even threatening to kill him and his family, before Mr. Islam managed to escape.
''During the torture, they told him, 'You are trying to become a leader of the workers,' '' recalled another organizer, Laboni Akter, who worked closely with Mr. Islam. ''They told him, 'We follow you. We listen on your phone.' ''
A Secret Truce
Workers won a partial victory after the 2010 riots, as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina raised the monthly minimum wage to about $37. Many labor activists believed the next step should have been to lift restrictions on workers' organizing. Street protests would be less likely, they argued, if workers thought a fair, impartial process existed to resolve disputes.
Bangladeshi officials instead have focused on oversight. A special government committee, called the Crisis Management Cell, now monitors the garment sector. An entirely new law enforcement agency was created, the Industrial Police, empowered to collect intelligence and pre-empt labor unrest in industrial areas.
After his ordeal, Mr. Islam lowered his profile. Kalpona Akter said N.S.I. agents were calling so regularly that she moved Mr. Islam to a quieter industrial area to put some distance between him and the angry protests still happening in Ashulia. At one point, she asked him if he wanted to quit.
''He said, 'No, I want to work. It is my passion,' '' she recalled.
Finally, in late 2010, an intermediary arranged a secret meeting that included Mr. Islam and the director of the National Security Intelligence Agency. The meeting -- confirmed by three people with knowledge of the meeting -- was an attempt to clear the air so that Mr. Islam could continue to work in safety. The director gave Mr. Islam his cellphone number and told him to call if he had a problem.
But last March, more than a dozen officers took Mr. Islam away, his family and co-workers say. For several hours, officers with the Industrial Police questioned him about unfounded rumors that he was planning to organize 10,000 workers to participate in an opposition political rally on March 12. Not true, Mr. Islam had responded. The officers allowed him to leave but required him to return to the station on the day of the rally.
At roughly the same time, a protest in Ashulia paralyzed the Shanta Denim factory, which made clothes for Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, American Eagle and a range of other American brands. The dispute had a fluky spark: An angry confrontation had broken out after managers had refused to allow workers an afternoon off to watch the Bangladesh national cricket team play for the Asia Cup championship. But soon it swelled into a standoff over wages, sexual harassment of female workers and other concerns.
Workers sought out Mr. Islam, who began exchanging regular phone calls with a high-ranking government security official to try to broker a deal. On the early evening of April 4, Mr. Islam had negotiated a breakthrough. The next morning, workers would return to the factory.
By then, Mr. Islam had disappeared.
Evidence From a Grave
Two days later, a photograph appeared in Amar Desh, a newspaper circulated in Mr. Islam's home village. It was the face of an unidentified dead man whose body had been discovered by the police in Tangail, about 40 miles from Dhaka. Someone in the village grabbed the newspaper and rushed to Mr. Islam's family home.
When the family reached Tangail, the police had buried the body in a pauper's grave. The corpse was exhumed and showed evidence of torture. In police photographs of the body, Mr. Islam's knees are smashed and his toes broken. Someone had cut or drilled a hole beneath his right knee. A medical official concluded that he bled to death.
''This kind of torture was definitely by a professional goon squad,'' Ms. Akter said.
Torture and extrajudicial killings have existed in Bangladesh since its founding in 1971. In a scathing 2009 report, the International Crisis Group wrote that Bangladesh's police ''have a well-deserved reputation for brutality, corruption and incompetence.'' Too often, the report noted, security forces served at the behest of powerful interests.
''Wealthy businessmen in particular have a history of buying police support to increase profit margins,'' the report stated, citing a human rights lawyer who complained of ''numerous examples of garment factory owners bribing police officials to force workers protesting late wages to work.''
In 2007 and 2008, when a military-backed caretaker government ruled Bangladesh, at least 297 people died in extrajudicial killings, according to Odhikar, a Bangladeshi human rights group. When she took office as prime minister in 2009, Ms. Hasina promised to restore democratic practices and put an end to vigilante-style killings.
But nearly four years later, progress has been halting. In January, Human Rights Watch noted that security forces ''remain above the law'' and described the rise of a new problem -- ''enforced disappearances'' -- in which a growing number of people have disappeared after being abducted.
Mr. Islam's co-workers believe his case fits the same pattern, even as the authorities deny any involvement by security agencies. In July, Ms. Hasina seemed frustrated by the outside attention on the case, saying that suspicions about security forces were unfounded and that Mr. Islam's image as a labor leader was misleading, since he actually worked for a nonprofit group. ''Why don't you inform the embassies of the Western countries that Aminul was not a workers' leader?'' she said, according to The Independent, a Dhaka publication.
One of the biggest mysteries in the case involves Mustafiz Rahman, the man who sought Mr. Islam's help in arranging his wedding on the night that Mr. Islam disappeared. Mr. Islam's co-workers say Mr. Rahman had ties to security forces, while an investigative account in the New Age, a Bangladeshi publication, said Mr. Rahman had helped the police arrest a different labor organizer and had been seen in the presence of intelligence agents.
He has not been seen or located since the day Mr. Islam disappeared.
Leaders of the biggest Bangladeshi labor federations have condemned Mr. Islam's killing but also complained that the Solidarity Center and its unions initially shunned them and looked overseas for help.
''They didn't do anything on the ground,'' said Roy Ramesh Chandra, head of the country's biggest labor federation, a government ally. ''They have only asked for solidarity support from the outside. They only send e-mails that tarnish the image of the country, industry, even the trade union movement. That is not acceptable to us.''
This concern about national image is a major reason some of Mr. Islam's supporters believe the government may have considered him a threat. He had documented his 2010 abduction and torture on a labor Web site. This year, he helped arrange interviews for an ABC News report about unsafe conditions at a factory where 29 workers died in a fire while sewing clothes for Tommy Hilfiger.
Mr. Islam lived in Hijolhati, a small, leafy village about an hour's drive from the Ashulia factory district. His widow, Hosni Ara Begum Fahima, still lives in their simple concrete home. Mr. Islam has been reburied there, in the small dirt backyard.
Ms. Fahima, 32, is jobless and worried about her children's future. She is still tormented by memories of nighttime telephone calls from police and intelligence agents. She does not know who killed her husband, but on the night he disappeared, she awoke from a nightmare: in her sleep, she had seen her husband crying, surrounded by security forces.
''Aminul used to work for the rights of factory workers,'' she said. ''I think that is why someone killed him.''

HEADLINE: The Newsroom on Campus

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
MACON, Ga. -- From the rattling cicadas at twilight to the willow trees bending in the late summer heat, the lush campus of Mercer University seems like the last place to find one of the nation's boldest journalism experiments.
This fall, Mercer, a 179-year-old former Baptist school, is starting an ambitious $5.6 million project to try to save local journalism by inviting both the Macon newspaper and a Georgia Public Radio station onto its campus.
Reporters and editors for the 186-year-old paper The Telegraph and the radio station will work out of the campus's new journalism center, alongside students whom the university expects will do legwork for newspaper and public radio reports, with guidance from their professors and working journalists.
It's a plan born in part of desperation. Like many newspapers, The Telegraph has lost circulation and advertising revenue in the last decade, and the public radio station was forced to trim down to one staff member during the recession. 
William D. Underwood, Mercer's president, expects that by applying what he calls a medical residency model to journalism, all of these players may give the struggling industry a chance to stay alive.
''I want young people to be able to practice journalism ethically and competently the day they graduate,'' Mr. Underwood said. ''I have a concern about the future of local print journalism. There's nothing more vital to a functioning democracy.''
Mercer's is one of several such collaborations across the country. A 2011 study by the New America Foundation called on journalism schools to embrace the model of an ''anchor institution'' and do what they can to help local media outlets.
Three universities in Ohio joined together to provide content for local news organizations with a company called the News Outlet. The Miami Herald worked with WLRN 91.3 FM to have print reporters prepare and provide news for the local station. But the Mercer project is believed to be the first venture among a university, newspaper and public radio station. Groups like the Knight Foundation, which financed most of the Mercer experiment, are closely monitoring Mercer's success.
''This could be a new model for journalism education,'' said Beverly Blake, a program director for the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which provided a $4.6 million grant. ''We thought about what it could do for journalism education and to strengthen our community.''
There have been some growing pains. University officials housed the radio station in a space that has the distinct smell of a nearby wings joint. The newspaper offices are just three noisy stories below student dorms known for their Friday night dance parties. A recent Friday deadline was accompanied by what reporter Joe Kovac Jr. joked sounded like ''a wild game of Twister.''
On a recent election night, newspaper editors who were already short-staffed neglected to plan with professors in advance to have students help out. Telegraph editors and reporters who have previously worked with interns and students are concerned about working with inexperienced staff.
''Some reporters think they're going to be unduly stressed,'' Mr. Kovac said.
There's no shortage of material. Macon -- a city with 91,000 residents in the throes of gentrification -- is filled with enough political battles and economic disparity to occupy flocks of enterprising student journalists. It's rich with old Southern grandeur: it has an opera house, enough stately homes on the National Historic Register to rival Charleston and Savannah and an imposing Beaux-Arts 1916 train station where preservationists kept the ''Colored Waiting Room'' sign etched into the facade. But Bibb County, where Macon is, has a 22.4 percent poverty rate that is equally visible as residents linger on the front porches of decrepit homes that local community groups have been working to help clean up.
At a recent morning editorial meeting, Oby Brown, the senior editor of local news for The Telegraph, ran through a long list of story ideas. With many of the paper's 20 staff journalists out on mandatory furloughs and maternity leave, he said there's ''not a lot of room for throat-clearing.''
Mercer students, who say they depend heavily on the Internet for news, will be used to fill the gaps. On a recent evening, nearly two dozen students, many dressed in candy-colored fraternity and sorority pledge shirts, herded into a classroom at Mercer's new Center for Collaborative Journalism. They ate pizza slices and listened to Timothy Regan-Porter, a newly minted professor and the program's director, nervously walk them through a slide show of his plans.
''Practical experience won't be something we want you to have,'' said Mr. Regan-Porter to the crowd of students. ''It will be required.''
The vision for the Macon program was conceived three years ago by George McCanless, publisher of The Telegraph and a magician of sorts at keeping The Telegraph profitable through circulation and advertising declines.
Data from the Audit Bureau of Circulations shows that The Telegraph's Monday to Friday circulation shrank to 43,100 from 58,522 in the last five years. So Mr. McCanless outsourced the printing of the paper and tried to find The Telegraph a smaller work space. Through these largely discouraging cuts, he found that he felt inspired when he talked to university students about how much they wanted to work in journalism.
''I got a lot of energy from being around the youngsters,'' Mr. McCanless said.
In 2009, he called Mr. Underwood while he was stuck in traffic driving from Atlanta and asked him whether he would welcome The Telegraph onto Mercer's campus. Ms. Blake, whom he knew through the Rotary Club, helped the pair brainstorm how to pay for the venture. After two years of meetings, the Knight Foundation offered a five-year grant to build out space for Mercer's Journalism and Media Studies department and for Georgia Public Broadcasting to expand its programming. The Peyton Anderson Foundation provided an additional $1 million to pay for The Telegraph's newsroom at Mercer.
Mr. Underwood recognizes that he is trying to save an industry that many wise businessmen have failed at before, especially since so many students do not read newspapers.
''I acknowledge the possibility that it might fail,'' said Mr. Underwood. ''But there are really good people working on it.''
Those ''good people'' were drawn to Macon for its reporting opportunities and homes that cost slightly more than a Manhattan parking space. Mr. Regan-Porter, the program's director and a founder of Paste magazine, cut short the interview process for a job at Condé Nast to move to Macon and buy a nearly 6,000-square-foot Victorian for $180,250.
Adam Ragusea, who previously worked on a local news program called Radio Boston for WBUR, relocated with his wife and bought a 1917 Craftsman bungalow for $145,000. Both Mr. Regan-Porter and Mr. Ragusea say they love being part of a community and the kind of journalism they can do.
''I missed doing small-city journalism,''' said Mr. Ragusea as he sat in his new studio where he hosts a three-hour morning program.
But editors and professors recognize that the best way to understand the future of journalism lies in learning from and working with students. Mr. Brown said that he learns a lot about online journalism trends from his daughter who works on graphics for the Harvard Crimson. Jay Black, a Mercer journalism assistant professor, said this program gives more of his students a chance to gather professional clips that will land them jobs after graduation.
''I can only take my students so far,'' he said. ''We're trying to define what journalism is in the future. Nobody knows how to be a journalist anymore because nobody knows the direction journalism is going to go.''
In the first few weeks of classes, Mr. Regan-Porter said that a Telegraph photographer had invited a student with experience shooting live video to live-stream the sentencing at a closely watched murder trial. Mr. Black has been finding students to help a business reporter on an investigative project. Erica O'Neal, a sophomore, published an article in The Telegraph about nearby bike trails.
''I wanted to be a vet. I completely did a back flip and I went into writing,'' said Ms. O'Neal, who typically reads her news online. ''Maybe I'll end up being a journalist.''
Mr. McCanless is unfortunately the last to benefit from his vision. Since the newsroom moved to the university, Mr. McCanless is one of the few people left at the Telegraph's half-abandoned offices in downtown Macon. When he wants to be inspired about journalism's future, he heads back to Mercer. On a recent evening, he stared out at a room of students and aspiring journalists, hesitated and then smiled.
''Y'all what we were hoping for,'' he said. ''It's been three excruciating years.''

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Push to Increase White House Oversight of Financial Regulators

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Financial regulators may face a new obstacle in their efforts to police Wall Street.
Lawmakers are pushing a bill that could curb the influence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other regulators, according to Congressional staff members and government watchdog groups.
The measure, which a Senate committee is planning to debate this month, aims to empower the president in the rule-writing process. The proposal would allow the White House to second-guess major rules and mandate that agencies carefully study the economic effects of new regulation. The change could, in effect, delay a number of rules for the financial industry.
Some legal experts say the White House already has ample authority to impose such demands on independent agencies like the S.E.C. But critics say that the bill would stymie financial reform and threaten the autonomy of regulators that operate outside the presidential cabinet.
"Those who support preserving the status quo where Wall Street regulates itself will find much to like in this legislation," said Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit government watchdog group. 
The bill, introduced in the Senate last month, would offer a path to challenge the Dodd-Frank law, the sprawling regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Regulators have already encountered significant delays as the financial industry mounts legal challenges to the law.
The authors of the Senate bill - Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine - say they are not out to kill financial reform. Ms. Collins backed Dodd-Frank, and the lawmakers point to support among several Democrats, including their co-author, Mark Warner of Virginia.
"This is a bipartisan, consensus reform with broad support, and it will promote a more stable regulatory environment for economic growth and job creation," Mr. Portman said in a statement.
The bill's future is uncertain. Congress has little time to act during the election season, and the legislation is not on the Senate's official agenda. But some Congressional staff members say it is rapidly gaining steam.
The bill was assigned to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, overseen by Joseph Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. The committee has discussed putting the proposal on the agenda for a Sept. 20 meeting, according to staff members briefed on the matter. The committee, which will most likely release its schedule on Wednesday, could use that meeting to amend and vote on the bill.
As a last resort, lawmakers may also include the measure in a broader appropriations bill. Such a move would be the latest Congressional jab at financial regulation. The House has passed a series of bills to temper Dodd-Frank. And this spring, President Obama signed the bill known as the JOBS Act, for Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups, which loosened the rules surrounding initial public offerings as well as parts of a landmark settlement over stock research struck almost a decade ago.
Some regulators, sensing momentum around the new legislation, are resisting. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other financial regulators have raised concerns with lawmakers in recent days, in a bid to keep the bill off the Congressional docket, people briefed on the matter said. Regulators, whose cause is backed by advocacy groups like Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform, say the legislation would upend their way of doing business.
Under the bill, current and future White Houses would receive explicit authority to influence the rule-making process at independent agencies, a collection of several dozen government bodies as varied as the Federal Communications Commission and the F.D.I.C., S.E.C. and C.F.T.C. The Federal Reserve is exempt.
The president, through an executive order, would be allowed to mandate at the minimum a 13-point test for rule-making. That includes finding "available alternatives to direct regulation," evaluating the "costs and the benefits," drafting "each rule to be simple and easy to understand" and periodically reviewing existing rules to make agencies "more effective or less burdensome."
For more "significant" rules - those that have an annual effect of at least $100 million on the economy - independent agencies would have to submit their proposals to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, an arm of the White House that acts as a sort of regulatory referee. A negative review from the office would delay a rule for up to three months and force an agency to explain its approach.
Despite the change, some legal experts say the bill will have no trouble passing Constitutional muster.
"It doesn't mean he can tell them how to decide, but it does mean they must consult with him - and that is the minimum required for the single executive the Constitution created," said Peter L. Strauss, the former general counsel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is now a professor of regulatory law at Columbia Law School. He added that he hoped "the bill will be enacted."
The president currently exercises such power only over cabinet agencies like the Treasury and Commerce departments. That power was gained from executive orders issued by both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
Proponents of the bill say they are aiming to close what they call a "loophole" for independent agencies, which have struggled at times to fully evaluate the costs of their rules. The bill tracks a recommendation made in a report this year by the president's jobs council.
But for years, Congress has balked before explicitly granting the White House such authority. Even Ms. Collins has questioned the approach, saying at a 2009 hearing that "the whole reason that Congress creates independent regulatory agencies is to insulate them from administration policies."
Critics of Wall Street say the bill is an unnecessary check on regulatory power. The S.E.C. and its fellow financial regulators, they say, already draft cost-benefit analyses. The futures trading commission also recently tapped the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to advise on some of its rules.
If Congress and the White House ramp up the requirements, that will translate into months of additional delays, advocates say. The bill, they argue, will also spur court battles over financial regulation, potentially handing Wall Street another victory.
"Corporate interests will likely use negative White House reviews as a new weapon for challenging independent agencies in court," Mr. Narang of Public Citizen said. "The bill could lead to increased litigation and greater regulatory uncertainty."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Roll Call and CQ Today To Merge Into One Paper

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
As many Washington-area news outlets continue their hiring sprees to feed the appetite for political news, two political newspaper stalwarts, Roll Call and CQ Today, are following what recently has been a far more common path in journalism. They are cutting back and merging. 
Starting Nov. 13, Roll Call and CQ Today will become a single daily newspaper called Roll Call and will merge both newsrooms, which have already been working alongside each other. Executives say the new publication will combine the kinds of gossipy items that Capitol Hill experts rely on Roll Call for with the deeper policy reporting and legislative schedule printed in CQ Today.
"Roll Call will become the news of Capitol Hill, but also have that policy element," said Beth Bronder, publisher of Roll Call.
The move is the final step in a three-year plan by the papers' owner, the Economist Group, to blend many elements of the two papers, except their names.
The Economist, which bought Roll Call in 1992, created a company called CQ Roll Call in 2009 with its purchase of Congressional Quarterly.
At the time, Keith White, managing director of CQ Roll Call, said "the plan was not to merge into a daily newspaper" because both newspapers were holding their own.
"They were both in good financial shape," he said. "They were growing. They were doing well."
It made sense to print two papers, he said, because while young Capitol Hill staff members shifted to reading online more, silver-haired legislators liked to read print. Peter A. Anthony, senior vice president and publisher for CQ Roll Call's Advocacy and Engagement, said that he often spotted legislators carrying the paper editions under their arms and that older lobbyists wanted paper.
But CQ Roll Call executives noticed a shift in January 2011 when the House allowed tablets onto the floor. Soon even the biggest holdouts had moved to reading the news digitally.
When print advertising shrank to 10 percent of revenue in 2012 from 25 percent in 2009, CQ Roll Call executives were convinced it was time to merge the papers.
"The question came up whether it's worth it to print and deliver these copies every day," Ms. Bronder said. "Everything pointed to migrating the CQ Today folks to an online environment."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Recalling Henry Ford, the Not-So-Good Capitalist

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''When Capitalists Cared'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 3):
Hedrick Smith reminds us that Henry Ford had the reputation of a caring capitalist after bestowing on his workers the ''unheard-of wage of $5 a day'' in 1914. But for years Ford also resorted to legal as well as thug tactics to prevent workers in Ford plants from unionizing. 
In December 1937, the company was found in violation of the Wagner Act and was ordered to cease interfering with workers' efforts to unionize. In 1941, when wages at Ford were in fact lower than the average wage for the industry, Henry Ford continued to insist that ''we do not intend to submit to any union.''
Finally, in the spring of 1941 -- after violent strikes, brutal assaults by Ford agents and government pressure -- Ford and his company capitulated and agreed to a union shop. Ford workers were finally able to negotiate a contract.
A vital, productive economy depends on strong unions as well as on enlightened employers.
SUSAN DUNN Williamstown, Mass., Sept. 3, 2012
The writer teaches leadership studies at Williams College.
To the Editor:
I can understand holding up Henry Ford as an example of an industrialist who paid fair wages. I cannot, however, accept Ford's self-assessment of his concern for social justice.
Ford's anti-Semitism has been well documented. That it should not be mentioned in Hedrick Smith's article is baffling.
JACK HELLER Huntington, Ind., Sept. 4, 2012
To the Editor:
Hedrick Smith is correct that America's corporate leaders care less about middle-class wages than previously. But to make Henry Ford the symbol of a lost golden age is perverse.
Ford created the $5-a-day wage because he needed to reduce a yearly staff turnover of more than 200 percent (Foxconn has increased its wages in China fivefold since 2010 for similar reasons).
Mr. Smith also commends ''other executives [who] bought his logic'' for cooperating with unions. Ford employed a brutal union-busting operation and was the last big automaker to recognize a union.
Unlike German leaders who have endeavored to preserve jobs in today's bad economy, in 1931 Ford laid off 75,000 people, leading to the Ford Hunger March in 1932. Dearborn, Mich., police and Ford security opened fire on unarmed marchers, shooting dozens and killing five.
Labor terms may be bad today, but I am glad Henry Ford is not around to improve them.

HEADLINE: More Young Adults Have Insurance After Health Care Law, Study Says

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The share of young adults without health insurance fell by one-sixth in 2011 from the previous year, the largest annual decline for any age group since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collecting the data in 1997, according to a new report released on Monday.
The estimates are drawn from a federal survey of about 35,000 households. It did not ask how the newly insured obtained coverage, but the study's author, Matthew Broaddus, a research analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the increased coverage for young people was almost certainly due to a provision in the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act that allows children to stay on their parents' insurance policies until their 26th birthday. 
Joseph Antos, a health care policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that the provision of the new law was the only plausible explanation for the increase. He pointed out that young people have been among the hardest hit in the recession and would otherwise have been expected to be less likely to be insured. ''Nothing else went well for this age group,'' he said.
The share of people ages 19 to 25 who lacked health insurance fell to 27.9 percent, down from 33.9 percent in 2010, or about 1.6 million fewer uninsured people, according to the data from the federal study, known as the National Health Interview Survey. For the next age group -- those 26 to 35 years old -- the share of the uninsured rose, a further sign, Mr. Broaddus said, that the health care law was driving the decline among the younger group.
The dependents' provision of the health care law took effect in September 2010, and the number of uninsured young adults declined that year, too, though by a smaller amount. Obama administration officials said that drop showed that the law, which was broadly opposed by Republicans, was having an effect.
The decrease in the number of young adults without health coverage helped drive an overall decline in the share of uninsured people in the country, the first since 2007, before the recession.
The share of all Americans without health insurance stood at 15.1 percent in 2011, or about 46 million people, the center reported, down from 16 percent in 2010. It remained above the level in 2007, when 14.5 percent of Americans lacked health insurance.
Before the dependents' provision took effect, young adults were typically forced off their parents' plans at 18 or 21, after high school or college. The C.D.C. data for 2011 captured the first full year that the provision allowed young people to stay on their parents' policies.
The report comes two days before the Census Bureau is to release its annual report detailing changes in health insurance coverage for the nation. That report, based on data from the Current Population Survey, is considered the standard because it includes information from about 100,000 households, a very large sample.
The C.D.C. data is drawn from a smaller sample, and Mr. Antos said it was likely to indicate the direction of the Census Bureau's report, though that is not always the case. The C.D.C. says its numbers are preliminary and subject to revision.
Children under the age of 18 are far more likely to be insured than adults, according to the C.D.C. Just 7 percent of children lacked health insurance in 2011. The poor are among the least likely to have coverage. Forty percent of poor Americans under age 65 lacked health coverage last year -- still high, but an improvement over the 42 percent who were uninsured in 2010, according to C.D.C. estimates.
The findings are in line with those of another study, released in June by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which found that young adults were a third more likely to be on their parents' employer policies since the provision on dependents went into effect.
That study, based on a different data set, the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation, which tracks individual households over time, allowed researchers to pinpoint the details of the change in coverage for young adults.
Kosali Simon, a professor of health economics at Indiana University, Bloomington, and a co-author of the study, said that only half of that increase was made up of dependents who did not have any coverage to start. The other half, she said, had some form of coverage but switched to their parents' policies.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Mullahs

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
IRAN has returned to the front pages after a summer hiatus. Negotiations aimed at preventing the dreaded Persian Bomb have resumed their desultory course. Iran, although suffering from the international sanctions choreographed by the Obama administration, keeps adding new arrays of centrifuges while insisting the program is strictly nonmilitary. Israel is -- or maybe isn't -- edging closer to a unilateral strike. The U.S., we learn from The Times's reliable David Sanger, is considering more and bigger bouts of cybersabotage. Meanwhile, the mullahs are shipping arms to their embattled fellow despots in Syria.
This strikes me as a good time to address an unnerving question that confronts any concerned student of this subject: Can we live with a nuclear Iran? Given a choice of raining bunker-busting munitions on Iran's underground enrichment facilities, or, alternatively, containing a nuclear-armed Iran with the sobering threat of annihilation, which is the less bad option? As the slogan goes in Israel: ''Bomb? Or The Bomb?''
The prevailing view now is that a nuclear Iran cannot be safely contained. On this point both President Obama and Mitt Romney agree. They can hardly say otherwise; to even hint that a nuclear Iran is acceptable would undermine the efforts aimed at preventing that outcome. But I tend to think they mean it. 
However, there are serious, thoughtful people who are willing to contemplate a nuclear Iran, kept in check by the time-tested assurance of retaliatory destruction. If the U.S. arsenal deterred the Soviet Union for decades of cold war and now keeps North Korea's nukes in their silos, if India and Pakistan have kept each other in a nuclear stalemate, why would Iran not be similarly deterred by the certainty that using nuclear weapons would bring a hellish reprisal?
Anyone who has a glib answer to this problem isn't taking the subject seriously. Personally, I've tended to duck it, taking refuge in the hope that the tightening vise of international pressure -- and a few cyberattacks -- would make Iran relent and spare us the hard choice. But that could be wishful thinking. So I've spent some time reading and questioning, trying to report my way to an opinion.
Let's assume, for starters, that Iran's theocrats are determined to acquire nuclear weapons. Western analysts say there is no evidence yet that the supreme leader has made that decision. But if you ruled a country surrounded by unfriendly neighbors -- Persians among the Arabs, Shiites among the Sunnis -- a country with a grand sense of self-esteem, a tendency to paranoia and five nuclear powers nearby, wouldn't you want the security of your own nuclear arsenal?
Let's assume further that diplomacy, sanctions and computer viruses may not dissuade the regime from its nuclear ambitions. So far, these measures seem to have slowed the nuclear program and bought some time, but Iran's stockpiles of enriched fuel have grown in size and concentration despite everything a disapproving world has thrown at them so far. So, then what?
A pre-emptive bombing campaign against Iran's uranium factories would almost certainly require major U.S. participation to be effective, and would not be neat. Beyond the immediate casualties, it would carry grave costs: outraged Iranians rallying behind this regime that is now deservedly unpopular; Iran or its surrogates lashing out against American and Israeli targets in a long-term, low-intensity campaign of retaliation; a scorching hatred of America on the newly empowered Arab street, generating new recruits for Al Qaeda and its ilk; an untimely oil shock to a fragile world economy; an unraveling of the united front Obama has assembled to isolate Iran. All that, and a redoubled determination by Iran's leaders to do the one thing that would prevent a future attack: rebuild the nuclear assembly line, only this time faster and deeper underground. There is a pretty broad consensus that, short of a full-scale invasion and occupation of Iran, a preventive attack would not end the nuclear program, only postpone it for a few years.
Now imagine that Iran succeeds in making its way into the nuclear club.
Despite the incendiary rhetoric, it is hard to believe the aim of an Iranian nuclear program is the extermination of Israel. The regime in Iran is brutal, mendacious and meddlesome, and given to spraying gobbets of Hitleresque bile at the Jewish state. But Israel is a nuclear power, backed by a bigger nuclear power. Before an Iranian mushroom cloud had bloomed to its full height over Tel Aviv, a flock of reciprocal nukes would be on the way to incinerate Iran. Iran may encourage fanatic chumps to carry out suicide missions, but there is not the slightest reason to believe the mullahs themselves are suicidal.
The more common arguments against tolerating a nuclear Iran are these:
First, that possession of a nuclear shield would embolden Iran to step up its interference in the region, either directly or through surrogates like Hezbollah. This is probably true. But as James Dobbins, a former diplomat who heads security studies for the RAND Corporation, told me, the subversive menace of a nuclear Iran has to be weighed against the lethal rage of an Iran that had been the victim of an unprovoked attack.
A second worry is that a Persian Bomb would set off a regional nuclear arms race. This is probably an exaggerated fear. A nuclear program is not cheap or easy. In other parts of the world, the proliferation virus has not been as contagious as you might have feared. So the Saudis, who regard Iran as a viper state, might be tempted buy a bomb from Pakistan, which is not a pleasant thought. But Egypt (broke), Turkey (a NATO member) and the others have strong reasons not to join the race.
Most worrisome, I think, is the danger that a crisis between Israel and Iran would escalate out of control. Given the history of mistrust and the absence of communication, some war planner on one side or the other might guess that a nuclear attack was imminent, and decide to go first.
''You would have a very unstable deterrent environment between Israel and Iran, simply because these are two states that tend to view each other in existential terms,'' said Ray Takeyh, an Iranian-American Middle East scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, who is not an advocate of containment. Against this fear, history suggests that nuclear weapons make even aggressive countries more cautious. Before their first nuclear tests, India and Pakistan fought three serious conventional wars. Since getting their nukes they have bristled at each other across a long, heavily armed border, but no dispute has risen to an outright war.
At the end of this theoretical exercise, we have two awful choices with unpredictable consequences. After immersing myself in the expert thinking on both sides, I think that, forced to choose, I would swallow hard and take the risks of a nuclear Iran over the gamble of a pre-emptive war. My view may be colored by a bit of post-Iraq syndrome.
What statesmen do when faced with bad options is create new ones. The third choice in this case is to negotiate a deal that lets Iran enrich uranium for civilian use (as it is entitled to do under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty), that applies rigorous safeguards (because Iran cheats), that gradually relaxes sanctions and brings this wayward country into the community of more-or-less civilized nations.
That, of course, won't happen before November. Any U.S. concession now would be decried by Republicans as an abandonment of Israel and a reward to a government that recently beat a democracy movement bloody. We can only hope that after the election we get some braver, more creative diplomacy, either from a liberated Obama or (hope springs eternal) a President Romney who has a Nixon-to-China moment.
Because a frank look at the alternatives of (a) pre-emptive war and (b) a nuclear Iran should be enough to focus all of our intelligence and energy on (c) none of the above.

HEADLINE: Obstruct And Exploit

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Does anyone remember the American Jobs Act? A year ago President Obama proposed boosting the economy with a combination of tax cuts and spending increases, aimed in particular at sustaining state and local government employment. Independent analysts reacted favorably. For example, the consulting firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimated that the act would add 1.3 million jobs by the end of 2012.
There were good reasons for these positive assessments. Although you'd never know it from political debate, worldwide experience since the financial crisis struck in 2008 has overwhelmingly confirmed the proposition that fiscal policy ''works,'' that temporary increases in spending boost employment in a depressed economy (and that spending cuts increase unemployment). The Jobs Act would have been just what the doctor ordered. 
But the bill went nowhere, of course, blocked by Republicans in Congress. And now, having prevented Mr. Obama from implementing any of his policies, those same Republicans are pointing to disappointing job numbers and declaring that the president's policies have failed.
Think of it as a two-part strategy. First, obstruct any and all efforts to strengthen the economy, then exploit the economy's weakness for political gain. If this strategy sounds cynical, that's because it is. Yet it's the G.O.P.'s best chance for victory in November.
But are Republicans really playing that cynical a game?
You could argue that we're having a genuine debate about economic policy, in which Republicans sincerely believe that the things Mr. Obama proposes would actually hurt, not help, job creation. However, even if that were true, the fact is that the economy we have right now doesn't reflect the policies the president wanted.
Anyway, do Republicans really believe that government spending is bad for the economy? No.
Right now Mitt Romney has an advertising blitz under way in which he attacks Mr. Obama for possible cuts in defense spending -- cuts, by the way, that were mandated by an agreement forced on the president by House Republicans last year. And why is Mr. Romney denouncing these cuts? Because, he says, they would cost jobs!
This is classic ''weaponized Keynesianism'' -- the claim that government spending can't create jobs unless the money goes to defense contractors, in which case it's the lifeblood of the economy. And no, it doesn't make any sense.
What about the argument, which I hear all the time, that Mr. Obama should have fixed the economy long ago? The claim goes like this: during his first two years in office Mr. Obama had a majority in Congress that would have let him do anything he wanted, so he's had his chance.
The short answer is, you've got to be kidding.
As anyone who was paying attention knows, the period during which Democrats controlled both houses of Congress was marked by unprecedented obstructionism in the Senate. The filibuster, formerly a tactic reserved for rare occasions, became standard operating procedure; in practice, it became impossible to pass anything without 60 votes. And Democrats had those 60 votes for only a few months. Should they have tried to push through a major new economic program during that narrow window? In retrospect, yes -- but that doesn't change the reality that for most of Mr. Obama's time in office U.S. fiscal policy has been defined not by the president's plans but by Republican stonewalling.
The most important consequence of that stonewalling, I'd argue, has been the failure to extend much-needed aid to state and local governments. Lacking that aid, these governments have been forced to lay off hundreds of thousands of schoolteachers and other workers, and those layoffs are a major reason the job numbers have been disappointing. Since bottoming out a year after Mr. Obama took office, private-sector employment has risen by 4.6 million; but government employment, which normally rises more or less in line with population growth, has instead fallen by 571,000.
Put it this way: When Republicans took control of the House, they declared that their economic philosophy was ''cut and grow'' -- cut government, and the economy will prosper. And thanks to their scorched-earth tactics, we've actually had the cuts they wanted. But the promised growth has failed to materialize -- and they want to make that failure Mr. Obama's fault.
Now, all of this puts the White House in a difficult bind. Making a big deal of Republican obstructionism could all too easily come across as whining. Yet this obstructionism is real, and arguably is the biggest single reason for our ongoing economic weakness.
And what happens if the strategy of obstruct-and-exploit succeeds? Is this the shape of politics to come? If so, America will have gone a long way toward becoming an ungovernable banana republic.

HEADLINE: Romney, Easing, Says Health Law Isn't All Bad

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Fort Pierce, Fla.; Rachel L. Swarns from Washington; and Jim Rutenberg from New York.

 BODY:
Adopting a new tone, Mitt Romney on Sunday said he would retain elements of President Obama's health care overhaul, blamed Republicans as much as Democrats for the ''mistake'' of agreeing to automatic cuts in military spending and said Mr. Obama's national security strategy had made America in ''some ways safer.''
The remarks were a marked departure from Mr. Romney's frequently harsh and openly partisan critiques of the president on the campaign trail over the last year, and seemed to amount to a different tenor now that he has officially become the Republican presidential nominee: bipartisanship, of sorts.
They came in a rare interview on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' and not the friendlier terrain of Fox News, on which Mr. Romney prefers to appear. 
The approach, however fleeting it may be, appeared to be a direct and deliberate appeal to middle-of-the-road voters who have not made up their minds yet and are likely to decide the race. At one point, Mr. Romney said the speech last week by the country's previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton, had ''elevated'' the party's convention in Charlotte, N.C.
Asked by the show's host, David Gregory, what elements of the health care program he would maintain, Mr. Romney said he would ensure that those with pre-existing conditions can obtain coverage, just as the president's plan does.
''I'm not getting rid of all of health care reform,'' Mr. Romney said, while emphasizing that he planned to replace the president's plan with his own. ''There are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I'm going to put in place. One is to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage.''
Mr. Romney did not entirely refrain from jabbing at the president. He criticized Mr. Obama's handling of the crisis over Iran's nuclear program and insisted that should the president be re-elected, Americans would ''see chronic high unemployment continue for another four years or longer.''
But he was also generous in his praise, commending the president twice for giving the order to kill Osama bin Laden, which as recently as April Mr. Romney had said ''even Jimmy Carter'' would have done.
''That was a great accomplishment,'' Mr. Romney said on Sunday. ''Using the drones to strike at Al Qaeda targets. I think those are positive developments.''
Mr. Romney, whose standing in several national polls improved slightly after the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., said, ''I'm in a better spot than I was before the convention.''
''People got to see Ann and hear our story,'' he said, referring to this wife. ''And the result of that is I'm better known, for better or for worse.''
Mr. Romney, who has repeatedly blamed the president for failing to curb the federal debt, said he would seek to balance the federal budget in 8 to 10 years, perhaps after his own potential presidency would end. Any attempt to do so in a first term, he said, would have ''a dramatic impact on the economy -- too dramatic.''
Yet neither Mr. Romney nor his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who appeared on ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC, offered details about how they planned to balance the budget. Asked separately what loopholes they would close to pay for their proposed tax cuts, neither of the men answered.
Mr. Obama pounced on that omission in an appearance in Melbourne, Fla., on Sunday. ''When my opponents were asked about it today, it was like 2 plus 1 equals 5,'' the president said, mocking the math underlying the Republican economic plan.
On ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Romney made it clear what kind of budget cuts would be off limits under his presidency. He said he strongly disagreed with a compromise made last year by the White House and Congressional Republicans, including Mr. Ryan, that called for automatic cuts to military spending as a way to force a deal on deficit reduction.
''I thought it was a mistake on the part of the White House to propose it. I think it was a mistake for Republicans to go along with it,'' he said.
Mr. Ryan, on ''This Week,'' stood by that agreement despite his new boss's criticism, saying that he had been trying to find common ground with Mr. Obama. He called it a ''step in the right direction.''
Mr. Romney seemed defensive when Mr. Gregory asked about criticism from the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard -- and from others on both sides of the ideological divide -- that he did not speak about the conflict in Afghanistan when he accepted his party's nomination in Tampa.
''Was that a mistake, with so much sacrifice in two wars over the period of this last decade?'' Mr. Gregory asked.
Mr. Romney answered, ''You know, I find it interesting that people are curious about mentioning words in a speech as opposed to policy,'' noting that he had discussed the war in Afghanistan just before the convention, in a speech to the American Legion. ''I went to the American Legion,'' he said, ''and spoke with our veterans there and described my policy as it relates to Afghanistan and other foreign policy and our military.''
When Mr. Gregory noted that his American Legion address had not had the same large audience as the convention speech -- ''tens of millions of people'' -- Mr. Romney replied: ''What I've found is that wherever I go, I am speaking to tens of millions of people. Everything I say is picked up by you and by others, and that's the way it ought to be.''
Officer in Motorcade Killed
A police officer escorting President Obama's motorcade was killed on Sunday when his motorcycle was hit by a pickup truck. The Associated Press quoted a spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department as saying that the officer, a member of the Jupiter Police Department, was on Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Sunday preparing to shut the roadway down when he was struck. Sgt. Scott Pascarella, a Jupiter police spokesman, identified the officer as Bruce St. Laurent, a 20-year veteran of the force. The president was informed of the accident, said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.

HEADLINE: For Putin, a Flight of Fancy at a Summit Meeting's Close

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia -- At times, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seemed to be limping and in pain this weekend, but as the annual Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting wrapped up here on Sunday, the Russian leader showed some of his trademark swagger, hitting back at political opponents who mocked his latest stunt: flying a motorized glider to help lead endangered cranes from Siberia on their migration south.
Seizing on a question at his closing news conference that may or may not have been planted by his aides, Mr. Putin signaled that he was not bothered by the jokes and the ridicule -- including assertions that some of the cranes, like some Russian voters -- opted not to follow him.
''Only the weak ones,'' Mr. Putin said, after urging the audience to applaud the question, which was asked by a reporter from Komsomolskaya Pravda, a tabloid. ''The weak ones didn't follow me.'' 
At the same time, Mr. Putin made clear that he had little interest in working with the United States to encourage a political transition in Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad's government continues to cling to power with a violent crackdown on the rebels there.
Mr. Putin conducted the news conference from behind a desk -- aides said his limping was the result of a strained muscle -- but he clearly enjoyed the moment, turning the crane episode into a parable about how his tight control and strong leadership keep Russia from descending into chaos.
''To be frank with you, not all of the cranes flew, and the leader, the pilot, has to be blamed because he was too fast in gaining speed and altitude and they were just lagging behind; they couldn't catch up,'' Mr. Putin said. ''But that is not the whole of the truth: simply during certain circumstances, when there is strong wind and bad weather, the pilot has to lift very speedily -- otherwise the vehicle, the flying machine, could overturn and capsize.''
It was a thinly veiled description of his view of himself as Russia's paramount leader, and it echoed a speech that he delivered to lawmakers just days before parliamentary elections in December, in which he urged them to unite behind him ''so that the boat really does not turn over.''
Accounts of widespread fraud in those elections led to big protests in Moscow last winter, in which tens of thousands of people took to the streets, often chanting ''Russia without Putin!''
But Mr. Putin went on to easily win election to a third term as president, and on Sunday he essentially mocked the mockers of his bird adventure, deriding them as out of the mainstream -- odd ducks, perhaps, or dodos. ''What else can be said? There are certain birds that don't fly in flocks,'' he said. ''They prefer to have their nests separately. But this is a different sort of problem. Even if they are not members of the flock they are members of our population, and they have to be treated very carefully to the extent possible.''
The jabs at the opposition were bookended by more serious declarations of success about the economic summit meeting, which was held for the first time in Russia. Mr. Putin used the event to underscore his country's eagerness to sharply increase business and trade ties with the Far East.
''We believe we have reached all the goals set for the APEC leaders' week in Vladivostok,'' he declared.
In a joint declaration, the leaders of the 21 members of the economic conference, which includes not just nations from the Asian Pacific but also several countries in North and South America that border the ocean, applauded efforts to address the economic damage in Europe.
In the declaration, the leaders also said that they would continue to promote free trade and combat protectionism, particularly in food exports. They announced a new agreement to reduce tariffs on a list of goods identified as beneficial to the environment, and they pledged to combat corruption and protect endangered wildlife.
Numerous talks -- political and economic -- were held on the sidelines of the summit meeting, and some important deals were reached, including an accord signed by Japan and Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled natural gas monopoly, to move forward with plans for a multibillion-dollar transfer station here. The station will help increase Russian energy exports to Japan, which is in need of alternatives to its largely shuttered nuclear power industry.
Mr. Putin's swagger could be seen in relations with the United States, too. Only days before the meeting, he injected himself into the American presidential campaign by calling President Obama honest and rebuking Mitt Romney. But when it came to Syria and Iran, he rebuffed the Obama administration and its highest representative here, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton met privately with Mr. Putin and sat next to him for 90 minutes at the closing dinner on Saturday night, chatting about wildlife and the Winter Olympics that Russia will host in 2014. But the two failed to bridge the gaps that divided them.
''We haven't seen eye to eye with Russia on Syria,'' Mrs. Clinton said in Vladivostok before returning to the United States. ''That may continue.''
Russia, along with China, has vetoed three resolutions regarding Syria at the United Nations Security Council, but Mrs. Clinton had hoped Russia would show more flexibility as the violence worsened. Instead, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, publicly rebuked her on Syria, as well as on Iran.
''Our American partners have a prevailing tendency to threaten and increase pressure, adopt ever more sanctions against Syria and against Iran,'' Mr. Lavrov said. ''Russia is fundamentally against this, since for resolving problems you have to engage the countries you are having issues with and not isolate them.''
In his news conference, Mr. Putin called his discussions with Mrs. Clinton ''useful'' and said they concerned ''primarily economic ties and certain political issues.''
''We touched on hot spots in the Middle East, in Asia,'' Mr. Putin said. ''It was a constructive, very businesslike conversation.'' But, he added, ''no special decisions'' were made.
Twice, leaders at the meeting were jarred by unexpected news. First, on Friday by earthquakes that killed scores in southwestern China, and then on Saturday by the unexpected death of the father of the Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard.
In his summary on Sunday, Mr. Putin expressed condolences to the Chinese, as he had to Ms. Gillard.
Mr. Putin also strongly defended the huge expenditures in Vladivostok that were undertaken in preparation for the economic summit meeting. They included money for three new bridges and an entire new campus for Far East Federal University. Two luxury hotels, a theater for opera and ballet and an aquarium are under construction.
''We will certainly continue developing and improving the living conditions in the Far East,'' Mr. Putin said, arguing that the goal is to ''tap the new opportunities that integration and partnership with our Asia-Pacific neighbors opens up.''

HEADLINE: Effects of Romney's Tax Plan? Key Variables Are Left Blank

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If any single question can be said to dominate the presidential campaign, it is whether the conservative policies advocated by Mitt Romney would help or hurt the middle class. And no issue hits the heart of that question more than taxes.
Mr. Romney says no middle-income Americans will have their tax bill go up if he is president. President Obama says the average middle-class family would pay as much as $2,000 a year more under the Romney plan.
It is a conflict that grew in prominence during the party conventions and that both sides intend to push from now until Election Day. And it has focused sharper attention on what many experts agree is one of the tax code's biggest problems: an array of tax breaks totaling more than $1 trillion a year.
The breaks cover activities as varied as cutting timber, providing health insurance to employees, selling stock and buying a home, making them popular with powerful constituencies and voters. But many economists say the tax breaks are inefficient and even distort the economy. 
Mr. Romney has pledged to cut individual income tax rates for everyone, and to do it without increasing the federal budget deficit or putting new tax burdens on middle-income people to make up for the lost revenues from the rate cuts. But he has provided no further specifics, confounding analysts and leaving himself open to attack from Democrats.
Asked on the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday which tax deductions he would eliminate, he said only that he would target ''some of the loopholes and deductions at the high end'' while lowering the ''burden on middle-income people.''
Democrats -- as well as a broad range of economists from the left, right and center -- say that the consequence of ending tax breaks substantial enough to offset the lost revenue from income tax rate cuts would be to hurt middle-class Americans.
Many independent analysts contend that the only way to raise the revenue Mr. Romney is talking about would be to eliminate breaks like the preferential treatment of investment income or the mortgage-interest deduction.
Their position is central to the Democrats' argument that eliminating tax breaks -- called tax expenditures because they often function like government spending programs -- would hit the middle class the hardest.
The partisan battle underscores a wide consensus among economists and policy experts that no matter who wins the presidency, tax reform will be near the top of the national agenda before the end of the year, when the Bush-era tax cuts, worth $100 billion a year, are set to expire and lawmakers turn again to addressing the government's budget problems.
''Scaling back the tax expenditures in the tax code will be incredibly difficult,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ''There is some constituency ready to go to war for every deduction and credit in the code. They're ready to go on jihad. It will be very, very hard.''
Mr. Romney's tax proposal is built on three central pillars. He has pledged that he will cut all of the marginal tax rates by 20 percent -- so the top tax rate would fall to 28 percent from 35 percent, and the bottom tax rate would fall to 8 percent from 10 percent. That by itself would reduce the government's revenue by hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
Second, Mr. Romney has promised that his plan will be ''revenue neutral,'' meaning it would pay for those rate reductions by clearing out the underbrush of loopholes and credits in the tax code.
But each tax break has its own rationale and fierce defenders.
Eliminate the home-mortgage interest deduction (annual cost: $99 billion and rising) and risk that housing prices will plummet just as that sector of the economy is starting to recover. End the deduction for charitable giving (annual cost: $53 billion) and attract the wrath of every hospital chief and museum director. Touch the protections for investment income (annual cost: more than $100 billion) and anger everyone from Wall Street executives to retirees.
Given that reality, the campaign has said it would protect some tax breaks -- most notably the home-mortgage interest deduction and the investment protections.
But it has refused to detail which tax expenditures it would cut, leaving economists and other tax experts guessing and making a definitive analysis of its effects on families, businesses and the economy close to impossible.
''Everything is on the table,'' R. Glenn Hubbard, a top economic adviser to the campaign, said in an interview, declining to elaborate any further.
Third, and finally, the Romney campaign has said that it would not raise taxes on the middle class.
The problem, tax analysts say, is that it is mathematically impossible do all three of those things.
High-income earners would pay far less as tax rates fell. Even if the Romney campaign eliminated every one of their noninvestment tax breaks and credits, rich families would still not pay what they do today.
That raises the question of whether the plan would increase taxes on the middle class, add to the deficit or require less-steep rate reductions.
''The combination of stuff they've specified is not only impossible -- it is impossible several times over,'' said William G. Gale, the director of economic studies for the center-left Brookings Institution and a co-author of a definitive Tax Policy Center study on Mr. Romney's plan, whose arithmetic the Obama campaign is citing.
''It's not as if the entire philosophical approach he's pursuing is doomed,'' said Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute. ''But he's going to need to cut rates significantly less than 20 percent if he wants to honor his other goals.''
For weeks, the Obama campaign has used the vagueness of Mr. Romney's tax plan as an opportunity, filling in the gaps in the equation on its own and, not surprisingly, accusing him of being a class warrior on behalf of the wealthy.
Presuming that Mr. Romney would protect the investment income of the 1 percent, Mr. Obama's campaign has argued that Mr. Romney can pay for his tax cuts only by eliminating tax breaks that benefit the middle class.
In his acceptance speech Thursday, Mr. Obama warned that those lost deductions and tax credits would add up to $2,000 to middle-class families' tax bills.
Mr. Obama, for his part, has promised to preserve the Bush-era cuts for income below $250,000. But income over $250,000 would be taxed at the Clinton-era rates -- with the rate for the top bracket climbing to 39.6 percent from 35 percent now. All told, Mr. Obama's proposal would raise about $1 trillion in new revenue over the next decade, according to most projections.
Mr. Romney has said that it is ''just not true'' that he would raise taxes on middle-income earners, with his campaign hitting the Obama campaign for playing ''class warfare.''
But it is simply not clear how the Romney campaign would fill the holes. And his campaign for the presidency has raised much broader questions about how to carry out tax reform in a heated political climate and a tepid economy.
''Slowly,'' is the answer that most tax experts give.

HEADLINE: Ideological Opposites Prepare to Meet in Debate

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Both root for the Green Bay Packers. Both are charged with rallying white working-class voters. And with a debate a month away, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Paul D. Ryan are increasingly lobbing personal barbs while stalking each other across the same few Midwestern battleground states.
As Mr. Ryan buckled down on Sunday for his first full day of debate preparation, Mr. Biden campaigned over the weekend in Ohio, where he derisively labeled Mr. Ryan's plan to overhaul Medicare ''vouchercare.'' 
The vice president challenged the news media to ''fact-check me.'' The Romney-Ryan campaign responded with a direct round, singling out Mr. Biden. ''Vice President Biden is once again advancing fabricated and disproven attacks,'' said a spokeswoman, Amanda Henneberg.
On the campaign trail, the most thunderous applause for Mr. Ryan often comes when a local politician introducing him mentions the Oct. 11 debate with Mr. Biden. The Republican faithful are spoiling for the matchup, which they see as pitting Mr. Ryan, with his cold command of budget facts, against an outclassed Mr. Biden, whom they portray as gaffe-prone and too liberal for most voters.
Mr. Biden's supporters say, in essence, bring it on. ''I think the vice president can just tie him up in knots,'' said former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, who campaigned with Mr. Biden over the weekend. ''I'm looking forward to the Ryan budget being discussed in the debates. I see Ryan as an empty suit.
''Far from being a deficit hawk, he's gone along with nearly every budget-busting program the Republicans have supported, including massive tax cuts.''
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Biden, who are scheduled to be in Wisconsin on back-to-back days this week, emphasize their personal biographies to connect to blue-collar workers in Midwestern states hit hard by the financial crisis. Mr. Ryan's hometown, Janesville, Wis., may now be best known for an auto plant whose closing he has pinned on the president.
Mr. Ryan speaks of ''high school buddies'' who lost jobs at the General Motors plant in Janesville, criticizing a promise in 2008 by President Obama, who was then a candidate, to help the plant retool and remain open.
Mr. Biden, speaking to General Motors workers last week in Lordstown, Ohio, said Mr. Ryan ''wasn't on the level.'' He accused him of ignoring the fact that Mr. Obama's auto industry bailout saved a million jobs, while Mitt Romney opposed it. ''G.M. wouldn't have been reorganized,'' he said. ''It would have been liquidated.''
Mr. Biden's roots are in blue-collar Scranton, Pa., where, as he recalled last week at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., he lived with his grandparents when his father had to move away temporarily to find work.
''The financial crisis hit like a sledgehammer on all the people I grew up with,'' he said in Charlotte.
Mr. Ryan's selection by Mr. Romney put Wisconsin into play as a battleground state. At the same time, the congressman has reached out to Ohioans by suggesting that he is nearly a native son. He speaks of the ''lucky buckeye'' he carries, and he recently attended a football game between Ohio State and his alma matter, Miami University in Ohio.
Each candidate is his ticket's bridge to the party base. Mr. Biden has spoken to labor groups as well as to Hispanics and African-Americans. For Mr. Ryan, his House budget proposal for $5.3 trillion in cuts over 10 years, a majority from programs for low-income Americans, has erased any ambivalence by the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party to embrace Mr. Romney.
The Ryan campaign is tamping down expectations by grass-roots supporters that the vice-presidential debate will be lopsided or easy. ''Remember, the vice president has run for president twice,'' a senior aide to Mr. Ryan said. ''He's probably one of the most experienced debaters in American politics right now.''
Vice-presidential debates often provide interesting theatrics, like Senator Lloyd Bentsen's remarks to Senator Dan Quayle in 1988 that ''You're no Jack Kennedy,'' but they rarely affect the outcome of the race.
Still, Mr. Ryan took time out from a fund-raising swing in Oregon on Sunday to meet with a small circle of advisers about the debate. One challenge for him will be to translate his sometimes overly technical policy explanations into ordinary language.
''I think it would be fair to say that after a number of years in Congress and putting together the budget, Chairman Ryan has an exceptional grasp of policy,'' the aide said. ''A lot of what we're working on is the best way to debate, particularly given the vast experience the vice president brings to this process.''
Mr. Biden's challenge in Ohio to the news media came after a recent assertion by a top Romney pollster that the campaign would not be ''dictated by fact-checkers.''
''It's amazing how they don't like to be fact-checked, right?'' Mr. Biden said in Zanesville, Ohio. ''What they're proposing will actually cause the Medicare trust fund that pays for the benefits when you go to the hospital, the doctor, to run out of money, a sufficient amount of money, by 2016.''
Mr. Biden issued the challenge: ''I say to the press, 'Fact-check me.' ''
Although the vice president and Mr. Ryan are ideological opposites, they do have at least one thing in common.
Mr. Ryan took a break from debate preparation on Sunday to watch his favorite football team, the Packers, play its season opener. Mr. Biden revealed during a visit to Green Bay, Wis., last week that he, too, is a Packers fan. As a student in Catholic school, he said, the day began with a prayer invoking ''the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and Vince Lombardi.''

HEADLINE: Big Step in Selling A.I.G. Stake, but Other Bailouts Remain

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Treasury Department's plan to sell a big chunk of its A.I.G. holdings is a big step in unwinding one of the most controversial bailouts of the financial crisis. But there are still plenty of other rescue programs to dismantle. 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department announced on Sunday the biggest sale of its holdings in the American International Group yet, taking its stake below 50 percent for the first time since 2008.
It's a big step in unwinding one of the most controversial bailouts of the financial crisis. But there are still plenty of other rescue programs to dismantle.
The Treasury Department is planning to sell about $18 billion worth of its shares, an amount that could grow to $20.7 billion if there's strong enough demand. That means that the government's stake would fall anywhere from 23 percent to 15 percent.
 Of course, that's dependent on the stock market holding up and investors becoming enthusiastic about buying up an enormous amount of stock, though A.I.G. itself is buying about $5 billion. Neither the Treasury Department nor the company gave a proposed price for the shares, though by the government's own reckoning, they must be sold at above $28.73 to break even on the bailout.
Still, there's plenty more of selling that the government must do apart from the A.I.G. stock. The federal government still owns about 32 percent of General Motors, down from an initial 60.8 percent. And thus far, the Treasury Department has recovered about 50 percent of its initial investment in the auto maker. 
But it's not clear whether that will go down in the short term, given G.M.'s tepid profit reports of late. People close to the car maker said this summer that they did not expect the administration to sell off significant portions of its holdings this year.
On the other hand, the government has divested its stake in Chrysler, leaving control of the smaller car manufacturer with Fiat of Italy. 
And the Treasury Department still owns 74 percent of Ally Financial, the bank formerly known as GMAC, as well as $5.9 billion worth of mandatory convertible preferred stock. To date, the department has earned back about one-third of its initial $17 billion investment. 
Again, however, it isn't clear when the government will be able to sell its stake in the lender. Ally's mortgage unit, Residential Capital, filed for bankruptcy in May, removing one of the biggest thorns in its parent's side. The lender can now contemplate either going public or selling itself to private equity firms, but a timeline for such a move hasn't been set.
The Treasury Department also owns stakes in many small banks as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and specifically the Capital Purchase Program in which it essentially bought equity in many lenders. So far, the government has made a $19 billion return on its initial investments. But as of early May, about 343 institutions remained in the program, though many continue to repay their rescues.
And, lest we forget, the administration is still heavily involved in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, having put the mortgage giants into conservatorship four years ago. That rescue plan so far remains deeply in the red, though both institutions posted a profit in their most recent quarter.
