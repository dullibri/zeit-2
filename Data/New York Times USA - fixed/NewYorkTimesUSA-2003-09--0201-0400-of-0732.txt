HEADLINE: Western Farmers Fear Third-World Challenge to Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
Christian Vachier, the last sheep farmer in his small commune north of here, is wondering whether his pastoral life in the Luberon mountains is about to end.
 Halfway across the world, Dean Argotsinger, who raises corn and soybeans on nearly 2,000 acres of land once cultivated by his father and grandfather outside Denison, Iowa, has the same worries. 
 Mr. Vachier grazes his flock on 36 acres of pasture and sends them off in the summer to wild mountain meadows, a land-intensive and expensive method underwritten by checks from the European Union and the French government. His lamb is never sold outside the region, much less overseas. 
Mr. Argotsinger is a very different kind of farmer. He considers himself modern and efficient. He uses chemical fertilizers and receives more than $336,000 from the government every four years and sells his grain in the global marketplace.
But both farmers worry that they will be the targets when trade ministers from around the world meet in Cancun, Mexico, on Wednesday to begin deciding which subsidies to cut back in the wealthiest nations in order to lessen the damage the subsidies inflict on poor farmers in the developing world. 
The world's wealthiest nations give more than $300 billion of subsidies to their farmers every year, more than the gross national product of sub-Saharan Africa. Those payments are now the biggest complaint of poor nations.
"It's ridiculous that rich farmers are getting richer and poor farmers are getting poorer," said John Nagenda, a farmer in Uganda and adviser to President Yoweri Museveni. "We are kept out of the world market. When countries like America, Britain and France subsidize their farmers, we get hurt."
Siphiwe Mkhize, agriculture attache at the South African Embassy in Washington, said: "We would give up foreign aid if the farm subsidies were eliminated. The subsidies give the rich-nation farmers the upper hand in all markets, and we can't even compete in our own markets, much less theirs."
Mr. Vachier, however, said, "Why should world trade rules dictate whether French taxpayers can pay me to preserve our way of life and protect our countryside?"
Though he has different views about world trade, Mr. Argotsinger has similar complaints.
"The federal government made a promise to us farmers in the farm bill last year and all at once they're telling us the World Trade Organization can take that away from us," he said at his Iowa farm. 
From the hillside vineyards of Europe to the dense cornfields of Middle America, dozens of farmers said in interviews that they were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the talks in Cancun, where the first order of business is farm policy.
In the past decade, the top quarter of farmers in the developed world have steadily gained most of the subsidies -- 70 percent in Europe and 90 percent in the United States, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Those payments allow industrial-size farms to produce many more acres of crops than are needed for domestic consumption, and they are sold overseas at low, subsidized prices. 
Farmers in developing markets cannot compete with the cheap imports. They lose out in their own markets and have little chance of exporting.
A recent American-European farm proposal disappointed many developing nations. Seventeen developing nations countered by asking the United States to make deeper cuts in its subsidies and Europe to eliminate subsidies that underwrite exports.

The U.S. and Europe: How Their Subsidies Differ
Subsidies began in times of hardship -- during the Depression in the United States, to help farmers survive as their costs rose and market prices stagnated, and after World War II in Europe, to encourage farmers to increase food production and avert malnutrition. 
But today Western countries are drowning in food, their citizens more likely to suffer from obesity than starvation, and the huge surpluses are sold cheaply overseas.
The American system -- with farms 10 times larger than those in Europe -- has grown the most lopsided. In 1995, the top 10 percent of American farmers received 55 percent of government subsidies; in 2002 their share rose to 65 percent, according the Environmental Working Group. 
While Europe also gives more money to its larger farms, it is slowly shifting to reward small farmers like Mr. Vachier who raise expensive, high-quality food that is rarely exported, subsidies that are considered harmless to the developing world. 
"Cutting these subsidies to the huge farmers in favor of the small farmers would also help small farmers in the developing world," said Stefan Tangermann, author of the O.E.C.D. report.
Pascal Lamy, the top European trade official, said the answer for European agriculture "is shifting from quantity to quality." When the European Union grows by 15 countries next year, farm subsidies will be further diluted.
Philip Bloomer, director of advocacy at Oxfam, which lobbies against farm subsidies, said that while Europe, including France, is still among the worst offenders in farm policy, it is slowly understanding that it has to change.
"In Europe, we believe there is a glacial movement in the right direction," said Mr. Bloomer. "In the United States, there is a fairly rapid movement in the wrong direction."
The United States openly embraces increased trade as the answer for American agriculture, heavily subsidizing the biggest farms in an industrialized system that generates huge surpluses for export. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, boasts that one out of every three acres in the United States is planted for export. 
It is highly unlikely that either the United States or Europe will offer the concessions needed to undo the damage of the system.
"Our American subsidy system is a crime, it's a sin, but we'll talk a good game and get away with doing almost nothing until after the presidential election," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Agriculture is now one of the few sectors of the American economy where the United States runs a trade surplus, and American businesses that thrive on subsidized global trade want to keep the subsidy system in place.
In the past decade, industrial-scale farmers have tipped their allegiance decisively toward the Republican Party, which supports the current system. Political contributions from agribusiness jumped from $37 million in 1992 to $53 million in 2002, with the Republicans' share rising from 56 percent to 72 percent, according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Those commercial companies were not disappointed when President Bush signed into law last year a new farm policy that increases permanent subsidies by $40 billion a year, even though Mr. Zoellick had promised the developing world that subsidies would be cut in this new round of trade talks. 
"Reducing these subsidies and removing agricultural trade barriers is one of the most important things that rich countries can do for millions of people to escape poverty all over the world," said Ian Goldin, the World Bank's vice president for external affairs. "It's not an exaggeration to say that rich countries' agricultural policies lead to starvation."

The Name of the Cheese: Defending a Way of Life
For Europeans like Jean-Pierre Boisson, mayor of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, a small village in Provence, subsidies also represent survival of a centuries-old way of life and of the kind of traditional farming that produces the expensive, high-quality wine, olive oil and meat for which his region is known.
Europe's environmental programs receive a mandated 15 percent of the $46.3 billion in annual European farm subsidies. 
The farmers around Chateauneuf-du-Pape worry that in Cancun, trade ministers with little understanding of agriculture and its effect on a nation's food system and countryside will cut the wrong programs.
Mayor Boisson is also watching carefully whether the trade ministers adopt a universal respect for geographic indicators, a form of copyright tying the name of a food product to its region. Those labels guarantee the authenticity of products like Roquefort cheese and grand French wines; for farmers like Mr. Boisson, those labels -- and not government subsidies -- ensure his profits.
Mr. Lamy, the European trade minister, has told colleagues that if the World Trade Organization is willing to support geographic indicators, he would discuss reducing export subsidies.
Phillipe Mauguin, director of the French government's Institute of Appellations of Origin, said the government hoped that 20 percent of French produce would eventually besold under a specialty labeling. France already sells $18 billion in products protected by appellations of origin.
"Without such labeling, there is zero protection for local people, zero protection for local culture," said Mr. Mauguin.

An Industry Remade: The Passing of the Farmer
Iowans like Mr. Argotsinger know what it means to lose the traditional farm way of life.
When the members of the Denison High School class of 1963 held their 40th reunion this summer, they counted only one farmer among them. Over cold beers and enchiladas, they guessed that at least 40 of the 108 men and women in their class were either raised on a farm or spent their summers on the farm of a close relative.
In one generation, they said, they became witnesses to the remaking of American agriculture, which has been turned upside down by globalization, altered federal farm subsidies and the demands of the "big guys" to make agriculture run on the principles of mass production.
"The subsidies let the big farms get bigger, and the big companies end up controlling everything around here, paying low prices for grain so they can control markets around the world," said Gaylord Moeller, the surviving farmer of the class of 1963. He said he had held on to the 160-acre farm originally settled by his German great-grandfather because he had resigned himself to living modestly.
Thomas Dorr, the under secretary of agriculture for rural development and an Iowa farmer himself, advocates the industrial-size farms and said in an interview that it was wrong-headed to view agriculture in terms of small farms versus large. American agriculture, he said, simply reflects the increased global market.
"Marketplaces are always going to change, they are always going to fluctuate," he said. "Everybody always frames it in small versus large instead of where the opportunities are."
Mr. Zoellick, the trade representative, has proposed cutting over $8 billion in subsidies, but only if Europe makes deeper cuts. 
Keith Collins, the chief economist at the Department of Agriculture, said there is "compelling evidence" that subsidies do increase production, distort trade and undermine poor countries.
"Payments increase production and production increases exports," Mr. Collins said in an interview.
This American emphasis on exports has not only increased the size of the farms, but has also limited what is grown on them. 
When Denison's boomers were born in 1945, Iowa's farmers grew 17 commercial crops, including potatoes, cherries, peaches, plums, pears, strawberries, raspberries and wheat. Farmers sold vegetables from their truck gardens at harvest time.
Now the commercial crops are down to four -- feed corn, soybeans, hay and oats -- and Denison has a hard time filling a farmer's market one afternoon a week.
"It's easier to get fresh fruits and vegetables in Des Moines now than it is in Denison," said Cecelia Servoss Arnold, a member of the class of 1963.
Denison is the birthplace of Iowa Beef Packers, among the first slaughterhouses to use a modern assembly line system that revolutionized the meat industry by eliminating the need for most skilled labor. 
Grain farms like Mr. Argotsinger's literally fed those new slaughterhouses by raising the crops needed to feed the hogs. Soon an industrial system was introduced to raise enough hogs to be killed by the tens of thousands every day.
Farmers emptied their barnyards and built factory-size sheds in the rolling hills. They pack hundreds of hogs into each building, feeding them with automated tubing and siphoning off their excrement into open vats known as manure lagoons. 
While the odor and pollution are causing political battles in the state, supporters say they are an integral part of the new industrialization of agriculture.
"We're part of a global protein market," Mr. Argotsinger said. "I'm growing corn for meat that will be sold to China."

HEADLINE: Indiana Governor Rushed Into Surgery After Stroke 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
Frank L. O'Bannon, a veteran of Indiana politics in his second term as the state's governor, was listed in critical condition in a hospital here tonight after apparently suffering a massive stroke in a hotel room downtown.
 While doctors this evening described the three hours of surgery they performed on Mr. O'Bannon during the afternoon, Joseph E. Kernan, the lieutenant governor, assumed the role of acting governor, as he does when the governor is out of the state. 
 Mr. Kernan said state legislative leaders were considering whether to make the transfer of power formal under a complicated process required by the state Constitution, and called on the people of Indiana to pray for Mr. O'Bannon's recovery. 
Mr. O'Bannon, one of Indiana's best-known Democrats, was scheduled to make opening remarks at the Midwest U.S.-Japan Association Conference this morning, but he never appeared. An Indiana state trooper who accompanies the governor went to his room at the Palmer House Hilton, found him unconscious and called paramedics, said Mary Dieter, spokeswoman for the governor.
Doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital said he was found in his pajamas, near the closet of his hotel room. He had a cerebral hemorrhage, apparently caused by a significant stroke on the right side of his brain, and then fell. Doctors said they were unsure what time he had been stricken, although a hotel worker had apparently talked to Mr. O'Bannon about two hours before he was found.
Mr. Kernan had been in Chicago with Mr. O'Bannon to take part in the trade conference, but was flown by state police helicopter back to Indianapolis after Mr. O'Bannon was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital.
Though Dr. Wesley Yapor said the surgery went well, he made few predictions about Mr. O'Bannon's recovery, saying only that the next day or two would be critical.
Mr. O'Bannon has not regained consciousness and is on a ventilator, doctors said.
Over the years, Mr. O'Bannon, 73, had been deemed in excellent health. His doctor gave him a full physical exam three months ago, Ms. Dieter said.
Mr. O'Bannon has spent his life in Indiana politics -- serving in the State Senate and as lieutenant governor before becoming governor. He is barred from seeking re-election when his term ends next year because state law prevents candidates from serving three terms as governor. A fierce battle for the job was already shaping up this summer, with at least six candidates .
Mr. Kernan, however, is not one of them. He surprised some state Democratic leaders last year when he announced that he would not run to replace Mr. O'Bannon. Some had viewed Mr. Kernan as the party's strong and likely choice. 
Mr. Kernan, 57, worked alongside Mr. O'Bannon during both of his terms as governor. Mr. Kernan, who was held as a prisoner of war for 11 months in Vietnam, also served three terms as mayor of South Bend in the late 1980's and 1990's.
State officials were racing today to sort out the process required by the Indiana Constitution in case a formal transfer of power is needed in the coming days: If the governor cannot pass along power to his lieutenant on his own, the leaders of the Legislature may turn to the State Supreme Court to request permission for the transfer. The court has 48 hours to decide whether the governor is, indeed, unable to discharge his duties.
Mr. O'Bannon has long been personally popular in Indiana, though his approval ratings have slipped in the past year or two as the state, so dependent on agricultural and industrial jobs, fell on particularly rocky economic times. 
"His ratings took a nose dive," said Brian Vargus, a professor of political science at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis. "It's been a rocky road for him, as it has for many governors. But on a personal level, he is beloved. Even the Republicans who criticize him will tell you that, interpersonally, there is not a more liked person in this state."
In recent months, some critics had complained that Mr. O'Bannon's administration was showing signs of poor leadership and had allowed a state surplus to shrink to a large deficit. 
Today, such issues seemed far away.
"Now is not a time to discuss politics," said Marc Lotter, a spokesman for the state Republican Party. "The thoughts and prayers of Hoosiers across the state are with the governor for his full and speedy recovery."

HEADLINE: THE PRICE OF MUSIC: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Fighting the Idea That All the Internet Is Free

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
With the club of lawsuits and the olive branch of an amnesty program, the music industry is waging a campaign against online piracy that relies on both public relations and economics to attack the idea that everything in cyberspace can be free.
 That will not be easy. The Internet sprang from a research culture where information of all kinds was freely shared. That mentality still resonates with the millions of Internet users who routinely download music onto their computers. But the emphatic message of the music industry's two-step program announced yesterday is that the days of plucking copyrighted songs off the Internet without paying for them are numbered. 
 The Recording Industry Association of America said yesterday that it had filed 261 suits against online music pirates, and it promised thousands more. Under its amnesty program, contrite file sharers who have not yet been sued will be spared if they erase their illicit music files and promise never to do it again.
"These lawsuits certainly tell consumers that 'free' ultimately has a price," said Michael J. Wolf, managing partner in charge of the media practice at McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm. "Originally, there was this perception that consumers would not pay for content -- entertainment or information -- over the Internet. But that perception is changing."
Mr. Wolf observed that in their own way all media companies will have to confront the overarching issue that the music industry is grappling with: how to respond to the challenge of digital distribution and find a profitable business model. "Nobody is immune," he said.
For the struggling music industry, there are at least some encouraging signs. Raising the price of illegal file sharing, according to a recent research report, could have an impact on the behavior of today's carefree music downloaders.
In the United States, about half of all young people ages 12 to 22 with access to the Internet have downloaded music from file-sharing networks like KaZaA and Morpheus, according to a survey conducted by Forrester Research in July. Of those, 68 percent said they would stop downloading music if there was a "serious risk" of being fined or sued.
"If the issue is, can you scare people? The answer definitely seems to be yes," said Josh Bernoff, an analyst for Forrester Research.
Yet scaring the customers is a tricky strategy for the music industry. Other industries, to be sure, have sued customers who misuse a product or service. The software industry, for example, has long waged a campaign against people who illegally copy or use software, and the credit card industry has aggressively pursued people who commit fraud with their cards.
But the problem group in other industries typically represents a small portion of potential customers. In the music industry, by contrast, young people are the most active users of music file-sharing systems and they purchase more CD's per person than older music listeners.
In beginning the crackdown campaign yesterday, Cary Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Association, took pains to portray the step as one reluctantly taken to protect the livelihoods of gospel singers, pit musicians and record store clerks -- not just record executives and millionaire divas.
The music industry's actions yesterday dealt with one side of the economic ledger: raising the cost of illegal file sharing. 
But the industry, according to analysts, must pay at least as much attention to its own economics if it is really to address the challenge presented by Internet file sharing.
The industry, they said, must provide convenient, reasonably priced and legal ways to download music digitally, and reduce the price of CD's. As positive steps, they point to Apple Computer's iTunes service, which allows users to download songs for 99 cents each; Real Networks' Rhapsody online music service; and the decision last week by Universal Music Group, the largest record company, to cut wholesale prices on CD's by up to 30 percent.
"The industry has to increase the price of illegal file sharing and make it more attractive to download music legally or purchase CD's," said Hal R. Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "That is the economic gap the industry is trying to close."
The music industry's travails, analysts agree, are in part self-inflicted -- a result of reacting slowly and ineptly to the challenge of Internet file sharing. Still, other media industries face similar issues. Movies and television programs, though nothing like music yet, are beginning to be distributed over file-sharing networks.
"The movie industry and broadcasting is obviously watching this playbook with great interest, wondering if someday they may have to do the same thing," said Harold Vogel, president of Vogel Capital Management, an investment firm specializing in media companies.
Hollywood has far more time than the music industry to adopt business alternatives, like Movielink, which allows users to download movies legally. Movie files are much larger than music files, so downloading a film over the Internet is still inconvenient and time consuming. But the barrier to widespread movie file sharing will drop as Internet connections to homes continue to get faster.
Part of the challenge facing not just the recording industry but all media companies is how to deal with the lingering perception that the Internet is somehow a free resource. It never was, of course. In the early days, the government and universities subsidized it. E-mail continues to be free to users, though one unintended byproduct is the spread of spam, an irritation to consumers and a costly burden to corporations and network operators handling Internet traffic.
Most commercial Web sites still do not charge for viewing, though some do, and others charge for "premium" offerings.
"It was never really free," said Thomas R. Eisenmann, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. "The hope was that advertising would pay for everything. That's not necessarily a flawed model. It has just been a lot harder than most people thought."

So It Is Adapting Though it is suing some users who swap files, the industry is also trying to regain customers. After resisting the idea, the industry agreed to sell individual songs online. And, the Universal Music Group recently announced a price cut, a decision analysts expect other companies to follow. 10 million -- Songs that Apple Computers iTunes music store says have been downloaded so far. $12.98 -- New estimated retail price of Universal CD's, a 24 to 32 percent reduction from current average prices of $16.98 to $18.98.

HEADLINE: Energy Project vs. Environmentalists inPeru 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: PARACAS, Peru 

 BODY:
In the barren moonlike landscape outside this coastal hamlet, workers in hard hats are busily laying cables and constructing giant holding tanks for natural gas liquids. An alliance that includes well-known names in energy like Hunt Oil of Texas and Pluspetrol of Argentina then plans to lay two miles of pipe along the ocean floor to a loading platform for tankers.
 The development in Paracas, about three hours' drive south from Lima, is part of an ambitious project, which could cost up to $3.6 billion, to export butane, propane and, eventually, natural gas to California. Peruvian officials say the development, 20 years in the making, would be a crucial engine for growth as the country, which is resource rich but cash poor, tries to transform itself into an energy exporter. 
 But a surging environmental movement -- led by activists from the United States -- is pushing hard to halt construction at this plant, which is still in its early stages, and force it to move elsewhere. 
 Asserting that the plant is a danger to the country's only marine reserve, a sanctuary for sea turtles, rare penguins and sea lions only 4.3 miles to the south, environmental groups won a big victory on Aug. 28. That was when the Export-Import Bank, a credit agency of the United States government, rejected a $214 million loan, citing concerns about the environment.
 Now, the Inter-American Development Bank is set to vote on Sept. 10 on $75 million in additional financing that, if rejected, could place at least another $60 million in syndicated loans in jeopardy.
 Peruvian government officials and operators of the Camisea project -- named for the region where the wells are -- said they had lined up $225 million in optional financing from a Peruvian bank and promised to finish the project. 
 On Monday, the Andean Development Corporation approved long-term loans worth $75 million, Peru's government said. 
 But an adverse decision could be a serious blow to the project's image and set a precedent sought by environmentalists -- that multinational lending agencies, particularly those dependent on American money, ensure rigorous environmental standards before providing big loans.
 "Camisea is a key test for the international financial institutions and the United States government," said Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat in the foreign operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee and a leading critic of the project. "The issue is whether the Inter-American Development Bank, financed with U.S. taxpayer dollars, will protect a pristine area."
 Alliance engineers and officials in President Alejandro Toledo's government, which says the project would increase gross domestic product 0.8 percent a year, assert that the highest environmental standards have been exceeded. They accuse environmental groups of exaggerating deficiencies in a quest to terminate the project.
 "We had 18 public meetings," said Jaime Quijandria, the economy minister. "Problems came up, but not the kinds of problems that are being raised now."
 Mr. Quijandria added: "We are certain there is not going to be any environmental damage."
 Project officials and government officials admit errors in the development, but say that standards were improved as environmentalists and consulting firms hired by the multinational lenders raised concerns.
 Alejandro Segret, general manager of TGP in Peru, noted that the pipeline construction, which his company is leading, will be underground, to be covered by jungle.
 "Our focus was always to minimize the environmental and social damage," he said. "This is one of the most transparent projects there has been in this country."
 But environmental groups like Amazon Watch, Conservation International and the World Wildlife Fund and a collection of grass-roots groups have warned of environmental devastation. And some of their concerns have been echoed by some officials at the Export-Import Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and by some members of Congress.
 The Camisea fields, discovered a generation ago by Shell, were envisioned as one of the largest energy developments in Latin America.
 Shell eventually dropped out, and the project has been developed by companies like Hunt Oil of Texas; Pluspetrol of Argentina; Techint, which owns TGP; the SK Corporation of South Korea; Sonatrach, an Algerian state-owned company, and Tractebel, the Belgian energy giant. The companies are developing gas fields thought to hold 13 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and condensate, including butane and propane, an enormous amount. Wells are being developed in the lower Urubamba region of the Peruvian Amazon, along with a gas- and-liquids separation plant and two pipelines stretching across the Andes.
 One pipeline, 445 miles long, is projected to transport gas to Lima by August, lowering electricity rates and improving air quality. The other, 335 miles long, leads to this 600-acre site. All this will cost $1.6 billion.
 Another $2 billion will be spent to build a plant to liquefy the natural gas and, by 2007, become a major supplier to the United States. A leading candidate for the job would be Halliburton, another Texas company, a Hunt Oil official said.
 Both companies have close ties to the Bush administration (Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton). The administration's energy policy calls for diversifying the sources of America's energy imports and reducing dependence on the Middle East.
 But the project cuts through some of the world's most pristine jungles, home not only to rare species of birds and animals but also to indigenous tribes. Wells are being developed in the Nahua Kugapakori Indigenous Reserve, a region established to protect three tribes living in virtual isolation from modern Peru.
 "These populations depend exclusively on the territory where they live, the river, the woods," said Beatriz Huertas, adviser to a tropical forest Indian organization. "But the new contacts cause sickness, transmission of disease and death."
 Environmentalists also say that the project has led to serious soil erosion, the contamination of rivers and the killing of fish and that developers have cut through communities without providing adequate reimbursement.
 Reports from the United States Agency for International Development and an environmental assessment memo from the Export-Import Bank show that the United States has had deep concerns about a lack of transparency, about environmental studies that are called shoddy or insufficient and a lack of knowledge of native groups in the region.
 An environmental assessment by the Export-Import Bank says access roads and other paths cut into the jungle "have produced significant direct negative impacts." The report also says "deforestation, human population growth and consequent losses of biodiversity" are "by far the most significant potential negative effects."
 Regarding the Paracas site, the Export-Import Bank report says that while oceanographic conditions were taken into account in choosing the site, no adequate assessments of the social or environmental impacts were conducted on five other alternative sites, contradicting government officials and project officials.
 A July memo from the United States Agency for International Development recommended that the Treasury Department, which determines the vote at the Inter-American Development Bank, withhold support for the loan.
 Environmentalists concede that much of the work on the Camisea project is complete. Indeed, Norberto Benito, general manager of Pluspetrol in Peru, said the well sites, the pipeline and the gas-and-liquids separation plant are largely done, with about $1.2 billion already spent.
 The hope now, environmentalists say, is to halt work on this project in Paracas, at a fractionation plant that would separate gas liquids and pipe them into a marine terminal. About 20 percent of the work is done, engineers here said during a tour.
 "We're saying, 'You didn't go through the necessary requirements to make a sound decision on whether it should be in Paracas or not,"' said Greg Love, who closely follows the Camisea project for Conservation International. "Our position has always been to do it over."
 Government officials and the project's sponsors say halting construction is unthinkable. Closing down here and moving to another site would cost an estimated $100 million.
 "No way," said Roberto Danino, the Peruvian ambassador in Washington, who has lobbied hard for the project.
 Mr. Danino says the plant is exactly where it needs to be, in a region with a natural harbor and slight embankment that makes the plant safe from tidal waves.
 On first glance, the site does not look like much. The coastline around here is already polluted, thanks to a string of fish meal plants that spew waste into the ocean. And the bone-dry, dusty land around the plant is covered with mounds of empty shells of marine life discarded by the plants.
 But just to the south is the hamlet of Paracas, with its hotels, seafood restaurants and a fishing fleet that is dependent on fishing grounds loaded with mackerel, anchovies and other fish. And nearby is the Paracas reserve, a 135,000-acre land-and-sea sanctuary popular with Peruvians and foreigners.
 "Paracas is a big tourist destination and visitors could stop coming," said Adalberto Campos, owner of a small hotel. "We wonder what dangers it could bring. We know nothing about the level of pollution we could have."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Providence; 
A Mecca For Tourism And the Arts

BYLINE:  By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
Providence, R.I., the much-promoted "renaissance city," has become a tourist mecca with its rejuvenated downtown, trendy restaurants and vibrant cultural scene. It is also becoming more business-friendly. Rhode Island's governor, Donald L. Carcieri, a former managing director of the $3 billion Cookson Group, has made economic development of the state a priority, and the legislature has approved nearly $11 million in tax breaks for manufacturers, financing for the biotechnology industry and investment in small businesses.
 Meanwhile, the mayor, David N. Cicilline, wants to nurture the city's arts scene; the arts industry statewide employs almost as many people as the financial-services industry. 

AIRPORT
 Many limousines at T.F. GREEN AIRPORT have Massachusetts license plates; Boston executives have discovered that it can be more manageable to drive to Providence's easy-to-maneuver airport than cope with sprawling Logan International. Local business leaders are pushing to expand the 7,166-foot main runway to accommodate nonstop flights to the West Coast.
 In the meantime, more than a third of the travelers take Southwest Airlines, which runs nonstop fights to eight cities. Catherine Bert, a Providence gallery owner, was grateful for the dozen weekday flights to Baltimore when she was on the committee of a Washington museum. Although the airport is eight and a half miles -- about a $15 taxi ride -- from Providence, "You can be off your plane and in a restaurant in half an hour," Ms. Bert said. For trips to New York she prefers Amtrak's Acela train, which leaves from downtown.

HOTELS
 Sky bridges link the WESTIN (401-598-8000, $189 to $409) to the convention center and the Providence Place Mall. The 18 guest rooms outfitted with offices all have cordless phones, as well as printer-fax-copy machines. There is also a health club and a glass-domed pool.
 The PROVIDENCE BILTMORE (401-421-0700, $119 to $405), a downtown landmark built in 1922, is adding a spa, business center and seafood restaurant. Two floors have 24-hour concierge service and high-speed Internet access. Another popular choice is the three-year-old COURTYARD BY MARRIOTT DOWNTOWN (401-272-1191, $129 to $259).
 Elaine-Marie Notarantonio, a professor of marketing at Bryant College, tells friends with early-morning flights to stay at the CROWNE PLAZA (401-732-6000, $109 to $269) two miles from the airport for roll-out-of-bed-and-into-the-gate convenience.

RESTAURANTS
 Brad Waugh, president of a Providence computer-consulting firm, takes clients to 10 STEAK AND SUSHI (401-453-2333, $97 for dinner for two with wine and tip) for the beef and fish dishes and rum mojitos; he also likes NEW RIVERS (401-751-0350; $95), a bistro that features specialties like venison ribs and chilled lobster salad with jicama, papaya and mango.
Although CAFE NUOVO (401-421-2525; $95) is on the first floor of an office building, its outdoor terrace feels like something out of Venice. On a WaterFire evening, a warm-weather event sponsored by local businesses, diners can smell the cedar burning in fires on the banks of the nearby canal while enjoying crab cakes and lobster ravioli.
 For Italian food, the Federal Hill neighborhood is the place to go, and locals recommend topping off the evening at PASTICHE FINE DESSERTS (401-861-5190).

ON YOUR OWN
 If you don't have time to explore the history of art at the Rhode Island School of Design's RISD MUSEUM (401-454-6500), you can browse through creations by the school's faculty and alumni, from furniture to food processors, at the RISD WORKS store (401-277-4949) near the convention center. The store is also a rotating gallery, with shows that often play off the interests of conventioneers. When the National Trust for Historic Preservation held its annual conference in Providence, for example, the store put on an architecture show.
 Matthew Bird, the store's director, says that he loves to shop at the four-year-old PROVIDENCE PLACE MALL, which features a Nordstrom department store and an Imax theater. For a more intimate setting, the CABLE CAR CINEMA AND CAFE (401-272-3970) has art films and comfortable couches.
 For a list of what the city's many small performance groups are up to, call the Arts and Business Council of Rhode Island (401-621-6123), or visit the box office on Kennedy Plaza or the www.arttixri.com Web site.
 The third Thursday of every month is Gallery Night, when visitors can ride the trolleys free to free visits at 28 galleries, museums and historic sites that all stay open late.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Hotels Are TiltingToward Luxury to Lure Convention Business

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
Here is one of the abiding early images of the conventions and meetings business: In a 1956 episode of "The Honeymooners" television series, Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton, decked out in ceremonial coonskin caps and armed with a bagful of convention-style gag tricks, congratulate each other on an overnight train for managing to keep their wives from tagging along to the annual convention of their Raccoon Lodge -- before they accidentally manacled themselves to their berths with a pair of joke handcuffs.
 Here is an actual image from the meetings-and-convention business this summer: 
 While casually clothed members of a professional association drifted into conference rooms for morning sessions at the extravagantly landscaped Four Seasons Maui at Wailea resort in Hawaii, their children splashed and squealed in free-form pools surrounded by gardens blooming with tropical flowers. In the 21,000-square-foot spa and fitness center, spouses of both sexes signed up for relaxation treatments like the Mele Wailea, a regimen of massage and aromatherapy.
 "Nobody ever complains about coming to Maui," said Brian DiMartino, a director of the Maui Visitors Bureau, from a wicker chair under a softly turning ceiling fan. 
 The statement is as much an expression of relief as a boast. That is because a major segment of the conventions-and-meetings business -- consisting of corporate and professional conferences, training and educational meetings and corporate incentive-awards trips -- is undergoing sharp change as luxury hotels and others battle for market share.
 And no wonder. Over all, corporate meetings and conventions account for about $102 billion in annual spending worldwide, according to Meetings Professionals International, a trade group of corporate and third-party meetings planners. In the United States, where overall business-travel spending is estimated at more than $150 billion a year, conventions and meetings account for one in every eight business trips, and for 27 percent of all hotel rooms sold, according to the Travel Industry Association of America.
 Domestic business trips declined 5.8 percent in 2002 from the year before, according to travel industry statistics. The meetings and conventions business has fared somewhat better, with total events and spending off less than 2 percent. Within that segment, however, spending on big, brassy conventions and trade shows is off -- and hotel managers remain glum about any surge in the overall meetings business this year. 
 "Look at how aggressively hotels are pursuing this market right now," said Lori Cioffi, the editor in chief of Meetings and Conventions, a monthly trade magazine. "Everybody wants a piece of this business."
 Still, according to Successful Meetings Magazine, the only budgets that have been growing are those for smaller meetings, management-training retreats and incentive and motivational trips for high-performing employees.
 And the most high-end incentive trips -- typically attended by the most valued producers in a company that is anxious to keep its top moneymakers happy in troubled times -- are where spending has been growing fastest.
 And therein lies opportunity, many resort hotel owners believe. "Incentives are the last thing to be cut," said Mark Simon, the marketing director at the Four Seasons resort in Maui, who added that this has been the "best year ever" in bookings for corporate meetings.
 While the meetings business tried to find new traction in a soured economy, one strong undercurrent this year has been a shift away from foreign destinations in favor of American resorts that are deemed more removed from the threat of terrorist attacks, SARS and other perceived overseas perils. Spotting that trend, five-star hotels have been opening or renovating facilities in resort areas like Hawaii, California, southern Arizona and elsewhere close to home.
 "We've moved a number of our programs domestically into the Caribbean and elsewhere, whereas there used to be tons of folks going to Istanbul, Athens, Venice, exotic locations overseas," said Mike Kust of Carlson Marketing, a unit of the Carlson Companies.
 Unlike big conventions, which are typically planned years in advance, group meetings and incentive travel are often planned about a year ahead, and, since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, eight months or less in advance. Meetings planners and travel agencies alike are becoming more adept at switching gears, often by pulling back from a foreign spot to one closer to home. In fact, since the attacks, 54 percent of corporations and 46 percent of associations have changed meeting dates, canceled meetings altogether, or changed meeting locations, according to Meetings and Conventions magazine.
 Plans can change abruptly. In the buildup to the Iraq war last winter, "We had a client that was doing a Mediterranean cruise, and because of what was going on, they moved back to a Caribbean cruise," said Cynthia Grissom, Carlson Marketing's director of industrial relations. 
 On the other hand, international meetings travel has begunpicking up again recently, said Ms. Cioffi of Meetings and Conventions magazine. "People changed locations for a while, but I think they're starting to go back" to certain international locations, like South America, that are pushing incentive offerings, she said. Hotels in Asia, staggered this winter by SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, are also beginning to see more meetings business from United States clients, she said.
 There's another trend at work: the idea of personal growth and satisfaction. Companies are trying harder than ever to set agendas that satisfy corporate productivity goals while allowing participants to engage in self-fulfillment or personal education.
 The golf course used to loom large among amenities that meetings planners looked for. But now it's the spa.
 In Maui, for example, the Four Seasons Wailea spent $3 million to expand its spa and fitness center earlier this year, adding 13 treatment rooms and a "healing garden" of native medicinal plants, flowers and trees. Next door, the Grand Wailea Resort has a spa more than twice the size, at 50,000 square feet.
 Mr. Kust of Carlson Marketing said, "In the past, the question used to be, 'What kind of golf course do they have?' That may still be one of the criteria, but the spa is now the major driver."
 Meetings planners are now stressing "really getting into the family and lifestyle and educational learning aspects" within corporate agendas, said Bob Frear, the vice president for sales at Montage Resort and Spa, a 262-room luxury oceanfront hotel that opened in February in Laguna Beach, Calif. 
 Among the hotel's offerings, he said, are a "special-event sommelier" and a "cheese maitre d"' for educational seminars on wine and cheeses, as well as yoga instruction geared to stress relief and work productivity.
 As meeting planners look for new group experiences, more meetings are also being planned on cruise ships. In January, for example, the Cunard Line plans to launch Queen Mary 2, the biggest and, at $780 million, the most expensive cruise liner ever. The 1,132-foot-long ship will have plenty of conference rooms, as well as a 20,000-square-foot spa, to attract corporate groups, which already represent about 20 percent of the cruise industry's business.
 And the demand for self-fulfillment does not necessarily mean just pampering in a domestic spa. Last year, a major financial services company sent an incentive-award group to Kenya, said Ms. Grissom at Carlson. While corporate events predominated, part of the agenda involved a team-building visit to a Masai village where participants "cleaned and painted a building that was going to be turned into a school," she said.
 "It's almost like a Habitat for Humanity kind of thing," she added. "It's not the typical team building we've seen in the past."

HEADLINE: Presidential Character 

 BODY:
George Bush's long-term plans for 2003 probably did not call for his August vacation to be followed by a national television address trying to justify a floundering policy in Iraq. Just about nothing, in fact, looks like what he must have hoped for in the run-up to an election. To many Americans, the economic recovery is anything but -- 2.7 million private-sector jobs have been lost in the last three years. The number of people living below the poverty line is rising, the trade imbalance has reached unnerving proportions, and the federal budget deficits have grown so huge that even the International Monetary Fund has begun expressing concern. Most of the Bush domestic agenda is a sad deflated version of its earlier incarnation. 
 It is useful at times like this to look back on the road that brought a president into trouble and try to divide bad luck from bad guesses, and both from the wrong turns that stem from the innate nature of the presidency itself. In the case of Iraq, there is a little of each. Early in his term, Mr. Bush was stuck with trouble that was not of his making, including both the terrorist attack and the sinking economy. His judgment about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq appears to have been wrong -- and, worse, hyped. But over all, it was a bad guess that was shared by intelligence experts from the Clinton administration and many allies. 
 Other wrong turns, however, were chosen because of a fundamental flaw in the character of this White House. Despite his tough talk, Mr. Bush seems incapable of choosing a genuinely tough path, of risking his political popularity with the same aggression that he risks the country's economic stability and international credibility. For all the trauma the United States has gone through during his administration, Mr. Bush has never asked the American people to respond to new challenges by making genuine sacrifices.
He committed the military to war, but he told civilians they deserved big tax cuts. He seems determined to remake the Middle East without doing anything serious about reducing our dependence on Middle East oil. His energy policy is a grab bag of giveaways to domestic oil and gas lobbyists. He refuses to ask for even the smallest compromise when it comes to fuel-efficient cars.
The pattern goes further. Mr. Bush rolled out a domestic agenda that included some ambitious programs aimed at lifting up America's least fortunate, particularly his No Child Left Behind education package. But in this -- as in the African AIDS initiative and even his controversial faith-based initiative for social services -- Mr. Bush has been content to take the credit for proposing, without paying the political dues necessary to get things done. Certainly most American parents, whose public schools are racked by state and local budget crises, are not feeling that their children are enjoying better educational opportunity. The AIDS program that got such a positive response when the president unveiled it has been underfinanced by Congress, with the White House's encouragement.
Even the administration's foreign policy reflects its tendency to go for quick gratification without much thought of the gritty long haul. The invasion of Iraq appears to have been planned by people who assumed that after a swift military assault, Saddam Hussein would be gone and Iraq would quickly snap into a prosperous, semidemocratic state that would be a model for the rest of the Middle East.
When it turned out that things were far more complicated, the president hedged on the price tag -- apparently out of fear that if Congress knew how high the bill was going to be, there would not be enough votes for another round of tax cuts. Congress, however, was happy enough to be deluded until it was too late. Now we know the cost is going to be massive, with much of the tab to be paid by the future generations who will be saddled with the Bush debt.
The United States has no clear exit strategy from Iraq or immediate hope of a turnaround in a violent, complicated and expensive commitment. The hard realities of postwar Iraq have convinced Mr. Bush that he needs the United Nations support he snubbed before the invasion. But even there he is avoiding the hard choice of acknowledging his error and ceding real authority to other nations. Diplomats are wondering, with good reason, whether Mr. Bush is embarking on a new era of international cooperation or simply giving them permission to clean up his mess.
Mr. Bush is a man who was reared in privilege, who succeeded in both business and politics because of his family connections. The question during the presidential campaign was whether he was anything more than just a very lucky guy. There were times in the past three years when he has been much more than that, and he may no longer be a man who expects to find an easy way out of difficulties. But now, at the moment when we need strong leadership most, he is still a politician who is incapable of asking the people to make hard choices. And we are paying the price.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: U.S. BUDGET; 
78% of Bush's Postwar Spending Plan Is for Military

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush's $87 billion request for postwar costs is heavily weighted to maintaining military operations, with $65.5 billion directed to the armed forces, $15 billion toward rebuilding Iraq and $5 billion toward building its security forces, and $800 million to new spending for civilian programs in Afghanistan, administration officials said today.
 The $87 billion price tag makes the package the most expensive postwar military and civilian effort since the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, after adjusting for inflation. Combined with the earlier $79 billion approved by Congress to conduct the war and pay initial postwar expenses, it would bring the cost to the United States of deposing Saddam Hussein and stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan this year and next to $166 billion. That is more than 25 times the $6.4 billion bill to American taxpayers, in today's dollars, for the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to expel Iraq from Kuwait. 
 Most of the cost of the 1991 conflict -- $60 billion at the time or about $84 billion in today's dollars -- was picked up by allies, including Saudi Arabia and Japan. 
This time around, administration officials said, their main financial goal is to squeeze donations from other countries toward the difference between the $15 billion the United States plans to put toward physical reconstruction of Iraq and the total cost, which the White House put at $50 billion to $75 billion.
White House officials said Mr. Bush's request, higher than the $60 billion to $70 billion that Congress had expected, should cover all costs for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. But some analysts said the figure might still prove to be low, especially if the United States cannot quell the growing terrorist threat within Iraq.
"This is the beginning of the administration presenting realistically eye-popping numbers to the American people," said Rachel Bronson, director of Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "The number is probably on the low side of what's needed, but we're finally in the realm of realism."
In his speech on Sunday night, Mr. Bush himself compared his plans to rebuild Iraq with the effort after World War II, saying, "America today accepts the challenge of helping Iraq in the same spirit." 
His request, though, amounted to an abandonment of a more optimistic plan sketched by administration officials earlier in the year. The administration told Congress in the spring that Iraq's oil revenues would be sufficient to pay the bulk of the postwar costs, which they estimated then would be low.
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told a House subcommittee in March that Iraq could generate $50 billion to $100 billion of oil revenue over the next two to three years. "We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon," Mr. Wolfowitz said at the time. 
Last spring, when it sought the initial $79 billion for the war, the White House asked for $2.5 billion for reconstruction.
"It is fair to say that the level of decay and underinvestment in the Iraqi infrastructure was worse than almost anyone on the outside anticipated," a senior administration official said today.
Administration officials said they now expect Iraqi oil revenues to increase from zero this year to $12.1 billion next year and $20 billion a year in 2005 and 2006.
The administration's proposal includes $51 billion for military operations in Iraq and $11 billion for military operations in Afghanistan. The military money for Iraq would include $800 million to help cover the costs incurred by other nations that agree to send troops to a multinational division, as well as $300 million to buy more body armor and armored vehicles for American troops, who have been subject to regular bombing and sniper attacks.
In addition to seeking $15 billion for reconstruction in Iraq, the proposal calls for $5 billion to be put toward building up Iraqi security forces, including an Iraqi Army, a police force and a border and customs agency.
In many ways, the $87 billion figure was the most compelling evidence yet of how Mr. Bush, who campaigned in 2000 against taking on such jobs, has reversed course to take on a more ambitious role in remaking parts of the world than any president since Harry S. Truman.
From 1948 until 1952, the United States spent just under $13 billion on the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, an amount equivalent to about $100 billion today. The parallels to the spending request for Iraq are not exact, because the United States was also spending considerable amounts after World War II to maintain a large military presence in Europe and square off against the Soviet Union in the cold war.
But the White House's overall estimate of $50 billion to $75 billion in civilian reconstruction costs for Iraq, much of which the United States expects to come from other countries, makes clear that the job in Iraq is one of huge scale. At that level, it would be on a par in today's dollars with the reconstruction costs shouldered by the United States for Britain, France and Germany under the Marshall Plan.
To put the request into a different kind of perspective, the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group, said $87 billion is roughly equivalent to two years of unemployment benefits, 87 times what the federal government spends on after-school programs and more than 10 times the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency.

HEADLINE: Mayor Gains Boost In Poll but Is Facing Wide Disapproval 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER and MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
After guiding the city through last month's blackout and spending much of the summer courting voters, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has gained a modest lift in his job-approval ratings, the latest New York Times poll has found.
 But a majority of New Yorkers still disapprove of the way he has handled his job. 
 Mr. Bloomberg won praise for his stewardship during the blackout -- there was less violence than in the 1977 blackout -- but it was not enough to convince most city residents that he is a good mayor. Fifty-nine percent of those polled approved of his handling of the blackout, while 30 percent disapproved. But asked about his work as mayor overall, only 32 percent approved while 57 percent disapproved. 
The mayor's job-approval rating, which began to drop last year when he raised taxes and cut spending to balance the budget, has climbed eight percentage points since June, when only 24 percent said they approved of his job performance, the lowest approval rating for any mayor since The Times began polling about mayors a quarter of a century ago. 
The poll, which found New Yorkers still worried about another terrorist attack two years after the World Trade Center was brought down, also found them concerned about economic issues. Thirty-eight percent of those surveyed said their family's financial situation had declined in the past two years; when the same question was asked a year ago, 27 percent said so.
The telephone survey was conducted Aug. 31 to Sept. 4 with 976 adults throughout the city. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
New Yorkers remain generally positive about their city. More than 8 in 10 said they have a good image of the city. About half said that, given the choice, they would like to remain in New York, a drop from 57 percent a year ago but better than it was in the early 1990's, when a majority said they wanted to move out of the city.
Only a little of that good feeling has rubbed off on the mayor, though.
The slight lift in Mayor Bloomberg's numbers comes after a summer in which he took pains to burnish his public image. He abandoned most of the harshest budget cuts he proposed and now talks frequently about trying to scale back the tax increases he pushed through. He spent more time in the neighborhoods, schmoozing with regular New Yorkers over lunch or at senior centers. He took two trips abroad, to the Dominican Republic and Israel, that could appeal to important blocs.
But he continues to be particularly unpopular among Hispanic New Yorkers, who were crucial to his election victory in 2001. Only 23 percent of Hispanics said they approved of the job he is doing as mayor, and they were more likely than any other group to disapprove of his handling of the blackout and the city's recovery from the terrorist attacks. 
In follow-up interviews, some respondents complained that Mr. Bloomberg raised taxes without cutting spending enough. Others complained that he had cut spending too much. 
Although the mayor found ways to avoid making harsh cuts, his tough talk about the need for them apparently is still remembered. Some said they believed the cuts were diminishing city services, and others thought, erroneously, that he had cut the number of teachers and firefighters. (While he cut the education and fire budgets and closed six fire companies, he did not lay off teachers or firefighters.)
To be sure, being a mayor in tough times is bound to involve making unpopular decisions. Still, considering the disparate criticism leveled at Mr. Bloomberg, a veteran political consultant for both Democrats and Republicans, Norman Adler, said it sounded as if some people were simply trying to rationalize a visceral dislike of the mayor. 
"My theory is that sometimes a public personality is disliked, and people fish around for explanations," Mr. Adler said. "For whatever reason, the mayor got off on a bad footing with the electorate, and he's got to find a way to get on solid ground. He's not cuddly, but neither was Rudy Giuliani and he did just fine. There's no explaining these things. You know how sometimes you meet somebody and just don't like them? It's like that happened, but on a mass scale."
Mr. Bloomberg's aides said some of the unpopular decisions he made at the beginning of his term would help ensure the city's future.
"Mayor Bloomberg was elected to lead New York through a crisis," said Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary. "He has made the tough choices that were necessary to keep the city a safe place where people want to work and live and has succeeded in closing massive budget deficits, bringing jobs back to the city and fundamentally reforming our school system. Because of his leadership, the best days for New York City are yet to come."
Segments of the population that are supportive of the mayor include those with high incomes and those who are more highly educated. Fifty-nine percent of people with a post-graduate education and 57 percent of those whose annual household income exceeds $100,000 approve of his job performance. 
The geographic part of the city that is most supportive is Manhattan, where 49 percent approve of his job performance and 39 percent disapprove. In the rest of the city, only 27 percent approve.
Handling a catastrophe well can raise the popularity of a politician, as was evident after Sept. 11, 2001, when Rudolph W. Giuliani was transformed into one of the most popular figures in America. One month before the attacks, Mr. Giuliani's approval rating in the city stood at 55 percent. One month afterward, it was at 85 percent. 
Mayor Bloomberg's handling of the Aug. 14 blackout won him praise and favorable publicity. ("Even Rudy couldn't have done better," Newsweek said.) Most New Yorkers were unable to watch their mayor in action on television, since their power was out, so he did not end up with a very big bounce in his poll numbers. 
Asked why the blackout of 2003 was less violent than the blackout of 1977, 19 percent credited more police officers on the streets, 17 percent said society and the world had changed, and 15 percent saw it as a sign of the degree to which the city had changed since Sept. 11. Only 1 percent of those surveyed specifically cited Mayor Bloomberg, while 3 percent of those questioned in this poll cited Mr. Giuliani.
When asked if they viewed Mr. Bloomberg favorably or unfavorably, slightly more than a fifth of New Yorkers said their opinion was favorable; almost twice as many have an unfavorable view. The rest were undecided or had no opinion.
Gov. George E. Pataki, with whom the mayor has been sparring in recent weeks, did a bit better.
Though the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which the governor controls, raised the subway fare this spring and the governor has opposed several aid packages for the city, 30 percent of city residents said they have a favorable impression of him, while 29 percent said they had an unfavorable impression.
Although Mr. Pataki is now in his third term as governor, 39 percent of those polled said they were either undecided about him or did not know enough about him to form an opinion. 
Support for President Bush's job performance, which was high among New Yorkers immediately after the 9/11 attack, continued to fall. 
Thirty-four percent of New Yorkers approve, while 58 percent disapprove. 
Most New Yorkers have not yet focused much attention on Mr. Bloomberg's proposal to ban party primaries, which will be on the ballot as a referendum in November. Fifty-nine percent of registered voters said they did not know enough about the proposed changes to offer an opinion.
Among those who knew enough to offer an opinion, 24 percent regarded it as a good idea and 15 percent said it was a bad idea.

How Poll Works
The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from Aug. 31 through Sept. 4 in all parts of New York City with 976 adults. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish. 
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population.
For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age, education and Hispanic descent.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.
Complete results for each question are available at nytimes.com/politics on the Web.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: CAPITOL HILL; 
BUSH LIKELY TO GET MONEY HE SOUGHT, LAWMAKERS AGREE

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
Members of Congress said today that President Bush would get the $87 billion he requested for Iraq and Afghanistan, but that he would have to walk through a bit of fire first. Lawmakers said they expected sharp questioning of the request and a renewed debate about the effect on federal spending, taxes and the record-setting deficit.
 Many members predicted that pressure would build immediately on nonmilitary programs, including the proposal to add a drug benefit to Medicare. Lawmakers noted that the amount requested in this single bill represented a fifth of all money to be spent next year on nonmilitary programs like education, housing and veterans affairs, many of which are already being squeezed by a deficit that will reach $480 billion. 
 "It's stunning in its size," said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, noting the overall $166 billion to be spent on Iraq this year and next. "It's astronomical when you compare it to the arguments we have over things like after-school programs." 
Some skeptical Republicans said they wanted to know why more Iraqi oil money could not be used for reconstruction, and they questioned some of the grander plans for rebuilding the country. Democrats said the request put further tax cuts in question, and many are demanding that equal attention be paid to construction work in the United States.
Of the $87 billion sought in the package, $20.3 billion is for rebuilding and security in Iraq, only a small fraction of what will ultimately be needed for the reconstruction of that country. Page A12. 
"People are going to want to ask a lot of questions over here," said Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, a Republican member of the Budget and Armed Services Committees. "They'll want to see a lot of details, particularly about oil revenue. But in the end, they'll support it, mostly because there is really no alternative."
Mr. Thornberry said the size of the commitment could force Congress to slow down on spending elsewhere, and predicted that some members would now be far more reluctant to approve a prescription drug benefit for Medicare or other big-ticket spending proposals.
After being briefed by administration officials on Capitol Hill today, one Republican official said the real cost of reconstruction would be $75 billion. After contributing $20.3 billion, the administration expects Iraqi oil revenues to supply another $12 billion, with the international community contributing the balance of $42.7 billion, the Congressional official said.
"That's a lot of change left on the table for our allies to pick up," the official said. "If our friends don't come through, this is going to be much more expensive than it now looks."
Democrats, aware of the growing pressure on their own spending priorities, said staying in Iraq should not require domestic sacrifices, and promised an intense debate on the administration's agenda. Nearly 75 Democrats in the House are co-sponsoring a bill written by Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois that would require the administration to spend the same amount on rebuilding schools and hospitals in the United States as it spends in Iraq. 
Although it has no chance of passage, Mr. Emanuel's bill is intended to demonstrate to the public the choices made by the administration, and the party's leadership plans to do the same. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said the administration must not neglect the needs of American children in overcrowded classrooms as it brings stability to Iraq. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said taxpayers deserved to know how spending on Iraq would affect unmet domestic needs.
"Congress will provide our service men and women with whatever resources they need to accomplish their mission," Representative Pelosi said. "The president's spending request on infrastructure will be subjected to a higher level of scrutiny."
Two senior Democrats said the spending bill required holding back the president's tax cuts for wealthy taxpayers. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic Whip, said the cuts had left the nation ill prepared to fight against terrorism. Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, said the cuts for upper-income Americans should be suspended as an example of the sacrifice called for by the president.
The president's request, which is in addition to a $79 billion spending bill for the Iraq war approved by Congress just five months ago, left even conservative members staggered by the cost. Several Republican members said they had expected a request for $60 billion to $70 billion, and some openly questioned whether the administration was being too generous with taxpayer dollars.
"I still remember candidate Bush's maxim that we shouldn't be nation builders," said Representative Tom Feeney, Republican of Florida. "We can't be the nanny of the world. We have an absolute responsibility to protect the safety of American men and women over in Iraq, but not when it comes to writing checks for their schools and health systems."
But Representative Rob Portman of Ohio, a member of the House leadership and a White House ally, said that the administration had spent weeks preparing the request and that it would be able to "justify every dime of it" when the bill reaches the Capitol in the next week or 10 days. Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he would "aggressively expedite" the bill once it arrives, but other members said that with hearings and additional scrutiny, the process could take longer than the three weeks spent on the April bill for Iraq.
Several senior Democrats are planning to demand an accounting of international cooperation before they approve the reconstruction money. Senator Levin said the proposal would require the administration to report to Congress on its efforts to round up global support and explain which countries are taking part and which have refused. The reconstruction money would be released when the report is received, he said, adding that the military portion of the bill would probably be approved with few objections.
If approved by Congress, President Bush's supplement spending request for Iraq would aggravate the administration's already severe fiscal problems just as it heads into an election year -- the worst possible time to push for spending cuts in other programs. Adding $87 billion to the budget for 2004 would raise the government's projected deficit for next year to $550 billion. More worrisome to economists than the absolute number of dollars involved is that the deficit would amount to nearly 5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. That is clearly entering the danger zone, approaching the record percentage level reached under President Reagan in 1986.
The additional money for Iraq would make it all the more unlikely that Mr. Bush can reach the goal, established just two months ago, of reducing the expected deficit by half -- to $238 billion -- by 2006.
White House officials said today that they would not offset the costs of the bill by either postponing the tax cuts or cutting nonmilitary spending this year, thus adding the full amount of the bill to the deficit. One official said the actual spending from the bill would be $60 billion in 2004, keeping the deficit at $540 billion, which the official said could still be cut in half within five years.

HEADLINE: A Macho Candidate for Governor and His Achilles' Heel: Women 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
Maria Shriver, a member of a famously Democratic family, pulled into a Wal-Mart parking lot here this afternoon in her first solo campaign appearance, registering voters on behalf of her husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who wants to be governor of California.
 But Ms. Shriver's foray turned into utter chaos. She was shouted down by a score of organized union members protesting the recall election and Wal-Mart's labor policies. Less than 10 minutes into a scheduled 45-minute appearance, she was hustled into a black sport utility vehicle and driven away. 
 Before leaving, Ms. Shriver told reporters above the din, "Like many women, I'm just trying to juggle helping my husband and my four children." 
Her trip had larger ambitions than adding a few dozen voters to the rolls and issuing a bland statement of support for her husband. She is trying to soften Mr. Schwarzenegger's image and address a problem that is clouding his prospects. Like virtually every Republican candidate in California for more than a decade, Mr. Schwarzenegger faces a gender gap among voters, with women showing more support for Democrats.
But his career as a professional bodybuilder and then as a star in a succession of violent movies, coupled with accounts of boorish behavior and chauvinistic comments about women, are making the problem worse for him. The situation has turned off thousands of potential female supporters, analysts here say. 
Among the leading candidates in the recall race, Mr. Schwarzenegger holds a small edge among potential male voters over his current chief competitor, Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, a Democrat, public and private polls show.
But among women, Mr. Schwarzenegger is trailing Mr. Bustamante by 13 points, according to a statewide Field Poll to be released on Tuesday.
Overall, Mr. Bustamante leads Mr. Schwarzenegger by 30 percent to 25 percent, the Field Poll shows. The poll was based on interviews with 649 registered voters from Wednesday through Sunday. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.
Mark DiCamillo, director of the nonpartisan Field Poll, said the message was obvious. "You can see," Mr. DiCamillo said, "Bustamante's lead is all women."
Mr. Schwarzenegger has taken positions on some social issues that tend to attract votes from women, supporting abortion rights, some gun controls and environmental protections.
Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican consultant in Los Angeles, said that any Republican candidate began at a disadvantage in California, because of the marked tendency for women to vote Democratic in this state, which has two women who are Democratic United States senators.
Mr. Schwarzenegger's macho image compounds the problem, Mr. Hoffenblum said. "Look at the movies he made, look at his career, look at the statements he's made -- and he's a Republican," he said. "Of course he has a woman problem."
The Schwarzenegger campaign recognizes its weakness among women voters and the increased visibility of Ms. Shriver, 47, is part of the answer, aides said.
One senior adviser said that partly by chance and partly by design the early weeks of the Schwarzenegger campaign had been spent addressing economic and fiscal issues, which tend to engage men more than women. The campaign has also sought to solidify support among Republicans and right-leaning independents by appearing often on conservative talk-radio programs, another move that has alienated many women.
Now the campaign is pivoting to broaden its base and appeal to women, and Ms. Shriver is the vanguard of that effort. The daughter of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the niece of John F. and Robert F. Kennedy, she is a member of perhaps the most famous Democratic family in America. Today's Wal-Mart appearance was the beginning of a relatively heavy schedule of solo campaign appearances over the next several weeks, Schwarzenegger aides said.
Ms. Shriver gave a preview of her role in the campaign on Friday night, when she helped her husband open his headquarters in Santa Monica, as about 100 women protested outside over what they called Mr. Schwarzenegger's hostility to women.
"I volunteered for my first political campaign when I was 5 years old," she said. "I stood outside a department store in the winter in Chicago, and anybody who's been to Chicago in the winter knows it's cold, and I handed out leaflets with my mother and brother. Ever since then, I've volunteered in numerous campaigns. I've stuffed envelopes. I've licked envelopes. I've put up yard signs."
She never identified her family or the candidates by name. Nor did she identify their party. She clearly did not have to.
"If you are a Democrat, you are welcome here," she told the volunteers crowded into the headquarters. "If I can work here, you can work here." Then she offered a personal testimonial to her husband.
"He's one of the most gracious, supportive, open-minded men I have ever met," Ms. Shriver said. "I've known him since I was 21 years old, and I know I would not be where I am today -- in my career, as a woman -- without his support."
Mr. Schwarzenegger's attitudes toward women became an issue when comments he made in years past surfaced after he declared his candidacy last month. In an interview with Oui magazine, he bragged about engaging in group sex and talked about the benefits of sex before bodybuilding competitions. Mr. Schwarzenegger has said he made up those episodes to promote a documentary about his life and to advance his sport.
An article in Premiere magazine in March 2001 said the actor had groped women on movie lots and in interviews. Mr. Schwarzenegger has said those episodes never occurred.
And an article in Entertainment Weekly in July quoted the actor discussing his new movie, "Terminator 3," which he said he enjoyed because "How many times do you get away with taking a woman and burying her face in a toilet bowl?"
Women's groups and Democratic officials have seized upon these remarks to accuse Mr. Schwarzenegger of predatory sexual behavior and disrespect for women.
Responding to questions about these statements, Mr. Schwarzenegger said last week that he had "the utmost respect for women." 
"Did I say crazy things? You are absolutely correct. It was the 70's, and we promoted bodybuilding," Mr. Schwarzenegger said of the comments in the interview with Oui, which is now defunct. "We tried to get attention and headlines and I would say things that many times were exaggerated and untrue, just to get the headlines. But the fact of the matter is, you've got to forget about the 70's. I was a different person then."
He did not address the more recent articles, but one of his advisers, Mike Murphy, dismissed complaints about them as "background noise."
Outside the Wal-Mart today, Mr. Schwarzenegger got mixed reviews from women waiting to see his wife. Kerry Wittlake, 28, a married mother of two, said: "I think he's the perfect candidate. I like that he's a social Democrat but has the Republican financial views." She said of accusations of indiscretions: "It doesn't matter. Everyone has a skeleton in their past."
Juana Olivares, 44, a Mexican-American office assistant in Sacramento, said she was uneasy not about Mr. Schwarzenegger's attitude toward women, but about his views on immigration. He supported a ballot measure in the 1990's that denied access to public services for illegal immigrants.
"I admire Maria a lot because of all her Kennedy family, but not enough to vote for him," Ms. Olivares said. "He doesn't have a humane attitude toward immigrants. We're a little afraid that he's going to change things and hurt us."

Meeting Low Expectations, Happily

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
WHEN the economy slows, the restaurants retreat. Except for a few publicity-seeking barkers who choose a slow moment to hawk their Kobe beef hot dogs and caviar burritos, the luxury ingredients have largely given way to the basics: pizza, burgers, sandwiches and the rest. 
 Still, it would not be New York if restaurateurs did not apply at least a modest sheen of pretension to such seemingly common fare. Those restaurantgoers who once took comfort in knowing their scallops were plucked by divers, their turbot "line-caught" and their chickens free range can rest easy at a new place like Westville in Greenwich Village, knowing that their hot dogs come from Niman Ranch, that the mixed greens are organic and that the steak in the steak sandwich is aged. 
 I mention Westville, which is almost always packed, because it's one of those places that gets lauded for the source of its ingredients regardless of the caliber of the cooking. Frankly, you could use the most expensive cut of beef in the world to make a hamburger, and it could still just taste like grease, as at Westville, particularly if the chef doesn't bother to clean the grill before cooking. 
In almost giddy counterpoint to Westville is a restaurant like Schnack, a little storefront in Brooklyn near where Carroll Gardens merges into Red Hook. The small dining room is a dead ringer for an early 1960's rec room, decorated with seemingly found objects that are blessedly free of weighty themes except that they are old and kitschy. A blown-up baseball card of Johnny Podres, the old Dodgers pitcher, hangs across the room from a mural for Carling Black Label beer, which once represented class in suds. Old boxes of kosher salt stand in one corner, and a shelf holds a row of laminated plastic cups like those given away by gas stations in the 60's. 
Like a semaphore, the brief menu hoists a motto to the top of the page: "Hot dogs, cold beer -- it's not complicated." Is it a liberating credo? Or a sneer at those who would have you believe that short-order cooking is an art? I can't say I've decided, though the hot dogs are just fine. They may not have the cachet of Niman Ranch, the Black Angus of the organic set, but for what it's worth, Schnack's menu discloses that the spicy beef frank ($2.50) comes from Sabrett, and the classic beef is from Stahl-Meyer. Both hot dogs are snappy with underlying garlic and spicy flavors, served on small toasted buns -- Key Foods, for all I know.
Other sausages come from Jubilat Provisions, a good Polish butcher in Brooklyn. The swojska ($3.50), a thick sausage sliced lengthwise and served on a hot dog bun, is smooth and smoky, while the knockwurst ($4.50), twice as big as the swojska, seems coarser yet equally smoky. 
Schnack treads on thin ice with its sliders, or "schnackies," as it terms them, thin, gray burgers on the White Castle model, with just as little flavor or redeeming value. One sets you back a mere 99 cents, but does not inspire interest in a double, two patties on a bun ($2.50), much less a quint ($5.50). Incidentally, the pricing confuses me, too.
In Schnack's favor are terrific fries ($1.50), salty and well-herbed; excellent onion rings ($2.50), served in a gargantuan mass; and a thick chocolate brownie served over chocolate ice cream with whipped cream ($4), a gooey pleasure. And the promise of cold draft beer includes Jever, a bracingly bitter Pilsener served exceedingly fresh, and Dentergems, a good unfiltered Belgian wheat beer. 
On the negative side are dry roasted pork ($6.50), served in an incongruous tomato and onion gravy, and a Cubano sandwich ($5.50) with lettuce and tomato, the equivalent of pastrami with mayonnaise.
All told, Schnack isn't much. It's not meant to be, and that's the beauty of it. Alan Harding, one of three owners, is a chef who has worked his way down from the hip mid-1990's Nosmo King in Chelsea to a cadre of increasingly simple restaurants in Brooklyn. With Schnack, he has touched bottom, and is loving it.

Schnack

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
$400 Bottle's Too High? Try Its $18 Cousin

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
WINEMAKERS have reacted in a variety of ways to the continuing economic downturn. Some have simply ignored it. The 2000 vintage Bordeaux, which sold at record prices, are gone with the exception of a few leftovers, like Cheval Blanc at $800 a bottle or Leoville-Barton at $235. Cult cabernets from the Napa Valley still command $200, even $300 a bottle and $100 a bottle, once a shocking excess, is now commonplace. Restaurants, the top ones anyway, roll blithely on, their wine lists seemingly recession-proof. Just the other day, in a moderately expensive place in New York, I discovered a Corton-Charlemagne at $1,300. A good fish wine.
 On a more realistic level, prices have indeed dropped. Newsletters and magazines for wine fans are vying with each other these days to offer the best lists of "wine bargains" or "wines under $10." Grape surpluses everywhere have made it easy to offer wines at rock bottom prices. Witness the success, however ephemeral, of the $2 California wine from Charles Shaw, better known as "Two Buck Chuck." 
 Premium wine producers, mindful of their reputations, have been pressed to find more ingenious ways to move down the economic ladder. Some, like Robert Mondavi or the big Australian winemakers, already have separate labels at different price levels. For a smaller prestige producer the problem can be trickier. Ridge Vineyards, in Cupertino, Calif., is an interesting example.
For almost 40 years, Ridge has managed to combine tradition and innovation. It is a cult winery with fiercely loyal fans who collect its great cabernet sauvignon-based wine called Monte Bello and its zinfandels like Lytton Springs and Geyser Peak. At the same time it is known for its steady output of intriguing, often unique wines made from unusual grapes or blends of grapes bypassed by others. 
This year, to reflect the current emphasis on economy, Ridge has introduced a zinfandel-based Sonoma County wine called Three Valleys. The grapes come from young vines in six vineyards in the Dry Creek, Alexander and Russian River valleys in northern and northwestern Sonoma. Two of the vineyards are owned by Ridge. The wine has a geographic rather than a varietal or grape name because there is not enough of any single grape in the blend to qualify it for a varietal name. The varieties in Three Valleys are 50 percent zinfandel, 15 percent each of petite sirah and carignane, 11 percent mataro (called mourvedre in France), and 9 percent grenache. By law a wine must contain 75 percent of one grape variety to bear its name. 
Most of these grapes were planted in recent years. In better times they would be permitted to grow to maturity and become part of Ridge's "site specific" wines. In other words, wine identified by the name of the grape and the vineyard, a Ridge Lytton Springs Zinfandel, for example. 
Like many premium California wineries, Ridge has several tiers or levels of quality. The top wines come from cosseted older vines -- some of them more than 100 years old. These vines often produce the best fruit but very little of it, making the cost of the wine produced from them correspondingly high. 
Along with Monte Bello, which is an ever-changing blend of (mostly) cabernet sauvignon, merlot, petit verdot and cabernet franc, these wines include zinfandels from Lytton Springs, Geyserville, Pagani Ranch, York Creek and Paso Robles.
Second-tier wines also come from the best mature vines but not from the best batches. A wine like Monte Bello may be put together from 30 or more separate lots of wine. The grapes from different parts of the vineyard are vinified separately and blended later. Just as in Bordeaux, some lots of wine, even from the best grapes, fail to make the cut and go into a second-tier wine. "In a perfect world, the whole crop would be worthy of the final blend," said Donn Reisen, Ridge's winemaker, "but this never happens."
Grapes meant for but ultimately excluded from the Monte Bello, mostly end up in Ridge's second-tier -- and less expensive -- cabernet blend called Santa Cruz Mountains. Sonoma Station is the name of a second-tier predominantly zinfandel blend made at Lytton Springs in Sonoma. It is composed of mature vineyard lots that failed to make it into the best-known Ridge zinfandels. As a blend, it resembles the new Three Valleys, which is a third-tier wine. 
In some vintages, the top wines may not appear at all. Almost since its inception, Ridge has made a small quantity of chardonnay with, again, the best going under the Monte Bello label. In 2001, not enough was thought to be of Monte Bello quality so it came out as Santa Cruz Mountains chardonnay. 
Prices reflect a wine's place on the Ridge quality scale. Most of the single-vineyard zinfandels range from around $25 to $35. The most recent Sonoma Station is $20 at the winery; the New Three Valleys is $18. The 2000 Monte Bello is $120 at the winery but so rare in the open market that it can sell for $175 or more in retail shops. Older Monte Bellos are extremely hard to find and their prices reflect as much. The 1978 sells for $400 a bottle and up; the 1981 for $350 or more.
None of Ridge's wines are made in huge quantities but wines like Sonoma Station and Three Valleys should not be difficult to find. Most good shops carry at least a few of the top zinfandels as well. Ridge has long been a proponent of ripe, powerful, high-alcohol wines, a style widely adopted in California in recent years. Many of the newer versions of these wines resemble ungainly ports more than they do table wines. Not so Ridge wines. At their best, they are big but elegant, intense but nuanced. And, thanks to clever resource management, at least some of them are quite affordable. 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 17, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The Wine Talk column last Wednesday, about winemakers that sell cheaper lines in addition to their premium labels, gave an erroneous name at one point for a premium zinfandel made by Ridge Vineyards. As noted elsewhere in the column, it is Geyserville, not Geyser Peak.

HEADLINE: Casting a Cold Eye on Arctic Oil 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Alaska 

 BODY:
Here's a helpful hint for backpackers here in the Arctic: If you're lying in your sleeping bag and suddenly feel a pat on the behind from outside the tent, YELL!
 Several campers have been subjected to this kind of sexual harassment lately, and when they opened their tent flaps, they found polar bears grinning at them. This refuge is, after all, a bit like a wildlife safari in reverse -- curious animals have the opportunity to gawk at humans. 
 After rafting and backpacking through this wilderness for a week, weighing whether Congress should allow oil drilling here, I've reached a few conclusions. One is that both the oil industry and environmentalists exaggerate their cases. 
For starters, no one has any idea how much oil is here, and we will never know unless it is explored. There has been limited exploration and test drilling in Eskimo-controlled lands in the refuge, but those results have been kept secret. Environmentalists say contemptuously that there's only a six-month supply, while Big Oil speaks of a 25-year spigot -- and they're both talking through their hats. 
Estimates range from 3.2 billion barrels (which would supply all U.S. needs for six months) to 16 billion barrels, but these are all wild guesses. The top end of the range would be very significant, coming close to doubling America's proven petroleum reserves of 22 billion barrels, but there is some reason to be skeptical of the higher estimates -- particularly because the oil here may not be economical to extract.
One clue, for example, is that the Badami oil field, almost adjacent to the Arctic refuge, is now being mothballed because it was producing only 1,300 barrels a day instead of the 30,000 expected.
Arctic oil can be chimerical, and it would be tragic to sacrifice this wilderness for a series of dry wells.
It is true that oil drilling would not ravage the entire refuge. Only the coastal plain, 7 percent of the total area, would be open to drilling. The coastal plain is endless brown tundra, speckled with ponds and lakes, boggy and squishy to hike in. It is by far the least scenic part of the refuge, and if one has to drill somewhere in the area, this is the place to do it.
It's also only fair to give special weight to the views of the only people who live in the coastal plain: the Inupiat Eskimos, who overwhelmingly favor drilling (they are poor now, and oil could make them millionaires). One of the Eskimos, Bert Akootchook, angrily told me that if environmentalists were so anxious about the Arctic, they should come here and clean up the petroleum that naturally seeps to the surface of the tundra.
Yet drilling proponents who dismiss the coastal plain as a wasteland -- Alaska's governor, Frank Murkowski, has likened it to a sheet of white paper -- are talking drivel.
They should have been with me as I sleepily opened the tent flap early one morning to see a herd of caribou outside, or beheld the polar bears swimming along the coast, or admired a huge grizzly as it considered dining on nearby musk oxen.
(For a Web tour of the refuge, with audio, maps and photos, including pictures of those musk oxen, see www.nytimes.com/kristof.)
Drilling supporters also grossly understate the impact of drilling when they speak of only a 2,000-acre "footprint" in the Arctic. The reality is that oil would mean roads, lodgings, pipelines, security fences, guard stations and airstrips -- and my children would never be able to experience the Arctic as I have. 
True, we need to get our oil from somewhere, and Americans are dying now in Iraq because of our dependence on foreign oil. So I would endorse drilling in the Arctic refuge if it were part of a mega-environmental package that also addressed global warming, an environmental challenge where we have even more at stake than in the Arctic.
Daniel Esty, a Yale scholar of the environment, proposes such a deal -- with trepidation -- in the interest of breaking the national deadlock on environmental policy.
The package could include careful oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (exploratory drilling could be done in winter without permanent damage) and, if it turned out to be the oil lake that proponents claim, commercial drilling as well.
In exchange, the right would accept a beyond-Kyoto framework to control carbon emissions, with tighter standards but a longer time frame. The deal would include $1 billion in additional financing for solar, wind and hydrogen energy, and significant increases in vehicle mileage standards to promote conservation.
Yet President Bush's push to open the Arctic refuge is not part of such a bold and thoughtful package to break the stalemate on the environment. Rather it is simply a lunge for oil. Without trying to conserve oil, Mr. Bush would gobble up a national treasure, the birthright of our descendants, as a first resort.
The argument that I find most compelling is that this primordial wilderness, a part of our national inheritance that is roughly the same as it was a thousand years ago, would be irretrievably lost if we drilled. The Bush administration's proposal to drill is therefore not just bad policy but also shameful, for it would casually rob our descendants forever of the chance to savor this magical coastal plain -- and to be slapped in the butt by a frisky polar bear.

HEADLINE: Africans' Burden: West's Farm Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: KASESE, Uganda 

 BODY:
Erikangin Thembo does not think much about agricultural policy as he farms. Sweating in the midday heat, he keeps his mind focused on the earth in front of him. He raises his hoe above his head. With a grunt, he sends it plummeting into the rich soil.
 One of his two wives, pregnant with his fifth child, works by his side. His two youngest play on a blanket under a shade tree. 
 Mr. Thembo, 40, grows cotton on a rented acre in the westernmost reaches of Uganda, the way his father did and his grandfather before that. He farms barefoot, with a hoe, his large family assisting him. He barely makes ends meet.
Mr. Thembo is not sure how cotton prices are set but he knows he has as much control over them as he does over the rains. He laments his lot in life but points no fingers. All he can do, he figures, is hoe.
"It's not easy," he said during a break. "If everything goes well, if I get the best harvest I've ever gotten, I'll just get by." 
There are a host of reasons for Mr. Thembo's poverty. For one, he works hard, but his time-honored methods are by no means efficient. Then there is the collapse of Uganda's cotton industry, partly attributable -- like so much else that is wrong in this country -- to Idi Amin, the dictator who brought Uganda to ruin.
But the most critical factor? World cotton prices. Although his costs are low, far lower than those of Western farmers, he earns far less than he would if every farmer were paid based simply on how much they produced. 
African farmers can produce cotton at less than 50 cents a pound, compared with 73 cents for American farmers and even higher costs in Europe, according to data gathered by Burkina Faso. 
But cotton is one of the most heavily subsidized agricultural products in the United States. Washington doled out $2 billion in direct cash subsidies to cotton farmers over the past year and another $270 million to cotton exporters. By propping up the industry, the United States government keeps the world cotton price low: in late 2002, it was a meager 35 cents a pound.
"Our farmers just can't compete against a Western farmer who's getting subsidies," said Hans W. Muzoora, a monitoring officer with the Cotton Development Organization in Kampala, Uganda's capital. "It's like our farmers have one of their hands tied behind their backs. The best thing for Ugandan farmers would be an end to those subsidies."
The Ugandan government and others across Africa have begun battling the subsidies. In June a group of African cotton-producing countries vowed to block any new global trade pact at the World Trade Organization unless the United States and European Union dismantled subsidies for their cotton farmers. 
Cotton is just one of many agricultural products affected by Western subsidies, but it is a major one, directly supporting more than 10 million small-scale growers across Africa.
Until the subsidies are wiped out, the African governments are demanding that African farmers receive compensation from the West to level the playing field.
Burkina Faso's president, Blaise Compaore, said in June at the General Council of the World Trade Organization that the subsidies Western governments pay exceeded his country's gross domestic product by 60 percent. "These subsidies have caused economic and social crises in African cotton-producing countries," he said.
 Trade ministers from 146 nations gathered in Cancun, Mexico, for talks beginning on Wednesday. Agricultural subsidies are at the top of their agenda. 
Farmers in Uganda are urging President Yoweri Museveni, at the very least, to subsidize them until the foreign subsidies are eliminated. But the United States, the European Union and the many governments that are propping up Uganda's economy with large infusions of assistance oppose that; subsidies, they argue, are not the best way to jump-start a poor nation's economy.
Not all the woes that Ugandan cotton farmers face can be tied to Washington. Idi Amin neglected the country's cotton gins and fomented strife in farm regions. His repressive ways prompted the rest of the world to boycott Ugandan products, making the country's cotton worth almost nothing. Some farmers tried other crops; others suffered with lower incomes.
When Mr. Amin came to office in 1971, Uganda was ranked third among African cotton producers. By the time he went into exile in 1979, Uganda was not even among the top 15, and the country's economy was on its knees. (He died on Aug. 16 in Saudi Arabia.)
Cotton has been rebounding in recent years, though production is still about a third of what it was in the 1960's.
To many Africans, the American subsidies are especially incomprehensible because the United States has been working in many ways to support struggling African economies. 
The African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 eliminated duties on many products exported to the United States from Africa. That has helped Uganda's textile industry, offering jobs (albeit low-paying ones) to thousands of workers who make clothes. But the great bulk of the fabric is imported from outside of Africa, and was made from cotton from foreign fields.
Other American-financed projects aim at improving output by introducing simple changes in production. 
In one successful program, American experts have encouraged Uganda's gins to work with farmers to increase yields. In pilot projects, farmers have doubled or even tripled their output by using fertilizer, eliminating overcrowding among seedlings and spraying at the right time for pests.
One of the most successful test plots is a few miles down the road from Mr. Thembo, in Kasese.
Francis Kabaseke, 49, is considered a cotton tycoon in these parts. He has 56 acres of land, a tiny amount for a Western farmer but a vast tract here. He rents a tractor, considerably shortening the weeks it would take to hoe his fields by hand. During harvest time, he has the resources to hire laborers.
Mr. Kabaseke set aside one acre to test all the methods being promoted by the experts. His yields were astronomical by local standards. A typical half-acre in this area produces about 1,300 pounds of raw cotton. Many, like Mr. Thembo, get far less than that. But Mr. Kabeseke managed to grow 3,400 pounds.
"Some of the farmers weren't interested when we first came around," said Francis Mugisha, an agricultural outreach worker with the American-financed Speed program. "But now they see the results." (The acronym stands for Support for Private Enterprise Expansion and Development.)
Mr. Kabaseke is one of the converts. Increased yields together with increased prices would turn his life around, he says. He is the father of nine, and sees hope that prices will increase, if not during his lifetime, then perhaps during his children's.
"I want my boys to be farmers," Mr. Kabaseke said. "They've grown up doing it just like I did and my father did. It's our life here. It's how we get by."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Decline as Nokia Outlook Cools Investor Fervor

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A disappointing revenue outlook from Nokia set off profit taking on Wall Street yesterday as investors were reminded that a strong economic rebound was not a sure thing.
 "The market took its cue from Nokia," said John Caldwell, chief equity strategist for the McDonald Financial Group. 
 "As the market is anticipating, with its huge run-up, better earnings growth in the third and fourth quarter, we'll need confirmation from revenues as well," Mr. Caldwell said. "That's adding a layer of concern in the market today." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 79.09 points, or 0.8 percent, at 9,507.20, after gaining nearly 83 points in the previous session.
The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,873.43. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.47 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,023.17.
Nokia declined $1.09, to $15.98, after announcing that it expected third-quarter revenue to be flat or slightly above forecasts; that disappointed analysts who had hoped for a more robust outlook.
Stocks have surged in the last month on brokerage firm upgrades and economic reports that bolstered hopes for a strong recovery. But analysts say that rising interest rates and weak employment could threaten the rally; stocks also may be ready for pullbacks after rising so quickly.
Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Wachovia Securities, said it was a good sign that the declines were somewhat modest. Since the rally began in mid-March, the Dow is up 26 percent, the Nasdaq has risen 47 percent and the S.& P. is up 28 percent.
"This is a mild-mannered pullback in a market boiling for six months," he said. "After six months in a bull market, normally you retract one-third to one-half of the advance. You haven't come close here. People just don't want to let go."
Retailers also faltered after Goldman Sachs lowered the stock ratings of Home Depot, Federated Department Stores and May Department Stores, citing weak outlooks. Home Depot declined $1.60, to $32.15, while Federated lost $1.38, to $42.44, and May declined $1.14, to $25.20.
Alpharma dropped $4.21, or 18.6 percent, to $18.47, after the company, a specialty pharmaceutical concern, lowered its outlook for the third and fourth quarters; Morgan Stanley also cut the company's stock rating to underweight from equal.
But McDonald's climbed 24 cents, to $23.59, after saying that sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.8 percent in August; in the United States, sales rose 8.8 percent, representing the fifth consecutive month of gains since the company announce a turnaround plan.
Research in Motion rose $6.31, or 22.3 percent, to $34.55, after the company, the maker of BlackBerry pagers, raised its fiscal second-quarter outlook; several firms upgraded the company's stock rating.

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Reuters) -- Treasuries rose yesterday as bond traders seemed confident in the success of the government's coming sale of $29 billion in debt.
"It's the path of least resistance," said Vincent Verterano, head government bond trader at Nomura Securities. "There's a lack of anybody willing to short the market."
By late in the day, the 10-year note rose 18/32, to 99 5/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.36 percent from 4.42 percent. And the 30-year bond rose 19/32, to 10 27/32. Its yield declined to 5.23 percent from 5.27 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: IRAQ'S WEALTH; 
A Popular Idea: Give Oil Money to the People Rather Than the Despots

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Few Iraqis have heard of the "resource curse," the scholarly term for the economic and political miseries of countries with abundant natural resources. But in Tayeran Square, where hundreds of unemployed men sit on the sidewalk each morning hoping for a day's work, they know how the curse works.
 "Our country's oil should have made us rich, but Saddam spent it all on his wars and his palaces," said Sattar Abdula, who has not had a steady job in years. 
 He proposed a simple solution instantly endorsed by the other men on the sidewalk: "Divide the money equally. Give each Iraqi his share on the first day of every month." 
That is essentially the same idea in vogue among liberal foreign aid experts, conservative economists and a diverse group of political leaders in America and Iraq. The notion of diverting oil wealth directly to citizens, perhaps through annual payments like Alaska's, has become that political rarity: a wonky idea with mass appeal, from the laborers in Tayeran Square to Iraq's leaders.
American officials have projected that a properly functioning oil industry in Iraq will generate $15 billion to $20 billion a year, enough to give every Iraqi adult roughly $1,000, which is half the annual salary of a middle-class worker. 
No one suggests dispensing all of the money -- and some say the government cannot afford to give up any of it -- but there have been proposals to dispense a quarter or more.
Leaders of the American occupying force have endorsed the oil-to-the-people concept and said recently that they plan to discuss it soon with the Iraqi Governing Council. 
The concept is also popular with some Kurdish politicians in the north and Shiite Muslim politicians in the south, who have complained for decades of being shortchanged by politicians in Baghdad.
"Giving the money directly to the people is a splendid idea," said one member of the Governing Council, Abdul Zahra Othman Muhammad, a Shiite from Basra who leads the Islamic Dawa party. "In the past the oil revenue was used to promote dictatorship and discriminate against people outside the capital. We need to start being fair to people in the provinces."
When oil wealth is controlled by politicians in the capital, one result tends to be the resource curse documented in the last decade in academic works with titles like "The Paradox of Plenty," "Does Oil Hinder Democracy?" and "Does Mother Nature Corrupt?" 
Among the many researchers have been Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University and Paul Collier of Oxford University, both economists, and Michael L. Ross, a political scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles.
The studies have shown that resource-rich countries in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America are exceptionally prone to authoritarian rule, slow economic growth and high rates of poverty, corruption and violent conflict. 
Besides financing large armies to fight ruinous wars with neighbors, as in Iraq and Iran, oil wealth sometimes leads to civil wars over the sharing of the proceeds, as in Sudan and Congo.
"Governments tend to use mineral revenues differently from the revenues they get from taxpayers," said Dr. Ross, who found an inverse relationship between natural resources and democracy. "They spend more of it on corruption, the military and patronage, and less of it on basic public services. Oil-rich governments don't need to tax their citizens, and taxation forces governments to become more representative and more effective."
On April 9, the day Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in Firdos Square, a plan to end Iraq's resource curse was published by Steven C. Clemons, executive vice president of the New America Foundation, a centrist research group. 
He proposed using 40 percent of Iraq's oil revenue to create a permanent trust fund like the one in Alaska, which has been accumulating oil revenue for two decades. That capital is invested and each year a share of the income is distributed -- more than $1,500 to each Alaskan in recent years.
"A fund like Alaska's is the best way to prevent one kleptocracy from succeeding another in Iraq," Mr. Clemons said. "It would go a long way to curbing the cynical belief that Americans want Iraqi oil for themselves, and it would give more Iraqis a stake in the success of their new country. It would be the equivalent of redistributing land to Japanese farmers after World War II, which was the single most important democratizing reform during the American occupation."
In America, Mr. Clemons's idea was quickly embraced by many foreign aid experts, editorial writers, Bush administration officials and politicians of both parties. Some experts, though, have faulted the trust fund, saying it would be expensive to administer and would pay out small dividends at first, perhaps only $20 per Iraqi adult, until more capital was amassed.
As an alternative, some have suggested skipping the individual payments in the early years and dedicating the money to economic development or social programs. Money could be invested in a long-term pension program, as Norway does with some of its oil revenue.
Another alternative would be to make bigger payments up front by giving the money directly to citizens instead of putting it into a trust fund. Thomas I. Palley, an economist at the Open Society Institute, proposed dividing a quarter of the oil revenue each year among all adults in Iraq. That could amount to $250 per adult, assuming that the administration's hopes for oil production prove accurate.
Oil companies would not be directly affected by an oil fund, since they would be paying the same taxes and fees no matter what the government did with the money. But they could benefit indirectly if citizens eager for higher payments pressed the government to increase production and open the books to outside auditors.
"The oil industry likes working in countries with dedicated oil funds and transparent accounting, because there's less loose money to corrupt the government," said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, an American consulting firm to the oil industry. 
"Corruption is bad for business," Mr. West said, "because it creates instability. In places like Alaska and Norway, people support the oil industry because they see the benefits. In places like Nigeria, they see all this wealth that doesn't benefit them, and they start seizing oil terminals."
Iraq's civilian administrator, L. Paul Bremer III, has praised the idea of sharing "Iraq's blessings among its people," and suggested that the Governing Council consider some kind of oil fund. Iraqi politicians, of course, have no trouble understanding the appeal of handing out checks to voters.
The chief argument against an oil fund is that Iraq's government cannot afford to part with any oil revenue for the foreseeable future. It faces a large budget deficit this year, and sabotage to the oil industry has reduced oil production far below projections.
"There isn't that much money now, and we need every penny for rebuilding the country," said Adnan Pachachi, a member of the Governing Council and former foreign minister of Iraq. 
"Giving away money would be politically popular," he said, "but we should not gain popularity at the expense of the long-range interests of the country. By giving away the money you may sacrifice building more schools and hospitals."
Some have suggested letting the government keep all of the revenue until oil production increases well beyond current levels, then putting the extra money into a fund. 
But the oil-to-the-people advocates say that now is the time to at least establish the framework for the fund, before a permanent government gets addicted to the revenue. If experience is any guide, that government would probably not be devoting the money to schools and hospitals.
"There is a direct proportional relationship between bad government and oil revenue," said Ahmad Chalabi, the current chairman of the Governing Council and the leader of the Iraqi National Congress. "If the government performs well or badly it doesn't matter, because the oil revenue continues to flow. The government will use the oil revenue to cover up mistakes."
Mr. Chalabi pointed to a precedent: a trust fund that existed in Iraq during the 1950's, when part of the oil revenue went not to the government's budget but to a development fund whose disbursements were directed by Iraqi and foreign overseers.
"The fund worked very well," he said. "Iraq's economy in the 1950's and 1960's was relatively good."
Back then, Mr. Chalabi said, oil revenue was a relative pittance, adding up to less than $10 billion in the four decades preceding the Baath Party's rise to power in the late 1960's. But then came the resource curse. During a single decade, the 1980's, Iraq's oil revenue amounted to more than $100 billion.
"What happened to it?" Mr. Chalabi asked. "Iraq was a much better country in every aspect before it got that money."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE MONEY; 
War Budget Request More Realistic but Still Uncertain

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
As the war wound down last spring and gave way to armed occupation, administration officials reassured Congress that rebuilding Iraq would be no big deal, at least in terms of cost to the United States. 
 "We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told a House appropriations subcommittee on March 27. Alan P. Larson, the under secretary of state for economic affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on June 4 that "Iraq will rightly shoulder much of the responsibility." 
 Their optimistic view rested on two assumptions -- that the Pentagon would be able to reduce its military presence fairly quickly and that Iraq was reasonably well developed economically. Both assumptions have proved wrong. 
In requesting $87 billion from Congress for next year to keep trying to stabilize Iraq and get a start on reconstruction, President Bush has acknowledged the error, setting off fiscal and political aftershocks that could be substantial. 
Even if the White House is right that Iraqi oil production will eventually help foot a portion of the bill, and even if other countries agree to chip in more than token amounts, American taxpayers now confront the prospect that Iraq's needs will compete for years with domestic programs, tax cuts and efforts to rein in the budget deficit. 
"The administration may finally have leveled with the Congress and the American people about the initial costs," said Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, the libertarian research organization in Washington. "It has not yet leveled with the Congress or the American people about the length of the American mission in Iraq. One wonders about the domestic reaction if this becomes a perpetual mission."
The new budget request is built around an assumption that allied troop levels will have to remain roughly where they are now for a year, with the United States even picking up much of the tab for several tens of thousands of soldiers from other countries to replace the same number of American troops. And it reflects a judgment that Iraq was an economic shell even before the war, and needs far more extensive investment than the administration had anticipated. 
Analysts said the $87 billion package, which also includes money for security and reconstruction in Afghanistan, amounted to a realistic assessment of what the American presence in Iraq will require in the coming year. They said it reflected both the possibility that other nations would balk at donating large sums to the rebuilding effort and a clear desire by the White House not to risk forcing Mr. Bush to seek more money from Congress next year, in the heat of a presidential campaign in which his handling of Iraq is sure to be a major issue. 
"They stepped up to a politically tough call for the president to get enough money so he doesn't have to go back again next year," said John J. Hamre, chief executive of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a former senior Pentagon official in the Clinton administration. "My read of the number is that we're not counting on anybody else and we may have to do this ourselves." 
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee today, Mr. Wolfowitz defended the costs as necessary to protect the United States from terrorism. "As large as these costs are, they are still small compared to just the economic price that the attacks of Sept. 11 inflicted, to say nothing of the terrible loss of human life," he said. "And even those costs are small in comparison to what future more terrible terrorist attacks could inflict." 
But the package by no means assures that Mr. Bush will be able to dispense with the issue in one quick piece of legislation. 
Any intensified attacks against American and allied troops could further raise the financial cost of the occupation and discourage other nations from deploying their military personnel. 
Even after downgrading its initial estimates of Iraqi oil sales, the administration's plan still rests heavily on the prospect that oil revenue -- $12 billion next year and $20 billion in each of the two following years, up from nothing this year -- will finance both routine government operations and some of the reconstruction. But there is no guarantee that Iraqi oil production, already suffering from sabotage and creaky equipment, will reach the needed level, or that oil prices will remain high enough to generate the projected revenues. 
Should international donations fail to fill the gap between the $15 billion the United States has pledged for rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and the $50 billion to $75 billion the White House says is needed, the administration would also have to decide whether to seek further money from American taxpayers. 
To the degree the United States presses other nations for military and financial help, it will open the door to highly sensitive negotiations over how to parcel out Iraq's oil wealth and what role American companies like Halliburton should play in the rebuilding effort. 
As international aid pours into Iraq, it is also likely to set off a debate over why Iraq should be showered with assistance while much less money goes to poorer nations -- including some that are breeding grounds for terrorism as much as Iraq was said to be or is. 
At the same time, the sheer scale of the Iraq request will put the administration in a difficult position as it tries to hold the line on other spending programs. Even as it completes its $87 billion package, all of which will ultimately show up in the budget deficit and the national debt, the White House is blocking Democratic attempts to add $1 billion for fighting AIDS in the poorest nations to the $2 billion Mr. Bush wants. 
Then there is the potential domestic political fallout heading into an election year. A few fiscal conservatives have suggested that the postwar costs in Iraq might lead them to rethink their willingness to vote for a prescription drug benefit for the elderly. Democrats said their call to roll back some of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, while unlikely to go anywhere legislatively this year or next, might resonate on the campaign trail if the bill for Iraq is perceived to be coming out of domestic programs like health care and education.

CHRONOLOGY
Words on the Cost

MARCH 27

Paul D. Wolfowitz deputy defense secretary, before the House Appropriations defense subcommittee.

Asked what the "entire package" for rebuilding Iraq might be:

"The real number would be not what's going to get you through the rest of the fiscal year, but what is it going to be over two to three years. And my -- a rough recollection -- well, I'm -- the oil revenues of that country could bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of the next two or three years."

JUNE 4

Alan P. Larson under secretary of state for economic, business and agricultural affairs, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:

"On the resource side, Iraq will rightly shoulder much of the responsibility. Among the sources of revenue available are $1.7 billion in invested Iraqi assets, the found assets in Iraq, which currently total roughly $600 million, and $1 billion of unallocated oil-for-food money."

JULY 29

Joshua B. Bolten director of Office of Management and Budget, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Asked if the government expected to continue spending nearly $4 billion a month on the troops in Iraq in 2004:

"We don't have any reason to expect a dramatic change in that number, but I wouldn't want to predict beyond the next couple of months."

JULY 29

Mr. Wolfowitz before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:

"But let's put it in some context. According to some estimates, it cost us slightly over $30 billion to maintain the so-called containment of Saddam Hussein for the last 12 years. And it cost us far more than money. The containment policy cost us American lives; lives lost in Khobar Towers, on the U.S.S. Cole; it routinely put Americans in danger in enforcing the no-fly zones, and it cost us in an even larger way as well."

SUNDAY

President Bush speaking to the nation:

He said that Iraq was now the central front in the campaign against terror and asked for $87 billion for the next year:

"This will take time and sacrifice. Yet we will do what is necessary, we will spend what is necessary, to achieve this essential victory in the war on terror, to promote freedom and to make our own nation more secure."

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Democrats on Capitol Hill intensified their criticism of the Bush administration's Iraq policy today, with moderates as well as liberals demanding a detailed strategic plan from the White House, along with an explanation of why domestic priorities were being shunted aside.
 Nine Democratic senators, including Tom Daschle, the minority leader, introduced a bill that would require the White House to submit a plan of its intentions in Iraq in the next 60 days. Some members said the plan would have to be submitted before the reconstruction portion of the president's $87 billion spending request for Iraq would be granted. 
 "I, for one, will not simply rubber-stamp this request," said Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who as the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee will play a significant role in the debate over spending in Iraq. "Congress is not an A.T.M. We have to be able to explain this new enormous bill to the American people, and the first responsible step for dealing with this request is to hold hearings." 
At the same time, even moderate Democrats whose support the White House is counting on said they would have a hard time explaining to voters why they were spending tens of billions to rebuild schools and hospitals in Iraq while money was short for similar domestic projects.
"I got things that need to be rebuilt in Louisiana," said Senator John B. Breaux, a centrist Democrat who occasionally sides with the administration on economic issues. "And I certainly don't want to give money we don't have to a faraway country to the neglect of the domestic demands we have here. I mean, $87 billion for Iraq and zero for better security at our ports? That's not exactly balanced."
Republican leaders dismissed the criticism as election-year posturing and said that after the fireworks, the president would get the money.
"There's a lot of politics being played right now by people who are running for president or trying to position their party to take advantage of the uncertainty that we have right now," said Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania.
But for Democrats the fireworks were the point. Senator Daschle made it clear that Democrats at the highest levels planned to make regular use of the contrast between domestic and Iraq spending, promising a debate meant to made the administration squirm. 
"If we're going to say we have to provide these other funds with an urgency for Iraq, there has to be an equal urgency for the kinds of things that we care so deeply about here at home," Mr. Daschle said today, repeating a call to defer tax cuts for those making $250,000 or more.
Every Democratic senator, he said, has expressed concerns about the administration's lack of answers on its Iraq strategy and the cost of remaining there. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and others said the questions need to be answered before reconstruction money was released.
Mr. Daschle and other Democrats say they have no intention of holding up the money for Iraq, as many of them are even stronger advocates of a strong reconstruction plan than the Republicans. But they fully intend to hold prolonged hearings on the issue, taking political advantage of rising public discontent with the casualties in Iraq and the cost of the occupation.
Mr. Daschle cosponsored a bill written Senator Dianne Feinstein of California that would require the administration to explain its plans for bringing security to Iraq; the current and predicted cost of remaining there; a timetable for restoring self-government; and the actions taken to increase international participation in the rebuilding plans.
Ms. Feinstein said that after months of giving half-answers to Congressional questions, it was time for President Bush to "level with Congress and the American people."
Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, the majority leader, said that "it's simplistic and it's naive" to demand a detailed strategy. But several centrist Republicans said they would join in the questioning, including Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska.
At a hearing of the Armed Services Committee today, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said, "We underestimated the size of the challenge that we would face after the military operations, unquote, were completed -- the Baathist resistance, the former military people melting into the population, etc."
"The decay of the infrastructure is truly staggering," he said. "You have to see the second-largest city in Iraq, which is a total and complete slum, to appreciate the depth and expense involved."

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves to Halt Import Of Drugs From Canada 

BYLINE:  By GARDINER HARRIS 

 BODY:
The Justice Department moved yesterday to close a chain of Canadian drugstores, signaling that federal regulators are cracking down on the import of cheaper drugs from abroad.
 Carl Moore, president of the drug chain, Rx Depot, remained defiant. Rx Depot allows patients to order prescription drugs from Canada at prices often half those in the United States. 
 "We're not going to stop, and we're going to fight for the right of senior citizens to buy affordable medicines," Mr. Moore said. 
His company, which also operates under the name Rx of Canada, has 85 stores in 26 states, with more opening monthly.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are fiercely opposed to the stores and have been pushing federal drug regulators to take action against them for more than year.
Until yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration had taken only tentative steps, and state efforts had been spotty.
As a result, Rx Depot and similar chains have been spreading like kudzu.
With information from the F.D.A., the Justice Department sent a letter yesterday to Mr. Moore promising that it would seek an order in federal court to shut the company, the largest of these storefront chains, unless it agreed by Thursday to close.
The United States is the last industrialized country that allows drug makers to set prices. Drug prices here are on average twice those in Canada and nearly three times those in Italy, according to a recent report by a Canadian health agency. 
The drug industry argues that it must charge high prices to pay for expensive research and that price restrictions in the rest of the world should be lifted rather than allowing those drugs to be imported into the United States.
But the growing gap between American drug prices and those abroad has caused cross-border prescription drug sales to soar to as much as $650 million annually, according to IMS Health, a company that tracks drug sales.
Some older people take monthly bus trips to Mexico and Canada to buy drugs. Others order drugs from Canadian pharmacies with Web sites. But with computer familiarity limited among the elderly, entrepreneurs like Mr. Moore opened stores to help patients order drugs online. 
Regulators largely ignored the cross-border trade as long as it was occasional bus trips and private Internet orders.
But storefronts indicated that an entire industry had sprung up in defiance of a United States law banning drug imports. Pharmacists complained that the stores lacked pharmacy licenses or licensed pharmacists and could sell the same products for much less. 
State pharmacy boards in Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma began to crack down on the stores, arguing that they were dispensing prescriptions without appropriate state licenses. Some other state pharmacy boards decided to leave the matter to the Food and Drug Administration. 
"In some states, there is no political support to go after Rx Depot," said Carmen Catizone, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.
The drug industry and drug regulators say that imported drugs are more susceptible to counterfeiting than those sold in the United States. 
The F.D.A. said yesterday that one of its investigators had ordered a 30-day, 60-pill prescription of the antidepressant Serzone from an Rx Depot but instead received a bottle with 99 pills. Serzone can, in rare instances, cause serious liver damage, and the F.D.A. argued that the larger number of pills could pose a risk. 
"Unapproved drugs entering the United States through illegal channels pose a significant threat not only to good prescribing practices but to the safety and security of the prescription drug supply," said Mark McClellan, an F.D.A. commissioner.
Some in Congress favor drug imports. An amendment to legislation in the House creating a Medicare drug benefit would legalize drug imports. Representative Gil Gutknecht, a Minnesota Republican, and a sponsor of the amendment, said in an interview that no one had been hurt by such sales. 
Even without the help of federal regulators, drug manufacturers have begun to limit their own sales to Canadian pharmacies in an effort to halt the growth of imports.

HEADLINE: Showdown in Cancun 

 BODY:
The world's attention should be focused on the World Trade Organization's meeting at Cancun this week for reasons having nothing to do with the anti-globalization protests. The protesters will be trying to be as colorful and disruptive as they were when the W.T.O. met in Seattle in 1999, but their role is marginal. The real drama involves the delegates from 146 nations. They are bound to be speaking in eye-glazing bureaucratic Esperanto, but they will be engaged in crucial negotiations aimed at making life fairer for poor countries' farmers, who are struggling haplessly against a rigged global trading system.
 Few things could improve the lives of more people -- including the more than one billion struggling to live on a dollar a day or less -- than a positive outcome in Cancun. By that we mean a strong W.T.O. commitment to create a fair and efficient global market for agricultural goods. 
 To date, globalization remains a flawed game whose rules have been fixed by rich nations. The United States, Europe and Japan have succeeded in forcing others to reduce trade barriers in services and in the industrial goods they excel at producing, while maintaining high tariffs on imported agricultural goods. Or they dole out lavish farm subsidies -- the developed world pays its farmers roughly $1 billion a day in subsidies -- and the produce is then dumped on the international market at prices below the real cost of growing it. That has devastating effects on poorer nations, many of which could improve living standards if only given a chance to export farm products at fair market prices.
Agriculture, the key export industry for many poor countries, is the cornerstone of these trade talks -- called the "development round" -- launched at Doha, Qatar, in late 2001. Nobody doubts what needs to happen to restore the credibility of the global trading system. Eliminating agricultural protectionism could help the developing world's income grow by an estimated $1.5 trillion in the next decade, and that possibility makes the developed nations' selfish reluctance to abandon their farming subsidies all the more appalling. Repeated deadlines have already been missed in this effort, and unless substantial progress is made in Cancun, with all the trade ministers locked in the same conference hall, the chances of coming up with an agreement by the scheduled end of the development round next year seem slim.
Since World War II, the United States has been a steadfast champion, and beneficiary, of freer trade and ever-greater global economic integration. It is in the nation's broadest economic and security interests for the Bush administration to reassume this leadership role, but doing so entails offending powerful farming interests -- cotton and sugar lobbies, for starters -- that stand to lose if forced to compete fair and square against foreign farmers.
Despite the barrier-reducing proposals put forth in the past by his trade czar, Robert Zoellick, President Bush's record of abandoning principles to score cheap political points with special interests like steel unions and the farm lobby raises doubts about whether he will have the stomach to defend the broader national interest and do right by the world's poorest.
Japan and Europe have been even more resistant to the idea of surrendering their harmful agricultural policies. Last month, the United States and the European Union agreed to a vague joint negotiating framework, roundly denounced by others as insufficiently ambitious. It fails, for instance, to stipulate the complete elimination of egregious export subsidies. Mr. Zoellick was no doubt trying to pull Europe closer to the American position, but he must now try again, rather than digging in his heels at the side of European protectionists.
No longer can the two richest trading powers set the world's trading rules on their own. At Cancun, an influential alliance of developing nations and major agricultural exporters -- including Brazil, Thailand, India, Australia and South Africa -- will be pressing, and holding out, for a meaningful liberalization of agricultural trade. The United States ought to make common cause with them.

HEADLINE: EMPLOYEES PAYING EVER-BIGGER SHARE FOR HEALTH CARE 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
People in employer-sponsored health plans are paying 48 percent more out of their own pockets for care than they did three years ago, according to an authoritative new study, and the cost will be even higher next year. 
 Almost two-thirds of large employers raised the amounts that employees are contributing to the cost of their health plans this year, and 79 percent say they will do so again in 2004, according to the study, by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust. 
 Other health care experts are projecting that 2004 will be the fourth straight year of double-digit increases in health insurance premiums.
The steady climb in costs has made health care benefits a hot issue in labor negotiations this year, and it has put pressure on Congress to reach agreement on adding a drug benefit to Medicare. The sponsors of the study said yesterday that health care costs were also a significant drag on the economy. 
"Workers pay substantially more, companies raise prices and they hire fewer people," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which specializes in health care issues. 
Out-of-pocket spending for insurance premiums, deductibles and drug co-payments rose to $2,790 this year for a typical employee with family coverage, from $1,890 in 2000, Mr. Altman said. 
Over all, according to the Kaiser study, health care premiums rose 13.9 percent this year, the biggest increase since 1990, outpacing the 11 percent rise in spending for hospitals and doctors, and far ahead of the 2.4 percent increase in manufacturers' prices. The increase was 15.6 percent for small employers with fewer than 300 workers.
Health care economists say that the rising costs reflect advances in drugs and health care technology and a loosening of managed care restraints during the prosperous 1990's. 
Employers still pay the bulk of the costs -- typically at least 75 percent. But the study found that most employers are shifting more costs to workers, in hopes of lowering the expense by discouraging heavy use of doctors, hospitals and prescription drugs.
Deductibles and co-payments for hospital care, which were uncommon only a few years ago, were required by 4 in 10 plans this year, the study found, and higher co-payments for expensive prescription drugs have been widely adopted. 
"Given the state of the economy and the rapid rate of inflation, I don't think we have seen the worst of increased cost-sharing with employees," said Jon Gabel, vice president of the Health Research and Educational Trust, a nonprofit group based in Washington. The study is based on the responses of 928 employers to a survey about their health care spending.
In a typical example, state employees in Ohio will face increases in deductibles, co-payments for doctor visits and some drugs, and higher ceilings on out-of-pocket costs next year. But in a tradeoff with the state employees' unions, Ohio has postponed a 50 percent rise in the workers' share of insurance premiums to July 2005.
Benefit consultants said the health care inflation rate would slow somewhat next year -- in part, they said, as workers respond to higher out-of-pocket costs by curtailing their use of some expensive drugs and avoiding some less-than-urgent hospital procedures.
"The rate of elective surgeries such as knee surgery is declining," said Kenneth Sperling, a health care consultant with Hewitt Associates.
In addition, spending on allergy drugs is declining after the switch of Claritin to nonprescription status. Employers expect a similar cost dip for ulcer and heartburn remedies when Prilosec, another widely used drug, becomes available in stores without a prescription next week. The switch to over-the-counter sales, however, usually means that the drugs are no longer covered by health plans, so consumers must pay the full price.
Still, based on early insurance contracts reported by large employers, the increases in premiums for the coming 12 months will be substantial. 
"It does look bleak again, looking forward to 2004," said Joseph Martingale, a health benefits consultant with Watson Wyatt. Mr. Sperling said he expected the increase in premiums to fall below 12 percent.
The slowdown in spending for drugs and hospitals is good news for large employers, which typically pay medical bills directly, even if the paperwork is handled by an insurer. 
But insurers and health plans have not passed those savings along to small businesses. Because their premiums were based on last year's health costs, "2003 was a very profitable year for the managed care industry," Mr. Sperling said. 
Employers' health plans cover 175 million people, including 160 million workers and their families and 15 million retirees.
According to the new study, 65 percent of employers increased the amount that employees pay for health insurance this year, 47 percent raised employees' payments for prescription drugs, 34 percent increased deductibles and 34 percent raised co-payments for doctor visits.
Mr. Sperling, the Hewitt consultant, said many large employers added $100 deductibles for hospital visits three years ago. This year, most of the 300 companies that he monitors raised the deductible to $200, and one in four large employers is planning a further increase to $250 in 2004, he said.

HEADLINE: DaimlerChrysler Struggles To Turn the Corner; 
Troubling Economic Signs for Giant Automaker

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER with MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
It is hard to shake the feeling that DaimlerChrysler owns the Frankfurt International Motor Show: the company showcases its cars in imperial style over three exhibition halls.
 But at this year's show, which opened to the media today, it is also hard to shake the feeling that DaimlerChrysler, Germany's largest and the world's fifth-largest carmaker, is out of step with both the industry and consumers. 
 DaimlerChrysler's two most trumpeted new models here are a Mercedes-Benz McLaren sports car with a carbon-fiber body and a sticker price of close to $400,000, and a majestic Chrysler sedan, the 300C. Both seem ill suited to these leaner economic times.
The company's cars are an apt reflection of its deeper business woes. Five years after Daimler-Benz paid $36 billion to buy the Chrysler Corporation, the trans-Atlantic giant finds itself out of step with much of the auto industry. Not surprisingly, perhaps, it faces trouble on nearly every front. 
The Chrysler Group continues to hemorrhage money, prompting rumors of a new cost-cutting plan, which the company denies. Still, a DaimlerChrysler executive refused today to rule out more layoffs at Chrysler, which has already cut 26,000 jobs.
Mitsubishi Motors, which DaimlerChrysler chose as its Japanese partner over Nissan Motor, recently underwent a management shake-up in the United States after its aggressive strategy of sales incentives came apart amid a rash of defaults on new-car loans.
Even Mercedes-Benz, the company's gilded flagship and its most reliable growth engine, is losing momentum. DaimlerChrysler executives predicted that the division's sales would be flat next year, while the car's reputation for quality has recently come under a shadow in the United States and Germany.
"The markets aren't growing, Europe isn't growing, and we have overcapacity in the U.S.," the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, Jurgen E. Schrempp, said in a meeting today with reporters.
Mr. Schrempp found it difficult to summon up excitement for any market outside China, where he has just signed an agreement to make Mercedes E-class sedans in a venture with a Chinese partner.
Showing a photo of himself meeting Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China, Mr. Schrempp noted that by 2013, China will be the world's second-largest car market after the United States, accounting for 8 percent of sales.
But in Frankfurt, the talk was of DaimlerChrysler's troubles in the United States and Germany.
Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, tried to quash rumors that the company planned another round of deep cuts. He told reporters that Chrysler still hoped to meet its goal of a small operating profit this year. Most analysts and even senior company executives say that will be a stretch, given that Chrysler reported an operating loss of $1.1 billion in the second quarter.
Mr. Schrempp defended Chrysler for meeting its cost-cutting goals. But he acknowledged that the division had not been helped by the disappointing debut of the Pacifica, an oversized -- and, critics say, overpriced at around $32,000 -- station wagon that was meant to augur a wave of exciting new models.
"The Pacifica had a slow start," Mr. Schrempp said. "We are trying to create a new market segment."
As Chrysler struggles to right itself, it is trying -- with help from its sister unit, Mercedes -- to vault itself into the premium car market. Its 300C sedan and station wagon will use a Mercedes-Benz transmission, one of the promised benefits of the merger.
While some analysts question whether there is a market for yet another capacious rear-wheel-drive sedan, most seem willing to give Chrysler's premium strategy the benefit of the doubt.
"Being caught in the middle like a J. C. Penney or Sears is a bad spot to be," said Gregory L. Kagay, an analyst with Auto Market Scope of Fredericksburg, Tex. "There is room in between Dodge and Mercedes-Benz for an up-market Chrysler. I like the direction they are taking it."
Chrysler's future is tied to Mitsubishi's, because the companies share the development of small- and medium-sized cars. Analysts say that is why DaimlerChrysler moved quickly when troubles emerged there.
Last week, it named Finbarr J. O'Neill to head Mitsubishi's North American unit, succeeding Pierre Gagnon, a Canadian executive. Mr. Gagnon, ina drive to increase Mitsubishi's market share, had favored liberal lending policies toward young drivers. Many of the loans became delinquent, forcing Mitsubishi to take a 50 billion-yen ($419 million) charge in July.
Mr. O'Neill, the former North American chief of the Korean automaker Hyundai, is viewed as a rising star, and his arrival has been seen as a signal that DaimlerChrysler is determined to fix Mitsubishi's problems, rather than have another ailing division on its hands.
Mr. O'Neill reports to Steve Torok, an American sent from Chrysler to oversee the joint development program. In a news conference last week, Mr. Torok said the turmoil at Mitsubishi would die down.
"We think all the bad news is out," Mr. Torok said. "Finn's role in all this will be to define what Mitsubishi needs for North America. He sets up the duck and we have to deliver it."
Mitsubishi's ties to Chrysler are likely to become even closer. By mid-decade, a Mitsubishi design will replace the current Dodge Neon, which Chrysler promoted a decade ago as a rival to small Japanese cars but which has since been relegated largely to rental car fleets.
Given the weak performance of the two companies -- Mitsubishi's sales are down 20 percent this year, while Chrysler's have fallen 5 percent -- industry executives have speculated that DaimlerChrysler might someday put them under the same umbrella. Mitsubishi could serve as a young, hip entry-level brand, while Chrysler would produce more premium vehicles.
DaimlerChrysler executives insist that Mitsubishi, in which it has a 37 percent stake, will remain independent.
To turn these businesses around, analysts said, DaimlerChrysler must equip them to prosper on their own, rather than as cogs in a global automotive empire. In some ways, that runs counter to Mr. Schrempp's rationale for the merger, which was to share components and technology.
"DaimlerChrysler is going down the same failed road as Ford, trying to leverage its global scale to solve needs in disparate local markets with one-size-fits-all platforms," Mr. Kagay said. "It needs to let regional arms serve regional markets based on those markets' own merits."
Mr. Kagay said he was not disputing the merits of installing a Mercedes-Benz transmission in a Chrysler 300C. "That is probably desirable, relative to crafting an all-new transmission," he said. "But the vehicle needs to be justified based on its market potential in its home market."
In the end, DaimlerChrysler's recovery will hinge largely on its new cars. At this show, its high-end lineup contrasted with that of BMW, Volkswagen, and the Opel unit of General Motors, which presented smaller cars. BMW, its fiercest rival, introduced a more compact version of its S.U.V. for people who find the original too daunting.
DaimlerChrysler's new models partly reflect the vagaries of the product cycle. Mercedes plans to redesign its smaller A-class line, as well as its S.U.V., next year. And Chrysler is rolling out nine new models in 2004, among them a convertible PT Cruiser.
But the promise of exciting cars in the pipeline does little to alter the perception that DaimlerChrysler is losing ground. The German magazine Wirtschaftswoche published a cover story this week with the headline, "Reaching for the Star. How BMW will overtake Mercedes."
Worldwide sales of Mercedes fell 2 percent, to 805,600 vehicles, in the first eight months of 2003, while BMW's sales rose 0.5 percent, to 712,650. In the United States, BMW already outsells Mercedes.
Mercedes also recently got a black eye from a report by J. D. Power & Associates that ranked it behind Chrysler in terms of the problems encountered by drivers through three years of ownership.
Jurgen Hubbert, the DaimlerChrysler board member who oversees Mercedes, said the report had not dented sales.
Most of the complaints, Mr. Hubbert said, stemmed from problems with electronics and communications systems, which, he noted, had become far more sophisticated in the latest Mercedes models.
"Things that have never been in a car before, people expect them to work perfectly," Mr. Hubbert said, with a hint of frustration. "We have to make sure customers understand we are working like hell to fix it."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE U.N.; 
Europeans Offer Plan To Speed Rule by Iraqis

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is to go to Geneva this weekend to discuss the American resolution to broaden international involvement in Iraq with Security Council members. Three of them announced today their own proposals to accelerate the transfer of civil authority to Iraqis.
 The proposed amendments by France, Germany and Russia would expand the United Nations mandate, giving the organization, in cooperation with the interim administration, supervision over when and how Iraqis regain sovereignty. 
 This approach directly challenges Washington's assertion that the new resolution should be a logical extension of the existing balance of responsibilities, under which the military forces and the occupation's civilian administrator, L. Paul Bremer III, are the ultimate authorities over Iraq's military, political and economic administration. 
The Geneva meeting was called early this week by Secretary General Kofi Annan amid signs that Security Council members remained cool to the administration's proposed resolution. Mr. Powell's attendance was announced today by the State Department. 
Two sets of amendments were presented today, with the French and Germans collaborating on one, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The Russians offered a separate set of proposals, which diplomats described in interviews. 
Both plans give Mr. Annan's special representative the responsibility for drawing up a timetable for transferring civilian power, in cooperation with the current Iraqi Governing Council and in consultation with Mr. Bremer.
A senior Bush administration official said this evening, however, that this suggestion was impractical. One reason, he said, was that there was no obvious choice for such a job within the United Nations since the death of Sergio Vieira de Mello, Mr. Annan's envoy in Iraq, in the Aug. 19 bombing of United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.
"Very sadly, the U.N. horse is riderless," said the official. "The French want to turn it over to the U.N. But it doesn't make sense to concentrate on which foreigners are going to run Iraq. We should focus on the establishing of an Iraqi governing authority so they can run their own affairs."
Both sets of amendments essentially accepted the tenet spelled out in the United States plan that would designate all occupying forces now in Iraq -- including 140,000 American and 21,000 non-American troops -- as United Nations-mandated forces operating under American command.
Such a designation would clear the way for another division -- perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 troops from India, Pakistan, Turkey or Bangladesh -- to be added in coming months.
The Russian proposal, according to one diplomat briefed on its contents, gives the multinational force a one-year mandate that could then be renewed by the Security Council.
The American working draft was intended in part to give the United Nations's imprimatur to a force, perhaps enticing countries that had been reluctant to join the Iraq force without United Nations blessing.
But one Council diplomat noted today that in the week since the working draft emerged, "no one yet has indicated that a government would be ready to provide more troops because of that resolution."
A significant issue to be negotiated in Geneva is the nature of the interim authority that would effectively be the trustee for Iraqi interests pending the drafting of a constitution and elections. 
The current Iraqi Governing Council, which was handpicked by the United States, is viewed warily by many in Europe and the Arab world, although an intensive lobbying campaign has won it a measure of acceptance -- most recently from the Arab League, which today agreed to let a council appointee participate in its meetings as the Iraqi representative.
The French and German amendments refer to "the Iraqi interim authority," to which, they say, "effective and substantial authorities should be transferred," according to a copy of the amendments circulating at the United Nations. But they remain vague on what individuals or groups would comprise this authority.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Set to Seek Damages to Pay for Reversing Effects of Pollution 

BYLINE:  By KEN STIER

 BODY:
After months of threatening imminent action, New Jersey officials say they will soon begin broadly enforcing a law that requires polluters to pay the total costs of restoring water sources and other natural resources damaged by contaminants, not just clean up the mess left behind.
 The state's decision to pursue aggressively what are known as natural resource damages could create hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs for New Jersey businesses, especially any heavily polluting chemical and petrochemical companies. 
 Such damages have been collected in the past, but generally only in cases related to catastrophic ecological events, like major oil spills. New Jersey's program, which is being closely watched by other states, would be the first systematic attempt to seek restoration and compensation for damage to natural resources in cases involving more routine pollution. 
"Like in other states, our natural resources have been diminished far more by the accretion of smaller environmental insults from various sources of contamination," said Bradley M. Campbell, the state's commissioner of environmental protection, "and it would shortchange the public interest if we write off these claims instead of pursuing them." 
In particular, Mr. Campbell said, the state must be a better steward of its water resources, since the strains of pollution and overuse are making them the most significant roadblock to the state's growth. New Jersey expects its population to increase by one million by 2020.
Demand for water is expected to outstrip supply in a number of areas of the state within a few years. Camden, the economically depressed city on the Delaware River in South Jersey, is expected to exhaust its water supply within a decade, environmentalists and state officials say.
Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, pointed out that Camden could not afford the expense of finding an alternative water source. 
That kind of talk makes industry nervous. Many companies already regard themselves as scapegoats for the pollution created during the days when environmental controls were virtually nonexistent, and they fear that they are now being asked to shoulder a range of environmental burdens that are the price of the state's prosperity, including looming infrastructure expenses.
Critics of the state's plan say aggressive enforcement could scare businesses off in a struggling economy and undermine cooperation on current cleanup programs. 
The state will initially focus on areas where there has been significant contamination to groundwater; there are more than 3,000 known sites of such contamination, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. 
States are the sole trustees of groundwater, whereas oversight for other natural resources -- surface water, plants, birds and fish -- is shared with federal authorities.
For the last few months, state environmental officials have been negotiating with companies responsible for contaminated sites, and the state had set several deadlines -- the last one was Labor Day -- for the enforcement crackdown. But Mr. Campbell said last Wednesday that the negotiations and the preparation of legal claims against uncooperative companies were taking longer than expected. 
"There will be a series of announcements later this month on claims against responsible parties that have liabilities at one or multiple sites," he said. 
The state first developed regulations for enforcing natural resource damage claims under the Whitman administration. They have been rarely enforced since the state won an appeals court ruling in April 2000 thwarting a legal challenge by industry giants including Chevron, Exxon, Mobil, Public Service Electric and Gas, and DuPont. 
Shortly after the ruling, the industry won passage of a law forcing the state to assert claims of damage to natural resources by 2005, a factor that is encouraging the state to take action, said Tom Borden, director of the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic. Businesses have long tried to undermine this pending liability. 
"Gee whiz, let me think," said John Maxwell of the New Jersey chapter of the American Petroleum Council, which opposes the program. "It's my property, I had a spill, I cleaned it up. Now I have to pay natural resources claims. That doesn't seem appropriate." 
In cases where the costs of restoring a natural resource are prohibitively expensive, the state says it will consider a compromise. For example, the state may forgo a claim for damages if a polluter restores nearby wetlands or provides a substitute recreation area.

HEADLINE: ARTS BRIEFING; 
MR. REDFORD GOES TO WASHINGTON

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
 Robert Redford had a message for members of Congress yesterday: Give arts financing the priority it deserves. Delivering the annual Nancy Hanks Lecture on Arts and Public Policy to an audience of lawmakers at the Kennedy Center, Mr. 
Redford said: "Government support for the arts is not the frivolous giveaway that some would have you believe." He added, "It's a good investment, and it is sound economic development." Mr. Redford, who received the 1996 National Medal of Arts, said nonprofit arts were a $134-billion-a-year industry, employing millions and generating nearly $81 billion in spending and $24 billion in state, local and federal taxes. But, he declared, not only are state legislatures cutting arts programs, but the Bush administration has also recommended "virtually no increase" in federal arts grants and termination of financing of the arts-in-education program. While Americans cherish freedom, "to be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us to tell stories of our choice in the uniqueness of our own voices as citizens and as artists is not to be taken lightly," Mr. Redford said, adding, "To be able to freely voice dissent in our hearts or in our arts is something to protect at all costs."

HEADLINE: Baudelaire's Bird 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MILAN 

 BODY:
Even as Democratic candidates choose "quagmire" as the key word of their new-isolationist campaign oratory;
 Even as Palestinian politicians choose Arafat and war over Abbas and a road map to peace; 
 And even as the pro-American Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, ruefully notes that the fashion in central Europe is to be "leftist, federalist and anti-American": 
Comes now the Arab League, that association of 22 monarchies, dictatorships and oligarchies, to cut through the leftist cacophony making obeisance to terrorism's power. In a pragmatic decision made in Cairo this week, the states of the Middle East directly affected by Saddam's overthrow invited the new foreign minister appointed by the Iraqi Governing Council -- its members selected by the U.S.-led coalition -- to occupy Iraq's seat in the Arab League. 
As noted in this space two days ago, the Arab potentates have practical reasons to welcome Hoshyar Zebari: they want a piece of the political action in the new Iraq. Led by U.S.-dependent Egypt and Jordan, and supported by Saudis eager to maintain Iraq's membership in the oil cartel, the Arabs, over Libya's protest, clasped Zebari (a Kurd, of all people) to their bosom.
This comes as a shock to a lot of diplomats. Previously, the league had refused to recognize the Governing Council in Baghdad, on the ludicrous grounds that it had not been democratically elected. After that pious excuse generated a global horselaugh at the world's least democratic group, Arab leaders decided to become players by conferring provisional regional legitimacy on the coalition's choice. 
The U.N. and international economic groups will now have a harder time slamming doors in the face of the nascent Iraqi government. It's a blow to the Baathists and a boon to those helping the Iraqis build the beginnings of self-government. 
Clues to this coming event could be seen at the Ambrosetti conference, where world big shots gather annually at a northern Italian resort near Milan in a more high-powered setting than the publicized wingding at Davos. (Pundits seek ever more elitist venues.) Members of the Governing Council were huddling with Arab leaders, suggesting that an invitation to Zebari was in the works.
Because Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, knocked media types for our criticism of Turkey's noncooperation in the war against Saddam, I asked the first victorious Islamist party leader why he thought I had been "aggressive." He replied that Turkey had helped in the war by permitting overflights and the use of bases for medical treatment, and that Turks took offense at our failure to report their humanitarian aid. 
So, was he prepared to send troops to join the coalition to help pacify Iraq now? He said Turkey would help with natural gas and with doctors, but there were "ethnic issues that the U.S. does not understand as we do." Erdogan was apparently irritated by the statement of Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari that nations bordering Iraq should not send troops. 
That Turkish pique is fixable. My advice to Hoshyar: go see your counterpart in Ankara and say that Iraq would welcome a peacekeeping force of 10,000 or so Turks, stationed far south of Kurdish areas to avert any friction. To show suspicious Turks that Kurds are Iraqi nationalists, bring along your economics sidekick to discuss Turkish investment in Iraqi industry, including pipelines. It's important that two non-Arab Muslim presences -- Kurdish citizens and Turkish investors -- are part of the new Iraq. 
While leader-hopping, I collared France's prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, who cannot be all bad because he's a tax-cutter. He had spoken about the need to moderate government's role in public services, increase the workers' number of working hours and require 40 years of work before getting pensions -- wrapping these conservative reforms nicely into a poetic metaphor about "Baudelaire's bird."
I looked it up: in "The Albatross," Charles Baudelaire wrote of a graceful bird, "sovereign of space" but clumsy on the ground: "he cannot walkbecause of his great wings." When asked if the image of restraint could be applied to France's imperiousness in the Security Council or attempt to dominate the European Union, the Frenchman smiled: "I was speaking of domestic affairs."

HEADLINE: Bush Nominates 2 For New Fed Terms 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would nominate two prominent members of the Federal Reserve Board, Roger W. Ferguson and Ben S. Bernanke, to additional terms on the board.
 Mr. 
Ferguson will be nominated to a second four-year term as vice chairman, a post that he holds in addition to that of governor. Mr. Bernanke, a former economics professor who has become prominent in many of the Fed's policy debates, will be nominated to a full 14-year term. 
 Neither announcement was a surprise, but both are important. Mr. Bernanke, who joined the Fed last year to fill an unfinished term, has spoken out on topics ranging from the risk of deflation to the way the Fed might change its approach to setting policy.
Mr. Ferguson, who became a Fed governor in 1997 and vice chairman in 2001, has been primarily involved with domestic and international bank regulation. A Harvard-trained economist and a former partner at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, Mr. Ferguson played a crucial role in keeping the financial system intact after the Sept. 11 attacks.
When the attacks occurred, Mr. Greenspan was out of the country. Mr. Ferguson saw to it that banks could get money and remain operational when much of the check-clearing system was paralyzed.

HEADLINE: California Governor's Race Loses Another Major Name 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, dropped out of the race for governor of California today, diminishing the crowded field by one of its brand-name candidates but doing little to clarify the outcome of the Oct. 7 recall election.
 Mr. Ueberroth, whose successful stewardship of the Olympics in Los Angeles almost 20 years ago barely registered with younger voters, decided basically that he did not have any chance of winning. 
 "Frankly, we cannot see how the numbers work for this candidacy to get across the goal line," he told reporters. "To be practical -- I'm a businessman -- I've taken a look at what we're doing, and I've said if I can't win, win all the way, I'm going to step out." 
The Field poll, released today, showed Mr. Ueberroth, a Republican running as an independent, winning only 5 percent of the vote. That compares with 25 percent for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the leading Republican in the race to replace Gov. Gray Davis, if he is recalled. But Mr. Schwarzenegger trails Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, a Democrat, who had 30 percent of the vote.
Some of Mr. Ueberroth's backers could go to Mr. Schwarzenegger. Both are moderates on social issues and have emphasized the need to jump-start the state's economy. But it is not clear that Mr. Ueberroth's supporters will go to Mr. Schwarzenegger en masse. Some may prefer Mr. Bustamante.
Either way, the candidacy of State Senator Tom McClintock, a conservative Republican with 13 percent of the vote in the Field poll, remains a problem for Mr. Schwarzenegger. Mr. McClintock has vowed not to drop out of the race. But if Mr. Schwarzenegger tries to attract McClintock supporters by moving to the right, analysts said, he risks alienating his more moderate supporters.
Peter Ragone, a spokesman for the Davis antirecall committee, said he expected that at least some of the moderates and independents who were supporting Mr. Ueberroth would not transfer their allegiance to one of the remaining candidates but would vote against the recall instead.
"Ueberroth has been presenting himself as the sober alternative in this race," Mr. Ragone said. "I think we're going to pick up some of his support. If he's not in the race, those people are going to be inclined to vote no."
That message will no doubt be reinforced early next week by former President Bill Clinton, who is to visit the state for several long-scheduled appearances, including the dedication of the William Jefferson Clinton Elementary School in Compton. Mr. Clinton's public schedule does not include any joint appearances with Mr. Davis. But a Davis aide said that Mr. Clinton would appear with the governor and speak out against the recall and that details of those events would be announced shortly.
The ballot that voters will confront will ask first whether to recall Mr. Davis and then to choose among 135 replacements. The names of both Mr. Ueberroth and Bill Simon Jr., who dropped out earlier, will remain on the ballot.
Mr. Ueberroth said that before he endorsed anyone, he would meet with all of the major candidates in the next few days and see which shared his dedication to creating more jobs. He also indicated he wanted to lead a bipartisan task force dedicated to that goal, and his endorsement could be contingent upon which candidate agrees to appoint him to such a post.
Mr. Ueberroth said that neither Mr. Schwarzenegger nor the state's Republican establishment had pressured him to drop out. Dan Schnur, his top aide, said that to the contrary, some state Republican officials had viewed Mr. Ueberroth as a kind of "insurance policy" if Mr. Schwarzenegger's candidacy imploded.
But his campaign was gaining no traction. His one debate performance was lackluster. Mr. Ueberroth, a soft-spoken 66-year-old businessman, had tried to run a positive, substantive campaign but could hardly be heard over the roar of the Schwarzenegger machine and the cacophony from other candidates.
Mr. Schnur said Mr. Ueberroth had been unwilling to engage in the negative campaigning that some said would be necessary to raise his standing in the polls. He said Mr. Ueberroth thought such tactics would demean the process and be at odds with his principles.
But the main problem, Mr. Schnur said, was the whirlwind two-month campaign, which, he said, was too short for a relative unknown like Mr. Ueberroth to get his message across. He said that older voters needed reminding of his accomplishments. Younger voters, many of whom have seen a half-dozen Schwarzenegger movies, were receptive to Mr. Ueberroth's message according to focus groups conducted by the campaign, but had to be introduced to him. 
"We decided that was a story we wouldn't have time to tell," Mr. Schnur said.
Regardless, he had a poor showing in the first candidate debate, held last week, stumbling over his answers and appearing bored and distracted. Mr. Ueberroth, who was commissioner of major league baseball from 1984 to 1989, described himself afterward as "a rookie called up to the majors" and said he was unhappy with his performance.
Beyond that, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, senior scholar at the School of Policy, Planning and Development at the University of Southern California, said Mr. Ueberroth seemed to be an anachronism.
"It's not 1984," she said. "This state is so mobile and the demographics are changing so fast that there aren't that many people who remember he presided over the successful Olympics."
Three other candidates met here today in a debate sponsored by the Greenlining Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group for minorities and the poor. Mr. Schwarzenegger declined to appear, prompting Paul Turner, a senior program manager at the institute, to say the absence was "an insult" that would not be forgotten by the group's constituencies.
"His absence today only increases suspicions about his grasp of the issues," Mr. Turner said.
Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger, responded, "By election day, all Californians will know where Arnold Schwarzenegger stands on the issues."

HEADLINE: Paying the Bills for Iraq 

 BODY:
With American military casualties rising and Iraqis restive over shortages of electricity, water and most other things, Congress is inclined to give President Bush the full $87 billion he wants for Iraq and Afghanistan next year. But sticker shock is just starting to set in -- not to mention an awareness of potential costs the president neglected to bring up. Members of Congress are right to ask hard questions about how these huge bills will be paid, whether yielding some authority over Iraq may induce other countries to share the burdens and just how much a prolonged occupation will damage the military. 
 Mr. Bush's request for the next year would bring American spending on Iraq to some $150 billion. The most costly element is military operations -- roughly $1 billion a week. Long-term military costs are unknowable because they depend on how many troops will be needed, and for how long. The strain is already plain. The Army announced yesterday that it was extending the Iraq duty of thousands of reserve and National Guard troops, keeping their jobs and families in limbo. 
 Even if the White House can mend the damage done to American alliances before the war, the prospects for sharing these military burdens are necessarily limited, at least until combat gives way to peacekeeping. Only a few countries have troops adequate for the current phase. Britain is already contributing all it can. A new U.N. resolution could add perhaps an additional 30,000 from Western Europe. Turkey, Pakistan and India might provide peacekeepers, but would probably expect loans and other concessions in return. 
Reconstruction costs are more predictable. A further $50 billion to $80 billion will be needed over the next few years -- more if continued sabotage delays the rebuilding of electricity grids and oil pipelines. In future years, a revived Iraqi oil industry may be able to pay some of the bills. If the White House finally agrees to yield political and economic authority to the U.N., Europe and Japan may also be persuaded to make substantial contributions. Many donors would reasonably demand assurances of fair access to Iraqi reconstruction and oil contracts.
For now, Washington will have to pay most of the bills, and those sums cannot simply be added on to a deficit already nearing a half-trillion dollars. The $87 billion Mr. Bush seeks is equal to a fifth of next year's civilian discretionary spending at home -- more than the combined total for education, job training, and employment and social services. 
But as big as these issues are, Congress already needs to think beyond them. Before the war, the administration failed to define achievable American goals for Iraq or an eventual exit strategy. Those questions can no longer be deferred.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Flaws (and Chances) 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Asked the meaning of two new polls showing a modest improvement in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's approval ratings, politicians and academics divided into two camps: those who dwell on the silver lining, and those who dwell on the clouds. 
 For the silver-lining group, which includes the mayor's advisers, the theory goes this way: The mayor's poll numbers hit rock bottom when he took the unpopular steps of raising taxes and cutting spending, and now that those steps are behind him he will win back the good will of voters when the city's fiscal situation and the economy improve. They point to the improvement in his approval ratings as a sign that that has begun. 
 The clouds camp, though, sees it differently. In the latest New York Times poll, they note, only 32 percent of those surveyed approved of the job Mr. Bloomberg has done. And they say that the 8-point bounce in his approval ratings since June is small, considering all the praise he got for his handling of the city's blackout and the work he put in this summer reaching out to people in the city's neighborhoods. 
One thing is certain, though. Although it is unquestionably unenviable for a politician to have the approval of fewer than one in three constituents, and the mayor's low poll numbers are chum to potential challengers, no one is counting him out yet. For one thing, Mr. Bloomberg, who spent $75 million getting elected in 2001, has held the door open to spending even more on his re-election campaign.
William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director, was carrying a copy of a 1977 newspaper clip aroundCity Hall yesterday. It was an article about another poll taken after another blackout showing that Gov. Hugh L. Carey, who was taking tough measures to pull the city through another fiscal crisis, was rated unfavorably. 
A year later, Mr. Cunningham noted, Mr. Carey was re-elected. Point made.
For Mr. Bloomberg, the new polls released this week hint at plenty of weaknesses and opportunities.
The weaknesses are, perhaps, the most obvious. Most New Yorkers say they do not approve of the way Mr. Bloomberg has done his job. The Times poll found that Mr. Bloomberg's popularity was lowest among black and Hispanic New Yorkers. Only 26 percent of black New Yorkers approved of the way he has handled the job, and among Hispanic voters, who were crucial to his victory in 2001, only 23 percent approved. 
The mayor's strongest base is Manhattan, where 49 percent of those polled approved of the way he has done his job, compared with 27 percent in the rest of the city. That leaves him vulnerable to the kind of attack one potential rival, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., a Democrat, leveled at him this year: that he favors Manhattan. 
And a Quinnipiac University poll that was released yesterday found that 71 percent of registered city voters said that they do not believe Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, connects well with the people of the city. 
But there are opportunities as well. The Quinnipiac poll, which put Mr. Bloomberg's job approval rating at 38 percent, found that 60 percent of New Yorkers think he is honest and trustworthy and 60 percent approve of his handling of crime. 
The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 815 registered city voters from last Wednesday through Monday, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Several analysts noted that the mayor is not being compared to a challenger yet. "This is judging the mayor against an abstract standard," said Kenneth Sherrill, the chairman of the political science department at Hunter College. "And you can't beat someone with no one -- unless you're in California, where that is how the recall works."
The Times poll found that Mr. Bloomberg does best among New Yorkers with high incomes, and those who are most highly educated. 
"He does better with people who pay more attention to politics," Professor Sherrill said. "They are people who understand the complexities, people who recognize the difficult choices the mayor must make as dilemmas. But even though they're the people who are most likely to vote, they get outnumbered."
Governor Carey -- whom Mr. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director, once worked for -- won re-election using the slogan, "The more you know, the more you know Hugh Carey is right for governor." Mr. Bloomberg's success among more politically savvy New Yorkers may encourage him to try a similar strategy in 2005.
Andrew White, the director of the Center for New York City Affairs at the Milano Graduate School at New School University, said that he does not think the mayor's political problems are insurmountable, but that winning re-election will take work. 
"I think, if he has a year of pretty good news, and he crafts some kind of communications strategy and holds to it and then wins the right endorsements and spends $100 million on media, I think he'll have a better shot than it looks now," he said. 
Mr. Bloomberg's low poll numbers are already encouraging plenty of potential challengers to test the waters for a mayoral run. Some are raising money. 
Mitchell Moss, an adviser to the mayor who is a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, said that Mr. Bloomberg's low poll numbers could have the unintended benefit of encouraging them all to jump into the race. 
"That ensures that the Democratic primary will be fractious, mean-spirited and race-baiting," he said.
But some Republicans are also considering challenging Mr. Bloomberg in a primary, which could force him to run to the right just before a tough general election.
For his part, the mayor predicted he would win re-election. 
"All I have got to do is focus on doing what's right: bringing down crime, improving schools, making the streets cleaner, bringing jobs to the city, balancing a budget that is more difficult to balance than anything anybody has ever seen," he said yesterday at a news conference in the Bronx. "I think we are all going in the right direction and I think the public is starting to recognize that."

HEADLINE: TWO YEARS LATER: WHITE HOUSE MEMO; 
High Profile of 9/11/02 Shifts to Low on 9/11/03

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
When it came time to commemorate the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks last year, President Bush raced to all three sites of horror: The Pentagon, ground zero and the field in Shanksville, Pa., where the jetliner that did not hit Washington left a fearsome scar. The television cameras rarely let him step out of the center of the picture.
 The contrast could not be greater with the second anniversary, on Thursday, when the president will not leave Washington in a day of low-key remembrances, starting at the small church across from the White House and ending at a nearby military hospital where, out of sight, he will visit soldiers wounded in Iraq. 
 And inside the White House and the Bush campaign, discussion has begun on how to handle next year, when the Republican convention is deliberately scheduled for New York a week before the third anniversary. In the heady days of April, when the air was thick with the sounds of military victory in Iraq, convention planners were talking about rolling the political events seamlessly into the solemn remembrance. But the White House now has different ideas. 
"I think next year will look a lot like this year," a close Bush aide said today. While the last Sept. 11 was a moment for the president to lead the nation in grief, "from here on out, the president believes this is not a day about him, but a day about those who lost their lives."
In fact, as Mr. Bush prepares for the second anniversary, the tone of remembrances past, present and future underscore the continued sensitivity at the White House and within the Republican Party about how to mark not only the 9/11 attacks, but all that followed.
It is a calculus that hinges not only on measures of taste, but measures of success -- especially now that the glow that surrounded Mr. Bush in May as he landed in full flight suit on the aircraft carrier Lincoln, beneath the banner proclaiming "Mission Accomplished," has burned off, and the successful reconstruction of Iraq is an open question. 
"Last year you had an open wound, physically and metaphorically," one senior White House official said today, explaining why it was important that the president lead the nation in a series of memorial events. "This year it is about healing -- you don't ever want to forget, and the war goes on, but the spiritual need is different."
Since 9/11, the Bush White House has usually been quite skilled in striking the right tone -- and Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, has periodically stepped in to remind the president when she thought that macho pronouncements (especially his statement that Osama bin Laden was "wanted dead or alive") overwhelmed good taste and good sense.
But there was considerable backlash to his flight-suited landing on the Lincoln. Then came what Bush aides now concede was clumsy handling of the inquiries into whether the White House and 10 Downing Street exaggerated the threat of Saddam Hussein's weapons, starting a battle between the White House and the C.I.A. over who was to blame for presidential misstatements.
That eroded Mr. Bush's credibility on postwar issues, some White House aides concede under cover of anonymity, and made him more vulnerable to charges like the one that Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, made today, that the White House "did a miserable job of planning for a post-Saddam Iraq." 
So this week, more than at any time in the last two years, Mr. Bush and his aides have come face to face with the reality that the value of their political stock depends not only on the state of the economy, but on whether Iraq looks more like postwar Germany during the Marshall Plan or Yugoslavia after the cold war. 
Mr. Bush, the Democratic pollster Mark J. Penn said, is facing larger "questions now about how he handles the war on terrorism and Iraq and the economy than he ever has before."
The plan for Thursday is to keep the focus on small memorials -- moments of silence, ringing church bells -- and not on Afghanistan, Iraq or the events that have followed.
Vice President Dick Cheney will be at ground zero. He tends to be more restrained than President Bush, and officials do not expect the kind of tearful embraces that marked Mr. Bush's encounters last year with the husbands, wives and children of those who died.
In his appearances in recent days, Mr. Bush has not dwelled on 9/11, other than to repeat a key theme of his address to the country on Sunday night: That Sept. 11, Afghanistan and Iraq were all battles in the same war. "The wise way to go right now," said Bill Dal Col, a Republican strategist who is not connected to the White House, "is to offer reminders of how vulnerable we are, but how strong we have become -- and to say we are still in the middle of a fight."
But there is risk to that strategy, too. Last year's memorials reminded the nation of Mr. Bush's performance in the weeks following 9/11, transforming days that are now regarded as the strongest moments of his first term. By linking 9/11 to all that has followed, Mr. Bush runs the risk of mixing those memories with questions of why he had a hard time holding on to the sympathy of allies, or whether he rushed into Iraq before a workable plan was in place on how to handle its occupation. 
"Everything is in cycles with this, and the heady euphoria has led to a hangover," said one Republican strategist who talked with White House officials often. "The easy boisterism of the postwar is over," the official said, "and the sweep of foreign affairs has gone from overwhelming advantage to a more problematic advantage."
Mr. Bush, for his part, insists he does not have time for politics right now. "The political season will come in its own time," he said on Monday night in Nashville, at a fund-raiser where he raked in an estimated $1.2 million, and was introduced by the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, who compared Mr. Bush's performance to Franklin D. Roosevelt's during World War II.
"I'm loosening up," Mr. Bush said. "And I'm getting ready. But I've got a job to do," which he said he would do "by keeping this nation secure and strong and prosperous and free." It is one of the biggest applause lines of his standard campaign speech.

HEADLINE: What Will It Be, New York City? For $166 Million, Make It Snapple 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
For the right price, the Big Apple is happy to be called the Big Snapple.
 Under a five-year $166 million deal announced yesterday, Snapple, the beverage company that claims its drinks are made from the best stuff on earth, and New York City, which claims to be the capital of the world, are uniting to promote each other. Snapple is now an official beverage of the city. 
 Most immediately, the venture will give Snapple exclusive rights to place vending machines in the city's 1,200 public schools. And starting on Jan. 1, the deal will extend to other city properties, including office buildings, police stations and even sanitation depots. 
In return, Snapple will guarantee to pay the schools at least $8 million a year for five years. Under other parts of the deal, Snapple is expected to pay the city about $13 million a year, based on sales. And it will spend $12 million a year on advertising that also promotes the city.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg described the arrangement as unprecedented for a city of New York's size. The deal is the first to be brokered since he hired a chief marketing officer for the city in April.
The mayor has long insisted that New York City is not just an important megalopolis but a powerful brand name with strong revenue potential. And Joseph M. Perello, the chief marketing officer, said the Snapple deal was just the beginning. 
"Snapple will become the official iced tea and water," Mr. Perello said, leaving open the possibility that one day the city would have an official cola, or flavored tonic. "This is the start of a select number of really high-quality partnerships."
Whether a partnership with a beverage company will actually encourage tourism and promote economic development or simply expand Snapple's market share among the municipal work force is anyone's guess. 
As part of the deal, Snapple is developing four new 100 percent juice drinks -- Green Apple, Orange Mango, Grape and Fruit Punch -- to comply with the city's recent ban of soda, candy and other sugary snacks from school vending machines. Even though Snapple plans to sell 100 percent juice drinks, that does not necessarily mean slimmer waistlines for schoolchildren. Like soft drinks, many fruit juices provide calories from sugar and not much else. And while fruit contains at least some fiber, it is usually lost when the fruit is turned into juice.
"I think most nutritionists would say that if you have to drink something that comes in a can, Snapple is probably as good as you can get and they are also vending water," Mr. Bloomberg said. "You have to have something healthy, but you also have to have something that kids want to drink."
To be the Education Department's exclusive vendor, Snapple will pay the city a 30-cent commission on each $1 can of juice or water sold in schools. (Iced tea will not be sold in the schools.) In addition, the company will pay $3 per case sold tosupport school athletics, for a total of at least $3 million a year. Some of the money will go directly to schools, many of which rely on vending machines to support athletic teams and other programs.
When the ban on sweets was imposed last spring, some principals said the financial loss would be crippling. The mayor said that each school would get at least as much money as it did last year in vending revenues.
Mr. Bloomberg announced the deal on the athletic field at John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx, with a bright-orange Snapple vending machine and the high school's football team standing behind him. 
"It is my pleasure today to announce the first official corporate-marketing partnership the city has established," he said. "Given the global popularity of Snapple products, this will present the city with countless new opportunities to make positive impressions on people around the world." 
Outside the schools, Snapple will sell bottled water, iced tea and Yoo-hoo chocolate drink. Vending machines in other city buildings selling non-Snapple products will eventually be replaced, but contractual obligations may limit how quickly that changeover can take place. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said that a primary goal was to help Snapple boost business. "The corporate partner has to recognize benefits in terms of its ability to grow sales," he said, "and we certainly hope that for Snapple that's the way this will work." Mr. Doctoroff and other officials described the deal as generous on Snapple's part, and said that the company, now a division of Cadbury Schweppes, had a special loyalty to the city because it was founded in Brooklyn.
Jack Belsito, the president of the Snapple Beverage Group, echoed this. "New York City loves Snapple," he said. "Snapple loves New York City, its pretty much as simple as that."
Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said the deal would help the school system maintain nutritional standards. "We are going to make sure that the fat and sugar content is diminished," he said. "And there's no purpose to try to do that if we don't have a beverage program that's consistent."
Mr. Perello said that the Education Department had met with several beverage companies before selecting Snapple. A bidding process was not required, he said. 
Some beverage companies, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, have faced criticism for marketing aggressively to schools and for their efforts to lock school districts into exclusive contracts. In response to growing opposition in schools to sugary soft drinks, Coke recently introduced a milk-based beverage called Swerve, specifically aimed at school-age children.
Designating an official beverage is a growing trend among cities. San Diego, for example, is paid more than $1.5 million a year to sell only Pepsi products on city grounds. A similar deal between Oakland and Coca-Cola has so far proved disappointing, with the city making far less than expected. New York State's official beverage is milk but is not tied to any particular brand.
Yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg dismissed a question about whether it was appropriate to promote the Snapple brand in schools. 
"We already have vending machines in every school," he said. "They have other brand names on them. So that's a bridge that has long ago been crossed and I don't think in this day and age we can take the vending machines or should out of the schools."

One Vision: A Hill of Green at Ground Zero

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
Last Wednesday morning, without warning or fanfare, a FedEx box arrived at my door. Inside was a shipping folder of white foam board, with a letter attached to it addressed to me and signed by Ellsworth Kelly.
 "On October 19, 2001," it began, "I wrote a letter to you (that I never sent) in response to an article in The New York Times which discussed the controversy of what was to be planned for the 'Ground Zero' space, asking artists and others for their opinions." Mr. Kelly noted that two other artists, Joel Shapiro and John Baldessari, had urged that no building be erected at the site and that the architect Tadao Ando had made a similar proposition. 
 "At that time, my idea for the World Trade Center site was a large green mound of grass," he continued. 
More recently he saw an aerial photograph of the site on the cover of the Aug. 31 Arts & Leisure section of The Times. "I was excited to see the site from this vantage point," he wrote. "I was inspired to make a collage of my idea for the space of which I am sending you."
"I feel strongly," he continued, "that what is needed is a 'visual experience,' not additional buildings, a museum, a list of names or proposals for a freedom monument." These, he said, are "distractions from a spiritual vision for the site: a vision for the future."
I've stopped counting the number of ground zero proposals that have come my way in the past two years. But this newest addition, a green paper trapezoid positioned onto a page of fresh newsprint, representing a park at ground zero, is one I can't keep. Ellsworth Kelly's collage belongs in a real museum. And thanks to an anonymous donor and Maxwell Anderson, the outgoing director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the collage has entered the collection of one. Titled "Ground Zero," the collage, half the size of a newspaper page, will go on display this morning in the lobby of the Whitney, Madison Avenue at 75th Street, as part of the museum's current show, "Ellsworth Kelly: Red Green Blue."
Like Piet Mondrian in the 1940's, Ellsworth Kelly has with this piece transformed Manhattan into the musical state of mind we intuitively know it to be. Mondrian called this state "Broadway Boogie Woogie." Complexity is the technical term for it. It's full of fascinating rhythms. They help make New York an enchanted place.
But in the past two years the level of complexity has become almost too high for the city to bear. Few of us could have anticipated that a world-shattering event would explode in our front yard. City life can be disorienting enough without having to negotiate around a huge chunk of history hurled down violently into our midst. 
To cope with the World Trade Center catastrophe, many New Yorkers have had to construct a kind of remoteness between themselves and 9/11. For some of us,architecture has been an effective construction technique. To borrow Mr. Kelly's term, the design process has offered a series of distractions, both from the horror of the event and from the spiritual imperatives it has imposed on both the city and the nation.
Economic forces, political maneuverings, the power plays of civic and professional organizations, not to mention the inspired ideas produced by many artists, architects, planners and designers: all this has provided an endless stream of diversion from the simple, tragic fact of human carnage that took place in our midst. In this sense, complexity has helped to sustain sanity even as it has threatened to undermine it.
Some think that minimal art is our country's most important contribution to culture. I'm not sure that this is true, or that it's even an American invention. Mies van der Rohe had developed it in architecture before setting foot on our soil. Yet it is true that minimalism has held a particular appeal to Americans. It enables us to withdraw from the midst of complexity without denying the manifold reality of contemporary life.
Mr. Kelly's collage holds this appeal for me, as I suspect it will for many who once hoped that a dignified way could be found to express the unity of death and regeneration. The Manhattan cityscape has long been a standard visual metaphor for differentiation, for the breakup of unity that defines and haunts the modern world. Mr. Kelly has shifted the architectural jumble to a new metaphoric plane. His trapezoid has turned the disjointed cityscape into a symbol of the complex emotional and ideological forces that have been raging around ground zero.
Every park signifies escape from the asphalt jungle. Mr. Kelly's does, too. But simplicity is more than an escape from complexity. It is a technique for balancing contradictions. In this case, simplicity holds birth and death together as two halves of a continuum.
Some will interpret Mr. Kelly's proposal as a burial mound. They will be half right. The subject of the work, if it is possible to isolate one among many possible readings, is the continuity of life. That was the concept behind many of the great earthworks constructed in neolithic times. The message is still fresh.
In my student days abroad, I spent weekends west of London in Wiltshire, not far from Silbury Hill, the tallest earthwork in Europe. Its construction, which may have taken a century or longer to complete, has been dated to about 2700 B.C.; 130 feet high, the mound was long thought to be the burial site of a legendary Celtic chieftain named King Sil. But 20th-century excavations could not locate a body, and it is now thought that the hill represents in monumental form the tiny mounds of earth where seeds of grain are planted. It's entirely possible that "King Sil" was an ear of corn.
Typically, earth mounds were used for the harvest festivals that were held in August and September of each year. They were playing grounds for tribal fights and elaborate feasts. The harvesting of the crops and the approach of winter signified the acceptance of death. The festivals were religious rites intended to insure the regeneration of life the following spring. Silbury Hill was the center of a fertility cult, that is to say.
Mr. Kelly's interest in earthworks began with the Indian mounds of the American Midwest. The mound he has imagined for ground zero would rise perhaps 30 feet. In a telephone conversation, Mr. Kelly suggested that plantings could change, as would the colors. In autumn, a crop of wheat would yield a blazing red and orange dome.
Mr. Kelly, who is 80, regards this work as the continuation of a genre he embarked on in 1954, when he returned to the United States after living in Paris for eight years. His earliest collages often took the form of postcards to friends. Depicting imaginary monuments in familiar settings, Mr. Kelly affixed abstract shapes in locations like New York Harbor, Central Park, the East River and the Midtown skyline.
To my knowledge, the ground zero collage is the first of these images conceived as a "real" proposal. As such, it arrives too late. Urged on by a mix of political, economic and therapeutic desires, teams of reality experts are now rushing to get buildings into the ground.
But New Yorkers have developed an extraordinarily supple attitude toward reality in the past two years. As the ground zero design process has unfolded, they have become increasingly aware that all architecture is fantasy, never more so than when it is passed off as fact. Money can be even more abstract than the paper on which countless ground zero proposals have been inscribed. Materials are coaxed by architects into satisfying their clients' fantasies of immortality and other, stranger forms of power.
Urgency is also a fantasy. In large part, it stems from the accelerating news cycle to which reality is increasingly expected to conform. People get anxious when reality drags its feet. As the anxiety becomes intolerable, they start looking around for someone to blame. And so the complexity builds.
In her brilliant book "Central Park, An American Masterpiece" (Harry N. Abrams, 2003), Sara Cedar Miller recounts that Olmsted and Vaux, the park's designers, deliberately sought to recreate the settings captured by painters of the Hudson River School. Those paintings were works of philosophy as well as visual art. They tried to convey the metaphysical aspiration of writers like Emerson, Bryant and Thoreau.
Mr. Kelly's idea should be seen in a similar light. Our greatest living master in the rendering of natural sources into abstract form, Mr. Kelly is an heir to those 19th-century painters who tried to convey the awesome beauty of the sublime. In this work, he functions as his own Olmsted: a translator of artistic vision into urban poetry. Implicitly, the collage asks whether, as the heirs to Olmsted's city, we should not strive to create a work that transcends economic and political interests. The affirmative answer offered by this particular shade of green is irrefutable.
Yet it is virtually a foregone conclusion that Mr. Kelly's idea will not be warmly welcomed by public officials. Their social nature will take its course. Mr. Kelly's vision thus represents the unattainable. From the perspective of the reality experts, the concept is doomed. This only adds to the sublimity it projects.

In an African City, All Roads Lead to Rome

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: ASMARA, Eritrea 

 BODY:
THERE is a joke about an Asmarino, as the proud residents of this African capital call themselves, who visits Italy and is surprised at how much the architecture there mimics the buildings back home.
 Naigzy Gebremedhin, an Asmara architect who has cataloged the city's historic buildings, chuckled as he recounted the tale. "The Asmarino loves his city," he said, sipping a macchiato in an Asmara cafe. "He thinks everyplace else is pedestrian. The typical Asmarino believes there's no place in the world like Asmara." 
 On that point the Asmarino is right. History has been extraordinarily cruel to Eritrea, which suffered many decades of foreign occupation, but it has been quite generous, too. Today Asmara, the capital of Africa's newest state, which is nestled along the Red Sea, finds itself a standout among the continent's congested and tattered urban centers. 
The Italian occupiers who built up Asmara in the 1930's used the city as an architectural Petri dish. Bold experimentation that might have gone too far in Europe was permitted, even encouraged, in this colonial outpost. "The Italians tried to express the modern Roman empire in grand terms on a blank slate, just as the British did in Delhi," said Gabriel Abraham, an Eritrean architect based in Cambridge, Mass. What remains today is an architectural mishmash, but one that makes Asmara one of rarest concentrations of modernism in the world.
It can require some imagination to look past the crumbling plaster and appreciate the bold designs behind it. But it is clear that these buildings were erected for more than their functionality. There are turrets and grand arches, Art Deco awnings and, in the spirit of Italian Futurism, swooping references to trains, planes and ocean liners. Most of this has sat untouched since it was built in the first half of the 20th century.
A book on the city's architectural wonders, "Asmara: Africa's Secret Modernist City," to be published next month by Merrell, provides a building-by-building look at a place that Mussolini dreamed would be the start of his Italian empire in East Africa. "The Miami of Africa" is what some have called Asmara because of its Art Deco treasure, but other architectural styles are represented as well -- Rationalism, Novecento, neo-Classicism, neo-Baroque, and monumentalism among them.
"I was astonished to see the architecture of Asmara," said Nadine Bolle, a professor of architectural history at the University of Applied Science in Geneva, who visited Asmara several years ago. "There aren't many cities anywhere in the world with such an assemblage of well-preserved historical buildings."
Mr. Gebremedhin, an architectural consultant who wrote the book with two colleagues, Edward Denison and Guang Yu Ren, soaks up his city's treasures as he strolls. Like so many Eritreans who fled the long years of fighting in his homeland, Mr. Gebremedhin, 69, spent most of his life elsewhere, in his case in Ethiopia. But he is back now, trying to help his country make the transition to peace.
"Beyond the peeling paint, you see an urban idiom that is so pleasing," he said, gazing up at a refurbished villa. "Look at that gutter system. It is almost sculpted. Asmara is full of secrets."
But preserving the past is a challenge in a country that ranks among the world's poorest. Mr. Gebremedhin stood recently in the center median of Sematat Avenue, a broad roadway dedicated to those who died helping Eritrea win independence in 1991 after a succession of administrators from Italy, then Britain and finally Ethiopia.
As traffic rushed by in both directions, including cars as old as the buildings, Mr. Gebremedhin began scowling. He motioned toward a nondescript office building called Nakfa House, towering at nine stories above all surrounding structures. "Here's a building that doesn't fit in anywhere," he said.
Mr. Gebremedhin pointed out that the building, erected in the early 1990's, dwarfs a former Fiat Tagliero service station built in the streamlined style of Futurism and blocks the view southward from the city center. But some good has come from it. "That's the terrible building," he said, "that caused us all to decide to save the city."
The old stone and cement facades are relatively intact, but the interiors have received little or no maintenance over the years, especially since many owners fled the country. Now, in a rare period of peace, Eritreans are repatriating, bringing with them not only additional car traffic through narrow streets but new demands for housing.
In response, Asmara established a historical district of one and a half square miles in the heart of town two years ago and restricted alterations to any of the significant properties there. Such preservation impulses are rare in Africa. Not all Eritrean property owners relished the designation, some seeing it as an infringement on their property rights. But dissent has been muted by Eritrea's intense community spirit, as well as by rising property values.
The effort has been led by Mr. Gebremedhin, who heads Eritrea's Cultural Assets Rehabilitation Project. Financed with a $5 million World Bank grant, the project aims to catalog Asmara's historical treasures and work to preserve them.
Usually, war destroys history, but not here. It was Eritrea's long history of conflict, which isolated it from the outside world, that preserved Asmara. The British, who took control of Eritrea from the Italians during World War II, did little to alter the place. Their main influence on Asmara architecture was to remove some of the more blatant architectural tributes to Mussolini.
Ethiopian control over Eritrea,its tiny northern neighbor, lasted from 1962 to 1991 but did little to change Asmara either. The city was largely left to languish as Eritrean rebels waged a 30-year war for independence, a grueling campaign that required them to sustain themselves in the country's harsh landscape. Asmara was a place they dreamed of returning to one day.
In 1991, after the fall of the military regime in Ethiopia, that dream came true. The new nation of Eritrea, created officially in 1993, found its capital tattered but standing. But peace did not last long: a border skirmish with Ethiopia broke out in 1998 and lasted two years, leaving tens of thousands dead and wrecking the country's economy. Asmara emerged a little more weathered but still largely unscathed.
The city was designed as an extension of the Italian lifestyle of the 1930's. The broad avenues promoted the passeggiata, or evening stroll. The sidewalk cafes and ornate cinemas were places of diversion.
Despite Eritrea's difficulties, that lifestyle lives on. Eritreans, more than any other Africans, still relish leisurely walks. They crowd along the old Viale Mussolini, now called Harnet Avenue (from the Tigrinya word for independence), ambling along to nowhere in particular.
As they stroll, Eritreans pass some of the city's grandest architecture. There is the stately Asmara Theater, with its Romanesque and Renaissance flourishes, sitting on a hill framed by palm trees. Although in serious need of refurbishment, like so many of Asmara's buildings, the theater has a well-preserved Art Nouveau fresco showing eight women dancing overhead.
Across the street is the former Palazzo Falletta, which like other Novecento-style buildings has the distinctive balance of modern and classical that characterized Italian design between the wars. The structure, an apartment building erected in 1937, was designed as a modern version of a medieval castle with corner towers built around a central courtyard.
The Viale Mussolini itself was built as a parade ground, wide enough for throngs of Italian faithful. The old Fascist Party headquarters shoots up prominently at one corner, a brick-and-mortar tribute to the supreme leader; it now houses Eritrea's Ministry of Education. The austere building, whose height was meant to give it outsize authority, was never finished, because Allied troops arrived in midconstruction in 1941.
The dark side of the Italian occupation of Asmara can still be seen in the grim ghettos set aside for the local population. Italians built none of the city's grand structures for the Eritreans. They planned to stay forever, and their development of the city showed clear disdain for those they called the "natives."
The slums remain, and the poor residents there still feel cut off from the Italian part of town, now home to more prosperous Eritreans. "We feel like part of our city is a museum, but this is real life," said Ahmed, a college student, standing by the tin-roof shack he calls home. He said he was frightened to give his full name because of the government's intolerance of any dissent.
Eritrea has not gone the way of other African countries, which have sought to wipe out reminders of their colonial past. Perhaps because they suffered mightily under Ethiopian occupation, many older Eritreans recall the Italian days with some nostalgia. Most traces of the Ethiopian rule have been erased, but remembrances from the Italian days endure.
Bar Crispi, named after Francesco Crispi, the Italian foreign minister who organized the original colony of Eritrea, still serves up homemade vino. Aplaque at the Orthodox Cathedral indicates it was built in the year XVI -- 1938 on the Mussolini calendar, which started time at the beginning of his rule in 1922.
"This is our town," said Tesfai Menghistu, a retired oil executive who was born in 1937, at the heart of the building boom. "Maybe it's an Italian concept, but our blood and sweat built it. I don't feel this is a foreign place. It may look like an Italian town, but it's Eritrean."
Today, Asmara finds itself caught in an odd interplay of past, present and future. At the cavernous Cinema Impero, built in 1937 and elaborately decorated with sculptures and bas-reliefs, a few dozen people walked up the marble staircase into the grand interior the other day to watch "X-Men," the futuristic 2000 film starring Halle Berry. The old projection room, where film reels used to roll, was abandoned several years ago in favor of a modern DVD projector.
As for the old Fiat gas station, designed in 1938 by Giuseppe Pettazzi, it is now in the midst of a renovation, surrounded by construction fencing. Invoking the Futurist style, Mr. Pettazzi designed concrete wings that jut out 97 feet. The city authorities of the time, not trusting his structural calculations, required him to put pillars under the wings. But Mr. Pettazzi, by local legend, installed detachable pillars and forced the builder at gunpoint to remove them at the station's opening.
More than six decades later, the wings (still pillarless) remain in place. Soon the building will house a disco.
The former Bank of Eritrea building, one of Asmara's first Modernist buildings, escaped the wrecking ball in the 1990's, when developers began trying to spruce up the capital. The bank, with vertical windows and simple geometries, was to have been replaced by a huge glass high-rise. But the building's past helped secure its future. In an earlier incarnation, the bank had served as a prison -- Caserma Mussolini, it was called -- and some of the Eritreans who were jailed there wanted a reminder of the difficult old days of foreign rule.
Not everybody agreed. Mesghina Almedom, 78, a retired schoolteacher and a former member of the Eritrean Parliament, said the old building had too many bad memories. "People suffered and died in there," he said. "If I were head of the country I would have destroyed it overnight."
As for the rest of the old buildings, Mr. Almedom said he does not view the Italian structures as truly representing Eritrea's heritage. "They're useful to us," he said of the grand architecture. "Why should we destroy them? The Italians left us some good things. Let's not deny the past, good and bad."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 18, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Thursday about the architecture of Asmara, the capital of Eritrea in Africa, misspelled the given name of a former member of Parliament who regretted the preservation of a building that had been used as a prison when the country was ruled by the Italians. He is Mesghenna Almedom, not Mesghina.
The article also referred incorrectly to his career in education. Though he once taught school, he later became the head of Eritrea's Education Department; he is not a retired schoolteacher.

HEADLINE: TWO YEARS LATER; 
Jobs, Tourists and Nail-Biters: Taking the City's Pulse After 9/11

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON and MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
It's two years later. New Yorkers are taking more antidepressants. They fear they will be the target of another terrorist attack. They are still staggering from the jobs and money lost after the last one. 
 It does not come as a surprise that a statistical snapshot of the city after the World Trade Center attack produces more grim numbers: bankruptcies up, Broadway attendance down, the fact that of all the nation's securities jobs lost in the past two years, four-fifths of them came out of Manhattan. These numbers are mere hints of the incalculable pain caused by the human losses. 
 What is amazing is that there are more than a few numbers that offer reasons for hope. 
Unemployment is beginning to head down. Subway ridership -- which tends to track ups and downs in the city's general health -- is strong. And, perhaps most surprisingly, the apartment buildings at Battery Park City, the community just west of the World Trade Center site, are all but full.
 ERIC LIPTON and MIKE McINTIRE

BANKRUPTCY -- Since the attack on the World Trade Center, people have found it harder to make ends meet. In the 12 months before March 2001, 23,700 individuals filed for bankruptcy in the New York City area, according to the Administrative Office of the United States District Courts. In the year ending March 2002, 26,260 individuals filed for bankruptcy. In March 2003, the figure rose to 28,966.

WALL STREET -- The attack pushed already nervous investors firmly into pessimism. On Sept. 10, 2001, 1,274,909,598 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange. On Sept. 17, 2001, when the markets finally reopened, 2,367,954,572 shares were traded. That day, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 7.1 percent to close at 8,920.70, a one-day drop that pushed the Dow to 20 percent below its peak, a traditional indication of a bear market. These days, investors are feeling more confident. Yesterday, 1,498,456,000 shares were traded and the Dow closed at 9,420.40, down 86.80.

10048 -- Measures of what was lost on Sept. 11, 2001, still trickle into the history books.
While it stood, the World Trade Center was large enough to be its own ZIP code: 10048. Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College, analyzed Census Bureau data on business activity from 2000 (the most recent year available) broken down by ZIP codes. He found that while only 55 people lived in 10048, made up of the seven buildings of the World Trade Center, 31,149 people worked there. Those people were paid an average of $101,006 in 2000, the highest income per worker of any ZIP code in the city. (The average pay for all New York City workers was $59,448.) The $3.15 billion earned by trade center employees was more than 1 percent of the entire payroll of the New York City metropolitan area. 

SOCIAL SECURITY -- The federal government is paying about $3 million a month in Social Security benefits to people affected by the attacks. Most of the payments go to the 2,375 surviving children and 853 surviving spouses of people killed in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Benefits are also being paid to 498 people disabled by the terrorist attacks and 81 of their dependent spouses or children. In addition to the monthly payments, the Social Security Administration made one-time payments to 1,800 members of victims' families.

REMAINS -- The work of identifying the dead continues. Last Sept. 11, the office of the chief medical examiner listed 2,801 people as missing and had identified the remains of 1,402 people. As of Sept. 5, 2003, it listed 2,792 missing and had identified remains of 1,521.

CLEANUP -- The New York City comptroller's office says that it cost $582 million to clean up ground zero.

THE BOOKS -- There was a hunger to understand what had happened and why, and publishers raced to fill the need.
According to the Bowker's Books In Print database, 760 books have been published about 9/11. (For each book title, Bowker's counts every form -- trade hardcover, mass-market paperback, large-type editions -- as a separate published book.) Of these books, 724 are still in print, Bowker's found, and 39 of the hardcovers made at least one best-seller list. And it isn't over: 40 more 9/11 books have been announced for publication in 2003 and 2004. 

UNDERGROUND -- Subways were stilled after the attack, and even when they ran again some riders stayed away for a time. According to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, in August 2001, people took subways 4.41 million times. In September 2001, there were just 4.12 million trips. By September 2002, the system were mostly back to normal and the riders had returned: 4.70 million subway rides. In June of this year, the most recent figure available, there were 4.58 million rides.

ON THE WATER -- With much of the region's mass transit system paralyzed immediately after the terrorist attack, New Yorkers rediscovered an old but reliable means of getting to and from Manhattan: ferryboat. Ridership on private and city-operated ferries doubled, from a pre-Sept. 11 weekday average of about 65,000 to more than 130,000 two months later, according to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, the Port Authority and the New York City Department of Transportation. Ferry regulators say ridership has remained at about that level and are likely to increase as more routes are added.

FIREFIGHTERS -- The total number of firefighters and officers in the New York City Fire Department on Sept. 10, 2001, was 11,327. A year ago, the count was 11,270. On Monday, it was 10,751.

POLICE -- According to the mayor's office, the Police Department head count at the end of July 2001 was 39,895. In the same period last year, it was 38,900. This July, it was 37,354.

F.B.I. -- The terrorist attacks had a profound impact on how the Federal Bureau of Investigation views its mission. Though staffing at the F.B.I.'s New York City office remained relatively stable at about 1,100 agents, the number of those agents assigned to antiterrorism cases has increased three-fold since Sept. 11, 2001. (The F.B.I. would not release the exact numbers because of security concerns.)

ANXIETIES -- Two years after the attack, New Yorkers are still walking on eggshells, according to a New York Times poll of 976 New York City residents, conducted Aug. 31 to Sept. 4. When respondents were asked whether they generally felt safe from terrorist attack, felt somewhat uneasy or felt in danger, 18 percent said they felt in danger and half said they felt uneasy. Only 29 percent said they felt safe. And 68 percent said they were very concerned about another terrorist attack in New York City.

FEDERAL AID -- Federal aid committed to New York for rebuilding efforts has dipped to $20.8 billion from $21.4 billion in the past year, and the amount that the city has actually received so far stands at only a fraction of the total: $5.6 billion.

CHARITY -- The passage of time slowed, but did not halt, the flow of contributions to charities created to help victims of the attacks. The Sept. 11 Fund has made $126 million in grants during the past year, compared to $336 million a year earlier. The New York Times Company Foundation's
9/11 Neediest Fund made $4 million in grants through August, compared with $58 million the previous year.

BLOOD -- In the weeks following the attacks, people raced to donate blood, though much of it was never used. The Red Cross collected 1.2 million units of blood nationwide between Sept. 11, 2001, and Oct. 30, 2001 -- far more than the current rate of about 380,000 units for a comparable time period.

VISITORS -- One million fewer tourists came to New York City in 2001 than in 2000 (35.2 million vs. 36.2 million, according to the city's tourism office, NYC & Company). Last year, things seemed to improve marginally; the preliminary figures showed 35.3 million visitors. And this year, an estimated 35.9 million tourists will walk the city's streets.
But many more of these tourists are from elsewhere in the United States, and American tourists don't stay as long or spend as much money. Foreign tourists were 18.8 percent of the total in 2000; they are estimated to be 15 percent of the total this year. 

BROADWAY -- Broadway still has not recovered from the shock. In 2001, before the attack, Broadway theaters were averaging a total audience of 231,484 a week, according to data provided by the League of American Theaters and Producers. But the week beginning Sept. 16, 2001, drew just 65,155 patrons to Broadway theaters. By the week of Oct. 21, 2001, attendance broke 200,000 again, at 218,266. For all 2002, the weekly average was 219,356. And in 2003, through Aug. 3, the average has been 213,201.

ST. PAUL'S -- Before the attack on the World Trade Center, the 237-year-old St. Paul's Chapel of Trinity Church, in the shadow of the twin towers, was not routinely open to the public. But after the disaster it served as a round-the-clock sanctuary for weary rescue workers, serving up to 2,000 meals a day. St. Paul's has since opened itself to visitors, who number about 12,000 a week and are curious to learn about the chapel's role in the disaster.

MOVING OUT -- The Census Bureau says that it is too soon to count how many people moved away from Lower Manhattan after the attack on the World Trade Center. The best it can offer are estimates for Manhattan, which lost some residents; the number dropped from 1.549 million in 2001 to 1.547 million in 2002. But the entire city's estimated population rose slightly in the same period, from 8.062 million in 2001 to 8.084 million in 2002.

RENTS -- Despite all that's happened (perhaps because of it), apartments downtown are in demand again. CitiHabitats calculated that before Sept. 11, 2001, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment below Chambers Street was $2,582. This dropped to $2,321 in October 2002. By July of this year, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment was back up to $2,460. (The July average for all Manhattan one-bedrooms was $2,195.)

OFFICE SPACE -- Commercial real estate is not doing as well. William C. Thompson Jr., New York City's comptroller, just reported that from the beginning of 2000 through the second quarter of 2003 there has been no significant construction of new office space in Lower Manhattan. And the vacancy rate has increased. In the second quarter of 2001, downtown Manhattan had a vacancy rate of 6.1 percent, slightly better than the Midtown rate at that time, 6.4 percent. In the second quarter of this year, downtown had a vacancy rate of 14.3 percent, compared to Midtown Manhattan's 11.9 percent.

STORES -- At the World Financial Center, a complex of offices, stores and restaurants west of ground zero, Brookfield Properties said, 45 retailers were in business before Sept. 11, 2001. Though the center suffered serious damage when the towers collapsed, at the end of last month , 34 retailers were in business.

RESTAURANTS -- In the 2001 edition of Zagat's New York City survey, 92 restaurants were listed in the financial district and TriBeCa. This dropped to 74 restaurants in the 2002 edition. In 2003, the number increased to 81 and the 2004 Zagat's, which will be published in mid-October, will list 82.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about statistics on New York since the attack on the World Trade Center gave incorrect figures supplied by Bowker's Books in Print about 9/11-related books. According to its database, 468 books, not 760, have been published about 9/11. Of those published, 458, not 724, are still in print. Forty-one of the hardcover books, not 39, made at least one best-seller list. And 15 more 9/11 books, not 40, have been announced for publication in 2003 and 2004.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
When it comes to books, Internet selling has not led to uniformly low prices.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness," published by HarperCollins. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
LIKE every author I know, I'm obsessed with the Amazon ranking of my new book. Several times a day, I check the number on the book's Amazon.com page to see how its sales compare with sales of every other book. Best-seller lists rank just the top 10 or 20 books. Amazon ranks more than two million -- every book it sells.
 Authors love the rankings at Amazon and its competitor, BarnesandNoble.com (also known as BN.com), because they give us real-time information on how well a book is selling. Aside from satisfying anxious curiosity, the rankings provide immediate feedback on the effect of reviews and media appearances. 
 But the rankings aren't just important to authors. With some clever tweaking, they let economists answer some basic questions about online competition.
"Does the Internet make things very competitive?" asks Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. "Or does the Internet make the sellers of things able to gather information and charge different prices" to different customers, depending on their willingness to pay?
To put it a different way, does every product become a commodity online, driving all prices down so far that they just cover costs? Or can online retailers find ways to make significant sustainable profits? In theory, things could go either way.
Testing the question empirically means doing more than checking the prices listed on Web sites. Just because an online retailer offers a product at a particular price doesn't mean anyone's buying. Researchers need to know how much is actually selling at those prices. And that information is hard to come by.
Enter the Amazon and BN.com ratings. By measuring sales for exactly the same goods at competing sites, the book rankings provide the missing information.
In an article in the June issue of Quantitative Marketing and Economics, Professor Goolsbee and Judith Chevalier, an economist at the Yale School of Management, figured out how to turn the book rankings into sales figures. They then recorded prices and sales for more than 18,000 titles at three points in 2001, when Amazon tested various pricing strategies and BN.com responded. With that information, they examine how price changes at one site affect sales by both that retailer and its competitor. (The paper can be downloaded from http://gsbadg.uchicago.edu/vitae.htm.)
Unfortunately for curious authors, the specific calculation used to translate rankings into sales is obsolete, because online book sales have grown substantially since 2001. All the economists can say is that sales approximately double every time the rank is cut in half.
"A book at rank 2,000 sells a bit less than half the books as a book at 1,000," Professor Goolsbee says.
That means it's relatively easy to climb the low ranks. A book selling two copies a day at the time of the study was ranked at 14,468. The economists bought six copies in a 10-minute period and drove the rank to 2,854.
It's much harder, however, for top-selling books to move up, since already-high sales must double for a book to go from No. 8 to No. 4, double again to go to No. 2, and double once again to reach the top slot.
Not surprisingly, the researchers found that higher prices mean fewer sales. But the effects are notably different at the two sites. Both sites lose customers when prices rise, but Barnes & Noble loses a lot more.
A 1 percent price increase at BN.com pushes sales down 4 percent, making price rises a bad idea. By contrast, the same increase at Amazon reduces sales by only 0.5 percent -- a net revenue gain.
That's not exactly what economists expected. "We economists decided in about 1998 that the whole world was wrong about the Internet, and the Internet is not about companies making money," Professor Chevalier says.
Instead, the Internet would unleash "incredibly vigorous competition to a point that the law of one price is going to hold," she said. "You're not going to see a penny of difference in prices across different sites because everybody can check."
The Internet has indeed spurred competition. But it hasn't led to uniformly low prices. In the book business, at least, Amazon has demonstrated that it's possible to build a large base of customers who won't bolt to the competition if you raise prices a little bit. (For the record, I own 100 shares of Amazon stock, which I purchased about two years ago and have no immediate plans to sell.)
Barnes & Noble, by contrast, caters to discount hunters with little loyalty to its particular service. (Customers at smaller sites are, if anything, even more price-sensitive.)
In fact, BN.com picks up just about all the customers Amazon loses when it raises prices. By contrast, Amazon gets only a small number of the customers BN.com loses. They either go to an even cheaper retailer or perhaps don't buy at all.
"Raising prices by 1 percent at BN.com reduces sales about 4 percent but increases sales at Amazon.com by only about 0.2 percent," the economists write. "Many of the lost customers from BN.com evidently do not just go buy the book from Amazon.com."
For traditional independent bookstores, this is all bad news. "It just looks like it's a very competitive retail business," Professor Goolsbee says, "and it doesn't bode that well for the bookstores," since most of them have a lot less pricing clout than Barnes & Noble.
"Except for Amazon, the online bookselling business is extremely competitive," he says. "If they mess up the pricing they're just going to die."

HEADLINE: Two Years Later, a Thousand Years Ago 

BYLINE:  By Robert Wright; Robert Wright, a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, is author of "The Moral Animal" and "Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny."

 BODY:
Among the ideas that seemed to collapse along with the twin towers two years ago was a view of globalization as a kind of manifest destiny. Unlike the 19th-century version of manifest destiny, this vision didn't involve expanding America's borders. Rather, America's values -- notably economic and political liberty -- would spread beyond those borders, covering the planet. And this time around America's mission didn't have the widely assumed blessing of God. But it had the next best thing: the force of history. Globalization was seen by some as a nearly inevitable climax of the human story -- destiny of a secular sort.
 In some versions of this scenario, like neoconservative ones, tough American guidance might be needed -- coercing China, say, toward democracy. In other versions, international economic competition would do the coercing. After all, microelectronics was making free markets a more essential ingredient in prosperity, and free markets work best with free minds. As some libertarians saw things, all you had to do was end trade barriers and then sit back and enjoy the show. 
 Some show. As commentators started noting around Sept. 12, 2001, the terrorists had turned the tools of globalization -- cellphones, e-mail, international banking -- against the system. What's more, their grievances had grown partly out of globalization, with its jarringly modern values. It started to seem as if globalization, far from being a benign culmination of history, had carried the seeds of its own destruction all along.
Two years later, that view is still defensible. Though the United States has been free from serious terrorism, anti-American terrorist networks are intact -- and the war in Iraq has given them both a new rallying cry and conveniently located targets. Further, Islamist terrorism is assuming more global form; one can imagine a chain of attacks setting off a worldwide economic tailspin. With biotechnology and nuclear materials emphatically not under control, out-and-out collapse in some future decade is possible.
Still, viewed against the backdrop of history, the case for a kind of manifest destiny is stronger than ever. In this version, America's mission is different from the ones libertarians and neoconservatives have in mind -- passive role model or aggressive evangelizer, respectively. It is in some ways a grander mission, carrying a deep and subtle moral challenge. Indeed, the challenge is so deep, and so natural an outgrowth of history, that the idea of destiny in some nonsecular sense isn't beyond the pale. In any event, Sept. 11, 2001, illustrates the challenge in painfully vivid form.
Globalization dates back to prehistory, when the technologically driven expansion of commerce began. Early advances in transportation -- roads, wheels, boats -- were used to do deals (when they weren't used to fight wars). So too with information technology. Writing seems to have evolved in Mesopotamia as a recorder of debts. Later, in the form of contracts, it would lubricate long-distance trade.
All this is grounded in human nature. People instinctively play nonzero-sum games -- games, like economic exchange, in which both players can win. And technological advance lets them play more complex games over longer distances. Hence globalization.
What makes globalization precarious is that nonzero-sum relationships typically have a downside: both players can lose as well as win. Their fortunes are correlated, their fates partly shared, for better or worse. As a web of commerce expands and thickens, this interdependence deepens. The ancient world saw prosperity spread but also saw vast downturns -- like collapse across the eastern Mediterranean around 1200 B.C.
One reason trouble can spread so broadly is that it often uses the economic system's conduits of transportation or communication. The collapse of 1200 B.C. seems to have been abetted by raiders who exploited shipping lanes. In the Middle Ages, the bubonic plague moved from city to city along avenues of commerce. Today a bioweapon could spread death globally the same way. And support for terrorism proliferates via the very satellites that convey stock prices, as appeals from Osama bin Laden, or images of civilian casualties in Iraq or Gaza, are beamed around the world.
One way to protect an expanding realm of interdependence is through expanded governance. The Roman Empire, in its heyday, kept vast trade routes secure. But governance needn't come in the form of a full-fledged state. In the late Middle Ages, merchants in German cities formed the Hanseatic League to repel pirates and brigands.
Today the globalization of commerce, and of threats to it, has created the rudiments of international governance, from the World Health Organization to arrangements for policing nuclear weapons. Global governance sounds radical, but it's just history marching on -- commerce making the world safe for itself.
In light of 9/11, there is room for improvement. For starters, we need more routine and forceful means of policing the world's nuclear materials and, more challenging still, its biotechnology infrastructure. This will involve rethinking national sovereignty -- for example, accepting visits from international inspectors in exchange for the reassuring knowledge that they visit other countries, too. But we have little choice. The aftermath of the Iraq war suggests that even a superpower can't afford to invade every country that may have illicit weapons.
History's expansion of commerce has entailed the growth not just of governance, but of morality. Doing business with people, even at a distance, usually involves acknowledging their humanity. This may not sound like a major moral breakthrough. But prehistoric life seems to have featured frequent hostility among groups, with violence justified by the moral devaluation, even dehumanization, of the victims. And recorded history is replete with such bigotry. The modern idea that people of all races and religions are morally equal is often taken for granted, but viewed against the human past, it is almost bizarre.
Can moral enlightenment really be rooted in crass self-interest as mediated by the nonzero-sum logic of expanding economic interdependence? Certainly that would explain why an ethos of ethnic and religious tolerance is most common in highly globalized nationslike the United States. And it would help explain why, in contrast, open hatred of Christians or Jews is found in some Muslim countries that aren't deeply, organically integrated into the global economy.
Some favor a different explanation, blaming belligerent passages in the Koran for radical Islam's intolerance. But during the Middle Ages, when Islamic civilization was at the forefront of globalization, and co-existence with Christians and Jews made economic sense, Islamic scholars devised the requisite doctrines of tolerance. Muslims can read Scripture selectively when conditions warrant, just as many cosmopolitan Christians and Jews are profitably unaware of the jihads advocated in Deuteronomy.
Globalization, then, might eventually dampen the appeal of radical Islam, especially if economic liberty indeed tends to bring political liberty. In a world of economically intertwined free-market democracies, not only will more Muslim elites rub elbows with non-Muslims in business class, but also more young Muslims will have nonlethal outlets for their energies, thanks to new avenues for political activism and economic ambition.
Sounds great -- and, in fact, it's a prospect that has been hopefully invoked by many, including some hawks in advocating war with Iraq. But before deciding how to get from here to there, we might ponder one of history's lessons: bursts of technological progress can bring great instability. A particularly unsettling parallel with the current moment lies in a previous revolution in information technology, the coming of the movable-type printing press to Europe in the 15th century.
When transmitting information gets cheaper, groups that lack power can gain it. Within weeks of Martin Luther's unveiling his 95 Theses in 1517, German printers in several cities took it upon themselves to sell copies. An amorphous and largely silent interest group -- people disenchanted with the Roman Catholic Church -- crystallized and found its voice. Protest was now feasible. (Hence the term Protestant.)
The ensuing erosion of central authority went beyond the church. The "wars of religion" that ravaged Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries were about politics, too, and by their end the Hapsburgs, not just the pope, had lost possessions. If Europe's powers had adjusted more gracefully to the decentralizing force of print, much bloodshed might have been averted.
Today, similarly, new information technologies allow previously amorphous or powerless groups to coalesce and orchestrate activities, from peaceful lobbying to terrorist slaughter. And the revolution is young. As the Internet goes broadband, Osama bin Laden's potent recruiting videos will get more accessible -- viewable on demand from more and more parts of the world. Other terrorist televangelists may spring up, too. As in the age of print, far-flung discontent will grow more powerful -- often through peaceful means, but sometimes not.
Paradoxically, the increasing volatility of intense discontent puts Americans in a more nonzero-sum relationship with the world's discontented peoples. If, for example, unhappy Muslims overseas grow more unhappy and resentful, that's good for Osama bin Laden and hence bad for America. If they grow more secure and satisfied, that's good for America. This is history's drift: technology correlating the fortunes of ever-more-distant people, enmeshing humanity in a web of shared fate.
The architects of America's national security policy at once grasp this crosscultural interdependence and don't. They see that prosperous and free Muslim nations are good for America. But they don't see that the very logic behind this goal counsels against pursuing it crudely, with primary reliance on force and intimidation. They don't appreciate how easily, amid modern technology, resentment and hatred metastasize. Witness their planning for postwar Iraq, with spectacular inattention to keeping Iraqis safe, content and well informed.
Nor do they seem aware, as they focus tightly on state sponsors of terrorism, that technology lets terrorists operate with less and less state support. Anarchic states -- like the ones that may now be emerging in Iraq and Afghanistan -- could soon be as big a problem as hostile states.
Grasping the new challenge of terrorism doesn't render the problem simple or undermine President Bush's entire terrorism strategy. Obviously, we can't grow so concerned with grassroots opinion that we give in to specific terrorist demands. And sometimes we may have to use force in ways that, in the short run, inflame anti-Americanism. And so on.
Still, only if we see the growing power of grassroots sentiment will we give due attention to the subject that hawks so disdain: "root causes." With hatred becoming Public Enemy No. 1, a successful war on terrorism demands an understanding of how so much of the world has come to dislike America. When people who are born with the same human nature as you and I grow up to commit suicide bombings -- or applaud them -- there must be a reason. And it's at least conceivable that their fanaticism is needlessly encouraged by American policy or rhetoric.
Putting yourself in the shoes of people who do things you find abhorrent may be the hardest moral exercise there is. But it would be easier to excuse Americans who refuse to try if they didn't spend so much time indicting Islamic radicals for the same refusal. Somebody has to go first, and if nobody does we're all in trouble.
Even if we dawdle, and make no progress on either the moral or governmental fronts -- fail to move toward a global norm of tolerance and toward sound global governance -- history will eventually concentrate our minds. A nuclear explosion, or epic bioterrorism, will lead even some hardened unilateralists to embrace arms control and other multilateral actions.
But it would be nice to avoid the million deaths. Besides, if we wait until an American city is erased, by then hatred of America will be broad and deep. One can imagine national and global policing regimes that could keep us fairly secure even then, but they would be severe, with expanded monitoring of everyday life and shrinking civil liberties.
In other words, the age-old tradeoff between security and liberty increasingly involves a third variable: antipathy. The less hatred there is in the world, the more security we can have without sacrificing personal freedom. Assuming we like our liberty, we have little choice but to take an earnest interest in the situation of distant and seemingly strange people, working to elevate their welfare, exploring their discontent as a step toward expanding their moral horizons -- and in the process expanding ours. Global governance without global moral progress could be very unpleasant.
As the world's most powerful nation, and one of the world's most ethnically and religiously diverse nations, America is a natural leader of this moral revolution. America is also well positioned to lead in shaping a judicious form of global governance.
This role wasn't inevitable. But for a few quirks of history, some other nation might be on top at this moment of challenge. What was more orless inevitable, in my view, is the challenge itself. All along, technological evolution has been moving our species toward this nonzero-sum moment, when our welfare is crucially correlated with the welfare of the other, and our freedom depends on the sympathetic comprehension of the other.
That history has driven us toward moral enlightenment -- and then left the final choice to us, with momentous stakes -- is scary but inspiring. Some, indeed, may see this as evidence of the higher purpose that was widely assumed back in the 19th century. But a religious motivation isn't necessary. Simple self-interest will do. That's the beauty of the thing.

HEADLINE: New Agency Proposed to Oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
The Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago.
 Under the plan, disclosed at a Congressional hearing today, a new agency would be created within the Treasury Department to assume supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored companies that are the two largest players in the mortgage lending industry. 
 The new agency would have the authority, which now rests with Congress, to set one of the two capital-reserve requirements for the companies. It would exercise authority over any new lines of business. And it would determine whether the two are adequately managing the risks of their ballooning portfolios. 
The plan is an acknowledgment by the administration that oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- which together have issued more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding debt -- is broken. A report by outside investigators in July concluded that Freddie Mac manipulated its accounting to mislead investors, and critics have said Fannie Mae does not adequately hedge against rising interest rates.
"There is a general recognition that the supervisory system for housing-related government-sponsored enterprises neither has the tools, nor the stature, to deal effectively with the current size, complexity and importance of these enterprises," Treasury Secretary John W. Snow told the House Financial Services Committee in an appearance with Housing Secretary Mel Martinez, who also backed the plan.
Mr. Snow said that Congress should eliminate the power of the president to appoint directors to the companies, a sign that the administration is less concerned about the perks of patronage than it is about the potential political problems associated with any new difficulties arising at the companies.
The administration's proposal, which was endorsed in large part today by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, would not repeal the significant government subsidies granted to the two companies. And it does not alter the implicit guarantee that Washington will bail the companies out if they run into financial difficulty; that perception enables them to issue debt at significantly lower rates than their competitors. Nor would it remove the companies' exemptions from taxes and antifraud provisions of federal securities laws.
The proposalis the opening act in one of the biggest and most significant lobbying battles of the Congressional session. 
After the hearing, Representative Michael G. Oxley, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, and Senator Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, announced their intention to draft legislation based on the administration's proposal. Industry executives said Congress could complete action on legislation before leaving for recess in the fall.
"The current regulator does not have the tools, or the mandate, to adequately regulate these enterprises," Mr. Oxley said at the hearing. "We have seen in recent months that mismanagement and questionable accounting practices went largely unnoticed by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight," the independent agency that now regulates the companies.
"These irregularities, which have been going on for several years, should have been detected earlier by the regulator," he added.
The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which is part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was created by Congress in 1992 after the bailout of the savings and loan industry and concerns about regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them as securities or hold them in their own portfolios. 
At the time, the companies and their allies beat back efforts for tougher oversight by the Treasury Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Reserve. Supporters of the companies said efforts to regulate the lenders tightly under those agencies might diminish their ability to finance loans for lower-income families. This year, however, the chances of passing legislation to tighten the oversight are better than in the past. 
Reflecting the changing political climate, both Fannie Mae and its leading rivals applauded the administration's package. The support from Fannie Mae came after a round of discussions between it and the administration and assurances from the Treasury that it would not seek to change the company's mission.
After those assurances, Franklin D. Raines, Fannie Mae's chief executive, endorsed the shift of regulatory oversight to the Treasury Department, as well as other elements of the plan.
"We welcome the administration's approach outlined today," Mr. Raines said. The company opposes some smaller elements of the package, like one that eliminates the authority of the president to appoint 5 of the company's 18 board members.
Company executives said that the company preferred having the president select some directors. The company is also likely to lobby against the efforts that give regulators too much authority to approve its products.
Freddie Mac, whose accounting is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a United States attorney in Virginia, issued a statement calling the administration plan a "responsible proposal."
The stocks of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae fell while the prices of their bonds generally rose. Shares of Freddie Mac fell $2.04, or 3.7 percent, to $53.40, while Fannie Mae was down $1.62, or 2.4 percent, to $66.74. The price of a Fannie Mae bond due in March 2013 rose to 97.337 from 96.525.Its yield fell to 4.726 percent from 4.835 percent on Tuesday.
Fannie Mae, which was previously known as the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie Mac, which was the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, have been criticized by rivals for exerting too much influence over their regulators.
"The regulator has not only been outmanned, it has been outlobbied," said Representative Richard H. Baker, the Louisiana Republican who has proposed legislation similar to the administration proposal and who leads a subcommittee that oversees the companies. "Being underfunded does not explain how a glowing report of Freddie's operations was released only hours before the managerial upheaval that followed. This is not world-class regulatory work."
Significant details must still be worked out before Congress can approve a bill. Among the groups denouncing the proposal today were the National Association of Home Builders and Congressional Democrats who fear that tighter regulation of the companies could sharply reduce their commitment to financing low-income and affordable housing. 
"These two entities -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- are not facing any kind of financial crisis," said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee. "The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing." 
Representative Melvin L. Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, agreed.
"I don't see much other than a shell game going on here, moving something from one agency to another and in the process weakening the bargaining power of poorer families and their ability to get affordable housing," Mr. Watt said.

HEADLINE: Poorer Nations Plead Farmers' Case at Trade Talks 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: CANCUN, Mexico, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
The world trade talks began here today with the developing nations mounting a quiet revolt in the name of their farmers.
 With China standing among them, a group of 21 countries demanded that their proposal to cut rich nations" farm subsidies be debated at the World Trade Organization talks this week and not be shunted aside through a parliamentary procedure. 
 Flexing their collective muscle in a setting normally dominated by the United States and Europe, the world's biggest subsidizers of farmers, the group said it would not be silenced.
"It is absolutely an imperative that this paper is taken as a basis for discussion," said Celso Amorim, the Brazilian minister of foreign affairs and a spokesman for the group. 
Those countries together represent a majority of the world's farmers, and a majority of the world's population. They pointed out that their quest for lower farm subsidies and tariffs had become the cause of the moment, much like debt relief was several years ago.
Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the W.T.O. and an economist from Thailand, said he was pleased that more than one agricultural proposal was on the table and that procedures would not get in the way of negotiations.
"This is very conducive for the development agenda," Mr. Panitchpakdi said.
As a reminder of the passions evoked by farming, a protest by about 7,000 Mexican farmers a few miles away turned violent when a few dozen people pushed down a chain-link barricade and began hitting police officers with sticks and pieces of concrete.
At least 10 protesters and a dozen police officers were injured in the clashes. One rice farmer, who wore a sign that read "The WTO kills farmers," stabbed himself in the chest and died at a local hospital.
According a glossy handout that he distributed at the march, Kyung-hae Lee, the farmer, was 56 and a former president of the Korean Advanced Farmers Federation. He said he had tried to organize opposition to economic forces he described as "waves that destroyed our lovely rural communities." But he said he had failed, "like many other farm leaders elsewhere."
Imports, he said, were cheaper than domestic goods and soon his income did not cover his costs. And farmers, he said, were forced to go work in urban slums.
"I am crying out the words to you that have boiled so long time inside my body," his note said.
Most protesters condemned the violence and abandoned the march.
Throughout the day, senior ministers held a "flurry" of private meetings with the bloc of developing nations, said a spokesman for Europe, seeking a compromise to move forward when serious negotiations begin Thursday.
Last month, the United States and Europe presented their own plan that became the foundation for the debate. But the proposal ignored many concerns of the developing world, so the group of developing nations pushed a counterproposal. It became so popular that the group expanded from 17 to 21 nations in days, with Egypt as the latest member.
Pascal Lamy, the top trade minister for Europe, said it would be an "error" to conclude that a new confrontation was developing between rich and poor nations.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said at the opening session that the United States was willing to cut farm subsidies if other countries also did. He also alluded to the growing wave of protectionist sentiment in the United States, especially as the American trade deficit continues to balloon, and said he hoped all delegates recognized the political realities. 
"We're all going to have to compromise," he said.
International institutions like the World Bank have provided the data to explain how the $300 billion that rich countries give farmers each year helps undermine millions of farmers in the developing world. 
"Just saying they won't back down and promising to stay united is unprecedented," said Ben Lilleston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, referring to the developing nations.
With agriculture the pivotal issue for this round of trade talks, the ministers from those countries in effect are warning the W.T.O. that they could block progress on new agreements if they are ignored.
Among the most influential of the 21 developing countries are Brazil, India, Thailand, Mexico, Argentina, the Philippines, Chile, Pakistan and South Africa. In the world of trade, most developing countries should have an advantage in agrculture, because their production, land and labor costs are low. But farming is now the most protected sector of the economies of the world's richest countries. In addition to farm subsidies, the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries maintain high agricultural tariffs that block imports and spend millions of dollars subsidizing their food exports. 
Many exports are sold below cost, undermining the ability of the world's poor farmers to sell their products at home or as exports. 
That struggle has drawn the attention of rock stars and advocacy groups. 
At a news conference held by the Group of 21 countries here, Jonathon Buckland, the guitar player with the rock group Coldplay, presented the trade ministers with a supersized version of the groups' CD called "Make Trade Fair."

HEADLINE: In Yonkers, Deputy Mayor Faces Former Schools Chief 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: YONKERS, N.Y., Sept. 10 

 BODY:
The messy fight over the Republican nomination for the mayoral race has turned out to be a relatively safe victory for Deputy Mayor Phil Amicone, and Joe L. Farmer, the former schools superintendent, has emerged as the Democratic nominee for the job.
 The contest is likely to have further twists and turns as Mr. Amicone seeks to replace his political mentor, Mayor John Spencer, who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election. 
 Mr. Amicone beat State Assemblyman Michael J. Spano by five percentage points in Tuesday's primary, and Mr. Farmer defeated Pauline M. Galvin, a lawyer and the city Democratic chairwoman, by a similar margin. 
Mr. Farmer hopes to become the first black mayor in the history of Yonkers, an achievement that would be a significant milestone for a city that was racked by racial strife for so long. Mr. Farmer, who spent three decades in the city schools as an administrator and worked for Mr. Spencer as a special assistant in charge of moderately priced housing, is popular with teachers and has a natural constituency in a whole generation of children he helped educate and their parents.
Mr. Amicone has also not seen the last of Mr. Spano, who is part of a powerful political family. He remains in the race on the Conservative and Independence Party lines. Mr. Spano, whose brother, Nicholas, is an influential state senator, could siphon support from Mr. Amicone in the general election, leaving open the possibility that Mr. Farmer would eke out a Democratic victory, no small feat in Yonkers, where Republicans have dominated City Hall for the past decade even though they are outnumbered by Democrats. (The Spanos are not related to Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, who is a Democrat.)
In a city where a wrenching history of racial segregation, municipal corruption, fiscal instability and failing schools is just beginning to recede, this year's mayoral race is bound to be a momentous one. With no incumbent in the running for either party's nomination, the primaries attracted seven candidates, and Tuesday's voting winnowed that field to three of the best-known politicians in the city. Despite the obvious advantage Mr. Amicone would seem to have with the backing of Mr. Spencer, who has been credited with bringing new life to the city, all three candidates view the race as wide open. 
"This is clearly a three-way race, and we are in it for the long haul," Mr. Spano said in an interview today. He said he had no plans to leave the race, even if that meant spoiling his party's chances of holding onto the mayor's office.
"I am going to be draining support from Mr. Amicone and Mr. Farmer," Mr. Spano said. "I represent an Assembly district that has a Democratic majority by enrollment, and I have been blessed by a lot of crossover support. I expect to keep the Republican base that I have because moderate Republicans are looking for a home. I am moderate on social issues, conservative on tax issues and tough on crime."
Mr. Farmer was a principal and later superintendent in Yonkers. His three-year tenure leading the city's schools was rocky, and he resigned last year after clashing with the Board of Education, mostly over who would control the school system. But he was popular with parents and teachers.
He then worked for Mayor Spencer as the administrator in charge of fostering more moderately priced housing. He was elected to a term as a city councilman in the early 1990's, during one of the most pivotal periods of Yonkers's bitter battle over racial segregation.
"I have been a problem-solver in this city for a long, long time," Mr. Farmer said in an interview. "I am a natural choice to solve the most difficult problem facing the city now, education and its fiscal instability."
Mr. Amicone, an engineer who had no political experience before becoming deputy mayor, said that the race would be a referendum on the way voters view the changes in the city over the last decade. He said he plans to continue on the course Mr. Spencer set, focusing on drawing jobs and economic development to Yonkers and improving schools. 
"I have no hidden agenda, no higher aspirations," Mr. Amicone said in an interview. "I just want to finish the job we started."

HEADLINE: TWO YEARS LATER: WORLD OPINION; 
Foreign Views Of U.S. Darken After Sept. 11

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN; Contributing to this report were James Brooke, Frank Bruni, Alan Cowell, Ian Fisher, Joseph Kahn, Clifford Krauss, Marc Lacey, Jane Perlez, Craig S. Smith and Michael Wines.

DATELINE: BERLIN, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
In the two years since Sept. 11, 2001, the view of the United States as a victim of terrorism that deserved the world's sympathy and support has given way to a widespread vision of America as an imperial power that has defied world opinion through unjustified and unilateral use of military force.
 "A lot of people had sympathy for Americans around the time of 9/11, but that's changed," said Cathy Hearn, 31, a flight attendant from South Africa, expressing a view commonly heard in many countries. "They act like the big guy riding roughshod over everyone else." 
 In interviews by Times correspondents from Africa to Europe to Southeast Asia, one point emerged clearly: The war in Iraq has had a major impact on public opinion, which has moved generally from post-9/11 sympathy to post-Iraq antipathy, or at least to disappointment over what is seen as the sole superpower's inclination to act pre-emptively, without either persuasive reasons or United Nations approval.
To some degree, the resentment is centered on the person of President Bush, who is seen by many of those interviewed, at best, as an ineffective spokesman for American interests and, at worst, as a gunslinging cowboy knocking over international treaties and bent on controlling the world's oil, if not the entire world. 
Foreign policy experts point to slowly developing fissures, born at the end of the cold war, that exploded into view in the debate leading up to the Iraq war. "I think the turnaround was last summer, when American policy moved ever more decisively toward war against Iraq," said Josef Joffe, co-editor of the German weekly Die Zeit. "That's what triggered the counteralliance of France and Germany and the enormous wave of hatred against the United States."
The subject of America in the world is of course complicated, and the nation's battered international image could improve quickly in response to events. The Bush administration's recent turn to the United Nations for help in postwar Iraq may represent such an event. 
Even at this low point, millions of people still see the United States as a beacon and support its policies, including the war in Iraq, and would, given the chance, be happy to become Americans themselves. 
Some regions, especially Europe, are split in their view of America's role: The governments and, to a lesser extent, the public in former Soviet-bloc countries are much more favorably disposed to American power than the governments and the public in Western Europe, notably France and Germany.
In Japan, a strong American ally that feels insecure in the face of a hostile, nuclear-armed North Korea, there may be doubts about the wisdom of the American war on Iraq. But there seem to be far fewer doubts about the importance of American power generally to global stability.
In China, while many ordinary people express doubts about the war in Iraq, anti-American feeling has diminished since Sept. 11, 2001, and there seems to be greater understanding and less instinctive criticism of the United States by government officials and intellectuals. The Chinese leadership has largely embraced America's "war on terror."
Still, a widespread and fashionable view is that the United States is a classically imperialist power bent on controlling global oil supplies and on military domination.
That mood has been expressed in different ways by different people, from the hockey fans in Montreal who boo the American national anthem to the high school students in Switzerland who do not want to go to the United States as exchange students because America is not "in." Even among young people, it is not difficult to hear strong denunciations of American policy and sharp questioning of American motives.
"America has taken power over the world," said Dmitri Ostalsky, 25, a literary crtic and writer in Moscow. "It's a wonderful country, but it seized power. It's ruling the world. America's attempts to rebuild all the world in the image of liberalism and capitalism are fraught with the same dangers as the Nazis taking over the world."
A Frenchman, Jean-Charles Pogram, 45, a computer technician, said: "Everyone agrees on the principles of democracy and freedom, but the problem is that we don't agree with the means to achieve those ends. The United States can't see beyond the axiom that force can solve everything, but Europe, because of two world wars, knows the price of blood." 
Lydia Adhiamba, a 20-year-old student at the Institute of Advanced Technology in Nairobi, Kenya, said the United States "wants to rule the whole world, and that's why there's so much animosity to the U.S."
The major English language daily newspaper in Indonesia, The Jakarta Post, recently ran a prominent article titled, "Why moderate Muslims are annoyed with America," by Sayidiman Suryohadiprojo, a prominent figure during the Suharto years.
"If America wants to become a hegemonic power, it is rather difficult for other nations to prevent that," he wrote. "However, if America wants to be a hegemonic power that has the respect and trust of other nations, it must be a benign one, and not one that causes a reaction of hate or fear among other nations."

Bush as Salesman
Crucial to global opinion has been the failure of the Bush administration to persuade large segments of the public of its justification for going to war in Iraq.
In striking contrast to opinion in the United States, where polls show a majority believe there was a connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda terrorists, the rest of the world remains skeptical. 
That explains the enormous difference in international opinion toward American military action in Afghanistan in the months after Sept. 11, which seemed to have tacit approval as legitimate self-defense, and toward American military action in Iraq, which is seen as the arbitrary act of an overbearing power.
Perhaps the strongest effect on public opinion has been in Arab and Muslim countries. Even in relatively moderate Muslim countries like Indonesia and Turkey, or countries with large Muslim populations, like Nigeria, both polls and interviews show sharp drops in approval of the United States.
In unabashedly pro-American countries like Poland, perhaps the staunchest American ally on Iraq after Britain, polls show 60 percent of the people oppose the government's decision to send 2,500 troops to Iraq.
For many people, the issue is not so much the United States as it is the Bush administration, and what is seen as its arrogance. In this view, a different set of policies and a different set of public statements from Washington could have resulted in a different set of attitudes.
"The point I would make is that with the best will in the world, President Bush is a very poor salesman for the United States, and I say that as someone who has no animus against him or the United States," said Philip Gawaith, a financial communications consultant in London. "Whether it's Al Qaeda or Afghanistan, people have just felt that he's a silly man, and therefore they are not obliged to think any harder about his position."

Trying to Define 'Threat'
But while the public statements of the Bush administration have not played well in much of the world, many analysts see deeper causes for the rift that has opened. In their view, the Iraq war has not so much caused a new divergence as it has highlighted and widened one that existed since the end of the cold war. Put bluntly, Europe needs America less now that it feels less threatened.
Indeed, while the United States probably feels more threatened now than in 1989, when the cold war ended, Europe is broadly unconvinced of any imminent threat.
"There were deep structural forces before 9/11 that were pushing us apart," said John J. Mearsheimer, professor of political science at the University of Chicago and the author of "The Tragedy of Great Power Politics." "In the absence of the Soviet threat or of an equivalent threat, there was no way that ties between us and Europe wouldn't be loosened.
"So, when the Bush Administration came to power, the question was whether it would make things better or worse, and I'd argue that it made them worse."
"In the cold war you could argue that American unilateralism had no cost," Professor Mearsheimer continued. "But as we're finding out with regard to Iraq, Iran and North Korea, we need the Europeans and we need institutions like the U.N. The fact is that the United States can't run the world by itself, and the problem is, we've done a lot of damage in our relations with allies, and people are not terribly enthusiastic about helping us now."
Recent findings of international surveys illustrate those divergences. 
A poll of 8,000 people in Europe and the United States conducted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States and Compagnia di Sao Paolo of Italy found Americans and Europeans agreeing on the nature of global threats but disagreeing sharply on how they should be dealt with.
Most striking was a difference over the use of military force, with 84 percent of Americans but only 48 percent of Europeans supporting force as a means of imposing international justice.
In Europe overall, the proportion of people who want the United States to maintain a strong global presence fell 19 points since a similar poll last year, from 64 percent to 45 percent, while 50 percent of respondents in Germany, France and Italy express opposition to American leadership.
Many of the difficulties predated Sept. 11, of course. Eberhard Sandschneider, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations, listed some in a recent paper: "Economic disputes relating to steel and farm subsidies; limits on legal cooperation because of the death penalty in the United States; repeated charges of U.S. 'unilateralism' over actions in Afghanistan; and the U.S. decisions on the ABM Treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court and the Biological Weapons Protocol."
"One could conclude that there is today a serious question as to whether Europe and the United States are parting ways," Mr. Sandschneider writes.
From this point of view, as he and others have said, the divergence will not be a temporary phenomenon but permanent.
A recent survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project showed a growth of anti-American sentiment in many non-European parts of the world. It found, for example, that only 15 percent of Indonesians have a favorable impression of the United States, down from 61 percent a year ago.
Indonesia may be especially troubling to American policy makers, who have hoped that, as a country with an easy-going attitude toward religion, it would emerge as a kind of pro-American Islamic model.
But since Sept. 11, a virulent group of extremists known as Jemaah Islamiyah has gained strength, attacking in Bali and Jakarta and making the country so insecure that President Bush may skip it during an Asian trip planned for next month.
One well-known mainstream Indonesian Muslim leader, Din Syamsuddin, an American-educated vice president of a Islamic organization that claims 30 million members, calls the United States the "king of the terrorists" and refers to President Bush as a "drunken horse."
This turn for the worse has occurred despite a $10 million program by the State Department in which speakers and short films showing Muslim life in the United States were sent last fall to Muslim countries, including Indonesia.

A Residue of Good Will
Still, broad sympathy for the United States exists in many areas. Students from around the world clamor to be educated in America. The United States as a land of opportunity remains magnetic.
Some analysts point out that the German Marshall Fund study actually showed a great deal of common ground across the Atlantic.
"Americans and Europeans still basically like each other, although such warmth has slipped in the wake of the Iraq war," Ronald Asmus, Philip P. Everts and Pierangelo Isernia, analysts from the United States, the Netherlands and Italy, respectively, wrote in an article explaining the findings. "Americans and Europeans do not live on different planets when it comes to viewing the threats around them."
But there is little doubt that the planets have moved apart. Gone are the days, two years ago, when 200,000 Germans marched in Berlin to show solidarity with their American allies, or when Le Monde, the most prestigious French newspaper, could publish a large headline, "We Are All Americans."
More recently, Jean Daniel, the editor of the weekly Nouvel Observateur, published an editorial entitled, "We Are Not All Americans."
For governments in Eastern Europe, Sept. 11 has forced a kind of test of loyalties. Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Poland have felt themselves caught between the United States and the European Union, which they will soon be joining.
Here, too, the war in Iraq seems to have been the defining event, the division of Europe into "new" and "old" halves, defined by their willingness to support the American-led war.
Most Eastern European countries side with the European Union majority on such questions as the International Criminal Court, which is opposed by the Bush administration, while helping in various ways with the Iraq war. Poland and Romania have sent troops and Hungary has permitted training of Iraqis at a military base there.
But even if the overall mood in the former Soviet Bloc remains largely pro-American, recent polls have shown some slippage in feelings of admiration. 
"We would love to see America as a self-limiting superpower," said Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a former Polish defense minister.
Perhaps the administration's decision to turn to the United Nations to seek a mandate for an international force in Iraq reflects a new readiness to exercise such restraint. The administration appears to have learned that using its power in isolation can get very expensive very quickly.
But the road to recovering global support is likely to be a long one for a country whose very power -- political, economic, cultural, military -- makes it a natural target of criticism and envy.
Even in Japan, where support for America remains strong, the view of the United States as a bully has entered the popular culture. A recent cartoon showed a character looking like President Bush in a Stars and Stripes vest pushing Japanese fishermen away from a favorite spot, saying, "I can fish better."

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld Says More G.I.'s Would Not Help U.S. in Iraq 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that increasing the number of American forces in Iraq would put them at greater risk, hurt reconstruction efforts and sidetrack the goal of having Iraqis take greater responsibility for their own security.
 "Rather than flooding the zone with more Americans, which means you have to have more force protection, more support, it is, we believe, vastly better to continue to invest in encouraging the Iraqis to provide the kinds of increases and ramping up of their own security capabilities," Mr. Rumsfeld said in a speech at the National Press Club here. 
 With American soldiers still facing an average of 15 attacks a day in Iraq, Mr. Rumsfeld has said his top priority is to speed up the recruitment, training and deployment of a new Iraqi army and security services. That, he says, would ease the burden on United States troops and put more of an Iraqi face on the American-dominated occupation. 
But Mr. Rumsfeld's comments today injected a new sense of urgency into this mission and made it more apparent that the Pentagon's goal is to replace the 129,000 American troops and 22,000 international forces on a one-to-one basis with Iraqis once they are trained.
Mr. Rumsfeld said the main benefit of another United Nations resolution was more to provide political cover to reluctant allies so they could help pay for reconstruction costs rather than to attract more foreign peacekeepers. President Bush's $87 billion request to Congress for postwar needs includes $20 billion for reconstruction costs in Iraq over the next year.
"The expectation is that you would not get a large additional number of forces as a result of an additional U.N. resolution," Mr. Rumsfeld said in response to a question after his speech. "A new resolution would, however, provide some countries with a feeling that it was more of an international activity that they were engaged in, which would be a good thing, and it also would ease the process for some people to give additional money."
American commanders, however, have said it is crucial to have a third foreign-led division of 10,000 to 15,000 peacekeepers in place in Iraq by next year to avoid further straining the Army there or forcing the Pentagon to send marines, who are not normally assigned to peacekeeping tasks, to perform the mission.
After his speech Mr. Rumsfeld joined other senior civilian and military officials who went to Capitol Hill late today to push for Congressional approval of the administration's request for emergency funds for Iraq, Afghanistan and the broader campaign against terrorism.
In a pair of back-to-back classified sessions, members of the House and Senate were briefed by Mr. Rumsfeld; Secretary of State Colin L. Powell; Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Dov S. Zakheim, the Pentagon comptroller.
One senior Democratic official said Mr. Powell warned lawmakers not to expect large financial contributions or additional troops from allies, saying they were suffering from "donor fatigue." On Tuesday, Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, said allies had so far pledged only $2 billion. 
After the first meeting, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, and other Republicans predicted that the administration's proposals would be approved.
"The amount of money is horrendous, but what do you do?" said Senator George Allen, a Virginia Republican. "You have to persevere."
In his speech and remarks afterward, Mr. Rumsfeld repeatedly said Iraqis bore responsibility to take over the political, economic and security levers of power as soon as possible.
"I don't believe it's our job to reconstruct the country," said Mr. Rumsfeld, apparently not taking into account the $13 billion in Mr. Bush's budget request to help restore Iraq's electricity and running water. "The Iraqi people will have to reconstruct that country over a period of time."
He observed that Iraq could not rely on its oil revenues alone to rebuild its decrepit infrastructure but must plan to develop industries like tourism that would benefit from national and historic treasures like the ruins of the ancient city of Babylon.
"Tourism is going to be something important in that country as soon as the security situation is resolved, and I think that will be resolved as the Iraqis take over more and more responsibility for their own government," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "In the last analysis, they have to create an environment that's hospitable to investment and to enterprise."
Mr. Rumsfeld said he could not predict how long American troops would stay in Iraq or how much it would ultimately cost, but he described the sequence for an eventual withdrawal.
"It is to see that we work with the Iraqis to pass off to them political responsibility for their country -- they already have a cabinet; they already have a Governing Council; they already have city councils all across that country; they're working on a constitutional process -- and see that they assume more and more of that responsibility as fast as they're capable of doing it," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "That's our goal. And the same thing's true with respect to security. That's our exit strategy."
In his speech, which was briefly interrupted by two hecklers protesting the Iraq war, Mr. Rumsfeld focused on the accomplishments in Iraq and played down any lapses in prewar planning or intelligence.
When asked, for instance, why American intelligence analysts did not anticipate the state of neglect gripping Iraq's electrical network, oil pipelines and water system, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "Resources are finite, and they were worrying about more important things."
Instead, Mr. Rumsfeld returned to the theme of Iraqis taking over more security roles, including a new army, a civil defense corps, the police force and the border patrol.
"Our goal is not to create a dependency in Iraq," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "To the extent you are too heavy a footprint, you don't help them, you hurt them because foreign forces in a country are an anomaly. They're not natural. They're unnatural. And to the extent they're there, people tend to rely on them."
Mr. Rumsfeld was reinforcing a view voiced by General Myers at a Senate hearing on Tuesday. "We could put every sailor, soldier, airman, marine and Coast Guardsman we have in Iraq and it would not make this problem better," General Myers said. "The more Americans in Iraq, the less Iraqis might feel prompted to come forward and furnish us that intelligence, which is what we need so badly to deal with this threat."

HEADLINE: Air Travelers Adjust To a Vigilant Process 

 BODY:
Airports, where the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were launched, are where most Americans have seen security changes up close. 
 Some of those changes are big and obvious: the 49,600 federal security agents in crisp white shirts, the mammoth bag-screening machines, the hundreds of pilots carrying guns. 
 Others are smaller and less obvious. Travelers have bought post-9/11 shoes (slip-ons, no metal), bags (bigger, more compartments), even bras (no underwire) to smooth the ride through security. PAGE A19

CALCULATING THE TOLL -- A statistical snapshot of New York City two years after the attacks shows that economically, the city continues to suffer reverberations. But there are signs of hope: unemployment is beginning to drop, subway ridership is up, and apartments are once again hard to find near ground zero. PAGE A21

HEADLINE: Limpopo National Park Journal; 
Refuge for the Wild, With No Land Mines, Please

BYLINE:  By SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: LIMPOPO NATIONAL PARK, Mozambique, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
Wildlife specialists released seven elephants into this new game sanctuary the other day, and Santos Ngoverne, dressed in a blue plaid shirt and battered sandals, was on hand to watch. 
 "I've never seen an elephant," said Mr. Ngoverne, a 26-year-old primary school teacher, who traveled 12 miles from his rural village to see them lumber off into the bush. 
 A glimpse of wildlife, however, was not all that interested Mr. Ngoverne about the sanctuary. "I would be very happy to see tourists," he said. "It means development." 
Attracting tourists is precisely the goal of planners who built the 135-square-mile enclave in southwestern Mozambique. Eventually, the planners hope, the Mozambique sanctuary will be incorporated inside the world's largest wildlife park -- the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, linking this new park in Mozambique with Zimbabwe's scenic Gonarezhou National Park and South Africa's century-old Kruger National Park.
The plan is part of South Africa's efforts to become a unifying force in a region where, in the era of apartheid, it was often viewed as a destabilizing factor. But it also shows how political strife in southern Africa continues to hold back even a kind of development that has virtually no critics. The concept for the international park took hold after Mozambique ended 27 years of war in 1992, and South Africa held its first elections open to all races in 1994. 
But now Zimbabwe is embroiled in a political crisis, and few foreign donors are willing to help it create the 24-mile-long corridor that it needs to connect its park to South Africa's.
Zimbabwe first needs to rid the area of mines planted during the country's war for independence in the 1970's. "That is all at a standstill now," said Willem van Riet, chief executive officer of the Peace Parks Foundation, a nonprofit group that is lobbying to create 22 cross-border parks in southern Africa. 
Officially proclaimed last December, and financed with a total of $42 million from Germany, South Africa, the United States and the World Bank, the park is expected to cover 13,500 square miles.
The union of two Kalahari Desert parks in South Africa and Botswana gives an indication of the potential, park planners say. An average of 60 percent more tourists a year flocked to Botswana's camping grounds after its park was linked to South Africa's to form the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in 2000. "You can't find a single space now on the Botswana side," said Mr. van Riet.
However, wildlife experts say the bigger Limpopo preserve will do nothing to ease a population explosion that threatens to turn South Africa's Kruger National Park into an elephant preserve instead of a tribute to biodiversity. Park officials say the 7,700-square-mile Kruger reserve, which should ideally harbor about 7,500 elephants, is now home to nearly 12,000. 
Since pressure from animal rights groups led South Africa to impose a moratorium on shooting elephants to cull the population in 1995, Kruger's elephants have multiplied at a rate of 7 to 10 percent a year. The park is strewn with uprooted and trampled trees, including the exotic baobab tree, which is the only home for certain species of birds and bats. 
Mr. van Riet said that when Kruger's elephants discovered they could wander over to Mozambique or Zimbabwe, some would disperse. Other wildlife experts reject that. 
"Elephants have home ranges and they stick to their home ranges," said Danie Pienaar, Kruger's head of scientific services. "They will never know that the fence is down over here in Mozambique." 
The first group of 25 elephants transported from Kruger to Mozambique in 2001 simply crossed rivers to get around the eight-foot-high, 80-mile-long chain-link fence on Kruger's border to return home. 
Since then, all the animals that South Africa has delivered to its neighbor -- about 3,000 impalas, giraffes, wildebeest, waterbuck and other species -- have been confined behind an electrified fence inside the sanctuary. 
They will be kept there until park officials decide what to do with 26,000 people living in the 3,860 square miles designated as Mozambique's part of the park. Jorge Ferrao, international coordinator for the project, said three-fourths of the Mozambicans, mostly corn farmers, would be able to stay in the park and would probably benefit from it.
But the other 6,000 who live in what will be the center of the preserve will either have to move out or be fenced in for their protection, he said. 
South Africa's efforts to help Mozambique restock its wildlife and offering a connection to Kruger, which last year drew more than a million tourists, reflect the improvement in relations between the countries since the end of apartheid. 
But the war in Mozambique decimated its wild animals: those not killed by poachers were eaten for food. The animals donated by South Africa over the past three years are the first significant wildlife in Mozambique since the war. 
At least some of the animals are adjusting to the new surroundings. In the past year, said Mr. Pienaar, Kruger's science expert, elephants that were moved into the Mozambique sanctuary delivered three calves.

HEADLINE: Digital Dealmakers Meet in the Middle 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
PICTURE two people haggling over a debt -- say, $1,000 -- that is due in a month. The lender wants the money, but the debtor wants to cut a deal.
 "I'll get you the money in two weeks," the debtor says, "but only if I can pay $800." 
 The lender doesn't give in so easily. "Pay me now," he counters, "and I want $950." On it goes until an agreement is reached or both sides give up. 
 The two sides could be facing off at an office conference table or in a movie about small-time criminals. But in fact just such a scenario plays out regularly online, in the form of negotiations over claims between doctors and insurers, who have enlisted computers to represent them. 
 Software developed by a company called SplitTheDifference makes proposals on behalf of insurers, relying on algorithms to gauge what discount a doctor might accept in exchange for a faster payment.
 The software, which has been used in 20,000 negotiations over the past 18 months, is just one of the ways in which computers are playing a larger role in a growing variety of everyday transactions. The innovations are rooted in advances in mathematics that enable computers to mimic human behavior and in some cases replace them altogether. 
 Most uses of automated negotiations have so far been simple: settling insurance claims, selling excess telecommunications capacity and so on. But the scope for such negotiations is vast. Negotiation software may one day be used to help settle credit card bills, car loans and other financial exchanges, for example. 
 The electronics company Fujitsu is in the early stages of commercializing software that could enable consumers to negotiate deals for air travel, cellphone service or other products.
 Human beings, of course, continue to set the parameters. But computers, which have the capacity to consider millions of offers and counteroffers in seconds, hold out the possibility of crossing the subtlety of the human intellect with the raw power of the processor.
 "The big difference between humans and machines is that humans are really smart but slow, while machines are stupid but fast," said Steve White, a senior manager in the I.B.M. autonomic computing group. "Machines don't make mistakes, either."
 There is an emotional component to negotiation that goes beyond numbers, and computers cannot fully account for it. "What happens in negotiations is, both sides have their own interests so we never both get what we want," Mr. White said. "So what we are concentrating on is getting computers to talk to each other."
 Software advances have extended the automated negotiators' potential scope. Instead of considering price alone, computers can weigh the relative merits of variables including quantity, delivery time and technical specifications. Computers have moved beyond merely matching bids with offers or arbitrating between adversaries; they now can incorporate into the negotiations factors that people may not have considered.
 The trick to making automated negotiation software work is finding a niche where the humans involved will not feel either that the computer is fleecing them or giving too much away to the other side. To be effective, the software must give both sides some control over the process. 
 In practice, that has meant finding industries or business practices that are already digitized and have a high volume of data traffic, like financial markets and telecommunications providers. But while I.B.M. and other developers have had some success creating negotiation software for such areas, most companies are still a long way from being ready for digital dealing because the bulk of their data is on paper or in human memory, not on hard disks. Aside from the money and time needed to digitize such information, managers tend to be wary about ceding job functions or decision-making authority to a machine, a hurdle that must be overcome before negotiation software can achieve broader acceptance.
 "There was a huge amount of belief in automated negotiations, but it has turned into a long slog," said Robert E. Hall, a professor of economics at Stanford University and the author of "Digital Dealing: How E-Markets Are Transforming the Economy" (Norton, 2002). "We're still living in a fax world." 
 That said, companies are having some success selling the software, particularly to manufacturers. Ariba, a software company that is a leader in the field, has created a negotiating tool that gathers information about a company's inventory, production schedules and prices, among other things, and uses the information to field inquiries from potential buyers of its products. Bidders who use the software can specify their tolerance for such variables as return rates, reliability and other factors, which are assigned numerical rankings. By blending quantitative and qualitative information, the software enables users to determine the total cost of a purchase before negotiations begin.
 "Defining the parameters of the negotiations are as important as the negotiations," said Steve Markle, a product manager for Ariba's Spend Management Solution group.
 But to use such a full-service approach, companies must purchase an array of software that may exceed their needs if they are seeking only to automate one or two functions rather than an entire supply chain. 
 SplitTheDifference, focusing more narrowly, found an opportunity to help insurers and doctors haggle over payments that are too small to be handled economically by conventional methods. Ordinarily, insurance companies have 45 days after processing a claim to send the payment to the doctor. The doctors want to get the money sooner, while insurers have an incentive to pay out less money.
 SplitTheDifference's software adjusts itself as the negotiations proceed. The company has found that most doctors reject the first offer and come back with a counteroffer. The software then formulates a new offer that takes into account shifts in the doctor's position reflected by the counteroffer. The process continues until a deal is sealed or the doctor has rejected three proposals, in which case the insurer pays the full claim under the original time frame. The average negotiated settlement reached using the software has been $2,000, and the settlements saved the insurers an average of $400, or 20 percent. SplitTheDifference gets 20 percent of any money the insurer saves as a result of the negotiations.
 Roy Ophir, the company's president, said that insurers and doctors have agreed to automate their negotiations because it is cheaper than the existing arrangement, in whichoutside negotiators working for insurance companies employ telephone operators to call doctors, who are often too busy to talk. Because the fees earned by the outside negotiators are related to the ultimate payments, most of the negotiation companies focus only on claims for substantially more than $2,000.
 The software can be used effectively only if the doctors see an advantage in cooperating. "Financial instruments like insurance payments are where the value proposition is high enough to make negotiation software worthwhile," Mr. Ophir said. "The key is that both sides have to agree."
 Other behavioral patterns have emerged from SplitTheDifference's business. Just 2 percent of the insurers' offers are accepted immediately because doctors routinely think they can get a better result without giving anything away in return. Three-quarters of the negotiations, however, end after the second offer, suggesting that most doctors would rather reach an agreement quickly than haggle endlessly.
 The doctors' behavior does expose a fundamental weakness in the concept underlying algorithm-based negotiation software. Most negotiators have little incentive to divulge initially the outcome they are willing to accept. Participants regularly plead poverty or inflate the value of their goods to get what they want. Such strategic posturing makes it impossible for a computer to determine an "ideal" price and at times can scuttle the negotiations altogether.
 "The right solution depends on the right information, but it's mathematically impossible to come up with an equation to make me truthfully disclose my incentives," said Peter Cramton, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who teaches game theory. "Life would be pretty simple and maybe boring if we just ran into each other and exchanged information honestly. But life is not that simple."
 Dave Marvit and a team of researchers at Fujitsu Laboratories of America, however, have not let that stand in their way. His team, called Project A within Fujitsu, has worked for two years on a software program that can run through millions of potential scenarios in seconds. Unlike "matching" software, which aims to bring together parties with similar preferences, Fujitsu's program tries to narrow differences between groups that initially disagree.
 "We can run millions of prices and have 1,000 or more negotiations that ask how about this, how about that," said Mr. Marvit, whose background is in neuroscience. "Humans look for all these clues to psych out our opponents. Now, you can figure that out by making enough offers back and forth."
 As it moves to make the software commercially available, Fujitsu is hoping it will appeal to companies that swap foodstuffs, computer chips and other commodities. But it could in theory be used to negotiate to get a better rate on a hotel room or cheaper cellphone service as well. In a hypothetical example offered by Mr. Marvit, a traveler might bargain with an airline, offering a mixture of money, frequent-flier mileage and flexibility over route and destinations in exchange for a lower fare on the ticket and other benefits.
 In such a case, the traveler would presumably negotiate with the computer by entering preferences in an online form. The would-be traveler could choose to use software to negotiate on his behalf as well, raising the possibility of a computer-to-computer confrontation. The theory suggests that a stalemate is unlikely even in a computer face-off, however, because the automated negotiators' power to search for potential solutions is so much greater than humans'. 
 The Fujitsu software is relatively simple to use. Negotiators select preferences for categories like quantity, delivery time, shipping and handling costs, unit prices and reliability. Buyers can specify one priority, like the lowest price, or they can negotiate over several terms at once. They might continue asking for 1 percent discounts and tell the computer to stop when the price stops falling.
 Although the software may run thousands of iterations during a negotiation, the last round does not always yield the best price. In fact, in tests of the software, the optimum outcome is often found about halfway through the process. During the remaining repetitions, the price changed little but both sides gave ground on nonprice considerations like earlier or later delivery dates.
 The writing of the program, which Mr. Marvit compares to a computerized chess game, got tricky when colleagues from Japan joined in. Because practices vary by country, there were time-consuming debates about the most effective ways to run a business. As a result, it became clear that negotiating software must be capable of accounting for differences between, say, one business culture's tendency to tolerate defects if the price is right and another's assumption that prompt delivery is a given.
 Despite those differences, Mr. Marvit predicts that the relative ease and low cost of running the software will prompt more participants to trade online. In seconds, they will be able to calculate the cost of choosing blue over red or any number of other variables. Potential business partners could even haggle with each other to decide whether they want to cooperate. This could relieve anxiety that one side was bound to get cheated.
 "Good negotiators know you can do better if you add more business terms to the discussions," Mr. Marvit said. "Not just price, but time and others. The computers can handle more parameters so more value can be squeezed out of the transaction. It's the opposite of a zero-sum game."

HEADLINE: Costs Mount for Yale and Union as Strike Drags On 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
With the strike at Yale University entering its third week and no end in sight, the showdown is starting to exact sizable costs on both the university and the unionized workers.
 Indeed, if the strike drags on much longer, some labor experts say, whatever the ultimate settlement includes will not compensate either side for the losses suffered during the walkout. 
 For Yale officials, the strike has been a public relations quagmire and has set back the university's efforts to repair its history of lamentable town-gown relations. For the 2,000 striking clerical, dining hall and maintenance workers, the walkout has meant two weeks of missed paychecks, fears of many more such weeks and worries about not being able to pay rent and utility bills. 
A third group is also being hurt by the strike -- Yale's students -- even though they are supposedly mere bystanders. Many students complain that the atmosphere on campus has turned bitter, that most dining halls are closed and that they sometimes find it hard to concentrate in class when union bullhorns are bellowing outside.
"The strike is disruptive to the atmosphere here, and it's causing a pretty big rift on campus," said Taylor Chapman, an English major from Houston.
As often happens during strikes, each side is warning the other that to prevent even steeper costs, it would be wise to settle soon by making major concessions. 
Union officials and their community allies warn that every additional day the strike lasts will further undermine an earnest decade-long effort by Yale's president, Richard C. Levin, to mend relations with working-class New Haven. These officials note that several large demonstrations have attacked Yale and that local clergy members and politicians have criticized Yale's behavior in the dispute.
"The hallmark of President Levin's tenure has been to improve town-gown relations, and all that is going up in smoke," said John W. Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, the parent of the two union locals on strike. "When Yale puts workers in this polarized position, the cost to Yale, short term and long term, in its stature in the community is extraordinary. Since there are no issues of principle at stake for the university, it seems like an absurd price to pay."
But Dr. Levin insisted that the strike had not done major damage to campus life or town-gown relations.
"Our relations with most of the neighborhood leaders and community groups have remained very strong throughout this," he said, asserting that whatever frictions have developed resulted from union efforts to turn New Haven groups against Yale.
"It took some period of months after the 1996 strike to rebuild and strengthen some of the connections to the community that had been severed," Dr. Levin added. "I'm quite confident we can do that again."
Union leaders do not try to hide that the walkout is squeezing union members. "The cost for the workers is enormous," Mr. Wilhelm said.
The union is paying $250 a week in strike benefits, and has promised strikers help with rent if they face eviction. Nonetheless, many workers are worried about the economic strains of a strike. According to Yale's payroll figures, two-thirds of the 2,900 unionized clerical workers are reporting to work.
The union insists that more than half of the clerical workers are on strike, along with more than 90 percent of the dining hall and maintenance workers.
Laurene, a unionized financial analyst who earns about $27,000 a year and insisted that her last name not be used, said she crossed the picket line because "I couldn't go without pay."
Noting that many workers live paycheck to paycheck, she said the union could never recoup what the workers lose during the strike. "Once you've lost that week of pay, you never catch up," she said.
Mr. Wilhelm, a 1967 Yale graduate, asserted that the strikers would more than regain what they lose during the strike.
"People don't make a short-term mathematical calculation about going on strike," he said. "When we achieve fair pensions and fair salaries and a reasonable measure of job security, the workers will conclude, as in past struggles, that these struggles, while unwelcome, are necessary." 
The dispute appears to be turning into a test of wills, rather than mere haggling over dollars and cents. 
Union officials argue that Yale can settle the dispute at minimum cost. They say that meeting the union's pay demands would cost at most $2 million a year above Yale's offer. They say that meeting the union's demands to increase pensions by more than 50 percent would not require great pension contributions for at least six years because the pension fund is so overfinanced.
But Yale officials insist that meeting the union's demands would cost millions of dollars beyond what the university says is already a generous offer, calling for raises averaging more than 4 percent a year for the clerical workers.
Dr. Levin said recent changes in accounting assumptions resulting from lower interest rates had made the $200 million in pension overfinancing disappear. As a result, he said, any additional pension increases beyond what he said was a 20 percent increase offered by Yale would force Yale to increase its pension contributions.
Union negotiators say one obstacle to a settlement is that Dr. Levin may face criticism from board members and donors if he is perceived as giving too much or giving in to the union. Dr. Levin said he faced no such pressure, saying the university's offer was so generous that, unlike many employers, Yale has not demanded any givebacks.
As for whether the walkout would have lasting negative effects, James Yin, a freshman from Greenwich, Conn., said, "There have been many other strikes at Yale, and they didn't do much damage to Yale's reputation, so one more won't hurt so much."

HEADLINE: Gas Project In Peru Gets Crucial Loan 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
An ambitious project to develop Peru's natural gas fields, sharply criticized by environmental advocates, received a significant endorsement today when the Inter-American Development Bank approved a $75 million loan, bank officials in Washington said.
 The loan opens the door to another $60 million in financing that will help an alliance of companies, including the Hunt Oil Company of Texas, a company with close ties to the Bush administration, to complete one of Latin America's largest energy development projects. 
 Development of the gas fields, called the Camisea project, is led by the Argentine company Pluspetrol. Developers have already spent $1.1 billion to build gas fields on the edge of the Amazon, build two pipelines over the Andes and embark on construction of a gas-processing plant just north of the Paracas marine reserve on Peru's coast. 
In approving the loan, bank officials cited the project's importance to Peru's development, saying it would lower the cost of energy, reduce pollution in the capital (which would receive the natural gas tapped) and make the Andean country an energy exporter. The project, the bank said, could add a 0.8 percentage point growth to Peru's economy each year of its 30-year life.
"At first we had doubts," Enrique V. Iglesias, the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, said in a statement. "But we later thought our responsibility was to support it and assume the risks because we were certain that this is one of the most important projects in the history of Peru."
Developers said the $135 million in loans were not essential to completing the project, which would eventually provide gas liquids and natural gas to the United States. But the loan has a great symbolic value because Peru's government, which supports the project, considers it a seal of approval.
"This means that, most definitely, the I.D.B. assessment team took to their board a proposal that met with all the requirements," Alejandro Segret, the general manager of TGP, an Argentine company constructing the pipeline, said by phone from Lima, Peru's capital. "We are going to continue working the way we were, complying with environmental norms."
The first phase of the Camisea project, valued at $1.6 billion, has been dogged by environmental concerns raised by both ecologists and some United States government officials, who say the development endangers the rain forest, native indigenous communities and the Paracas reserve.
The Inter-American Development Bank's 14-member board, which represents 46 countries, had already delayed a vote on the loan twice. And today's vote did not come without a setback for the developers of Camisea.
The American representative, Jose Fourquet, abstained largely because of concern over the adequacy of an environmental evaluation of the project, people with knowledge of the vote said. On Aug. 28, the Export-Import Bank, a United States government credit agency that had also raised concerns, rejected a $214 million loan.
Officials at the Inter-American Development Bank said the loan was approved after Camisea's developers agreed to give the bank broader powers to monitor environmental issues over the entire length of the project. This is significant because the bank's loan is for the pipeline construction, not for development of the gas fields or of two gas-processing plants.
Bank officials were also swayed by President Alejandro Toledo's proposal, made on Monday, to create a commission to oversee the protection and cleanup of the coastal waters off Paracas where a fractionation plant to separate gas liquids is being built, and where fishmeal plants have been fouling the waters. The energy companies developing Camisea will spend $23.8 million on the bay-protection plan, the Peruvian government said.
Environmental groups, however, said the steps being taken were half-hearted. They charged that the Inter-American Development Bank had caved in to pressure and failed to uphold environmental standards before issuing a large multilateral loan.
"The I.D.B. just committed American taxpayers' money to a project that threatens the natural and cultural environment in Peru," said Aaron Goldzimer, who has closely tracked the Camisea project for Environmental Defense, a environmental group based in New York.
Kathryn S. Fuller, president of the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, said that rejection of the loan would have forced the project to "fix the plan's serious ecological flaws."
Ms. Fuller said that, instead, the bank had "wrapped the plan in a cloak of vague promises, ignored the serious risks and declared it worthy of taxpayer funding." 
The new loans mean that the project will probably move on to its next phase, the construction of a $2 billion plant to liquefy natural gas. By 2007, that facility, under development by Hunt Oil, will provide the United States with an important source of natural gas.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Grows at 3.9% Pace 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Japan's economy expanded 3.9 percent at an annualized pace in the April-to-June quarter -- nearly twice as fast as originally reported -- as capital spending was better than expected.
 The new figures put to rest any lingering concerns that Japan, the world's second-largest economy, would slip back into recession, at least during this year. In fact, Japan's economy is now growing faster than that of the United States, where growth was 3.1 percent in the second quarter. Companies here are investing more in plants and equipment, a sign they expect sales to continue expanding. 
 As in previous quarters, exports also provided a significant lift. Shipments of cars, electronics and other goods to China and the United States helped offset slower sales at home, and the strong demand from overseas shows little sign of slowing. 
The government also reported that Japan's current account surplus expanded 34.6 percent in July from the period a year ago. The current account balance is the broadest measure of goods and services entering and leaving the country.
The brighter numbers provide a lift to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's bid to win re-election on Sept. 20 as the president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party; a victory would allow him to remain prime minister. The accelerating growth gives him ammunition against rivals who say that he has damaged the economy by cutting public works projects and trying to overhaul the country's vast bureaucracy.
With the economy on the mend, investors are likely to continue moving into Japanese stocks. Though the benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.6 percent to 10,856 today, it hit a 14-month high this week and is widely forecast to rise another 11 percent to 12,000 by the end of the year.
Rising share prices and the expanding economy are taking the heat off the country's banks. The banks hold trillions of yen in stock which they count as capital, so higher share prices allow them to book extra paper profits. Declining bankruptcies and strong corporate profits also produce fewer new nonperforming loans.
Though fears of another financial crisis are fading for now, the government's chief spokesman, Yasuo Fukuda, said, "we should not be complacent" about forcing the nation's banks to write off the estimated 45 trillion yen ($384 billion) in nonperforming loans on their books.
Still, Mr. Fukuda said the economy was "heading in the right direction," a trend that analysts and investors say is hard to deny. The expansion between April and June was the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2000. Capital spending, which makes upabout 15 percent of the economy, grew 4.7 percent last quarter instead of 1.3 percent, as originally reported.
The growth figures in real terms, which account for changes in prices, were also magnified by a deepening of deflation. Prices fell 2.5 percent during the quarter, more than the 2.1 percent initially announced.
While today's report was largely upbeat, growth in the current quarter will probably be more subdued. Unusually cool summer weather led consumers to cut spending on food, travel, clothing and air-conditioners, forcing some companies to scale back their profit forecasts. The weather and the growing economy have increased prices for some produce, and those increases are being passed along to consumers.
Homeowners must also grapple with higher interest rates. The long-term prime rate, which banks use to determine the price of home loans, was raised 0.35 percentage point, to 1.85 percent, this week.
Fires in the last week at factories run by Nippon Steel and Bridgestone have also hampered production at the country's automakers.
More broadly, companies are still in the process of closing factories and trimming debt to strengthen their balance sheets. Last week, for instance, Matsushita Electric Industrial said it would close three factories in Japan before next March.
"Japanese companies still have too much capacity and too many debts, and it will take another three years before they are done cutting them," said Mamoru Yamazaki, an economist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo, who said the economy could contract in the July-to-September quarter. "The problem is getting smaller, but it still remains."
Analysts also criticized the government for not doing enough to reinforce the current recovery. Some say the Bank of Japan should more aggressively pump money into the economy until it ignites inflation. Instead, the central bank has moved only incrementally and refused to adopt an inflation target.
The central bank's policy board is unlikely to alter its stance at its next two-day meeting, which begins Thursday.
Other critics say Mr. Koizumi's penchant for cutting budgets is doing more harm than good. Some economists argue that as long as Japan is enduring deflation, the government should spend more to get consumers and companies spending again.
"Unfortunately, Mr. Koizumi understands none of this," said Richard Koo, an economist at the Nomura Research Institute, who wants the government to spend an extra 10 trillion yen ($85 billion) this year to encourage growth.

HEADLINE: Bond Sales, A Lifeblood For Italians, Face Problems 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SYLVERS

DATELINE: MILAN, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
When Barilla, the world's largest pasta maker, refinanced its debt last year, it turned to the bond market. That was no surprise, considering that stocks were in their third year of decline and the Barilla family had always shunned the possibility of an initial stock offering that would sap their jealously guarded control. 
 What was surprising, perhaps, is that Barilla sold bonds without first obtaining a credit rating from Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch. Barilla, based in Parma, Italy, which will have sales this year of about 5 billion euros ($5.61 billion) and has a brand name known the world over, is paying just 4.63 percent interest on the five-year bond, less than 1 percentage point above the rate on a similar Italian government bond sold the same week. 
 Barilla is certainly not alone. Other Italian companies with well-known brand names and unrated bonds outstanding include Bulgari, Benetton, Ducati, Pirelli and Prada. Italian companies are Europe's biggest sellers of unrated bonds and account for half the 20 billion-euro market, whether measured by number of issues, value of issues or number of companies selling the bonds. This is all the more impressive given that Italy's corporate bond market accounts for only about 5 percent of the total in Europe.
Barilla might have just gotten in under the wire, though, for just before its bond sale, another large Italian company defaulted on its debt, essentially closing the spigot for this type of borrowing, at least for now.
In the United States, unrated corporate bonds are harder to sell because many investment funds cannot hold the securities and individual investors have largely steered clear.
Barilla and other companies had several potential reasons for not seeking a credit rating, but chief among them was a desire to sell bonds with a lower rate of interest than would be possible if Moody's Investors Service or one of the other agencies gave them a rating.
"If you know your company would have to pay 8 percent interest on a bond if it got a rating, and you also know that based on your brand-name recognition you can sell the same bond at 6 percent interest if you don't have a rating, what are you going to do?" said Pierluigi Volini, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs in London who covers high-yield bonds and published a report in December on unrated Italian bonds.
The 0.8 of a percentage point that separates the Barilla bond from an Italian government bond is equal to the interest that companies with a mid-range investment-grade credit rating from Moody's or S.&P. have to pay to sell a similar bond on the market. By exploiting its brand-name recognition, Barilla essentially gained an investment-grade rating without having a rating.
Some executives argue that if their companies are going to sell only one or two bonds, it does not make financial sense for them to spend roughly 50,000 euros to get Moody's or S.&P. to rate them. And it can cost as much as 30,000 euros a year on top of that to keep a rating up to date. Getting a rating is certainly in a company's interest if it will lower, even minimally, the interest rate on a bond. Lowering the interest on 300 million euros in bonds, the amount Barilla sold, by half of a percentage point saves 1.5 million euros a year.
Barilla's tapping of the bond market in November came just two weeks after Italy's first-ever corporate bond default. Cirio, Italy's biggest canned-food producer, failed to make an interest payment on an unrated bond that had been sold six months earlier.
The company is now in liquidation and has defaulted on all its 1.1 billion euros in outstanding bonds. Sergio Cragnotti, Cirio's largest shareholder, resigned as chairman in the wake of the default and is under investigation for fraud.
"Once Cirio happened, that changed everything and effectively closed the unrated bond market in Italy," said Stefano Zeni, a credit analyst with Moody's in Milan -- though Barilla was able to complete its sale because the market had not had time to absorb the lessons of the Cirio default.
Corrado Passera, chief executive of Banca Intesa, Italy's largest lender and the lead manager on the Cirio bond sale, said in July that his bank would no longer sell unrated bonds. His comments were echoed by other Italian bank executives.
Even before the Cirio fiasco, unrated bonds were becoming harder to sell in Italy. After market declines that began in March 2000, Italians have increasingly turned to money managers, who are less likely than individual investors to buy unrated bonds based on brand-name recognition. Another factor favoring the move away from unrated bonds, said Mr. Volini of Goldman Sachs, is a general development of Italian capital markets. That has broken the cycle of banks directly financing companies. Since banks do their own credit analysis before lending, ratings were often unnecessary.
Barilla executives declined to be interviewed for this article and a spokesman declined to comment on the company's decision not to get a rating. One person at the company said the decision was based on logistical reasons.
"At the time that the bond was sold, the seven or eight people in the finance department were dealing with other things, and they didn't have time to dedicate to getting a credit rating," the person said. "We have nothing against ratings, and it's clear after what happened with Cirio that we will never be able to return to the market without one."
While the market for new unrated bonds may be all but closed, there are 15 billion euros in the securities coming due by 2007, Mr. Zeni at Moody's said. And should Barilla or one of the other companies with bonds and no rating need to refinance or raise funds for other reasons, this time around they will probably be forced to find time for one of the credit rating agencies.

HEADLINE: For This Old Program, An All-Thumbs Host 

BYLINE:  By HILARY DE VRIES

DATELINE: AGUA DULCE, Calif. 

 BODY:
IF ignorance is bliss, Kevin O'Connor is one happy man. Last year, he was a new homeowner who couldn't figure out how to strip his wallpaper. Next month he joins Norm Abram, Tom Silva and the rest of the "This Old House" team to become their improbable new host.
 Such is the curious fortune of Mr. O'Connor, 35, a freckle-faced banker from Boston whose biggest claim to fame used to be approving loans to sports teams like the Red Sox. That was before he was tapped to replace Steve Thomas, host of "This Old House" for 14 years. 
 "I grew up watching 'This Old House,' but when the producers called me at the bank, I thought they were calling me for a loan," Mr. O'Connor said. 
He spoke while gazing across the sun-blasted Martian landscape that is the front yard of Sherry Steele, a marketing analyst and -- for today's filming purposes -- baffled homeowner with a sprinkler system problem in Agua Dulce, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles.
During the taping session, Mr. O'Connor happily displayed his lack of expertise. Although it was nearly 100 degrees and the air was tangy with the smell of the neighbor's horse barns, he peppered Mrs. Steele with questions about her landscaping problems. 
Mr. O'Connor will not appear on the show until October, when the program begins its 2003-4 season with a new project: the conversion of a historic gambrel-roof barn in Concord, Mass., into an in-law apartment. But he has been on the job for months. Joined by Mr. Silva, the show's contractor, and its landscaper, Roger Cook, he had flown to California from Boston to tape segments based on questions from viewers like Mrs. Steele. 
Mr. O'Connor, who could pass for Mr. Thomas's younger brother, is along for the ride as a learning experience. Or not, as the case may be. 
"My role on the show is to not know anything, but to ask the questions of the guys -- our experts -- who do," Mr. O'Connor said, comparing himself to the average viewer. "I'm not actually supposed to get too smart."
His arrival is only the latest change in a yearlong renovation of the fusty Emmy-winning series "This Old House," after 25 years television's oldest and highest-rated home show despite a wave of cable TV hits like "Trading Spaces" and "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."
Two years ago, WGBH, the PBS affiliate in Boston that has owned and produced "This Old House" since it began in 1979, sold the program and its trappings -- syndicated reruns, a monthly magazine and Web site, books and videos -- to Time Inc. Although the series will remain on PBS, the new owners quickly set about spit-polishing the purposefully folksy show, expanding it to 60 minutes and giving it a new name -- "The New This Old House Hour" -- while adding a companion series, "Ask This Old House," which invites viewers to quiz the experts. 
As Mr. Thomas, then the series host, said at the time: "Real estate is the one bright spot in the economy, so the whole home renovation enterprise has gotten bigger. Our job is to follow that."
Early this year Mr. Thomas, 50, abruptly stepped down, saying he wanted time to pursue interests like skiing and sailing. A ship captain and amateur carpenter, Mr. Thomas was only the second host in the show's long history. He took the job in 1989 after Bob Vila, a Boston builder and the show's original host, left in an acrimonious dispute with the series over a policy forbidding employees to endorse products. (Mr. Vila went on to create his own syndicated show, "At Home With Bob Vila.") 
"When Steve told us he was leaving, it was quite frightening," said Bruce Irving, a senior producer. "First of all, Steve was really good and secondly, how do you fill a job like that? I mean, we didn't want to be inundated with every guy with a plaid shirt and a pickup."
Eager to avoid a replay of the previous auditions -- the producers had heard from more than 400 would-be Mr. Thomases, from contractors to a concert violinist -- they quietly auditioned several candidates, including architects and a developer. 
"We had a big internal debate about whether we should go with a host in the trade or not in the trade," Mr. Irving said. "We thought we'd look at someone in a related field, like home design or architecture."
Russell Morash, who created the series and remains its director and executive producer, said, "After those initial auditions, I realized what we really wanted was someone who had the curiosity, interest and enthusiasm of a real homeowner."
Mr. O'Connor was a vice president of Fleet Bank in Boston when he surfaced last November. He and his wife, Kathleen, had bought a Victorian house outside Boston, and he had contacted the show with questions about stripping the wallpaper. 
The couple and their conundrum became a segment on "Ask This Old House," where Mr. O'Connor made an impression. His camaraderie with the series regulars became clear during production of the segment when Mr. Silva played a practical joke on him by gluing his tools to the floor.
"Very believable" is the way Mr. Irving characterized the banker who was intent on renovating his own home. "A homeowner with a day job."
Mr. O'Connor started his new job in April and spent two weeks this summer at an ad hoc boot camp,working alongside Mr. Silva and the rest of the staff, but he freely admits he didn't learn all that much. "The reality is, you don't learn anything in two weeks," said Mr. O'Connor, who grew up in New Jersey, the son of an engineer. 
The biggest question for Time Inc. is how viewers will react to the new alter ego. As the least experienced of the three hosts, Mr. O'Connor is handling a franchise that reaches a total of nearly 45 million viewers, magazine readers and Web site visitors, and all are fair game for rival programs.
Kathleen O'Connor conceded that it was "a little bizarre Kevin got the job," adding, "He has a passion for renovating houses, but even his friends didn't believe him when he told them he was the show's new host." 
Stacey Lynn Koerner, a vice president at Initiative, a media services company that evaluates programs for advertisers, said that the stakes for Time Inc. may be high, but that Mr. O'Connor's role is less important than one might think. "People watch these shows because they want the expertise, not because of the host," she said. Indeed, she suggested that Mr. O'Connor's background as a banker with an M.B.A. may make him a wise choice. "A lot of the audience for these home shows are young Wall Street types wanting to fix up their homes," she said, "and Kevin fits that mold."
Mr. O'Connor's new training has already had one positive effect: speeding along his own home renovation. Since joining the series, he and Ms. O'Connor have completed the kitchen remodeling, which included moving a load-bearing wall. "We spent Easter weekend hanging the cabinets," she said with a laugh. "This is Kevin's dream job, and luckily he's already learned a lot."

HEADLINE: Election Race? First, Check Out This Bike 

BYLINE:  By NOAH SHACHTMAN

 BODY:
GEN. WESLEY K. CLARK is a hot topic in the chat rooms and clubhouses of Democratic politics, where pundits and activists are sizing up his possible presidential candidacy. More than $1 million and 13,000 volunteers have been pledged as part of an online movement to draft General Clark, the former NATO supreme commander and CNN military analyst, to enter the 2004 race. 
 But right now, General Clark wants to talk about bicycles. 
 The retired general has been devoting much of his time to running a company making a new kind of electric motor that does not require gears or a transmission, but uses computer algorithms to maximize torque and efficiency. 
 The company, WaveCrest Laboratories of Dulles, Va., hopes to put these motors into hybrid gas-electric cars or even hydrogen-powered fuel-cell cars one day. But for now, WaveCrest is focused on bikes.
 By adding one of its "adaptive motors" to a conventional bicycle frame, WaveCrest claims that its two-wheeler can go Lance Armstrong speed -- 30 miles an hour -- with hardly any pedaling at all. 
 With General Clark in command, WaveCrest is looking to the military market first.
 "The military always needs transportation for its men, but there are lots of places like tight alleys in urban areas where you don't want to be in a Humvee, which is big and noisy," said General Clark, the company's chairman. The electric bike is light and simple, he said. "You turn the handle, and it just scoots. There's no sound. Just acceleration and speed. Just a shoosh on the pavement."
 Infantrymen could ride the souped-up bikes to battle rather than marching, he said. Downed pilots could zip away on an electrified 21-speed bike instead of waiting to be captured.
 Bicycles have been used in the military for more than a hundred years. Six percent of British troops in the Boer War in southern Africa at the turn of the 20th century were on bicycles. Bicycles were common during World War I. 
 In World War II, the Japanese were able to take over the Malaysian Peninsula in 70 days largely because of the speed of its cycle-mounted troops, according to Jim Fitzpatrick, author of "The Bicycle in Wartime" (Bassey's, 1998).
 In the 1960's General Clark witnessed the use of bicycles by the Vietcong to carry supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the Vietnam War. The Special Forces Command is trying out a half-dozen prototypes of General Clark's folding-frame bikes, which are powered by two 36-volt nickel-metal-hydride batteries and have a range of about 30 miles. Several other Army units and law enforcement agencies, including the police department in General Clark's hometown, Little Rock, Ark., are considering using them as well.
 But some military analysts doubt that the electric bicycles will fit into American war planning.
 "Bicycles have worked because they're simple, light, and could be maltreated," Mr. Fitzpatrick saidt. At 64 pounds, the WaveCrest bikes are far heavier than ordinary models, he said, "so I'm somewhat dubious that they'll work."
 Tim Brown, a senior fellow at the public-policy group GlobalSecurity.org, is not convinced, either. "I'm skeptical that someone like Scott O'Grady would have this in his ejection seat," said Mr. Brown, referring to an American pilot who was shot down over Bosnia in 1995.
 WaveCrest is one of many companies developing advanced electric motors. What makes its motor different is how it is controlled, said Mike Fritz, a WaveCrest engineering executive. Most motors of this kind fire a predetermined sequence of electrical pulses that activate a series of electromagnets. These electromagnets repel and attract a set of standard, or permanent, magnets, making the motor spin. 
 WaveCrest puts six optical sensors in its motor, which inform a customized central processor thousands of times per second how fast the motor is rotating and how much torque it is generating. The chip then uses algorithms to determine precisely what kind of electrical pulses are needed to make the motor run most efficiently at that speed and at that torque. 
 Karl Brauer, editor in chief of www.edmunds.com, an automotive site, said: "With most electric motors, there's a range of speed and torque that they're happiest in, a sweet spot. What WaveCrest is trying to do is have the entire range be a sweet zone, from barely turning to turning rapidly."
 That sweet spot occurs in many electric motors when they are spinning at thousands of revolutions per minute. When used in a vehicle, some kind of transmission or reduction gearing is needed to slow things down so the wheels can turn at their proper rate, said Elias Strangas, an electrical engineering professor at Michigan State University. WaveCrest's design could eliminate the need for a transmission or gears by getting the motor's r.p.m. to match the wheel's needs. Small motors could even be put at the wheels themselves instead of having one large motor under a car's hood. The WaveCrest bicycle relies on such a setup.
 These so called in-hub motors could drastically cut the weight of a hybrid or fuel-cell car, Mr. Brauer said. And that could allow the car to carry extra batteries and extend its range.
 But that is in the uncertain future. As Professor Strangas noted, "Quite a few people have tried to produce similar kinds of motors before and haven't been able to get the economics right."
 For now, WaveCrest's main focus is electric bicycles, which General Clark said were practical to build because of their one-horsepower engines. A consumer version of the WaveCrest is scheduled to go on sale this fall for about $1,500.
 Two scientists, Alexander Pyntikov and Boris Maslov, invented the motor behind the bikes. They moved to the United States from Russia in the 90's, filed a patent on the motor in 1998 and, a year later, connected with a Washington technology entrepreneur, Allen Andersson. The three founded WaveCrest, with Mr. Andersson investing $17 million so far in the company, which now has nearly 100 employees. After informally advising the company for several years, General Clark became its chairman in April.
 Since then, he said, he has been devoting up to a quarter of his time to the company. But he may have to cut back on his WaveCrest responsibilities if he decides to pursue that higher-profile job.

HEADLINE: Bill on Changes in Welfare Advances to Full Senate 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Welfare legislation cleared a major hurdle today as the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill that would increase work requirements for welfare recipients.
 The bill, approved on a party-line vote of 9 to 8, would also spend $1 billion over the next five years to promote marriage as a goal for people on welfare. 
 The House approved a similar bill in February. Both bills make fundamental changes in the 1996 welfare law, which has prompted millions of poor people to move from welfare to work. Administration officials said President Bush supported both the House bill and the Senate version. 
It is unclear when the full Senate may take up the measure. Major provisions of the 1996 law expire on Sept. 30, but Congress could extend them for a few months, as it has done several times in the last year.
"Getting the bill out of the Senate Finance Committee is a huge step," said Wade F. Horn, assistant secretary of health and human services in charge of welfare policy. "Our very strong preference is for Congress to move the bill quickly in order to provide states with stability and predictability, so they can make long-term plans for their welfare programs."
Democrats and at least one Republican member of the Finance Committee said the bill did not provide enough money for child care.
"We are trying to help families get off welfare," the senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, said. "But to get off welfare, single mothers need adequate child care."
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, had previously blocked action on the measure, saying it did not have enough money for child care. But she voted to send it to the Senate floor today after having received a commitment guaranteeing her ability to offer an amendment to provide $5 billion to $6 billion for child care, on top of the $1 billion increase in the bill.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, says nearly half the states have reduced child-care subsidies or restricted eligibility in the last two years.
Ms. Snowe also persuaded the committee to give states the option of letting welfare recipients meet most work requirements by attending college or other postsecondary institutions. Maine has such a program, Parents as Scholars.
Last year, Mr. Bush denounced that provision of the Senate bill, saying it would pay welfare recipients to attend college for five years. But Ms. Snowe said the Maine program had been "an unqualified success," enabling many people to move off welfare to positions that pay more than $11 an hour.
Since the welfare law was signed in 1996, the number of people on welfare has plunged, to 5 million from 12.2 million, a 59 percent decline. Federal officials said they had seen a slight decline even as unemployment rose and the nation struggled through a recession in the last year.
Under current law, recipients are generally required to work 30 hours a week. Mr. Bush wanted to increase that to 40 hours. The House bill would require 38 hours. Under the Senate bill, most recipients would have to work 34 hours.
The Senate bill also provides up to $1.5 billion for programs to help low-income people "form and sustain healthy marriages."
Mr. Baucus said he doubted the value of such programs.
But Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, said: "The evidence is overwhelming. Children raised in married households do much better by every social, economic and educational indicator."
Under current law, at least 50 percent of a state's adult recipients are supposed to be engaged in work or preparing for work. The Senate bill, like the House measure, would gradually increase that figure, to 70 percent in 2008.
By voice vote, the Finance Committee approved a separate bill to improve health insurance coverage for families of children with severe disabilities. Under the bill, thousands of working parents could buy Medicaid coverage for which they would otherwise be ineligible.
"Medicaid is a safety net program, and one must be impoverished to be eligible," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chief sponsor of the bill. "This presents a terrible choice for many low- and middle-income families who have a child with special health care needs. They must choose between work or impoverishment. In the worst cases, parents consider the devastating choice of relinquishing custody so the child can obtain services."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Bush's Speech Offers Focus for Democrats' Attacks

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
In a classic case of unintended consequences, President Bush's major address to the nation on Iraq seems to have emboldened -- rather than muted -- his Democratic critics.
 Democratic presidential candidates have escalated their attacks since the president's speech to the nation on Sunday night, in which he declared Iraq the "central front" in the war on terrorism and asked for an additional $87 billion and more help from the United Nations to handle it. Like their colleagues on Capitol Hill, Democratic candidates are attacking both Mr. Bush's management of postwar Iraq and the huge toll that his spending request will take on the domestic agenda, including education and jobs. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, in an address to the Council on Foreign Relations today, asserted, "Both abroad and at home, the Bush administration has hoarded authority, bungled diplomacy, pushed allies to the margin and divided rather than multiplied the strength we need to win the war on terror."
Mr. Lieberman, who supported military action in Iraq, said an international administrator should take control of the country within 60 days.
The Democratic candidates are bitterly divided over whether Congress should have authorized Mr. Bush to invade Iraq; that was evident at the debate on Tuesday. Most are careful to say they will do what is necessary to protect American troops, including, if need be, backing the president's financing request. But they are eager to highlight what they consider fundamental miscalculations in Mr. Bush's performance as commander in chief, which has been considered his greatest strength in the campaign.
"President Bush and Karl Rove thought the issue of Iraq would be their greatest asset going into the re-election campaign," Terry McAuliffe, the national Democratic chairman, told reporters today. "It actually could turn into a liability."
Stanley Greenberg, a longtime Democrat pollster, argued: "Democrats can engage in a robust debate on security and foreign policy issues and be more than competitive. There's no need to walk in trepidation behind a president who's a wartime leader."
Republican strategists say they are confident that Mr. Bush will retain his party's traditional advantage on national security, which looms large in the post-9/11 world. Even with Mr. Bush's decline in the polls after major combat ended in Iraq, a Washington Post poll in August found Americans, by two to one, said Republicans would do better handling the war against terrorism.
Moreover, the Republican Party, led by Ed Gillespie, the national party chairman, has begun an aggressive defense against Democratic attacks, describing them as "political hate speech." In an interview today, Mr. Gillespie said, "There is a contrast here -- while President Bush is attacking the terrorists, the Democrats are attacking President Bush."
Mr. Gillespie added that the Democratic candidates, "in their effort to appeal to their hard-core antiwar and anti-President Bush base in their party, are adopting a weak and vacillating foreign policy that will hurt them with their broader electorate."
Some nonpartisan analysts agree that the Democrats face some risk in criticizing the costs of postwar operations. Andy Kohut, the pollster who heads the Pew Research Center, said: "What Bush did pretty well was say: 'This is about terrorism. We're confronting the battle on terrorism in Iraq and over Iraq.' And that's a very good way of framing it for the American public." 
James B. Steinberg, a member of the Clinton administration who is now an analyst at Brookings, said: "At some point, the issue will be joined. Was this necessary for the war on terrorism, and do people feel as a result of having done this that they are safer or less safe in the face of terrorism? How people feel about that question a year from now will be critical."
Still, Democrats seem energized by what many assert was a major admission of error by Mr. Bush -- in not seeking more international support in the action against Iraq, in underestimating the difficulty of postwar reconstruction, in not preparing the American people for such a lengthy operation, in not having a realistic plan.
Moreover, it has enabled many Democrats to link Mr. Bush's expensive policies in Iraq to what they say is his reckless handling of the economy and the federal budget at home.
"We cannot authorize or appropriate $87 billion without pulling back some of the unfair Bush tax cut for the wealthiest Americans and investing in the United States of America," Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said at the debate on Tuesday night. "If we can open firehouses in Baghdad, we can keep them open in the United States of America."
But, many analysts said, the Democrats are walking a difficult line, opposing the president's handling of Iraq, but recognizing that the country cannot "cut and run" and that they may, ultimately, have to give the administration what it needs.
Six of the nine Democratic candidates are in the Senate or the House, and will therefore have to vote on the president's spending request. Most have spelled out various conditions they would seek before casting their vote, declaring they will not vote for an open-ended request or a blank check. But most said they would, in the end, do what it took to protect American troops.
A spokesman for former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, whose surge in the Democratic field was largely powered by his antiwar stance, said he would oppose the spending request unless it was taken out of the administration's tax cuts.
In the end, even as Democrats move toward a more unified message against Mr. Bush on Iraq after the brutal divisions caused by the war, the strains of a competitive primary campaign remain, and may simply re-emerge in different form.

HEADLINE: TWO YEARS LATER: THE CONTEXT; 
Counterterror Proposals Are a Hard Sell

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
President Bush, seeking still greater powers to fight terrorism, appears to have calculated that the renewed memories of the Sept. 11 attacks evoked by their second anniversary will be enough to outweigh rising concerns over civil liberties.
 Mr. Bush's proposal for stronger counterterrorism laws, made in a toughly worded speech today, faces a hard sell in Congress, as the administration tries to persuade skeptical lawmakers in both parties that the authorities will not abuse their growing power to investigate and lock up suspects. 
 The strategy is similar to the one the White House has employed in the fight over its tax cut plan. After its first tax cut in 2001 came under intense attack from Democrats and many economists for raising the deficit, the administration responded this year not by retreating but by successfully championing yet another tax cut. 
But in this case, the administration is reviving some of the same terrorism proposals, including the expanded use of nonjudicial subpoenas in terror cases, that were considered and rejected by Congressional negotiators in debate over the Patriot Act in the fall of 2001.
In the last several months, Attorney General John Ashcroft proposed making more terrorism-related crimes eligible for the death penalty and making it more difficult for suspects to be released on bail, two critical components of the new initiative. But rather than using Mr. Ashcroft, a polarizing figure, to unveil the proposals, the White House decided to have Mr. Bush personally announce the plan on the eve of the second anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks -- and at an early stage of the presidential campaign.
Still, the political climate has changed markedly since the original Patriot Act was passed overwhelmingly by the House and Senate. Some 160 communities around the country have voiced formal objections to the legislation, civil rights groups have sued to have it overturned, and it has become a rallying point for Democratic presidential candidates on the campaign trail who say it smacks of Big Brother tactics.
Iin pushing for new counterterrorism authority, the White House appeared undaunted by the increasing attacks from both Republicans and Democrats over the Patriot Act and the government's expanded powers. 
"The best defense is a good offense, and this administration plays that strategy very well," said Beryl Howell, a specialist in surveillance and counterterrorism law and a former Senate Democratic aide. "Their attitude is, 'if you think the USA Patriot Act is so bad, wait and see what else we want.' They're marking their position."
Administration officials and supporters said they thought the intense focus on the law in recent weeks could actually help their cause. "If you have a lively debate, that's when you have the best chance to persuade the public and the Congress," said Viet Dinh, a former senior aide to Mr. Ashcroft who helped to draft the act.
Democrats in Congress were quick to attack the president's proposals.
Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said: "Removing judges from providing any check or balance on John Ashcroft's subpoenas does not make us safer, it only makes us less free. Of course terrorists should not be released on bail, but this administration has a shameful record of deeming law-abiding citizens as terrorists and taking away their rights."
Other critics said the plan amounted to a revival of some of the main proposals included in that earlier plan.
"They don't want to call this a sequel to the Patriot Act, but the fact is that that's what it is," said Timothy Edgar, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.
Democrats said the administration now appears intent on introducing new counterterrorism proposals in smaller, piecemeal fashion, rather than submitting to Congress an all-encompassing plan that many predict would face near-certain defeat. 
And by having Mr. Bush announce the plan at the F.B.I. Academy in Quantico, Va., a setting clearly identified with law enforcement and on the day before the Sept. 11 anniversary, the White House hopes to quell criticism, especially from Republicans. 
Even Republicans with deep-seated concerns about expanding the government's counterterrorism authority said the timing made it difficult for them to speak out today without appearing insensitive to the memory of those killed on Sept. 11 and disloyal to President Bush.
"This is the president talking and not John Ashcroft," said a Republican Congressional aide, "and the fact is that we have to be as supportive as we can of the president and his efforts to combat terrorism."

HEADLINE: New Accounts Of Meetings At Big Board On Chief's Pay 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Richard A. Grasso decided to give up $48 million in benefits owed to him by the New York Stock Exchange only hours before the decision was announced, and after some members of the board said he should, several directors said yesterday.
 Just days earlier, one director said, Mr. Grasso said he did not want to give up the money because to do so would "repudiate the process" that had determined his compensation over the years he served as the exchange's chairman and chief executive. 
 Documents released by the exchange yesterday also indicated that the board's compensation committee did not learn until late last year that Mr. Grasso's pay was considerably higher than that of executives at financial services companies and that his pension benefits were almost six times the size of theirs. 
The combined picture is of a board that -- while it received and approved Mr. Grasso's contracts with the exchange -- did not understand how the contracts were enriching Mr. Grasso to a far greater degree than any previous Big Board chairman. Several directors said they did not know about the $48 million until the day Mr. Grasso gave up the pay.
Mr. Grasso and the exchange have faced questioning since last month, when the exchange disclosed that he was paid $139.5 million in deferred compensation and pension benefits he had previously earned. Some were shocked that an official whose duties include regulating Wall Street firms would have been granted so much money by a board that included top officials of investment banking firms.
His pay soared under a contract signed in 1999 at the height of the Wall Street boom. It appears that many directors did not understand how generous that contract was.
The picture emerging is of a board far less united in support of Mr. Grasso than has been reported. The documents show that early last month H. Carl McCall, the chairman of the Big Board's compensation committee, told the committee that he believed that some directors would not support the decision to pay out the money to Mr. Grasso. And the reports from directors indicate that Mr. Grasso rejected the money only after some directors said he should. 
In a telephone meeting on Tuesday, several directors said, Mr. Grasso discussed the $48 million and then left the conversation to allow the board to discuss the matter without him. The $48 million was to be disclosed later that day to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had requested information.
Directors -- including Philip J. Purcell, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley; William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive of J. P. Morgan Chase; and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman Sachs -- argued that the board should demand that Mr. Grasso forgo these payments, and Mr. McCall agreed, directors said. Some others argued that it was Mr. Grasso's money and that he should be able to make his own decision.
But the debate became moot within minutes when Mr. Grasso rejoined the conversation and, according to one director, said: "I want to move ahead. None of this is good for the exchange." He added: "I didn't ask for this money. I don't spend this money, and I shouldn't accept this money."
A brief silence ensued, the director said, until Mr. Paulson spoke up, saying, "Dick, you are doing the right thing and we all support you." Other directors then joined in voicing their support of the decision.
Mr. Grasso could not be reached for comment last night.
If board members did not know until recent days that Mr. Grasso was entitled to that money, however, they may have failed to study the new contract approved by the board last month. While it does not cite $48 million, it spells out the payments that add up to that sum. That contract was shown to reporters by the exchange yesterday.
The Tuesday meeting was not the first time that director opposition had persuaded Mr. Grasso to consider backing down. Early in August, even as the board was moving to pay him the money he had been seeking for many months, he said action should be delayed, but the board's compensation committee decided to move ahead anyway.
Minutes of the board's Aug. 7 compensation committee meeting quote Mr. McCall as saying: "Some directors were concerned with the timing of the new agreement and asked questions regarding disclosure. Some directors had called Mr. Grasso to express their concerns." 
Mr. McCall, the minutes added, informed the committee that "Mr. Grasso did not think it was wise to proceed at this time."
But the compensation committee rejected that idea. Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock Inc., an institutional investment firm, was quoted in the minutes as saying he "felt the timing would be no better if the decision were deferred, and the issue should be dealt with immediately."
Several directors, who insisted that they not be identified, said opposition in August came in part from Wall Street executives, who were particularly concerned about public reaction. While they did not dispute the notion that Mr. Grasso should be paid the money that was contractually his, some opposed allowing him to receive such a large payment while he remained chairman. Some said more time was needed to analyze the numbers and try to reach a more palatable solution. This group included Mr. Purcell, Mr. Harrison and Mr. Paulson, according to other directors. Each of these directors, through their spokesmen, declined to discuss the meetings.
They were persuaded to allow the payment to proceed and to be disclosed immediately.
By then, the board appears to have felt trapped. The new agreement with Mr. Grasso, which extended his contract until 2007, was expected to save the exchange several million dollars by changing the way some bonuses and benefits were calculated. The money he was to receive was owed to him, the committee was told.
The contract was approved at the same time the board was working on revising its corporate governance, also under pressure from the S.E.C., a process that seemed likely to lead to disclosures of Mr. Grasso's pay.
At the Aug. 7 committee meeting, according to the minutes, Jurgen E. Schrempp, the chairman of the management board of DaimlerChrysler, "asked whether the present agreement was legally binding" and was assured that it was.
He emphasized that the amount being paid was determined by employment agreements entered into in 1995 and 1999, and "stressed the need for a discussion of Mr. Grasso's further compensation, which still requires a firm decision."
The new contract gives the board substantial discretion to set Mr. Grasso's annual bonus. The size will not be known until next spring.
But Mr. McCall seemed to indicate yesterday that Mr. Grasso might get less in the future. "The important thing is that this is behind us," he said in a statement. "We now have to completely revamp our compensation policies and set new benchmarks for compensation based on today's economic realities."
Mr. Grasso's high compensation was in sharp contrast to that of William H. Donaldson, his predecessor as Big Board chairman. Mr. Donaldson is now the chairman of the S.E.C., which made the inquiry. He was paid $1.5 million a year when he joined the New York Stock Exchange in 1991, and had total compensation of $1.85 million in his best-paid year.
According to documents, Mr. Grasso asked last year to take out the money that had accrued in a variety of plans. The amounts appear to have come as a surprise to some directors, and the compensation committee decided on Sept. 25, 2002, that a new consultant, with no ties to the exchange, should review his compensation.
Kenneth Langone, the founder of Home Depot and the chairman of Invemed Associates, a brokerage firm, was then the head of the board's compensation committee. He chose Robert J. Stucker and Thomas P. Desmond of Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz, a Chicago law firm. 
The new consultant looked at the pay of 16 chief executives of financial services companies. At the Oct. 6 compensation committee meeting, Vedder Price provided charts showing that in that group the median compensation -- including salary, bonus and equity-related grants like options -- was $13.46 million in 2001, and that someone would rank in the top quartile of that group if paid $18.23 million. Mr. Grasso, it said, received $31.25 million. (The figure is $700,000 higher than the one released by the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Officials could not explain the discrepancy when asked yesterday.)
The Vedder Price lawyers also reported that it was unusual for companies to include long-term incentive compensation in calculating pension benefits, as the Big Board did. The result was that Mr. Grasso, who is now 57, would be owed at least $122 million if he retired at 60 and took a lump-sum pension distribution. The comparable figure for the medium financial services firm was $21 million, and $29 million was enough to rank in the top quartile.
The Vedder Price report noted that there were "due diligence issues associated with C.E.O. request to cash out," and acceleration of deferred and incentive compensation awards "is rare and inconsistent" with the "retention orientation of these programs."
Nonetheless, Vedder Price recommended that the board largely agree to what Mr. Grasso was asking. The only exception was that it recommended he not be allowed to cash in a $5 million bonus that was awarded in early 2001 but was to vest fully in 2006. That bonus was part of the money that Mr. Grasso ended up forfeiting.
The minutes of the meeting at which that bonus was awarded show that the board agreed that the $5 million should be awarded "for the outstanding contributions of Chairman Grasso" and that a similar payment should be made in future years. No discussion of the total amount of Mr. Grasso's pay, or how it compared with that of other financial services executives, is reflected in the minutes.
In fact, a $5 million bonus was awarded a year later, and was part of the money that Mr. Grasso was able to cash out last month. But no similar bonus was awarded early this year, and Mr. Grasso's total compensation for 2002 was cut to $12 million from more than $30 million the previous year.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats, With Republican Help, Block Administration's New Overtime Rules 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
President Bush's plan to change the definition of who is eligible for overtime pay ran into a serious roadblock on Capitol Hill today, as the Senate, in a rare Democratic victory, voted to block the White House from issuing the new rules.
 Six Republicans joined with 48 Democrats to oppose the White House plan, which critics say would strip as many as eight million workers of their right to overtime. The 54-to-45 vote was a rebuke to the administration, which contends that the rules, strongly supported by the business community, would update an outmoded labor law and make more people eligible for overtime. 
 The matter is far from settled. The measure the Senate passed was an amendment to a much larger spending bill that covers programs for health, labor and education, including money for student loans and medical research. When the House considered the same bill in July, it voted, by a narrow margin, to clear the way for the new overtime rules. 
The Senate passed the spending bill unanimously tonight, 94 to 0. Now the two chambers must work out their differences in conference. The White House, meanwhile, has threatened to veto the entire $139 billion appropriations package if the Senate provision opposing the overtime revision remains in it. Lawmakers of both parties said they had no idea how the dispute would be resolved.
"We'll work out something," said Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who voted along with the Democrats to block the rules and who, as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, will name the Senate conferees and serve on the conference committee. "I don't want to see this bill vetoed."
Democrats vowed to stand fast.
"This is a real signal," said Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who was the chief sponsor of the amendment that passed today. "It's a signal to the administration that they can't just run roughshod over workers' rights in this country."
The proposed changes, which are not yet final, would revise the Fair Labor Standards Act, the 1938 law that guarantees workers overtime pay, at time and a half, if they work more than a 40-hour week. The law exempts administrative, professional and executive employees, but the White House wants to revise the exemption criteria.
There is sharp disagreement about how many people -- and precisely who -- would be affected. Under current law, workers earning $8,000 or less are guaranteed overtime; the administration would raise that threshold to $22,100, a move White House officials say would make 1.3 million more low-wage workers eligible for overtime. The administration estimates that 644,000 white-collar workers would lose overtime rights.
"The Department of Labor will continue our efforts to strengthen overtime protections for workers," Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said in a statement after the vote, calling the rule changes "long overdue."
The White House plan, though, does not list specific jobs that would be excluded; instead, it broadly defines the duties that would disqualify workers. For instance, administrators who hold a "position of responsibility" while performing nonmanual work could be excluded. 
An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, estimated that eight million workers would lose their overtime pay under the proposal. Ross Eisenbrey, the institute's vice president, said there was no evidence that 1.3 million workers would be added to the overtime rolls.
Momentum for the amendment opposing the administration's overtime revisions had been building in the Senate, so much so that Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, refused to schedule a vote on Tuesday, when the measure's prospects were enhanced because all four Senate Democratic presidential candidates were in the Capitol. 
After a day of partisan bickering that temporarily brought Senate business to a standstill, the vote was scheduled for this morning. The presidential aspirants, who had been in Baltimore for a Tuesday night debate, were back today; all four voted in favor of the amendment.
Republicans who joined them offered varying reasons. Senator Stevens said the proposal should be subjected to more public debate. Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, said the changes were "excessive, especially at a time when there's so much unemployment."
For Democrats, the issue has appeal in an election year. House Democrats are mulling whether to force a second, nonbinding vote on the amendment -- a vote they believe will put Republicans on the spot. "The more Republicans find out about it, and find out about who it impacts, the less likely they are to support it," Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, said. 
Mr. Miller said the chances were good that the Senate provision would survive the conference, but several House Republicans disagreed.
"Where we go over the next several months is an open question," said Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. He added, "I've not seen any indication that the White House is backing down."
Labor unions, which have argued that the White House plan would permit businesses to demand that employees work longer hours without compensation, hailed the vote as an important victory.
John Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, said the White House plan "would gut overtime protections for millions of American workers."
Business groups, which have lobbied heavily in favor of the revised rules, said they were outraged.
Randel Johnson, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, called the Senate action "a clear case of politics and party rhetoric trumping common sense."
Tracy Mullin, the president of the National Retail Federation, the retail trade association, said, "This vote will leave employers trying to shoehorn 21st-century jobs like computer programmer into cold war job titles like keypunch operator."
Before the overtime regulations can become final, the Department of Labor must first review 80,000 public comments. That process is continuing, Secretary Chao said today.

Senate Blocks Bush Plan To Alter Overtime Eligibility
President Bush's plan to change the definition of who is eligible for overtime pay ran into a serious roadblock on Capitol Hill, as the Senate, in a rare Democratic victory, voted to block the White House from issuing the rules.
 The 54-45 vote was a sharp rebuke to the administration, which argues that the rules will update an outmoded labor law and actually make more people eligible for overtime. Opponents say it would strip up to eight million workers of their right to overtime. Page A17. 

Coffee Case Ordered Back in Court
A federal appeals court in Manhattan ordered a new trial to settle a 1987 dispute over tons of Colombian coffee that failed to arrive in New York. The court nullified a 1997 decision in the case because the presiding judge, Milton Pollack, left, 96, belatedly disclosed that he and his wife owned stocks in one of the banks that benefited from his decision.

 A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan.

Museums

"A.I.M. 23," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000 (through Sept. 28). Every year the Bronx Museum puts on a show of work by participants in its Artists in the Marketplace program, which teaches emerging professionals how to manage and advance their careers. Highlights of this year's exhibition include Jeongtae Chae's optically vibrating arrangements of found objects, Joe Fig's miniature re-creations of painters' work tables, Kate Gilmore's video of herself as she tries to bring order to chaos and Hidemi Sato's obliquely poetic grids of photographs depicting brightly colored restaurant and gas station signs against blue sky. Hours: Wednesdays, noon to 9 p.m.; Thursdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 65+; free on Wednesdays (Ken Johnson).

* "THE AMERICAN EFFECT: GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE UNITED STATES, 1990-2003," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Oct. 12). Exploring ways that artists throughout the world react to the United States as a superpower, this show of documentary films, videos, installations, photographs, paintings and objects by 47 artists and filmmakers and 3 collaborative groups runs from sunny side up to deep despair. There are reflections on America's military might, its industrial clout, its treatment of minorities, its consumerism, its justice system, its marketing strategies, its religious evangelism, its celebrity worship and its interference with other governments. On the other hand, there are more positive expressions of admiration for the freedoms, the opportunities and the material achievements of a country unfettered by ancient traditions. A wacky installation by a French artist, Gilles Barbier, in the form of life-size figures, offers a wry take on the United States through its aging comic book heroes, viewed in the setting of a nursing home and in the last stages of decrepitude. In a very different key is a video projection dealing with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963; the work, by a Serbian artist, Zoran Naskovski, is accompanied by a poignantly chanted tribute. The show has its weak spots but is provocative and visually compelling over all. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

"ANSEL ADAMS AT 100," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Nov. 3). This exhibition of 113 of Adams's photographs, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of his birth, has been traveling around the world for two years. In these warehouse galleries it has a strangely random and homely feel. The photographs look small and lost. Maybe it's the setting. Maybe it's because the show, organized roughly thematically -- austere peaks, plants, peaks with plants, grand vistas, rocks -- doesn't have a clearly focused concept. Or maybe it's because the curator wanted to tamp down Adams's bombast and replace it with something quieter, smaller and subtler. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Sarah Boxer).

* MAX BECKMANN, Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Sept. 29). Like Beckmann, this retrospective of that German genius is dense, frequently revelatory and exhausting: all that heavy-handed symbolism and claustrophobia. Beckmann can seem like a truculent master, glaring balefully at us from his self-portraits, disappointed by our moral turpitude. It is easy to get bogged down in the miasma of his obscure allusions. But he also puts brush to canvas with surprising tenderness. Color is luxurious, not garish. The humor is sly and black. Finally, he is unavoidably compelling. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).

* "BLACK PRESIDENT: THE ART AND LEGACY OF FELA ANIKULAPO-KUTI," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 28). The Nigerian composer, musician and activist Fela Kuti (1938-1997) invented the musical style called Afrobeat, relentlessly assailed political corruption and repression in Africa and beyond through his records and performances, and led a scandalous private life very publicly. This taut, vivacious exhibition is less about the man himself than about how 30 contemporary artists, most of them African or African-American, respond to his blazing, goading lodestar presence. Their reactions range from celebratory to critical, and few are simple, but his vision of a rejuvenated Africa still shines bright. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

"DRAWN HOME: FRITZ VOGT'S RURAL AMERICA," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through Sept. 21). During the last decade of the 19th century, Vogt, a German immigrant, supported himself by making portraits of homes in upstate New York. A homeless itinerant who preferred to sleep in his patrons' barns, Vogt made wonderfully lucid, formally ingenious drawings of farms with multiple outbuildings and of elaborately decorated Victorian showpieces with manicured grounds. The 26 drawings here tap into an American ethos that elevated domestic prosperity to something like a national religion. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; $7, students and 62+ (Johnson).

* "EGYPT REBORN: ART FOR ETERNITY," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (permanent installation). The second and final phase in the museum's reinstallation of its world-
renowned holdings of ancient Egyptian art, this dazzling display rounds up more than 600 objects -- from king-and-queen-size monuments to tiny rings and amulets -- from the predynastic period to the 18th dynasty. Viewing it together with the first phase, which opened in 1993 and covers later Egyptian art, visitors will now be able to trace the entire course of this brilliant and complex civilization from its beginnings to its absorption by the Roman Empire in 30 B.C. The heart of the new installation is an introductory gallery that provides a wonderful summation, with a survey of sculptural styles and displays of weapons, pottery, cosmetics, jewelry, furniture and funerary arts. The adjacent galleries are devoted to an extensive chronological survey. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3, students and 62+ (Glueck).

* "FRENCH ARTISTS IN ROME: INGRES TO DEGAS, 1803-1873," Dahesh Museum of Art, 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606 (through Nov. 2). The show auspiciously inaugurates the Dahesh's spanking new Manhattan home in the former I.B.M. gallery, which is just about the only below-ground space in town that is not too bad for looking at art. It charts the evolution of French 19th-century academic art in Rome, although at heart it's about young friends finding themselves as artists in a great city with an intimidating past, a prototypical story that could be told about New York or Paris. The academic stars here are Ingres and David d'Angers. Adolphe William Bouguereau's "Battle Between the Centaurs and theLapiths," an academic machine of a painting, is a remarkable picture if you can stand it. But the best works in the show tend to be informal portraits and sketches of the Roman landscape, fresh and bathed in light. The exhibition ends on an ethereal note, with paintings by Moreau, Puvis de Chavannes and Degas, who challenged academia and for whom Rome became, when they were older, a kind of enchanted memory. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; $4 for students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

"FROM PICASSO TO POLLOCK: CLASSICS OF MODERN ART," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 28). This selective anthology of perennial in-house favorites in a major museum has much to be said for it. The bait is irresistible, the promised classics turn up here and there, and both the young and the not-so-young have a fine time on the ramps. In addition to fine examples by Kandinsky, Picasso, Leger, Chagall, Kokoschka and Malevich, there is an enormous piece in ceramic tiles by Joan Miro. Begun in 1965 and finished in 1967, it is largely in black-and-white, but every touch of color sings out. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $15; $10 for students and 65+ (John Russell).

* "GREAT WAVES: CHINESE THEMES IN THE ARTS OF KOREA AND JAPAN," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 21). Basically a collection reinstallation with a novel mix-and-match approach, this show, spread over both the Chinese painting and Japanese galleries, traces the flow of influence from one culture to the other. Most of the action takes place in the Chinese galleries, where the art is arranged by motifs -- seascapes, landscapes, floral images -- that emerged early in China and circulated to Korea and Japan. The model proposed will provide grist for many future scholarly mills; the show itself is tremendous fun to look at. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

JOSE ANTONIO HERNANDEZ-DIEZ, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 21). Born in Venezuela in 1964, Mr. Hernandez-Diez is one of several urbane Latin American artists whose work might be described as a kind of vernacular conceptualism, a physically reductive, idea-rich art made from scraps of everyday consumerist life. His New Museum solo incorporates skateboards, household furniture, a stuffed pet dog, fake fingernails, baseball bats and photographs of designer sneakers, all put to unexpected uses. The results can be read in terms of local associations, but the real focus is on commonly shared experiences: appetite, rootlessness, faith and delusion, violence, the collective unconscious of globalized culture. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* ELLSWORTH KELLY, "Red Green Blue," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Nov. 2). Mr. Kelly was the Chet Baker of the new, cool painters of the post-Abstract Expressionist generation. From the late 50's to the mid-60's he produced a series of paintings using the colors red, blue and green. On view in this show, they still sing. With their optically dazzling, high-keyed colors, their catchy, simplified designs and their satiny, brush-free surfaces, the paintings communicate the excitement of a new hedonistic optimism that did so much to make the 60's what they were. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).

"LEGENDS OF OUR TIMES: NATIVE RANCHING AND RODEO LIFE ON THE PLAINS AND THE PLATEAU," National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through March 7). This lively account of man, woman and horse among the native people in Western reaches of the United States and Canada proves that a cowboy can be an Indian, and vice versa. The show depicts native peoples not as objects of exploitation by the white man but as ranchers, cowboys, entertainers and rodeo performers. It displays more than 700 objects -- saddles, bead and quill works, paintings, photographs, blankets, clothing, horse gear, hunting implements, roundup equipment, headdresses and other ceremonial garb -- from the 18th century to now. At least half of this huge show provides an engaging and comprehensive account of rodeo, but nonrodeo fans will probably have more fun with the bedazzlement of objects depicting the more traditional side of American Indian life. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Glueck).

"MATERIAL DIFFERENCES: ART AND IDENTITY IN AFRICA," Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through Oct. 6). Part Art Methods 101, part Advanced Connoisseurship, this handsome, thoughtful show examines the potent connection between matter and meaning in diverse African cultures and shows them to be organically connected. The material is spiritual in these cultures, and the show's 130 mostly ceremonial objects, arranged strictly according to materials and techniques, reflect the power of that belief. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

"NOGUCHI -- THE BOLLINGEN JOURNEY: PHOTOGRAPHS AND DRAWINGS, 1949-1956," Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum (temporary space), 36-01 43rd Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 204-7088 (through Oct. 13). More than 100 photographs and drawings recreate Noguchi's travels from 1949 to 1956, on a grant from the Bollingen Foundation. The project was for an ambitious book (never completed) on the spaces and structures -- religious, monumental, classical and communal -- of familiar as well as less-documented societies. Besides providing an elegant travelogue, the photographs give some idea of the many sources that Noguchi drew on for his work. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Glueck)

"THE PERFECT GAME: AMERICA LOOKS AT BASEBALL," American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through Feb. 1). This sweet and nearly pitch-perfect show is not a documentary of the sport. It is an elaborate illustration of a shared loved affair with a game, expressed, as love often is, through art. Joe DiMaggio and Cy Young do not tip their caps anywhere in it. But George Sosnak does. A retired minor league umpire, he intricately decorated baseballs with India ink, elaborately annotated, in his spare time. John Tracy, a Union soldier in a Confederate prison, carved baseball scenes onto a cane to pass time and save himself from going nuts. Ray Materson sewed pictures of his favorite Yankees while serving a 15-year sentence for armed robbery. And David Mellor, who is in charge of the grounds at Fenway Park in Boston, rolls the grass into fantastic patterns for the folks in the stands to enjoy. Call it folk art for the masses, which is not abad definition for baseball, by the way. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

"PULP ART: VAMPS, VILLAINS AND VICTORS FROM THE ROBERT LESSER COLLECTION," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Oct. 19). This murky exhibition showcases the small, gaudy, largely unappreciated paintings commissioned for the covers of the pulp magazines that ruled the newsstands between the wars. While ultimately a bit repetitious, their overheated depictions of sharp-jawed heroes, compromised heroines and various human and nonhuman villains highlight talents like George Rozen and Paul R. Frank. They also give vent to the dark, violent, libidinous underbelly of the American psyche, to the same degree that Norman Rockwell's paintings bless its wholesome, repressed, preternaturally sunny side. The show is essential viewing for anyone interested in popular culture past or present. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

"REMEMBERING THE FORGOTTEN ONES: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF MILTON ROGOVIN," New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Oct. 12). Mr. Rogovin, who is 93, has been photographing the residents of Buffalo's Lower West Side, a largely black, Latino and immigrant neighborhood, since the 1950's. Wonderful images have emerged: a benignly smiling elderly man pushing a baby in a carriage; alert kids dressed in cool street styles; a teenage mother standing with her infant in front of a wall bearing the chalk-written words "I love you God." At regular intervals, Mr. Rogovin has rephotographed some of his original subjects, and he displays the updates in four-picture sequences that he calls quartets. In them couples marry and have families; change homes, partners and eras; gain weight, gain perspective, disappear. Sad, traumatic or sweet, these visual versions of oral history are the highlight of the show. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

"VIETNAM: JOURNEYS OF BODY, MIND AND SPIRIT," American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through Jan. 4). For many Americans who came of age before or during the 1960's, Vietnam was the name of a place you didn't want to go to. Even today the prevailing impression of this part of Southeast Asia seems to be a composite of remembered news clips and scenes from "Apocalypse Now." More than a quarter-century after the war, the image is due for revision, and that is the basic idea behind this show, a lavishly illustrated anthropological field trip through Vietnam today. Using objects, videos and photographs, it examines popular traditions associated with marriage, death and religion, often to vivid effect, in a lively, serpentine installation. And even with many important political and social questions left unasked and unanswered, there is a wealth of information here. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $9, students and 60+ (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

"BAUHAUS/NEW BAUHAUS," Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444 (through Oct. 4). A selection of 79 photographic works by 30 artists who taught or studied at the Bauhaus in Germany (1919 to 1933) and the New Bauhaus in Chicago (founded in 1937), this richly informative show evokes a euphoric excitement about all the new things that could be done with photography. From Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's experiments with the photogram to Aaron Siskind's classically austere picture of industrial silos, it takes us back to one of the more exciting futures of this world-altering medium (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

THE ART GUYS, "What's the Big Idea?" Cornell DeWitt, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 695-6845 (through Oct. 4). The Art Guys are two Houstonites, Mike Galbreth and Jack Massing, who have been producing droll, Dada-like performances and objects for more than 20 years. This show includes replicated scribbles, candles with video flames, a sneaky squirting television and music emanating from overturned galvanized buckets (Johnson).

DEREK AYRES; STEPHEN BITTEROLF, ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088 (through Sept. 27). A skillful craftsman, Mr. Ayers makes wooden versions of objects that have to do with seeing: actual-size binoculars, a rifle with a sniper scope and, greatly enlarged, a microscope and a film projector. Mr. Bitterolf presents 110 paperback-size colored pencil drawings of ladybugs (Johnson).

ANDREW HAINES, George Billis, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 645-2621 (through Sept. 27). With a deft, meticulous touch, Mr. Haines paints parking lots, low-rent apartment houses, crosswalks and other distinctly unlovely sights in and around his hometown, Boston. His compact panel paintings exude a tenderly rueful, Hopperesque visual poetry (Johnson).

LINDA CARMELLA SIBIO, "The Insanity Principle," Andrew Edlin, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-9723 (through Oct. 4). Since receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia 25 years ago in college, Ms. Sibio has had a career doing performances about mental health issues at places like Franklin Furnace and the Walker Art Center. Her large, densely patterned surrealistic cartooning on paper could be the real thing -- i.e., real Outsider Art -- or it could be a pretty good imitation. That uncertainty is curious in light of the artist's psychiatric history (Johnson).

"SOJOURN," PH Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 564-4480 (through Oct. 4). Nature is a blank screen onto which we project wishful cultural fantasies, or so this five-artist show implies. It includes Eric Torborg's howling wolves and a deer made from taxidermists' armatures; Jennifer Boysen's hazy photograph on canvas of an unusual geological formation out West; Chris Kannen's ironic expressionist painting of a forest; David McBride's painted, off-register meditations on mechanical reproduction; and Drew Gilmore's trompe l'oeil stack of cast stair treads (Johnson).

"THIS IS LAGOS: YABIS NIGHT, MUSIC AND FELA," Skoto, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 352-8058 (through Sept. 20). If you crave a second fix of the charismatic Nigerian musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti after seeing "Black President" at the New Museum, Skoto is the place to go. Much of this gallery's fine summer show is devoted to vivid pictures of Fela by the Nigerian photographer Femi Bankole Osunla, who was part of Fela's inner circle from the early 1970's to the musician's death from AIDS in 1997. This work is complemented by a handsome series of color images of Africa by the American photographer Howard T. Cash, two heads sculptured by Osaretin Ighile and an altarlike installation by the young American artist Sol Sax (Cotter).

"VACATION," Spike, 547 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4100 (through Sept. 20). Innocence and experience collide in the works of Norm Magnusson, who outlines juvenile, coloring-book-style images over gridded fields of pages from pointedly selected books. Jesus offering guidance to a little boy is drawn over pages from Bulfinch's "Mythology," for example, and paper-doll clothes over "Lolita." Also on view: Buck Henri's engaging photographs of exotic dancers, old cars, mannequins, small-town parades and other subjects; Alan Schmer's illustrative paintings of farm animals; and Melissa Stern's pedestal-size figurative sculptures that blend Surrealism and primitivism (Johnson).

Other Galleries

"MIRACLE IN THE SCRAP HEAP: THE SCULPTURE OF RICHARD STANKIEWICZ," AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through Sept. 25). Welded together from scrap metal, Mr. Stankiewicz's slyly figurative semi-abstract sculptures from the mid-1950's were early warning signs that Abstract Expressionism was losing traction, and more worldly subjects, materials and ideas were bubbling up all around. His ingeniously composed works lived up to titles like "Kabuki Dancer," "Urchin," "Marionette," "Middle-Aged Couple" and "Family Portrait" with the spine-tingling accuracy of unusually art-savvy cartoons. They expanded upon Cubism, rebuked the prevailing lugubriousness of postwar sculpture and predicted many aspects of Pop and Minimalism. But they were too respectful of tradition to withstand the double-barreled onslaught of those movements. Organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., this thoughtful show is the first Stankiewicz retrospective in New York. His penchant for compositional complexity, cartoonish figuration and the calculated two-timing of the abstract and the representational seem unusually pertinent and full of possibility (Smith).

Last Chance

* BEVERLY MAYERI, Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360 (through tomorrow). A man in a T-shirt combs his hair; a woman in a green slip wrings out a washcloth; another woman braids her hair. Rendered in clay from the waist up, about three-quarters life-size, these simple yet magically lifelike figures have a look of meditative distraction. And the dry, powdery surfaces, painted in muted warm-cool hues, give them a subtle, almost iridescent luminosity (Johnson).

"ENTERTAINING AMERICA: JEWS, MOVIES AND BROADCASTING," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Sunday). Marilyn Monroe's post-conversion mezuza and her music-box menorah are part of the lineup in this bustling roundup devoted to a century of Jewish presence in the entertainment world. A star-studded revue that takes the museum more than a step into show biz, it covers the 20th century from the early nickelodeons that preceded the Hollywood film industry to recent television manifestations like "Seinfeld," by way of film and video clips, audio tapes, photographs, posters and other artifacts. There is Al Jolson in "The Jazz Singer"; excerpts from Yiddish film and radio; Betty Boop, the sassy personification of a first-generation American Jewish girl from the Lower East Side; and pamphlets railing against Jewish prominence in the movie industry. There are also 10 "star shrines" that celebrate, mostly tongue in cheek, personalities like Sammy Davis Jr., Barbra Streisand and the silent-film vamp Theda Bara (really a Jewish girl from Ohio). Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m.; Fridays, to 3 p.m. Admission: $10; $7.50, students and 65+ (Glueck).

* HELMUT FEDERLE, "Works on Paper," Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441 (through tomorrow). From the mid-1970's to the late 1990's, the Swiss-born painter Helmut Federle extended his imagery from geometricized but lush mountain peaks to the freest of signs and markings. The 200 drawings on view here trace his progress. Although the work remains in a highly reductive geometricized mode, it is sometimes quirkily dreamy and sensuous, with more than a touch of whimsy. In these 200 drawings, which gain strength from being grouped together, Mr. Federle's many and varied passes at the paper range from the precise scientific textbook rendering "Constellation" (1983) to more relaxed and painterly grids like "Untitled" (1992), in which eroded bright blue bands are dragged across a white ground. He is a great performer; even his most fragmentary wisps hold the eye (Glueck).

* "FROM EXPRESSIONISM TO THE BAUHAUS: HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART," Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 (through Monday). Borrowed from the Museum of Modern Art, this economical, powerfully resonant exhibition of German Modernist artworks from the first third of the 20th century includes Expressionist paintings by Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Mueller and Emil Nolde; mordantly satiric New Realist paintings by George Grosz and Otto Dix; and sumptuously elegant utilitarian objects by Marcel Breuer and Marianne Brandt. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Johnson).

* "IN FULL VIEW," Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-6000 (through tomorrow). A show that invites visitors on a pluralistic treasure hunt for 18 artworks that tease one's limits of visual perception. Look for Christopher Chiappa's Ford Taurus gas-tank door built into the wall; Maurizio Cattelan's roosting stuffed pigeons; Vincent Shine's tiny, gold Brancusian wasp; Jim Hodges's jewelry-chain spider web; and Charles Ray's classic "Rotating Disc" (Johnson).

* "TODAY'S MAN," John Connelly Presents, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563 (through tomorrow). This dandy group show includes some 50 small pieces by as many artists, from senior figures like Alex Katz and A. A. Bronson, to a raft of youthful prodigies. The theme, men making art about men, naturally raises expectations of a "gay" show, which "Today's Man" both is and is not. Explicit homoeroticism is all but absent. Most of the artists who are gay are too young to have experienced AIDS and the identity politics of the 1990's first hand, and have scant interest in we're-here-we're-queer declarations. A result is an unassuming, shorthand new-talent survey of some of the masculinities currently operating between the presumed opposites of gay and straight (Cotter).

Stradivarius Adds Touch to Orchestra

BYLINE:  By ANNE MIDGETTE 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
The warmth of wood is a quality you're immediately aware of in the wonderful paneled auditorium of Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. Tonight, the gala opening of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra's season, this quality seemed particularly fitting.
 Wood and its warmth have been a big issue this summer for the orchestra, which acquired a collection of 30 priceless historic stringed instruments for daily use by its players. Guadagninis, Guarneris and a remarkable 13 Stradivariuses are now raising their 300-year-old voices as part of the ensemble. There is something special about hearing Mozart played on instruments that were elderly when he was composing. 
 Do the New Jersey Symphony's strings resound more, with a new warmth, richness and depth than they did before? Do these valuable instruments give extra resonance to the players' performances and enhance the way one hears them? You bet they do.
The orchestra had plenty to celebrate tonight. While the instruments were put through their paces in smaller ensembles at a Bach festival this summer, tonight was the first time they were heard as part of the full orchestra. In addition, the orchestra had signed a new two-year contract the day before. This was a special cause for relief because the contract involved a pay cut for the musicians -- something that, in today's economic climate, is likely to figure in the contract negotiations of more and more American orchestras in coming months. Few orchestras will be able to offer their musicians as convincing a gesture of goodwill as an array of Stradivariuses.
It was, accordingly, a feel-good evening. If there was ever an occasion for lighthearted celebration, this was it, and what resulted was a happy program just a notch or two shy of a pops concert. The concert began with the final movement of Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings, to show off the instruments, played warmly, with a palpable fizz of excitement; one only wished for the whole piece rather than an excerpt. There followed the second suite from Falla's "Three-Cornered Hat," and finally Mozart's second flute concerto with James Galway: a golden flute as a counterweight to the Golden Age Collection of strings.
For such a program, depth of feeling is not at a premium, and yet Miguel Harth-Bedoya, the young Peruvian conductor, seemed almost too foursquare, too obedient, too content merely to rest on the surface and render what was before him. The Falla was energetic, but not truly rousing; the Mozart more accurate than delightful. The New Jersey Symphony's strings are its strong suit, and in Falla's dances they were tripped up a few times over the clumsier feet of their partnering winds and brass.
Sir James played some pleasant if not very idiomatic Mozart before embarking on a string of Irish encores (including a number on his trusty tin whistle) sprinkled with a crowd-pleasing dose of blarney, which revealed where his heart truly lies. This segment of The James Galway Show was an apt conclusion to a happy evening.

HEADLINE: African Nations Press for an End to Cotton Subsidies in the West 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: CANCUN, Mexico, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
The director general of the World Trade Organization said today that he would intervene to address the grievances of four poor African nations whose cotton farmers have been hurt by rich nations' farm subsidies.
 The official, Supachai Panitchpakdi, a Thai economist, broke out of conventional neutrality during the opening of world trade talks here, telling delegates there was merit in the complaint of the leaders of Benin, Mali, Chad and Burkina Faso. 
 Cotton has become a potent symbol of the inequities of the world's agricultural system. It is one of most heavily subsidized crops in the world's richest nations, which helps keep the global price low. 
African leaders say that their farmers cannot compete with the global price -- which can fall below cost -- and that they are being driven out of the market and off the land.
"Millions of peasants have failed, and without a solution today we will fall further into misery," Fatiou Akplogan, Benin's minister of commerce, said at a news conference.
Saying that their heads of state consider cotton subsidies a "grave" threat to their national security, the African ministers said cotton provided them with 10 percent of their gross domestic product, 40 percent of their exports and 70 percent of their agricultural exports.
"It is not possible for us to leave here without a resolution," Mr. Akplogan said.
In the United States, cotton farmers received $3 billion last year -- over $200 an acre. The vast bulk of their cotton is exported, prompting accusations from African and South American countries that the subsidies amount to an unfair trading practice.
Europe gives nearly $1 billion in subsidies to cotton farmers, mostly in Greece and Spain. 
The four African countries have asked for $300 million in immediate compensation for losses they are suffering on the world market. They hope to win reductions in cotton subsidies by the wealthy nations, on the road to their eventual elimination.
While the four declined to single out a country that might be asked to pay compensation, trade officials say that demand is directed at the United States.
The United States has held several private meetings with the African leaders. Peter Allgeier, the deputy United States trade representative, said he welcomed the offer of Director General Supachai to "use his good offices and find a resolution."
A new, powerful bloc of developing nations known as the Group of 21 is pressing the trade organization to give equal weight to its farm proposals, which would require deeper cuts in wealthy nations' subsidies and lowering of trade barriers. Inresponse, the United States has said trade negotiations are a two-way street and require compromises by all parties.
Brazil has already brought charges of unfair trading practices against the United Sates for its cotton subsidies.
"There is no other American crop that causes more chaos and misery around the world," said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, which collects and analyzes data on American subsidies.
In the past several years, developing countries have dropped barriers and opened their markets in the belief that free trade, not reliance on handouts, is the best way to climb out of poverty.

HEADLINE: Hastings-on-Hudson Journal; 
Shopping for the Family (It's 1,000 Miles Away)

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y., Sept. 6 

 BODY:
Pam Koner had corralled her friends and clients into contributing to her altruistic vision before.
 There were clothing drives for the needy and midnight runs into New York City to feed the homeless. There was even a request for duffel bags for boys in a nearby foster-care center who were toting their clothes in plastic garbage bags during visits home. 
 But this was on a different scale: to send a monthly box of groceries to a hungry family halfway across the country, indefinitely. The destination is Pembroke, Ill., a dusty township an hour south of Chicago and one of the country's poorest communities. 
Ms. Koner learned of the township through a newspaper article. Average per capita income is $9,642, less than half the state average, while the unemployment rate is more than five times the rate for the state, according to census figures. The town of 2,784 has no supermarket, no bank, no pharmacy and no police force.
What it does have are ramshackle houses, some with dirt floors, others without electricity or running water. And there is hunger, especially toward the end of the month when a food pantry runs low. 
"It's our nation's secret," Ms. Koner said. "This is beyond poverty in a ghetto."
It was almost a year ago on a balmy Sunday when Ms. Koner, a slight woman with delicate features and a head of loose curls, stretched out on her deck overlooking the Hudson River. She had "beautiful music" on the stereo, she recalled, and bagels and coffee and the newspaper.
The story hit her in the solar plexus. Pictured with the article was a girl eating her one meal of the day -- pasta with neck bones -- as she lay on her bed, a bare filthy mattress. "I got up and opened my sliding door and walked into the living room and said, 'I've got to do something,' " she recalled.
The idea came to her immediately. As the head of a thriving business that runs after-school programs and toddler classes, Ms. Koner has access to a large number of local families. "I said, how about if I find a family here who would adopt a family there, and all we have to do is send them food once a month," she said she remembered thinking. "It would just cover that one week a month when there wasn't enough food in the food pantry." 
The Family-to-Family program, as it is called, started last fall with just over two dozen families. There are now 64 families here and in the surrounding villages paired with 60 families in Pembroke. (A couple of the Illinois families are so large that Ms. Koner has connected them with two families in New York.) The goal: 100 families by October.
From the start, a national overnight shipping company, which has asked to remain anonymous, committed to the free delivery of all the boxes. Another company has offered to donate all the boxes. And the Food Emporium has agreed to contribute $100 in gift certificates each month.
In a nod to people's hectic lives, Ms. Koner has tried to keep the program simple. Each month, she gives the Hastings families a detailed shopping list with items like one jar of Ragu meat sauce and a five-pound bag of America's Choice rice. The total usually comes to $25. She encourages families to put in extras like shampoo, diapers, cleaners, cake mixes, instant coffee and spices. 
What makes the program so appealing for families in this comfortable Westchester suburb, Ms. Koner believes, is the direct link to a family in crisis. "That tape will be cut by that family," she said. "No one else will touch that box, and another little child's hand will reach in there."
For the people in Pembroke, and the struggling village of Hopkins Park that the township encompasses, the shipments of food and other basics are a balm.
"It's truly a blessing," said Vanessa Kizart, 33, the mother of six, in a phone interview. "At the end of the month, the food stamps are running out and the food is getting low in the house and that box comes in at the right time."
The only requirement for participants in Pembroke is that they write to the families here, ideally a few times a month. "It's more than food," said Ronald Walker Sr., the outreach minister at the Church of the Cross who oversees the food pantry. "You have the opportunity to correspond with a family you know nothing about."
Mr. Walker has written for those who are illiterate, and this month, when the families arrive to collect theirboxes, he will ask them to say a few words while he videotapes them.
In some strange way, the distance, Ms. Koner believes, allows for greater intimacy. And, she hopes that the food will feed more than hungry bodies. "The idea that people 1,000 miles away know that you exist is so profound," she said. "That just changes life's color wheel, and all of a sudden possibilities unfold." 
As publicity has spread about the program, from the local weekly newspaper here to O, the Oprah Winfrey magazine, Ms. Koner's phone keeps ringing. There are calls from Maine, Massachusetts, Kansas, Texas and Utah, from people wanting to know how they can help or start their own program.
"The most interesting part, I think, is finding the generous spirit in others," Ms. Koner said. "Little old men are calling me on the phone, saying, 'Hello, is this Pam?' It happened to me yesterday: 'Will you take a check? I read the story about you. I'm too old to shop.' "

HEADLINE: Foreigners May Not Have Liked the War, but They Financed It 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE Bush administration is not very popular overseas, at least if you believe the opinion polls. But if money could talk, it would tell a different story.
 For most of this year's second quarter, the United States was waging a war in Iraq, with help from the British and not very many others. There were demonstrations around the world against the war. 
 But guess who was financing it? The world was. Figures released this week showed that private foreign citizens bought an unprecedented $129 billion in United States government and agency securities. Official accounts, mostly central banks, added $43 billion more.
All told, foreigners bought almost 80 percent of the net increase in Treasury and agency debt during the quarter. They now own 38 percent of outstanding Treasuries, more than double the figure of a decade ago.
Those numbers came from the Federal Reserve this week, in its quarterly flow of funds report. That report tends to be ignored because it is late, voluminous and complicated. But the foreign aspect of it is extraordinarily important these days because the United States must attract so much capital from the rest of the world.
We need that capital because of the huge current account deficit this country is running. That deficit -- largely reflecting the trade deficit -- went above 5 percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter for the first time in history. The second-quarter number, when it is released Monday, is likely to be about the same.
Such deficits can be financed only by investment flows. If they are not large enough, then currency values must adjust. A few years ago, it was fashionable in some circles to argue that the growing current account deficit was a sign of American strength because it reflected just how attractive American investments were to foreigners.
That argument does not work now. In the late 1990's, most of the foreign money was going into investments that were a bet on the vibrancy of the American economy: corporate stocks and direct investment, meaning foreigners were buying companies or building plants.
A lot of those investments went bad when the bubble burst, reflecting the fact that foreigners often tend to come a bit late to parties. Someone has to buy at the top.
The really big overseas accumulations of American stocks started in 1999 and continued into 2001. The overseas investors did not turn into net sellers until the first quarter of this year, after stocks hit bottom and started to recover. In the second quarter, they bought $21 billion worth of shares, a big gain but less than a third of the amount they bought in early 2000, when the market was peaking.
The second-quarter surge in private purchases of Treasuries may reflect a bit of bubble buying as well, as plunging bond yields and rising prices attracted speculators. John Vail, senior strategist of Mizuho Securities USA, notes that Japanese investors appear to have sold Treasuries in July, as rates were rising and prices were falling.
But speculators aside, much of the foreign investment reflects the need for a place to park the dollars foreigners receive when they sell all those toys, textiles and Toyotas.
It's a nice situation while it lasts. We get cheap imports, which hold down inflation and enable consumers to buy more. The flood of foreign money helps to keep interest rates low while supporting the dollar. The war can be financed relatively cheaply at those low rates.
But borrowers may eventually need to pay attention to the views of the lenders. It would not be fun if foreigners began to invest the way they talk.

HEADLINE: High Tuition Debts And Low Pay Drain Public Interest Law 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Often saddled with huge debts taken on to pay for their legal educations, more and more law school graduates are finding it hard to work in low-paying positions as public defenders, legal aid lawyers and -- notwithstanding the popularity of "Law and Order" -- prosecutors.
 When Paula J. Clifford landed a job in the district attorney's office in Bristol County, Mass., in 1998, she was thrilled -- until she realized how difficult it would be to repay $70,000 in law school loans on her $26,000-a-year salary. 
 To make it work, she kept her college bartending job at the Chart House Restaurant on the Boston waterfront, occasionally serving drinks to defense lawyers she had faced in court. She lasted almost five years before her debts became more than she wanted to bear. 
"I had to make a life decision," said Ms. Clifford, who joined the Boston office of a prestigious firm in October. "I was 31 and living in an apartment in my parents' house, driving a car with 235,000 miles on it." 
Histories like Ms. Clifford's are becoming more common, lawyers warn. Even more than tuition at other schools, the cost of legal education has been soaring in recent years. Experts say the trend threatens a segment of the legal profession that has long depended on lawyers who are willing to give up big salaries for moral satisfaction.
The problem has prompted a debate over programs to forgive loans, to make it easier for law school graduates to take jobs serving clients with limited means who may otherwise not have access to legal representation.
"We have an enormous problem of access to justice in this country," said Curtis M. Caton, a lawyer at Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe in San Francisco. Mr. Caton is also co-chairman of a committee of the American Bar Association that recently released a study on student debt. 
Because of debt, he said, "the natural flow of talent into serving that unmet legal need area is choked off."
Law students, the study found, are leaving school with an average debt of $77,300, more than twice the sum they borrowed 10 years ago. Since 1985, tuition at law schools has tripled and in some cases quadrupled. In the same period, public interest salaries have not even doubled.
The story is harsher if inflation is taken into account. According to the National Association for Law Placement, the earnings of lawyers in private practice have risen 70 percent since 1985. Starting lawyers at many big New York firms now earn $125,000 a year. 
The starting figures for public interest lawyers have increased 12.5 percent and for government lawyers 3.5 percent.
Paul Walsh Jr., the Bristol prosecutor who was Ms. Clifford's supervisor, faults law school debt for the departure of 8 of the 60 lawyers in his office in the last year, a devastating loss, he said. 
Mr. Walsh said it was not hard to find new lawyers because many law school graduates want the experience that his office can provide. But he needs more seasoned lawyers for his office to function properly. 
"What hurts me," he said, "is losing those individuals who now have four, five or six years of experience." 
Mr. Walsh is not alone. Lawyers at an increasing number of prosecutors' offices are very young or significantly older, with few in between, several district attorneys said. That leaves the younger lawyers with fewer people to advise them on when to take difficult cases to trial, when to seek an indictment or when to take a plea agreement, lawyers said.
J. Tom Morgan, district attorney for DeKalb County, Ga., said his young prosecutors became most valuable after three years on the job. It takes a year to learn criminal procedure, Mr. Morgan said, and even more important, lawyers need to lose lesser cases so they will learn how to win the big ones. 
These days, however, they are leaving just as they are becoming competent.
"They are just getting to where they can try a moderately complex case on their own," said Lee Coggiola, chief public defender in Richland County, S.C. "They are in fact able to assist younger lawyers who are just coming in. Also, every time a lawyer leaves, we have to reassign close to 200 cases."
In some cases, undergraduate debt contributes to law graduates' problems. According to the College Board, tuition at four-year institutions has increased 159 percent in 15 years, to $18,273 from $7,048 at private colleges, and to $4,081 from $1,485 at public colleges. 
The median tuition at medical schools has increased 107 percent, to $32,675 from $15,770 at private institutions, and 168 percent, to $30,515 from $11,390 at public institutions. 
Lawyers argue that doctors already have financial incentives to work in remote or underserved areas. The Association of American Medical Colleges does not have data on average tuition covering the past 15 years. 
At law schools, tuition rose 171 percent, to $24,193 from $8,911 at private schools, and 223 percent, to $18,146 from $5,616 at public schools, and students have taken out more loans as a result.
Student debt seems to make it harder to recruit nonwhite lawyers in particular, Mr. Morgan of DeKalb County said. "They will have not only the largest law school loans," he said, "but also undergraduate loans." 
This year, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, introduced a bill that would forgive loans of law school graduates who worked in prosecutors' or public defenders' offices for three years, said H. Scott Wallace, director of defender legal services at the National Legal Aid and Defender Association in Washington.
"There's a lot of interest in extending this to legal aid lawyers and lots of other folks, as well," Mr. Wallace added.
Not everyone sympathizes with lawyers who are forced to take high-paying jobs. But supporters of programs for loan forgiveness have little time for such criticism.
"I'd rather focus on the sacrifice and the provision of a necessary service, to provide access to justice, than to get cynical about what the alternative happens to be," said Mr. Caton, who worked on the bar group's study. 
Some wealthier law schools help graduates repay loans if they take low-paying jobs, but many do not. Catholic University, for example, does not, and that is one major reason Claudia M. Vitale says she left her job at the Riverdale, Md., legal aid office to go to a private firm in Bethesda, Md. Ms. Vitale lasted almost three years as a legal aid lawyer, from July 2000 to last April, representing clients in custody disputes, domestic violence and other cases.
She took a second job at an Ann Taylor in Chevy Chase and used her employee discount to buy clothes to wear to court. Ms. Vitale took out a consumer loan, but with no prospect of a significant raise, she decided to take a job offer from a firm.
"I stayed because it was such a challenging, rewarding job," Ms. Vitale said of legal aid.
But keeping a second job and debt concerns were too much, she said, adding, "It was just impossible to continue under those conditions."
The math was equally clear for C. Christopher Flinn, an assistant district attorney in Decatur, Ga. He worked in the office there for about three years. In 2001, concerned about his young family's finances, Mr. Flinn decided to leave. He accepted an offer made over pizza at a restaurant near his office, from two friends, both of whom had also recently left. He became the fifth of his friends to leave the office in less than two years, he said. 
"I got to a point," Mr. Flinn said, "that financially it was really the only decision I could make." 
Pamela S. Wells, an assistant state's attorney in Winnebago County, Ill., held a second job at a Barnes & Noble to supplement her $29,000 salary and cope with a $60,000 debt. By day, she tried to protect children from abusive relatives and serial child molesters; by night she sold books.
For another year and a half, she worked at a nearby U.P.S. center. It paid better than the bookstore, she said, "and I was in the best physical shape of my life." 
That was not enough. Unable to make her loan payments, in 1998 she defaulted and declared bankruptcy.
"I was very ashamed," Ms. Wells said. Now, she said, she has repaid the principal on her loans and is working to rebuild her credit history.
She thought about leaving the office to work at a firm but could not bring herself to do it, she said. 
"Right now," she added, "I'm the supervisor for the child protection unit, and I've always worked on a lot of cases where kids are the victims. Sometimes it's a thankless job. But there aren't a lot of people looking out for those kids. They need a champion."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Higher in July Despite Rise in U.S. Exports 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
Record imports from China pushed the trade deficit higher in July, the Commerce Department reported today, but exports also rose in a bit of good news for manufacturers that analysts said might signal gains in the slumping economies of United States trading partners.
 The trade gap grew 0.7 percent in July, to $40.3 billion, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had expected a gap of $40.5 billion. 
 Imports of goods and services came to $126.5 billion in July, the second-highest level on record, and represented a 1.6 percent increase from June. As the economy has strengthened, so have imports of foreign-made goods.
"U.S. consumers have almost an insatiable appetite for imported goods," said Clifford Waldman, economist with Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a research group. Improvement in sales of American-made goods to other countries during the month was a hopeful sign for the worldwide economic slump and "shows that the global situation is getting a tad bit better," he said.
Exports totaled $86.1 billion in July, the strongest showing since May 2001, and a 2 percent increase from the previous month. A weaker dollar is also helping exports, making them less expensive to foreign buyers, economists said.
"Our exports improved solidly," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. "Sales of food, industrial supplies, capital goods and vehicles were all up."
Separately, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment insurance rose by a seasonally adjusted 3,000 last week, to a two-month high of 422,000. The report disappointed economists who were calling for a decline in claims and suggested that cautious companies wanted to keep their work forces lean -- discouraging news for job seekers, economists said.
America's politically sensitive trade deficit with China widened to a record $11.3 billion in July. Imports from the country totaled $13.4 billion, an all-time monthly high.
In a visit to China last week, the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, pressed the administration's case for letting China's yuan trade freely on world currency markets.
American manufacturers and other critics say that China's fixed exchange rate is protectionist and that it makes goods produced in China less expensive on world markets and makes foreign imports too costly for Chinese consumers. Critics contend that China's currency policy amounts to an unfair trade advantage and draws manufacturing jobs away from the United States.

HEADLINE: Sizing Up Snapple's Drink Deal With NewYork City 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Officials in New York City are crowing about the $166 million deal they announced with Snapple to allow the company exclusive rights to sell its beverages in public schools and in city buildings. 
 Joseph M. Perello, the city's chief marketing officer, said the city would reap significant profits on the strength of the Snapple brand. 
 "It's generating revenue and it's easing a burden on government," Mr. Perello said. "And that's freed our principals to do what they do best." 
But, according to some industry insiders, the schools portion of the agreement may be slightly below the going rate. According to the terms of the deal, Snapple, a division of Cadbury Schweppes, will be the exclusive beverage vendor for New York's 1,200 public schools for five years. The Education Department will receive a minimum of $8 million a year in commissions and sponsorship money for athletic programs. The city will receive at least $13 million a year based on sales in municipal buildings. (An additional $12 million a year will go toward advertising that promotes New York City and Snapple.)
The school rights alone work out to about $8 a year for every New York City student. That is below the average of about $25 a student that companies typically pay for exclusive rights to sell drinks in schools, according to some consultants who broker deals between beverage companies and school districts. 
Mr. Perello disputes that the city may have undervalued the deal. The $8 million figure is a minimum payment, he stressed, and higher-margin deals were traditionally linked to agreements to sell soft drinks in schools, which New York City refuses to do. The deal also prohibits Snapple from advertising in schools.
But in other respects, the $166 million is a significant escalation in the battle to secure exclusive agreements with cities and particularly schools, where companies have the opportunity to woo pint-sized consumers and retain their lifelong loyalty. 
"Its magnitude is breathtaking," said Michael Riley, the president of Public Enterprise Group, a consulting company in Huntington Beach, Calif., that helps cities negotiate soft drink deals. "Comparable deals only come out of the federal government for the Pentagon or the Department of Defense. It's certain to increase the pressure on other school systems to increase their rate of rewards on these arrangements."
Snapple's contract with New York City schools is being closely watched by school districts across the country, particularly as more districts struggle with whether to ban soft drink sales for health concerns and thereby jeopardize lucrative upfront payments and vending commissions that help augment dwindling budgets. The Snapple deal, analysts said, proves that one action does not necessarily preclude the other.
"Oftentimes the large cola players may have been the only players in there," said Michael C. Bellas, chief executive of Beverage Marketing, a market research firm. "Now they have another one to look at. Much of this was made in the noncarbonated area. These are the types of beverages that you'll see more of."
The deal also makes Snapple, primarily a juice, tea and water company, a major player in exclusive beverage contracts, heightening competition with soft drink companies like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper/7Up. But perhaps more important, Snapple's huge outlay of cash has set a precedent that is likely to take the beverage industry to another level.
Jack Belsito, the president of Snapple, said the company's deal with New York was its first exclusive contract with a school district. Snapple approached the city after hearing that it was seeking sponsorship opportunities in the spring. The company made its first pitch after the Education Department banned sales of sodas in public schools in June.
Mr. Belsito said Snapple first offered to stock school vending machines with two of its juice lines, Nantucket Nectars and Mott's Apple juice, and its bottled water line. The company eventually agreed to create a line of 100 percent fruit juice drinks to comply with the Education Department's nutritional guidelines.
Other companies, including Pepsi; Veryfine juices; Poland Spring, a unit of Nestle; and Florida's Natural, an orange juice company that is part of Citrus World, also competed for the contract, but none had the size and scope of the Snapple deal. Coke did not place a bid.
"Coke or Pepsi could do similar deals because they have brands like Tropicana, Minute Maid, Aquafina and Dasani in their portfolios," said John D. Sicher, the editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry publication. "This deal is certainly a positive for Snapple. It's also a new way of looking at school beverage deals."
Since Snapple is making a juice product that will be sold only in schools, other beverage companies are also likely to feel more pressure to customize products for schools. Coke is already marketing Swerve, a milk-based drink, that it developed solely for sale in schools.
The deal may also increase the use of consultants to broker exclusive contracts with food and beverage companies on behalf of the schools. The school brokerage business is, for the moment, a cottage industry. The Octagon Group, a sports and entertainment marketing company, represented New York schools in the Snapple deal. City officials said the consulting firm was instrumental in securing the agreement.
"I don't think this deal would have gotten where it is without Octagon," Mr. Perello said. "They played a critical role in pushing the D.O.E. to do this and together we worked to make this thing happen."
Since the late 1990's consultants have been gaining in popularity as they help schools negotiate complex deals. Both Coca-Cola Enterprises and Pepsi Bottling, the largest bottlers for Coke and Pepsi, said they did not participate in deals in which third parties, or consultants, were involved.
"We don't believe that it provides any additional value or assistance," Laura Asman, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Enterprises, said.
But beverage analysts said consultants, which have been pushing more profits in school beverage deals from cola bottlers to school districts, were here to stay.
"You're going to see more of these guys," Mr. Bellas said. "When other cities view how New York has approached, or the money brought into them, they will likely want to have that type of expertise in their dealings with beverage companies."

HEADLINE: Middle East Math 

 BODY:
No one who witnessed the first years of Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation will forget them -- the tentative embraces, the joint patrols and business ventures, the mutual visits by ordinary citizens. Tomorrow marks the 10th anniversary of the handshake and signature by Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat on the South Lawn of the White House, a luminous moment of hope that turned into a vicious tangle of mutual disdain symbolized by yesterday's ill-conceived announcement by Israel that it was planning to expel Mr. Arafat. The problem all along has been that certain things never changed -- anti-Israel terror and incitement on the Palestinian side, extensive Jewish settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by Israel. Together, they have brought the process to its knees.
 The two are not equivalent. You cannot equate blowing up children on a bus with building on land someone else considers his. But you needn't do so to recognize that the one step Israel can and must take now is to freeze the construction of settlements and dismantle the newer settler outposts. This is the necessary course not only because the American-sponsored peace plan, or road map, requires it, and not only because such a move might drive the Palestinians to do something significant on their side, like arrest or disarm a few terrorists. Ending settlement in the occupied lands is central to the survival of the Jewish state. 
 Consider the cost. At a time when Israel is suffering soaring unemployment, a slashing of welfare benefits and a crisis in its state education budget, it is devoting hundreds of millions of dollars to the roads, housing and security needed for 235,000 settlers. They enjoy mortgage subsidies, aid to build and maintain schools and clinics, and whole army units for their defense, since they are such ripe targets for terrorists.
The real argument lies in the demographics, which become crushingly clear for a state that seeks to define itself as Jewish. There are 3.2 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, with an annual growth rate of 4.2 percent, among the highest in the world. Because of impressive medical gains over the last 30 years, the infant mortality rate among Palestinians has dropped to 20 per thousand, from 70 per thousand. 
In Israel itself, there are 1.3 million Arabs and 5.4 million Jews. This means that the number of Jews and Arabs living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River -- in Israel and the occupied lands -- is approaching parity. By 2020, Jews will be a minority. The longer Israelis continue to settle in the West Bank and Gaza, the harder it will be to cleanly divide the land between two nations with separate identities. Talk of two states will end. Two options will remain: an apartheid state run by a heavily armed Jewish minority, or a new political entity without a Jewish identity.
The conclusion is clear. Israel must begin to plan its exit from the West Bank and Gaza not only to permit the creation of a viable, contiguous Palestinian state but to preserve its own future. Polls show that most Israelis understand. They do not want to drain their treasury and lose their children to protect West Bank settlements. At the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night, Senator Joseph Lieberman criticized former Gov. Howard Dean for calling on Israel to dismantle most of its settlements. "That's up to the parties in their negotiations, not for us to tell them," the senator said.
We strongly disagree. True support for Israel means helping it see through its pain and rage to its own best interest. You do not have to believe in Mr. Arafat's sincerity or the Palestinians' good will to grasp the need for a radical course shift. You need only understand the meaning of self-preservation.

 BODY:
Bank of America Executive Is Said to Have Departed
The head of Bank of America's mutual fund business, Robert H. Gordon, whose actions were highlighted in an investigation into improper trading of fund shares, has left the bank, executives who know him said.
 Mr. Gordon figured prominently in a complaint filed by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, against Canary Capital, the hedge fund run by Edward J. Stern. The complaint said that Mr. Gordon allowed Mr. Stern to trade in and out of the bank's funds quickly and improperly. Page C5. 

FirstEnergy Cites Financial Errors
FirstEnergy said that the last three financial reports it had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering its results for 2002 and for the first and second quarters of this year, were wrong. It said that each of the reports contained "certain typographical and minor computational errors." The changes were in the sections where management explains how business was affected by various events. C2.

Senate Debates New Media Rules
The Senate opened debate on a resolution that would repeal the new media ownership rules adopted three months ago by the Federal Communications Commission. Sponsors predicted the bill would be approved next week. C3.

Experts Call Snapple Deal Low
New York City officials are proud of the $166 million deal made with Snapple to give the company exclusive rights to sell its beverages in public schools and in city buildings.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE MILITARY; 
4 American Soldiers Are Wounded in 2 Battles in Iraq

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
Four American soldiers were wounded and at least two vehicles were destroyed in two attacks on military convoys today, one just west of Baghdad and the other in northern Iraq, a United States military spokesman said. 
 The gunbattles came on a day when American troops held a series of ceremonies to mark the second anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which are indirectly responsible for their presence here. The day was mostly quiet in Baghdad, and fears that terrorists would celebrate the anniversary by setting off their fifth truck bomb in Iraq in a month proved unfounded. 
 But for American soldiers, who are now facing a dozen or more attacks daily, yesterday was far from quiet. At about 2:30 p.m. in Mosul, in northern Iraq, guerrillas fired rocket-propelled grenades at an American convoy, wounding three soldiers, Sgt. Danny Martin, an American military spokesman, said. At 5 p.m. in Khaldiya, about 45 miles west of Baghdad, another attack wounded one soldier and destroyed two vehicles. In both cases, the attackers wielded rocket-propelled grenades as well as small arms, Sgt. Martin said. He said he did not know if United States soldiers had killed any guerrillas in the attacks. 
Meanwhile, American forces seized about 80 people, including foreign fighters from Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Sudan, in a series of raids in western Iraq over the past two days, two senior Pentagon officials said today.
Army air assault troops raided at least two locations in the desert southwest of Karbala stretching to the Saudi border beginning late Tuesday, the officials said. They captured a mix of Iraqis and foreign fighters, as well as about $75,000 in American cash, AK-47 assault rifles and satellite telephones, the officials said.
The Iraqis and foreigners did not put up a fight and there were no United States casualties in the operations, the officials said.
The raid is one of the largest in recent weeks. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has said the greatest threats to American troops are the remnants of Saddam Hussein's security and paramilitary forces, foreign fighters and Islamic terrorists. 
So far, 290 American troops have died in Iraq or Kuwait since the beginning of the Iraq war, including 150 since President Bush declared on May 1 that major American combat operations had ended.
Khaldiya, the site of the second attack, is in the Sunni Triangle, an area north and west of Baghdad that has been the center of resistance to the American occupation. Sunni Muslim Arabs make up one-fifth of the population of Iraq but have long dominated the country's political and economic life, and many Sunnis fear that the United States occupation may end that primacy. 
But Mosul, where the first attack took place, is in heavily Kurdish northern Iraq, which has been mostly peaceful since Mr. Hussein was removed from power. 
The attacks came as American forces in Baghdad held more than a half-dozen ceremonies to mark the Sept. 11 attacks. The anniversary memorials began at 8 a.m., midnight in New York and Washington, when a fighter jet swooped low over Baghdad, rattling windows here with a show of American might. More than a half-dozen other ceremonies followed, from prayer breakfasts to candlelight vigils. One came just before 7 p.m., when the 800th Military Police Brigade, which draws most of its members from New York City and Long Island, held an hourlong service in memory of its members' friends and relatives who had lost their lives in the attacks. 
As dusk fell on a concrete island in the middle of an artificial lake inside Victory Palace, a giant complex that once belonged to Mr. Hussein and his family but is now occupied by the Army, about 35 members of the brigade sat somberly, candles in hand, their helmets at their feet.
"We honor tonight all who died on Sept. 11, 2001," an Army chaplain said, as members of the brigade stood and named friends or relatives who had died in the attacks, and the Muslim call to prayer sounded somewhere outside the palace grounds. "Let's remember those and all of the others who have lost their lives," the chaplain said. 
Later, with the sun down and dusk turned to night, the chaplain offered a benediction. "As we seek peace and security for our nation and the people of Iraq, we ask the Prince of Peace to see us safely and guide us home." With gunshots crackling in the distance, the service ended.

HEADLINE: HSBC Gets Approval To Acquire Polish Bank 

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS 

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
The HSBC Group's planned expansion into Poland received an endorsement today as Polish banking authorities approved its proposed acquisition of the consumer lender Polski Kredyt Bank.
 HSBC, the British bank, plans to buy Polski Kredyt, which is based in Warsaw, for about 31 million Polish zlotys ($7.8 million), now that the acquisition has been approved by the Polish Commission of Banking Supervision. Polski Kredyt is now owned by a unit KBC Bank of Belgium. Although the deal is small, it brings HSBC a Polish banking charter, which it needed to go ahead with plans to make consumer loans there through its Household International subsidiary. 
 HSBC plans to start lending to Polish consumers in the fourth quarter of this year, by pairing Household with retailers. Household, which HSBC bought last year, makes loans that generally carry higher interest rates than bank loans, often to people with credit problems.
 Consumers who may not have the cash upfront to make a big purchase, like a kitchen appliance, for example, might be able to get a loan through Household at the store selling the appliance, and then take it home right away. Household already has a similar partnership with the British electronics retailer Dixon in Hungary.
 In 2004, HSBC will begin marketing credit cards and unsecured loans in Poland, the bank said in a regulatory statement to the London Stock Exchange.
 HSBC is the latest lender to expand into Poland. Citigroup and Britain's Provident Financial have both opened offices there, after years of booming growth in the late 1990's.
 Analysts welcomed the move. "In general, the idea of exporting Household's business model to other countries is an excellent one," said Sheila Garrard, an analyst for Commerzbank, because the model has been so successful in the United States. Household is the second-largest consumer finance company in America behind Citigroup, with a portfolio of $107.5 billion loans at the end of 2002.
 Consumer advocates in the United States have long criticized Household's high interest rates and some of its sales techniques. In October, Household agreed to pay a fine of $484 million to United States regulators, and change some lending practices. The company's higher rates may not get the same attention in Poland, analysts said, because financial consumer advocacy is fragmented in Europe.
 To date, foreign banks have lent to Polish consumers with mixed results. Citigroup's Polish subsidiary, Bank Handlowy, reported an 85 percent drop in net profits in the first quarter as loan defaults rose. Profits were up in the second quarter but were dampened by low foreign exchange income.
 Recession hit Poland hard last year, and jobless rates have climbed to 18 percent, while inflation has been low.
 "Consumer spending, credit cards and retail sales have been dead," and bad loans have been rising, said Callum Henderson, head of emerging market research at the economics department of Banc of America Securities in London.
 But HSBC is buying as the economy turns around. The Polish economy has slowly improved in the last two months, Mr. Henderson said, and is set to grow about 3 percent this year. "We're not going to see the 6 to 7 percent growth rates of the late 1990's," he said, "but that's not a bad thing."
 HSBC has had a small corporate and investment banking unit in Poland since 1992. A spokesman for HSBC did not specify how much it planned to invest in Poland after its acquisition of Polski Kredyt closes in the third quarter, but he said the bank expected to have 50 employees in Poland by the end of the year, up from 20.

HEADLINE: FILM IN REVIEW; 
'Dummy'

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:
Directed by Greg Pritikin
R, 90 minutes
 Greg Pritikin's "Dummy" is a mildly engaging addition to that curious sub-genre of American independent filmmaking, the whimsical comedy of Long Island alienation. It was probably Hal Hartley who initiated this cycle of lovable losers confronting soulless surburbanism in his early films "The Unbelievable Truth" (1989) and "Trust" (1990), though one of the finest examples is Eric Mendelsohn's "Judy Berlin" (1999). 
 The carefully ambiguous title of "Dummy," which opens today in New York, could refer equally to Adrien Brody's Steven, a painfully shy young man who, though now in his mid-20's, is still living with his squabbling parents (Jessica Walter and Rob Leibman) and his tragically unmarried older sister, Heidi (Illeana Douglas), or to the unnamed ventriloquist's dummy who is his alter ego and closest companion. "You look like a child molester," Heidi says when she walks in on Steven, sitting on his bed and holding the dummy on his lap.
But the dummy is no child. Speaking in a voice far more confident and commanding than Steven's own (Mr. Brody performs his own ventriloquism, and quite nicely), the dummy becomes everything Steven has wanted to be but could never become: an outspoken, independent adult. Rehearsing obsessively with his little friend, Steven slowly emerges from his shell, enough to attempt the clumsy courtship of Lorena (Vera Farmiga), his kind-faced counselor at the local unemployment office.
"Dummy" is full of infantile adults: apart from Steven and Heidi, there are Heidi's former fiance, Michael (Jared Harris), an accountant with substance-abuse problems, and Steven's fellow high school misfit, a young woman (Milla Jovovich), who has taken the name Fangora in pursuit of her career as a screaming punk rocker.
Steven turns to Fangora for tips on approaching the opposite sex. She suggests spray-painting a love note on Lorena's front door, which he does with predictably disastrous results.
The gentle childishness of the characters gives "Dummy" a genuine sweetness that turns into treacle from time to time. Fangora, who dresses up in elaborate lace and leather outfits that seem to have been stolen from Courtney Love's closet, is so desperate to put her band to work that she accepts a gig playing klezmer music at a wedding, without knowing what klezmer is. Fangora's attempt to familiarize herself and her marginally talented backup musicians with the Yiddish folk music is funny at first but becomes more tiresome each time Mr. Pritikin returns to it.
Mr. Brody's performance hardly has the weight of his Oscar-winning work in "The Pianist" (which was made after "Dummy" was filmed), but he is a likable presence, with the craning neck and goggling eyes of a just-hatched chicken.
Ms. Jovovich, who performs with a rock band in real life, turns out to be an able comedian, far more at home in farce than as the title character in Luc Besson's unfortunate "Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc." And it is always a pleasure to see Ms. Walter, who earned her place in film history as Clint Eastwood's smiling stalker in the 1973 "Play Misty for Me."
"Dummy" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some strong language and adult situations.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times; 
Baseball Still Lingers In Montreal, Somehow

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
HOW hopeful it all seemed that cool morning in 1969 when the paint was still drying in Jarry Park.
 To those of us attending the first major league game outside the United States, bilingual and faintly exotic Montreal seemed like a great place for a baseball franchise. And for nearly three decades, fans revered Rusty Staub, Gary Carter and Vladimir Guerrero. 
 Now there is a bittersweet romance to this ruined team that refuses to die. Baseball has tried to run away from Montreal, to find its next El Dorado -- Monterrey, Mexico, is currently making an interesting bid -- but Montreal is still the most likely site for the Expos next season. 
 In recent days, the Expos' players have staged an admirable little rebellion after realizing just how badly Major League Baseball set them up to fail. Rather than roam the Americas next season, the Expos are saying they will not play a split schedule without more money for themselves and their team. And good for them. 
 The Expos are currently heading home -- to Montreal, that is -- for a weekend series with the Mets, their nearest rivals for the past 34 years. There have been fights and trades and memorable series between these teams, the shortest of plane hops apart.
 Part of me wants this rivalry to go on forever, a sign of stability in a fluid world. Two years ago, Commissioner Bud Selig tried to exorcise the Minnesota Twins and their 40 years of history, only to be thwarted, embarrassingly. Just the other night, Selig admitted to having made mistakes with new franchises, presumably listless Tampa Bay. Baseball's leadership may indeed be dragging its feet until after the 2006 season, when the current labor contract expires, and baseball can legally threaten to eliminate two teams, to get down to a more viable 28. 
 Relocating the Expos makes no sense if contraction is in the air. And none of the three bidders for the Expos in the mainland United States has overwhelmed baseball with an offer. 
 Portland recently passed a bill for a new stadium but the Oregon city is of dubious size and location for a major league franchise. Northern Virginia and Washington are stuck on the concept that baseball must commit to one of them before they present a serious proposal for a new stadium. 
 This standoff creates the impression that baseball is messing with the minds of the three bidders. Washington, which has already lost two franchises in less than half a century, would threaten the litigious Peter Angelos, whose mediocre Baltimore team has lost some of its glamour at Camden Yards. 
 "Instead of one great franchise, you might have two struggling franchises," said Robert DuPuy, the president and chief operating officer of M.L.B., who is overseeing the relocation efforts. "The commissioner wrestles with that." 
 The Expos have just finished playing 22 home games in San Juan, which had its charm but was not very practical. On one road trip, the Expos had to fly from Seattle to Puerto Rico overnight (refueling in Atlanta) and play the next evening. 
 According to the preliminary 2004 schedule, Montreal is still the home of the Expos next season.
 Now comes a bid from Monterrey, the major northern Mexico industrial city with a population of 3.8 million. Its promoters talk up the wealth, culture, recreation and security as well as the handsome, modern ballpark with 120 luxury suites and 27,000 seats. Monterrey is also many air miles more favorable to baseball schedules than Puerto Rico has been. 
 The bidders for Monterrey (either a full 81 games or a 22-game split season) include Carlos Bremer, the chief executive of Value Grupo Financiero, a large financial services firm; and Jose Maiz Garcia, the owner of the stadium and the Mexican League team.
 Baseball has already shown its international outlook by putting a franchise in Montreal, then in Toronto, and by playing regular-season games in Mexico and Japan.. 
 Monterrey might be a better bet for a future franchise than Montreal, which has fallen far behind Toronto and Vancouver in the Canadian economy. And putting a major league team in Monterrey would be a fine gesture toward the grand baseball tradition in Mexico and all of Latin America. 
 While players and their families would have legitimate concerns about conditions in Monterrey, the city has already elicited considerable respect from DuPuy as well as from Gene Orza, the general counsel of the players association.
 "Monterrey is definitely a viable candidate for a split season," said Orza, who has tried to persuade the Expos to consider the option of another year with two homes. 
 The Expos are currently not amused. After contending for a wild-card spot until the last couple of weeks, they are blaming baseball for their modest budget and brutal travel schedule, as well they might. 
 On Tuesday night, the Expos' players suggested they wanted more money to keep some of their talented players. Baseball is threatening them with an even lower payroll next year, but the players can veto any split schedule -- a nice little hammer over the cavalier owners. 
 In the meantime, Montreal survives in dingy, cavernous Olympic Stadium, with its once retractable dome now welded into place. 
 "Economically, it is not viable," DuPuy said of the franchise. "It has no owner, no stadium and no television coverage."
 While Selig dithers (or stalls until 2006), there is still the chance that Montreal could somehow fall in love with the Expos all over again. Having covered the first game while the paint was drying in 1969, I confess to harboring this romantic notion.

HEADLINE: Marie Foster, Early Fighter For Voting Rights, Dies at 85 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Marie Foster, a dental technician whose quiet but effective efforts to win voting rights for blacks made her a national symbol when she was beaten by the police in the Selma, Ala., voting rights march in 1965, died on Saturday in Selma. She was 85.
 She was one of the original eight members of the Dallas County Voters League, a group that came to be called the Courageous Eight and worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders to make Selma the center of a national crusade. She was later called "the mother of the voting rights movement" by its local organizers. 
 She tried eight times to register to vote before succeeding; she had already started coaching blacks on how to pass the deliberately bewildering voter registration tests.
She was clubbed at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge when state troopers stopped the first march from Selma to Montgomery on March 7. Two days later, she tried to hobble forward in another march, one that was stopped peacefully.
On March 11, when President Lyndon B. Johnson went on national television to announce that he would send Congress a strong voting rights bill, it was in Mrs. Foster's living room that Dr. King watched and wept at the news.
When the march was finally permitted to begin on March 21, two weeks later, Mrs. Foster walked 50 miles in five days with injured knees.
In his book on the civil rights movement, "The Children" (Random House, 1998), David Halberstam called Mrs. Foster "one of the heroes of the Selma group."
Marie Priscilla Martin was born on Oct. 24, 1917, in rural Wilcox County, near Alberta, Ala. Her mother wanted her children to be educated, but her father resisted moving to town, Mrs. Foster said in a statement prepared for the Web site of the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma, which she helped found. Her mother then sneaked away and took her children to Selma.
Mrs. Foster dropped out of high school to marry and had three young children when her husband died. After working for years, she returned to high school and graduated after her daughter, Rose. She then went to junior college, became a dental hygienist and went to work for her brother, Dr. Sullivan Jackson.
She became involved in the growing voting rights movement because of anger over racial discrimination. Mr. Halberstam suggested that being employed by her brother protected her from economic pressure from the white establishment.
Working with the Dallas County Voters League, she went door to door with leaflets and asked all ministers in town to announce the registration effort from their pulpits. 
Things at first went slowly. Taylor Branch, in his book "Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-65" (Simon & Schuster, 1998), said her first nighttime class to teach literacy for the voting test drew one student, a man in his 70's.
In 1964, she was named in an injunction against voter registration leaders along with John Lewis, the civil rights leader who is now a Georgia congressman, Mr. Branch wrote. The Ku Klux Klan threatened her life several times.
In 1985, Mrs. Foster told about her experience at the bridge in an interview with United Press International.
"It was a trooper who hit me," she said, adding that it happened just as she crossed the bridge near the head of the column of about 525 demonstrators. "I lay on the pavement with my eyes closed. I didn't move. I stood my ground."
Mrs. Foster is survived by her son, James Foster of Indianapolis; her daughter, Rose Davis of Salt Lake City; her brothers, Dr. Sullivan Jackson and Thomas Martin, both of Selma; and three grandchildren.
Her activism never stopped, said Rose Sanders, a friend and civil rights lawyer. Among more recent battles, Mrs. Foster was a leader in successful fights for public housing for poor people in Selma and the removal of a statue of the founder of the Klan from a public park.
She conducted reading classes for underprivileged children in a small classroom next to her home, and made it a point to take poor children to Sunday school.
"She never quit," Ms. Sanders said.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE CAPITAL; 
A Baghdad Traffic Circle Is a Microcosm for Chaos

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Before the war, in that bygone era when Baghdad's drivers stopped for red lights and drove on the right, Kahramana Square was controlled by one traffic policeman. Now there are 12, and they were still not enough to deter the guy in the red Caprice.
 He drove from a side street up onto a sidewalk, then crossed against four lanes of oncoming cars to enter the traffic circle counterclockwise. As he wove across another six lanes of oncoming cars, a policeman named Ali Hussein Hamza dared to suggest an alternate route. This so appalled the driver that he got out of his car and administered a head butt to Mr. Hamza's forehead. 
 The head butt, which drew blood and sent the policeman to the hospital, was enough to get the man arrested -- an extraordinary experience for any driver since Operation Iraqi Freedom transformed Baghdad. On the streets here, freedom's just another word for the wildest traffic in the history of the city, and quite possibly the world.
You could think of Baghdad traffic as the perfect storm. First the rules vanished in the chaos of the invasion, when there was no electricity for stoplights and no police officers to enforce the laws.
Every intersection became a perpetual game of chicken among cars, trucks, buses and carts drawn by horses and donkeys. Every lane became potentially two-way, even on expressways, where there quickly became no distinction between entrance and exit ramps.
Then, thanks to the newly opened borders and an end to Saddam Hussein's 300 percent tax on imported automobiles, the price of cars plummeted and the streets became jammed with new imported (and unregistered) vehicles. Meanwhile, American soldiers blocked streets with temporary checkpoints and permanent barriers. To keep car bombs away from high-rise hotels and their own headquarters, the occupying forces closed major arteries in central Baghdad and a critical bridge across the Tigris. 
New Yorkers might imagine shutting down Manhattan's West Side Highway and closing the Lincoln Tunnel at rush hour and diverting all traffic through Times Square, and they would get an idea of why it takes 45 minutes to travel a block near Kahramana Square.
"This is the hardest job in Baghdad," said Mr. Hamza, an hour after the head butt the other morning, as he returned to the square with a bandage on his head. It was his third injury on the job in the past month -- his foot and his leg had each been smashed -- and he announced he was quitting. His boss, Col. Mahdi Hamoudi, sent him home to rest and promised him a transfer. 
"He's right, the job is impossible," the colonel said. "We have no authority." Before the war, he explained, traffic policemen could not only issue tickets but also impound a car on the spot.
"People knew there were courts to enforce the laws," he said. "We had respect. We had guns, too. But they were all stolen from the station by looters when the Americans came."
Colonel Hamoudi was wearing a small pistol, a personal one he had saved from the looters, but the other policemen said they could not afford to arm themselves. They complained that there was no point in issuing tickets, since so many of the cars had fake license plates. Besides all the new unregistered cars from across the border, there was also a huge number of stolen cars as a result of the recent epidemic of carjacking.
"Look at that Ali Baba," said one policeman, Muhammad Nouri Azziz, pointing to the driver of a gray BMW. "I know his face. I've seen him driving other stolen cars, too, but what can I do? No one's afraid of us anymore. We need two pistols each, like cowboys in Texas."
As Mr. Azziz dashed off to try to stop another car from entering the traffic counterclockwise, Colonel Hamoudi gripped his pistol and shook his head. "I am amazed at the way Iraqis are acting," he said. "What happened to them? This is not freedom. This is chaos."
If Baghdad traffic represents the state of nature, it confirms the philosopher Thomas Hobbes's dark view of humanity: without the iron hand of a leviathan, brutishness will prevail.
But how could civility diappear so completely? What happened to people's instinct for working out codes of conduct voluntarily, as documented by evolutionary psychologists and economic historians? 
These questions were put to Daniel Klein, an American economist who has studied both modern traffic problems and the evolution of cooperation. 
The problem in Baghdad, Dr. Klein said, is that the drivers don't have to worry about their reputations. They're constantly involved in what are called one-off transactions -- one-time meetings with strangers.
"Even when there's no law governing people, repeated interactions, especially face-to-face ones, can give rise to cooperation and eventually institutions, norms and practices that continually improve," Dr. Klein said. "But on the road people are in their own bubble, sealed off from one another, and they scarcely worry about repeated interactions." 
The only solution, then, would seem to be an appropriately Hobbesian one, and the traffic policemen at Kahramana Square have an idea inspired by the sculpture in the square. It depicts Kahramana, the Iraqi name for the maid of the original Ali Baba in the story from "The Arabian Nights."
The sculpture shows her pouring a pot of boiling oil into a jar where one of the 40 thieves is hiding.
"We should be pouring hot oil on these drivers," Mr. Azziz said. "But we need more than a pot of oil. It would take a tanker truck."

HEADLINE: Libya and France Reach Agreement on Victim Compensation 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
The families of victims killed in a 1989 terrorist attack on a French airliner said today that they had reached a preliminary agreement with Libya that would eventually provide extra financial compensation.
 The agreement clears the way for a United Nations vote on Friday to lift sanctions against the government of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. 
 This week France forced a delay in the sanctions vote to give more time for negotiations over the settlement between the families and Libya and to keep pressure on Libya to pay additional compensation to the families of the 170 victims who died when a UTA airliner blew up over Niger. With the agreement signed today, France said it would now support a vote on sanctions.
Neither side would give any details of the agreement.
"France naturally has no more opposition to the U.N. Security Council voting for the lifting of sanctions against Libya as quickly as possible in New York," Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin told a news conference this evening.
Libya had previously paid about $34 million to France in compensation, but France objected last month when Colonel Qaddafi's government agreed to pay $2.7 billion to families of victims killed in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, arguing that the UTA families should get a comparable sum.
France has said that the UTA families received only $3,000 to $30,000 each because the airline and its insurer got the bulk of the earlier award. It said it would veto any resolution to lift the sanctions imposed on Libya in the wake of the Lockerbie bombing until the country had satisfied the UTA families' demands for more equitable treatment.
Britain had pushed for a Security Council vote on the sanctions Tuesday, but the Council put off action until Friday to give France and the UTA families more time. An affirmative vote would clear the way for the families of the 270 Lockerbie victims to begin receiving compensation from Libya, which could eventually reach $10 million for each family.
There was no mention today of a final compensation figure for the UTA families, and a joint statement by the families and the Libyan charity handling negotiations for the Libyan government simply affirmed the two sides' "common will to reach a definitive agreement."
France's effort to delay the sanctions vote in support of the UTA families had annoyed British and American diplomats, who said the French objections were raised late in the process and long after they had closed the UTA case and accepted Libya's earlier payments.
But Mr. de Villepin had said that France was only doing what was fair for the families of the UTA victims, which included seven Americans and people from 16 other countries.

HEADLINE: Exploiting The Atrocity 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In my first column after 9/11, I mentioned something everyone with contacts on Capitol Hill already knew: that just days after the event, the exploitation of the atrocity for partisan political gain had already begun.
 In response, I received a torrent of outraged mail. At a time when the nation was shocked and terrified, the thought that our leaders might be that cynical was too much to bear. "How can I say that to my young son?" asked one furious e-mailer. 
 I wonder what that correspondent thinks now. Is the public -- and the news media -- finally prepared to cry foul when cynicism comes wrapped in the flag? America's political future may rest on the answer. 
The press has become a lot less shy about pointing out the administration's exploitation of 9/11, partly because that exploitation has become so crushingly obvious. As The Washington Post pointed out yesterday, in the past six weeks President Bush has invoked 9/11 not just to defend Iraq policy and argue for oil drilling in the Arctic, but in response to questions about tax cuts, unemployment, budget deficits and even campaign finance. Meanwhile, the crudity of the administration's recent propaganda efforts, from dressing the president up in a flight suit to orchestrating the ludicrously glamorized TV movie about Mr. Bush on 9/11, have set even supporters' teeth on edge.
And some stunts no longer seem feasible. Maybe it was the pressure of other commitments that kept Mr. Bush from visiting New York yesterday; but one suspects that his aides no longer think of theBig Apple as a politically safe place to visit.
Yet it's almost certainly wrong to think that the political exploitation of 9/11 and, more broadly, the administration's campaign to label critics as unpatriotic are past their peak. It may be harder for the administration to wrap itself in the flag, but it has more incentive to do so now than ever before. Where once the administration was motivated by greed, now it's driven by fear.
In the first months after 9/11, the administration's ruthless exploitation of the atrocity was a choice, not a necessity. The natural instinct of the nation to rally around its leader in times of crisis had pushed Mr. Bush into the polling stratosphere, and his re-election seemed secure. He could have governed as the uniter he claimed to be, and would probably still be wildly popular.
But Mr. Bush's advisers were greedy; they saw 9/11 as an opportunity to get everything they wanted, from another round of tax cuts, to a major weakening of the Clean Air Act, to an invasion of Iraq. And so they wrapped as much as they could in the flag.
Now it has all gone wrong. The deficit is about to go above half a trillion dollars, the economy is still losing jobs, the triumph in Iraq has turned to dust and ashes, and Mr. Bush's poll numbers are at or below their pre-9/11 levels. 
Nor can the members of this administration simply lose like gentlemen. For one thing, that's not how they operate. Furthermore, everything suggests that there are major scandals -- involving energy policy, environmental policy, Iraq contracts and cooked intelligence -- that would burst into the light of day if the current management lost its grip on power. So these people must win, at any cost.
The result, clearly, will be an ugly, bitter campaign -- probably the nastiest of modern American history. Four months ago it seemed that the 2004 campaign would be all slow-mo films of Mr. Bush in his flight suit. But at this point, it's likely to be pictures of Howard Dean or Wesley Clark that morph into Saddam Hussein. And Donald Rumsfeld has already rolled out the stab-in-the-back argument: if you criticize the administration, you're lending aid and comfort to the enemy.
This political ugliness will take its toll on policy, too. The administration's infallibility complex -- its inability to admit ever making a mistake -- will get even worse. And I disagree with those who think the administration can claim infallibility even while practicing policy flexibility: on major issues, such as taxes or Iraq, any sensible policy would too obviously be an implicit admission that previous policies had failed. 
In other words, if you thought the last two years were bad, just wait: it's about to get worse. A lot worse.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts Split the Democratic Presidential Field 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
At nearly every campaign stop, Howard Dean says most Americans would happily pay as much taxes as they paid under Bill Clinton if they could have the same economy they had in the Clinton years.
 Dr. Dean, former governor of Vermont, advocates repealing all of President Bush's tax cuts and using the money for universal health insurance, domestic security and job creation. 
 "Most middle-class people never got a tax cut from George Bush," Dr. Dean asserted last week in a debate in New Mexico with the other Democratic presidential candidates. "I'm sure they'd rather have health insurance for everybody than the $100 they got from George Bush's tax cut." 
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts takes a different tack. He would repeal the Bush tax cuts enjoyed primarily by the wealthy but would retain and possibly expand those provisions that help taxpayers of modest means, for instance the new 10 percent tax bracket and more generous child credits for parents.
"Some in my party want to balance the budget on the backs of the middle class," Mr. Kerry, who voted against all the Bush tax cuts, said on Tuesday at a day care center in downtown Baltimore. "I want to give the middle class a tax cut, not a tax increase. Too many middle-class people are getting pummeled everywhere they turn."
The tax issue is a main divide on domestic policy among the Democrats running for president. All of them call the Bush tax policies irresponsible, but they differ on what to do about them.
Like Dr. Dean, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri would repeal all the tax cuts enacted in the last three years. He would use the revenue for a multibillion-dollar program to provide health insurance for nearly all Americans. 
The president, Mr. Gephardt declared at a debate of the candidates in Baltimore on Tuesday night, "has only one idea in his head: tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, followed by tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, followed by tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans."
But like Mr. Kerry, the other Democratic candidates, perhaps taking their cue from Mr. Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign strategy, would do away only with the tax cuts for the wealthy. They emphasize the importance of maintaining tax reductions for middle-class taxpayers.
After Dr. Dean's remark at the New Mexico debate about the Bush legislation's $100 in tax relief for most, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut declared: "We've got to take back some of those high-income tax cuts, but I disagree with Governor Dean and others who would adopt so large a program that it would force an increase in middle-class taxes. That's not fair. The middle class is stressed today. They've got it up to here. And they've got more than $100, let's be honest about it."
Indeed, many middle-class people's tax cuts have amounted to no more than a few hundred dollars, hardly enough to affect their day-to-day lives. But many others have saved thousands of dollars in taxes from lower rates, new tax breaks for married couples, the larger credit for children and better benefits to workers for child care. 
The Bush administration has repeatedly emphasized the benefits of the tax cuts to the middle class and played down the proportion that go to the wealthy. In June, the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis, which has historically steered clear of partisan politics, published a list of how six families in particular circumstances benefit from the tax cuts. One example showed a couple with two children and an income of $60,000 having their taxes lowered by $1,700 (to $2,850 from $4,550), largely because of the increase in the child tax credit to $1,000 from $500.
If the provisions that are scheduled to expire at various times in this decade are instead extended, the tax cuts of the last three years will have reduced revenue and increased interest payments by a total of about $2.5 trillion in the six-year period from 2005 through 2010. Whether or not those provisions are extended, half the tax savings will be enjoyed by the 5 percent of taxpayers with the highest incomes, those of about $150,000 or more. 
Polls leave no doubt that most Democratic voters oppose the Bush tax cuts generally. But they are inconclusive on whether the Democrats would rather repeal all tax cuts or just those that mostly help the wealthy, like the lowering of the top tax rates and the reduction in taxes on dividends and capital gains.
A Washington Post/ABC News poll last spring found that 84 percent of Democrats would rather have the government spend more on "domestic programs such as education, health care and Social Security" than reduce taxes. On the other hand, a Gallup poll last month found that by 62 percent to 33 percent, Democrats preferred repealing only tax cuts "for the rich" to repealing all tax cuts.
Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is not aligned with any of the candidates, said he had no doubt that promising to protect middle-class tax relief was the better political strategy. "Any Democrat who doesn't do this will be hurt," Mr. Greenberg said.
In 1992, Mr. Greenberg was a campaign adviser to Mr. Clinton, who promised then to raise taxes on the wealthy and cut them for the middle class. After he was elected, Mr. Clinton pushed through Congress a law increasing taxes for the wealthy, but the promise to lower taxes for the middle class was abandoned.

HEADLINE: New Treasury Rule Taxes Some Insurance Policies 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department issued new tax rules yesterday that sharply reduce the appeal of a life insurance benefit that corporations have provided for decades to top executives like Martha Stewart, Ralph Lauren and Ted Turner.
 In the past, corporations paid the premiums on the insurance and the policies grew in value with minimal taxes for the executive. Now, executives will have to pay significantly more tax or, in some cases, tax and interest. 
 Previously, when executives retired, they repaid the premiums to the corporation from the cash that had accumulated. The policies still had enough cash remaining to pay for premiums for the rest of the executive's life.
Under the new rules, executives, in some cases, will be required to pay taxes on the premiums at a significantly higher rate. In others they will be required to pay the corporation interest on the premiums, as if they were loans. Should the corporation charge interest at below-market rates, the executive will be required to pay tax on the difference between the market rate and the actual interest paid.
"We're very disappointed," said Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group in Washington.
Insurers have issued tens of billions of dollars in life insurance on corporate executives and collected tens of millions of dollars in premiums. These policies are often called split-dollar policies because on paper the corporations and their executives split the benefits. That is, the corporation provides a benefit for which it is reimbursed, and the executive gets free life insurance.
Sales of these policies took a nose-dive in the summer of 2002 both because the Treasury Department was thought to be considering the changes that it announced yesterday and because corporate lawyers were concerned that the policies might be construed to violate the Corporate Responsibility Act of 2002, which banned company loans to executives.
"Nobody is writing these policies," said Robert C. Slane, president of the Wealth Transfer Group in Altamonte Springs, Fla., in an interview then.
Asked last night about the effect of the new tax rules on sales of the policies, Mr. Dolan said, "It is certainly going to be sending the insurance companies to the drawing boards, looking at how to best keep this type of benefit in place."
Treasury officials heralded the changes as closing a tax loophole. "Under these rules," said Pam Olson, the assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax, "companies cannot use split-dollar life insurance arrangements to provide tax-free compensation to their executives.
"By insuring that split-dollar arrangements are appropriately taxed, the regulations curb a backdoor form of executive compensation and promote greater transparency."
Mr. Dolan said that by imposing the tax rules on the policies, the Treasury was interfering with relations between executives and corporations. But some corporations have already begun finding different ways of providing a life insurance benefit.
At his confirmation hearing in January, John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, told the Senate Finance Committee that his former employer, CSX, had offered him a split-dollar plan. But he said he could see that the planned tax changes would reduce the value of the benefit. CSX compromised, Mr. Snow said, by giving him a lump-sum payment to buy a $25 million life insurance policy.
The new rules will take effect on Wednesday. and do not apply to existing policies.

HEADLINE: Big Hopes for Filling China's Garages 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
Canvas the top automotive executives at the Frankfurt International Motor Show about what gives them hope for their industry's future, and the answer is the same: China.
 With their home countries in the doldrums, and the outlook for 2004 scarcely better, the eyes of the world's automakers are fixed firmly on the market in China, where sales of cars and trucks are rocketing. 
 "Growth in China is absolutely amazing," said Rick Wagoner, the chairman of General Motors, in an otherwise subdued speech here on Wednesday. "The Volkswagen brand sold more vehicles during the first quarter of 2003 in China than they did in Germany. Last month, G.M. sold more vehicles in China than we did in Germany." 
 To understand what that means, consider that G.M. owns one of Germany's major car companies, Adam Opel.
 Mr. Wagoner's theme was echoed by the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, Jurgen E. Schrempp, who increasingly regards China as the cure for what ails his trans-Atlantic colossus. 
 And China is also on the mind of the chairman of BMW, Helmut Panke, who likened the company's foray there to its decision to open an assembly plant in Spartanburg, S.C., in 1994.
 It is easy to understand what is fueling the euphoria. Automobile sales in China are growing at an annual rate of more than 50 percent, compared with about 3 percent in the United States and Europe.
 By 2013, Mr. Schrempp predicted, China will be the world's second-largest car market, after the United States, with 8 percent of global sales. In trucks, where it already accounts for a quarter of worldwide demand, China will be the world's largest market within a decade.
 "The auto industry certainly hopes that China will be the cavalry pouring over the hilltop, with bugles blaring," said Garel Rhys, director of the automotive industry research institute at Cardiff University in Wales.
 But, he added, "the industry would be very foolish if they thought China was the answer to all their problems."
 Mr. Rhys said the euphoria masked a range of potential threats: too many foreign carmakers entering China, the lack of a genuine used-car market, the development of consumer credit in a country with debt-laden banks, and the simple question of whether torrid growth in China is inevitable.
 "In 1976, it was confidently predicted that Brazil would be an eight-million-car-a-year market by 1996," he said. "It didn't happen."
 As with the makers of everything from laundry detergent to cellphones, car manufacturers look at China and see a rapidly growing middle class of perhaps 400 million, with rising incomes and a taste for consumer products that will show off their newfound affluence.
 The new assembly plant of BMW in Shenyang, in northeastern China, will be equipped to turn out 30,000 5-series sedans a year. Chinese drivers, Mr. Panke noted, tend to favor cars with the most powerful engines. He expects China to become the largest market for the 12-cylinder engines of BMW.
 DaimlerChrysler signed an agreement on Monday to produce its C-class and E-class cars with a Chinese partner, the Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Company. Mercedes-Benz also has a thriving business importing its top-of-the-line S-class sedans, which can cost more than $100,000. 
 Indeed, DaimlerChrysler, like other foreign investors, wants Chinese officials to drop a regulation that requires carmakers to maintain separate distribution channels for imported and domestically produced cars.
 "Does it make sense to have separate sales channels for S-class and C-class and E-class? Absolutely not," said Eckhard Cordes, a senior DaimlerChrysler official who helped negotiate the China venture.
 Mr. Cordes, who accompanied Mr. Schrempp to a meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China earlier this week, said he was confident that the government would ultimately drop the requirement.
 The investment in trucks in China by DaimlerChrysler might prove to be as important as its venture in cars. It agreed to buy a stake in Beiqi Futian, a Chinese truckmaker that is controlled by Beijing Automotive.
 The venture, Mr. Cordes said, would allow DaimlerChrysler to produce a full range of commercial vehicles, from the relativelysimple trucks of Futian to the sophisticated ones of Mercedes. As China's economy develops, he expects buyers to gravitate to the Mercedes end of the market.
 "The trucks you see today in China are the trucks we made 30 or 40 years ago," Mr. Cordes said.
 DaimlerChrysler will also be helped by the emphasis of China on roads, not railway lines, as a way to open its vast hinterland. That will make trucks and buses the main means of moving people and goods.
 To some extent, DaimlerChrysler is playing catch-up in China. Most of the global carmakers already have joint ventures there. Volkswagen, an early entrant, controls nearly half the Chinese passenger car market, and is well represented in the luxury range by its Audi brand. 
 General Motors, which has an assembly plant in the Pudong industrial park next to Shanghai, has had success selling its Buick Regal sedan to Communist Party officials and executives at state-run enterprises.
 Even Rolls-Royce, the venerable British carmaker owned by BMW, has set up dealers in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern city of Guangzhou to handle sales of its new Phantom, which retails for $330,000. 
 Not every company is joining the eastward march. Renault, the French carmaker, is content to sit on the sidelines for now. The chairman of Renault, Louis Schweitzer, told reporters here that he would decide by next spring whether to make a major investment in China.
 Renault has a big presence in Asia through its 44 percent stake in Nissan Motor of Japan. But it has struggled in other countries, notably Brazil. And the China market is every bit as crowded as Brazil's.
 "With everyone rushing into China, there's not a lot of visibility right now," Mr. Schweitzer said.

HEADLINE: Argentine Deal Is Likely to Be One of a Kind 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
After the International Monetary Fund's agreement to help Argentina raise itself from its economic sickbed without having to follow a full fiscal discipline regime, could other debtors in the region be tempted to adopt a tougher stance with the fund?
 In neighboring Brazil, where orthodox policies have stifled inflation and stabilized markets, a debate has already started as to whether the country needs to renew its current $30 billion package with the fund that expires in December. 
 The administration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has indicated that he would want a new deal only on more favorable conditions, and the finance minister, Antonio Palocci, said last week that any new deal with the fund should allow the government to increase spending on social needs and infrastructure.
 In Ecuador, meanwhile, the authorities could be forgiven for wondering why the fund is demanding more belt-tightening from them than from Argentina. 
 But analysts say that the Argentine deal was probably a one-time thing. 
 Brazil has the clout -- it is a big enough debtor -- to play hardball with the fund, though it probably would not, analysts said. Smaller debtors like Ecuador, though, simply do not have the leverage to extract concessions from the I.M.F.
As the dust settled today, most analysts agreed that the pact announced on Wednesday night by President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina and the monetary fund's managing director, Horst Kohler, was a victory for Argentina.
 Argentina said today that it had repaid about $3 billion in defaulted debt to the International Monetary Fund, according to Reuters. That default on Tuesday was the biggest single missed payment in the monetary fund's history.
 After being abandoned by the fund as its economy collapsed in late 2001, Argentina felt justified in resolutely refusing to make a series of concessions that negotiators for the monetary fund wanted in exchange for refinancing $21.6 billion in debt that Argentina owes multilateral institutions over the next three years.
 Argentina's requirements, considered less than orthodox by Wall Street, included limiting its budget surplus to 3 percent of gross domestic product next year, while leaving goals for the following two years open to further negotiation. By contrast, Ecuador's fund-set surplus goal this year is 5 percent, while Brazil is aiming for 4.25 percent.
 The deal also failed to lock in, as the fund had wanted, compensation for banks and largely foreign-owned utilities operating in Argentina that were hard hit by last year's sharp devaluation of the peso.
 "Did the I.M.F. cave in? Yes and no," said John Welch, chief Latin American economist at WestLB in New York. "But on these issues it certainly did."
 Mr. Welch points out that a 3 percent surplus, by Argentine standards, is gargantuan. Before Argentina defaulted on its private debt in 2002, it had not ended the year with excess cash since 1993, and that surplus was a meager 1 percent, he said.
 Mr. Welch said he doubted that other countries would follow Argentina's lead because there are very few debtors of that magnitude.
 Brazil's left-leaning government is debating whether it needs another agreement, not out of any animosity to the fund -- although that does exist in some quarters of Mr. da Silva's Workers Party -- but because it feels it has proven its economic credentials by putting prudent economic policies into effect.
 Two former heads of Brazil's central bank, Arminio Fraga and Gustavo Franco, have both said recently that the country no longer needs to prop itself up with monetary fund cash, and many analysts agree.
 "Brazil is light-years ahead of where the Argentines are," said Doug Smith, chief economist for the Americas at Standard Chartered in New York. "They have developed this credibility by themselves."
 "These days nobody has a bad word to say about Brazil," he said, "so why put that in jeopardy?"
 And although Mr. Kohler said in a statement last night that the fund would work hard not only to help Argentina grow, but also to reduce poverty, analysts said that did not mean the fund was suddenly going to start condoning nonorthodox economic policies in poor countries.
 "The United States and the G-7 in general ultimately didn't want to have to be bothered with another international crisis, albeit economic rather than military," Mr. Smith at Standard Chartered said. "I think the deal was done in a fairly unique set of circumstances."

HEADLINE: Soft Voice Urges Europe to Carry A Bigger Stick 

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
Tzvetan Todorov is something of an outsider in French intellectual circles. Born in Bulgaria on the eve of World War II, he was raised and educated under a Stalinist regime before moving to France in 1963. He is married to the Canadian novelist Nancy Huston, and he frequently lectures at American universities. His life has required him to see the world from different angles. As a social critic, historian and moral philosopher, he is a man of nuances.
 In joining the debate about the state of trans-Atlantic relations, Mr. Todorov has therefore done so not as a French academic -- he is director of research at the prestigious National Center of Scientific Research here -- but as a European who is as alarmed by the unilateralist approach of the Bush administration as by the reluctance of Europe to take the necessary measures to defend its own interests. 
 Indeed, the most radical recommendation of his new book, "The New World Disorder: Reflections of a European," is that Europe should abandon its "pacifism and passivity" and rearm. He celebrates the fact that war is no longer possible within Europe. "But the whole world has not been pacified," he said in an interview in his Left Bank home. "Our potential enemies are no longer inside Europe. We must join forces to defend ourselves against these external enemies."
In that sense, Mr. Todorov shares the diagnosis of Europe's basic dilemma -- that its "soft" power of diplomacy, foreign aid and multilateralism can be effective only if twinned with "hard" military power -- that was offered by Robert Kagan in a much-debated article last year in the Hoover Institution's Policy Review, later expanded and published as a book, "Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order" (Knopf).
"The New World Disorder" is one of several new French books to address the current global crisis. In "West Versus West," the French philosopher Andre Glucksmann offers a strong defense of Washington's invasion of Iraq. And in another, "In the Name of the Other: Reflections on the Coming Anti-Semitism," Alain Finkielkraut warns that anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism are becoming synonymous in some parts of the world. 
What perhaps distinguishes Mr. Todorov's book, though, is its lack of stridency. Even in print, his voice is soft. A prolific author, he has covered a vast spectrum of theoretical and historical subjects in his books, ranging from literary criticism to essays about Soviet-era concentration camps in Bulgaria and about how Bulgaria's Jews were in the main saved from Nazi slaughter. In this book, his first to address today's world, he again tries to apply reason over emotion.
"You cannot place immediate contentment before everything else," Mr. Todorov said, echoing Mr. Kagan's view that Europe's concern for preserving its "paradise" -- its comfortable way of life -- had made it insular and ineffective as a global political force. "You must be able to defend your values."
But the logic of adding a unified army to the European Union's continuing economic and political integration is accepted more in theory than in practice. Not only has the United States viewed sporadic European efforts to create an independent defense capability as threats to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but Europe's leading powers -- notably Britain, France and Germany -- have shown little readiness to surrender sovereignty in this area.
"It's a bit like the French countryside," Mr. Todorov said with a smile. "The mayor of one small village will never agree to fuse with a neighboring village to be more efficient and have more resources, because one of the two mayors will lose the status of Monsieur le Maire. At the level of governments, it's equally ridiculous."
In analyzing American national interests in the post-cold war era, Mr. Todorov takes the long view. "We have gone from the world of George Orwell, where large empires confronted each other, to the universe of Ian Fleming and James Bond, where a megalomaniac billionaire hidden in a cave sends planes against American cities," he said, referring to the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001.
But while this represents a major change, he believes that Washington's response has not served the best interests of the United States. He has the advantage that his book was completed after the American and British occupation of Iraq and, like many on both sides of the Atlantic, he now worries that "terrorism has been strengthened since the Iraq invasion, instead of being reduced."
But his principal reason for opposing the intervention in Iraq was that it lacked the legitimacy of, say, the 1991 Iraq war or the ouster of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. And it is this, more than anything, he believes, that has fed anti-Americanism: "It seems to me that Washington does not care enough today to give legitimacy to its acts in the eyes of the world."
While the United States has traditionally oscillated between isolationism and a desire to manage the affairs of the world, he said, what is new is the combination of self-righteousness and extraordinary military power. 
But this approach, designed by what he calls the dominant "neo-fundamentalist" group in Washington, is doomed, he believes: "This mission of extirpating evil, of imposing good by force, is a policy that more closely resembles that of communism or the permanent revolution than a liberal agenda. For me, 'liberal imperialism' is a contradiction. One cannot impose the liberal spirit by force, one cannot impose freedom at the point of a bayonet."
More relevantly, he argues, the United States lacks the will to intervene everywhere that freedom is threatened. "It intervenes only in certain cases that coincide with its clearly defined interests," he said. "This means that in the eyes of the world it intervenes to defend its interests, not to defend justice. But an empire cannot maintain itself only through force of arms. It also needs to impose itself through legitimacy."
Mr. Todorov accepts that there are occasions when the use of force is necessary, but he notes that the West did not intervene to halt the two greatest genocides since World War II, in Cambodia and Rwanda. More often, he added, other forms of pressure on a repressive regime are more effective and less dangerous, not least the containment policy used by the West against the Soviet Union. But for this, he believes, it is better for the United States to work hand in hand with a Europe that can also defend Western values and interests.
Before this can happen, though, Europe must become what he calls a "quiet power." And he sees this occurring as Europe moves closer to political integration, starting perhaps with a small "hard core" group of nations unifying their armies. "It need not rival the United States," he said. "The United States should be its privileged ally. But it also need not be submissive to the United States."

HEADLINE: Revenue in Key Line Falls, And Oracle's Shares Slide 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Oracle unnerved Wall Street yesterday by reporting that revenue from licenses for new software fell 6.7 percent, to $525 million in its first quarter from the period a year ago.
 Most analysts had been expecting gains of at least 5 percent. Oracle had projected growth in revenue from licenses for new software of 2 percent to 12 percent, after reversing a long trend of declines with a gain in the previous quarter. 
 Investors sent Oracle shares lower on the news. The stock fell 43 cents, or 3 percent, to $12.55 in regular trading. The company, based in Redwood City, Calif., released the earnings, for the quarter that ended Aug. 31, before trading began. 
Oracle attributed the disappointment to unexpectedly slow sales in August and the disruptions from reorganizing its North American sales force.
But investors, who had been looking to Oracle for confirmation that the technology sector was gaining strength, spread their disappointment around by selling other major technology stocks.
Despite the decline in new software licenses, Oracle did well enough with its existing client base to achieve revenue of $2.07 billion, which was less than the $2.14 billion consensus projection from analysts polled by Thomson First Call, but up 2.2 percent from the $2.03 billion in the quarter a year ago. 
Oracle reported that net income rose 28 percent, to $440 million, or 8 cents a diluted share, in line with the analysts' consensus estimate. Much of the gain reflected the accounting for Oracle's investment in Liberate Technologies, which sells software to the cable television industry. Oracle sold its stake in Liberate in June.
Income from operations was $616 million for the quarter, up just 6.2 percent from a year ago. Analysts said that Oracle appeared to have done a good job of managing costs. Oracle's operating margin edged up to 30 percent from 29 percent a year ago.
In a conference call, Jeffrey O. Henley, the chief financial officer, dismissed suggestions that the company might have been distracted during the quarter by its hostile offer to take over PeopleSoft.
Oracle raised its offer for PeopleSoft in June to $19.50 a share -- roughly $6.3 billion -- as part of its unsuccessful effort to disrupt PeopleSoft's acquisition of J. D. Edwards. The PeopleSoft offer is under scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the United States and Europe.
Oracle's greatest weakness in the quarter appeared to be in its traditional database business, where it competes with I.B.M. and Microsoft. License revenue for that unit was down 7 percent from a year ago, to $408 million. 
Oracle's other software products had new license revenue of $102 million, down 4 percent from the quarter in 2002.
North America was clearly the trouble spot. New-license revenue was down 19 percent from a year ago.
Jason Maynard, an analyst who follows the company for Merrill Lynch, said that Oracle appeared to be under greater pressure to cut prices than he had believed. Mr. Maynard and other analysts said that the results would put Oracle under intense pressure to show growth in the current quarter.
Mr. Henley said yesterday that the license revenues could increase up to 7 percent, assuming moderate growth in the economy. The bottom end of his projected range for this quarter -- a decline of 3 percent -- was taken as a gloomy indicator by Wall Street.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
2 International Giants in Aluminum Agree to Merge in a $4.5 Billion Deal

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
Alcan, the world's second-largest aluminum company, won the support of Pechiney of France today for a $4.5 billion merger that will form the world's largest aluminum company by revenue.
 Alcan, based in Montreal, made a complex cash-and-stock offer that Pechiney said valued its stock at as much as 48.50 euros a share ($54.36), or about 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion). Alcan's offer is worth 47.5 euros, 24.60 euros of that in cash, for each Pechiney share, plus a bonus of 1 euro if Alcan obtains more than 95 percent of the outstanding shares. 
 Alcan, which made its first bid in July, agreed to this price after Pechiney's chief executive, Jean-Pierre Rodier, rebuffed a second takeover offer last week of 47 euros a share, terming it inadequate. 
Alcan's chief executive, Travis Engen, has spent considerable time in Europe this summer discussing the possible deal with Mr. Rodier; price was the sticking point.
At a hastily convened meeting, Pechiney's board voted to recommend the latest offer, saying that it "constitutes the best value alternative available to Pechiney shareholders."
Pechiney's shares closed up 0.39 euro in Paris, less than 1 percent, to 46.65 euros, and Alcan was up in New York $2.25, or 6.4 percent, at $37.24.
An analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, Russell Skirrow, shifted his recommendation on Pechiney from neutral to sell.
While Alcan shareholders would "reap the benefits of the cost and revenue synergies from the deal," Mr. Skirrow wrote in a note to clients, Pechiney shareholders faced possible antitrust complications in Europe and partial payment in Alcan stock, which he called a "high-risk strategy."
If the deal is completed, the combined companies would have annual revenue of almost $24 billion and 88,000 employees around the world, creating a huge global competitor for Alcoa, the world's oldest and until now largest aluminum company, which had revenue last year of $20.3 billion.
But the combined aluminum production of Alcan and Pechiney would lag behind that of Alcoa, which is based in Pittsburgh. The new entity would have a total production of 3.3 million metric tons, compared with 3.5 million metric tons at Alcoa last year. 
Alcan's takeover of Pechiney comes as the aluminum industry is struggling to emerge from a slump that has lasted almost two years. Oversupply has forced prices for raw aluminum and finished products down, while inventories have climbed, as aluminum users scale back purchases because of a generally slow global economy. Aluminum prices are about $1,600 a ton, down from a peak of $2,200 in 1995.
The slide in price and demand has already prompted several takeovers and mergers.
Last year, the Norwegian conglomerate Norsk Hydro, Europe's largest aluminum company, spent 3.1 billion euros to acquire the VAW aluminum unit of the German utility E.ON; in 2000, Alcoa paid $5.8 billion to merge with the Reynolds Metal Company.
Today's deal brings together companies that were at the heart of efforts in 1999 to achieve a three-way merger of Alcan, Pechiney and the aluminum division of the big Swiss conglomerate Alusuisse Lonza, known as Algroup.
When that merger deal was blocked by European antitrust regulators, Alcan went on by itself to acquire Algroup. Today's deal to add Pechiney would complete the original plan.
Alcan executives have said they expect that combining the two companies will produce around $250 million in cost savings, a number that some analysts have said is too low. The executives also said that they expected antitrust problems to be minimal.
Last week, the French government ruled it would not block the deal, even though Pechiney is a major supplier to French military contractors and supplies roughly half the needs of the Airbus aircraft group. European antitrust authorities are expected to rule on the deal by Sept. 29.
The principal benefits to the combined companies, said David Kerans, an analyst at Argus Research in New York, would come from economies of scale, merged research and development, and increased power to deal with large customers.
The principal challenge, he said, would be for Alcoa, since "it is not clear to me that any reduction of capacity is going to be produced."
Alcan gave assurances in July that it was willing to sell its interests in one of two rolling mills in Germany and eastern France if the European Union antitrust authorities require it.
An unwillingness to do so scuttled the three-way merger plan three years ago. But Mr. Kerans said such divestitures were not crucial to the success of the merger.
Other problem areas would be minimal. Pechiney's main attractions are its highly regarded aluminum smelting technology and a strong position in the aerospace market, where it is a major supplier to both Airbus and Boeing.
Mr. Engen, Alcan's chief executive, said Pechiney's decision to accept the latest offer "confirms a long-held view that this combination of Alcan and Pechiney presents the strongest industrial and business opportunity for Pechiney stakeholders."
Pechiney's board, in its statement, said: "The board of directors is pleased that this combination would allow Pechiney's employees to contribute to a global leader in aluminum and packaging activities."
The offer will be presented by Tuesday to European and American stock market officials and antitrust regulators, the statement from Alcan said.

HEADLINE: Pan Am 103's Bereaved Watch U.N. Lift Libya Sanctions 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
For John Zwynenburg, the Security Council's 13-to-0 vote today to lift United Nations sanctions on Libya was neither a triumphant moment nor an angry one. "It's another burial of my boy," he said quietly, as the 13 aye votes and two abstentions, by the United States and France, were tallied inside the lofty chamber.
 His son, Mark, a 29-year-old investment banker with Goldman, Sachs, was killed along with 269 other people on Dec. 21, 1988, when a Libyan bomb blew Pan Am Flight 103 apart over Lockerbie, Scotland. Until the destruction of the World Trade Center, that bombing was, for most Americans, the signature act of international terrorism. 
 Mr. Zwynenburg, of West Nyack, N.Y., sat in the Security Council gallery with about 30 other family members of Pan Am 103 victims. Like witnesses at a courthouse sentencing, they gazed sternly ahead as resolution 1506, lifting the sanctions, was made official.
"I was here when the original resolution was adopted in 1992," Mr. Zwynenburg said. "My son was involved in the model U.N. in college." His whisper grew softer as he then said he was burying his son again.
The families of the victims have lobbied for years, first for fixing responsibility, then for punishing the guilty. The United Nations sanctions against Libya were suspended after Tripoli, in 1999, turned over two suspects to a Scottish court. One, a military intelligence official, was convicted and the other, a Libyan airline executive, was acquitted.
"Would I have preferred military action immediately after it happened? Yes," said Kathleen Flynn of Montville, N.J., who lost her son, 21-year-old J. P. Flynn. After the vote, she repeated words of vindication that have become a mantra among the families, "We brought the Libyan dictator to his knees." That was a reference to the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
The Council vote, originally expected three weeks ago, was postponed in the face of a French veto threat. The French ambassador, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, said this week that Paris was pressing the Libyans to increase their payments to the families of 170 people aboard a French airliner destroyed by a Libyan bomb over Niger.
The French said a deal was reached Thursday between the families of those victims and the Qaddafi Foundation, named for the Libyan leader. Mr. de la Sabliere explained after the vote that he abstained to ensure Libyan commitments "are rapidly implemented."
Complying with United Nations demands, Libya took responsibility last month for the actions of its officials and agreed to pay $2.7 billion, which will mean up to $10 million to the families of each Pan Am victim. 
James B. Cunningham, the deputy United States ambassador, said Washington would not block the resolution and the resulting financial awards. But he said the United States had abstained because of Libya's "poor human rights record," and "its history of involvement in terrorism, and -- most important -- its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery." Washington's sanctions against Libya, he said, remain "in full force."

HEADLINE: Computer Use Limited for Accused Hacker Free on Bond 

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
A federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that a man accused of breaking into the computer network of The New York Times may remain free on $250,000 bond and must continue to restrict his use of computers.
 The man, Adrian Lamo, 22, was released on similar conditions earlier in the week by a federal court in Sacramento, where he surrendered to the authorities. 
 That court had banned Mr. Lamo from using computers at all. In Manhattan yesterday, Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman of Federal District Court extended that ban but said Mr. Lamo could send e-mail messages or use computers in connection with finding a job or educational training. 
She noted that the restrictions might have to be modified if Mr. Lamo enrolled in an educational program that required the use of a computer. "I don't know what will actually happen," Judge Freeman said, "but I can envision computer research as part of a lot of courses these days." She also ordered that he stay with his parents in California.
In court, Mr. Lamo sat quietly, speaking only to acknowledge his rights. He did not enter a plea. On a court financial disclosure form, he wrote that he was unemployed and listed his only asset as $50 in cash.
After the hearing, he did not comment, at the direction of his lawyer, Sean Hecker, a federal public defender. But in earlier interviews, Mr. Lamo, a well-known personality in the online world of computer hackers, has defended his actions and disputed some aspects of the charges against him.
"I don't think that I've done anything wrong," he said before his surrender, in a Sept. 5 interview on "The Screen Savers" on the cable channel TechTV. He added, "I hope the people out there considering their own courses in life will not let the people who want to criminalize curiosity let them stop what they want to do."
Prosecutors have charged Mr. Lamo with breaking into a computer without permission and recklessly causing damage and with using unauthorized access devices -- that is, user identifications and passwords.
The government has said that after breaking into The Times's computers, Mr. Lamo created fictitious user names and unauthorized accounts with LexisNexis, an online provider of legal and other databases.
Mr. Lamo "obtained LexisNexis search services valued in excess of $300,000," the complaint said. It also said that The Times had found in an internal investigation that during three months in 2002 an intruder had conducted more than 3,000 LexisNexis searches.
The $300,000 figure has been challenged by Mr. Lamo and may become an issue in the case, said one legal expert, Mark D. Rasch, a former federal computer crimes prosecutor who works for an Internet security company in Virginia. The amount is significant, because if Mr. Lamo is convicted, the higher the loss, the longer his sentence could be.
In an interview posted Wednesday on SecurityFocus.com, Mr. Lamo said he believed that the figure had "no basis in fact." He said: "I don't know what method they used to calculate their damage estimates, but I believe the truth will come out in trial."
The complaint cites LexisNexis as the source of the $300,000 figure for lost "search services," but does not say how it was calculated, or whether The Times incurred any actual financial losses. Mr. Rasch said that some companies have flat-fee arrangements with LexisNexis that generally allow unlimited searches. The Times and LexisNexis declined to disclose the precise terms of their contract.

HEADLINE: GROUND ZERO: THE SITE; 
Ground Zero Plan Seems to Circle Back

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
When the revised master plan for the rebuilding of the World Trade Center is released this month, it will include scores of changes to Daniel Libeskind's design, both major alterations and minor refinements, many of them never before seen in public.
 The plan will retain its signature elements -- the recessed memorial area, the 1,776-foot spire that will be taller than the original towers, and a grand new transportation terminal. But other features will come into sharper focus, like a giant waterfall that has so far attracted scant attention and shrinking "urban parks" that in reality are little more than streets with flower beds. 
 The secretive evolution of the plan contrasts sharply with the continuing portrayal of the rebuilding process as one of the most open and inclusive civic building projects in memory. Government officials, architects, civic groups and developers still speak in awestruck tones about the town hall meeting in the summer of 2002, when more than 4,000 New Yorkers spent hours discussing, of all things, urban planning. 
Ever since, the officials overseeing the rebuilding effort have congratulated themselves for their courage to go back to the drawing board after the public rejected the original six designs for the site. And they have cited that process for their defense of the Libeskind plan from mutations that would rob it of its singularity. 
"It was the aggressive outreach to a broader public that resulted in the consensus behind this plan," Gov. George E. Pataki said in an interview last month.
As much as the Libeskind plan evolved by the will of the public, however, it also turned on the political needs of Mr. Pataki, who was running for re-election last fall. The governor's decrees, like his early declaration under pressure from victims' families that the footprints of the towers be preserved as a memorial, sometimes created public opinion as much as reflected it.
Mr. Libeskind's plan, for all its ingenious originality, was just as prized for its flexibility. There also were financial considerations: The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the owner of the trade center, wanted to guarantee its revenues from the site, and its leaseholder, the developer Larry A. Silverstein, stood alone in his ability to pay for the rebuilding, thanks to his control of the twin towers insurance money.
Though the new master plan could be further revised in the environmental impact review, by most accounts it will be superior to that of the World Trade Center design of the 1970's. It will reconnect neighborhoods that were split apart by the original project and provide a somber memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attack.
In the minds of some officials, though, it also seems reminiscent of a design rejected by the thousands of citizen planners who packed that July 2002 town hall meeting in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.

Politics of the Memorial
Months before that huge meeting, rebuilding officials knew that almost all the decisions about the site would be driven by the memorial to the victims of the Sept. 11 attack, leaving few options for its basic design.
In early 2002, Louis R. Tomson, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, and others advised Mr. Pataki that the most sensible plan was to re-establish Fulton and Greenwich Streets through the site. That would carve the property into quadrants, saving the largest section -- the southwest corner, where the towers had stood for some 30 years -- for a memorial. The restored streets would physically separate the memorial from the remaining nine acres, which could then be used for office space and the rail connections that carried commuters to the financial district.
"It was pretty obvious where the memorial was going," Mr. Tomson said in an interview last month. "And it was clear we were going to put the rail station where the rails are."
The proposal would satisfy several critical constituencies: the victims' relatives, who wanted significant space for a memorial; neighborhood residents and architects, who wanted to break up the much-lamented 16-acre superblock; and the Port Authority, which wanted to keep receiving $120 million in annual rents from the site. 
By doing so, it would help to fulfill another significant goal: muting any significant controversy over the ground zero project that could disrupt Mr. Pataki's re-election campaign. 
When development officials unveiled the six original proposals, all of them had streets and pedestrian walkways running through the site, and four preserved the footprints of the towers for a memorial. It quickly became evident, however, that the Port Authority's goal of rebuilding all 10 million square feet of lost office space was fundamentally incompatible with leaving so much open space.
"We all knew from the beginning that you can't take half of the site away and put the same bulk back," said Alexander Garvin, who was then the director of planning, design and development for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. 
Even Beyer Blinder Belle, the architecture firm that created most of the six designs, told the Port Authority as much. And the thousands of private citizens at the Javits Center said it even more loudly.
But the rough outlines of some rejected designs seem to have endured. One in particular, called Memorial Plaza, included an eye-catching tower at one corner, topped by a huge television antenna, and a large, open memorial space including the tower footprints. Long-absent streets were re-established through the middle of the former superblock, and a row of office buildings joined with the tower in an L-shaped formation around the memorial.
Mr. Libeskind and Mr. Garvin reject the similarity as coincidental at best. But Joseph Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority, sees it differently. "When we roll it out," he said, "the land-use plan is going to be almost exactly what Beyer Blinder Belle proposed."
To address the perceived shortcomings in the early proposals, in August 2002 the development corporation called for the world's most prominent architects to think grandly about the future of ground zero.
Port Authority officials were livid at the development corporation's attempt to establish its own design for what the authority saw as its site, so the call for entries deliberately stated: "This is not a design competition and will not result in the selection of a final plan."
Still, Kevin Rampe, who succeeded Mr. Tomson as president of the development corporation, said the project evolved into a full-blown competition because of "the prestige of the architects involved and what they did in exhibiting their plans."
"They ignored the rules and did what they did best," Mr. Rampe said. "I don't think any of them thought about whether it was a competition of ideas or a competition of plans."
In December, the agency unveiled nine plans from seven groups of architects at the World Financial Center's Winter Garden. First to present was Mr. Libeskind. When he finished, applause echoed through the Winter Garden. None of the eight plans that followed received as great a response.
It was not an accident that Mr. Libeskind was the first to present his design, officials said later. As the design teams met with rebuilding officials every two weeks during the competition, they said, it became clear that Mr. Libeskind's "Memory Foundations" was the plan to beat.
When the public weighed in, it favored Sir Norman Foster's "kissing towers," which evoked the original twin towers but left little room for a restored street grid. In the minds of the officials, however, the only feasible alternatives were the World Cultural Center, by the Think team, which included Rafael Vinoly and Frederic Schwartz, and a design by Peterson/Littenberg Architecture and Design. Peterson/Littenberg hurt its cause when Barbara Littenberg, one of the principals, criticized the design competition and rebuilding officials at a public forum, infuriating Mr. Tomson and others.

And Then There Were Two
The competition was soon whittled down to Mr. Libeskind and Think. Yet the final decision was made less by consensus or by appeal to the public, than by fiat, born of indignation. 
The two teams approached the final weeks of the competition in very different ways, which had significant bearing on their fortunes. The Think team spent nearly all of its time working on the elaborate engineering of its cultural towers, twin cylinders of scaffolding within which multiple buildings and viewing platforms would be suspended. 
Mr. Libeskind, meanwhile, spent several days cloistered with Port Authority officials, working to satisfy their desires for underground parking and mechanical systems.
"The genius of Daniel Libeskind," said Mr. Seymour, the Port Authority official, "is that he worked hard with us to understand all the engineering and transportation elements on the site. He showed his flexibility."
For example, Mr. Libeskind agreed to raise the floor of the memorial site from 70 feet below ground level to 30 feet, allowing for the bracing of the foundation walls and an expanded train station and pedestrian concourses below the memorial. 
When the two teams made presentations in late February to the officials who would choose the winner, nearly all of the Think team's time was spent explaining the engineering of its towers. Mr. Libeskind, however, reprised his stirring monologue portraying his design as the embodiment of America's hopes and dreams.
The day before the architects made their final pitches, a committee of development corporation directors had recommended that the Think team's design be chosen, and one committee member told The New York Times, "We don't expect anyone to overrule us." Aides say that comment incensed Mr. Pataki and caused him to favor Mr. Libeskind.
The Think design was favored by Daniel E. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. But his boss, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was dismayed by the cost of the towers, which without accounting for any office buildings was estimated at more than $800 million, compared to $330 million for the Libeskind plan. 
"How can we spend so much on the memorial?" Mr. Bloomberg asked in a meeting after the two presentations, according to two people who were present. 
Both the mayor and the governor also expressed a basic dislike for the Think design. Mr. Bloomberg compared it to industrial natural-gas storage tanks, and Mr. Pataki said it reminded him of a skeleton. Hours before a 10-member steering committee of officials from the Port Authority, the development corporation and the mayor's and governor's offices was to meet to choose a winner, the decision was already sealed.
Though they picked the design, neither Mr. Pataki nor Mr. Bloomberg was in a position to pay for its construction. That would fall to Mr. Silverstein, the developer and leaseholder, who was expecting billions of dollars in insurance payments for the destroyed towers.
Just before the competition had been narrowed to the two finalists, Mr. Silverstein sent a letter to rebuilding officials claiming that none of the proposed designs met his requirements. 
After Mr. Libeskind was selected, Mr. Silverstein continued to push for his own priorities. This summer, Mr. Libeskind agreed that David M. Childs, who had designed the new 7 World Trade Center for Mr. Silverstein, would be the primary architect on the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower, which will dominate the Manhattan skyline.
Mr. Libeskind said that made sense because he has never built a skyscraper. But Mr. Silverstein went further, asking other architects about their interest in designing the remaining commercial buildings.
Already the Port Authority has hired another architect, Santiago Calatrava, to design the train station. Although he will follow guidelines set by Mr. Libeskind, his characteristic style, gracefully symmetrical forms, could conflict with Mr. Libeskind's angular geometries.
Mr. Libeskind says these are all normal accommodations that an architect has to make for any client on any project. "People are being educated by the process," Mr. Libeskind said. "They say to me, 'You won, what's the problem?' But I tell them, 'No, there's an investor who has a say in this.' "

An Evolving Master Plan
The accommodations in Mr. Libeskind's design, however, are extensive. For example, rebuilding officials gushed about his plans for the intersection of the restored Fulton and Greenwich Streets.
John C. Whitehead, the development corporation chairman, said it would be "one of the world's most majestic crossroads," a grand piazza on a par with the open plazas of European capitals, bounded by Mr. Libeskind's Wedge of Light and the Park of Heroes.
But the open space has been shrinking. Fulton Street, rather than being part of an open pedestrian plaza, is likely to be active with buses traveling from the Hudson River ferry terminal to the South Street Seaport.
The green space in the Park of Heroes, which originally was to mirror the Wedge of Light across Greenwich Street, has been cut roughly in half by a redesign of the Freedom Tower and the attached office building.
So the grand piazza appears to be, in recent renderings, more like a street with flower beds. And at the site's southern edge, the proposed Liberty Street Park is not much wider than the sidewalk next to it.
"They are urban parks," Mr. Libeskind said last month. "No, it's not Central Park. But the point is to make a connection through West Street to the Hudson."
Mr. Libeskind also said he has made changes to the borders of the Wedge of Light -- a feature meant to mimic how the sun was shining on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 -- but he declined to elaborate.
The architect acknowledged that he has not fully designed the waterfall proposed for the eastern edge of the south tower footprint, which would help filter out street noise. The waterfall has received almost no attention in public reviews, but as originally depicted, it would be mammoth -- up to 100 feet tall, rivaling the world's largest man-made waterfalls. 
The effect of these prospective changes has unnerved some people who have supported the planning process. Robert Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, a civic group, said rebuilding officials were very responsive to public opinion last year. "Since then, it's been a less open process," he said. "That has been unfortunate."
But Mr. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor, said the general lack of dissension indicated that the public supported what has happened. "I think it's remarkable the level of praise that not only the process but the end result got," he said. 
Mr. Libeskind and others credit the aggressiveness of civic groups with helping to preserve elements of his plan. "The vigilance of the public in this process has raised the stakes," he said. "People feel very much that they are a part of this."

B5) Chart/Diagrams: "Subtle Changes in Libeskind's Plan"The architect Daniel Libeskind's plan quietly underwent significant changes between December 2002, when it was first proposed, and February, when it was selected. The next revised plan, to be released this month, is expected to have edged even closer to one of six designs that the public roundly rejected at a town hall meeting in July 2002. A Circular Promenade Vanishes, and Open Space ShrinksThe giant ramp to the memorial was eliminated as impractical, and the Freedom Tower was moved closer to Fulton Street, which is now likely to be a bus route. The Floor of the Memorial Site Is RaisedThe memorial was intended to sit on bedrock, 70 feet below ground level. Now only part does, making room for a train station and pedestrian concourses underneath. The Building Outlines Become More ConventionalTo create retail space, the lower floors of the office towers were extended outward toward the sidewalks, softening the oblique angles in the original design. The Architectural Renderings Show Boxier BuildingsMr. Libeskind replaced his signature crystalline shapes with rectangular forms to allow for more office space in the towers. A Return to an Earlier, Rejected Plan?With all of the changes above, some rebuilding officials say the current Libeskind plan resembles the Memorial Plaza proposal, one of the plans rejected at the town hall meeting in 2002. Diagrams highlight the original and revised models of the aforementioned plans. (Sources by Lower Manhattan Development Corporation; Studio Daniel Libeskind; Beyer Blinder Belle)(pg. B5)

Late Buying Lifts Shares Despite Weak Retail Sales Data

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A burst of late-day buying lifted stocks modestly yesterday despite a lackluster report on retail sales and disappointing sales of new software licenses by Oracle. 
 Analysts said investors decided to take advantage of some bargains after the Dow Jones industrial average lost as much as 79 points earlier in the day. 
 "Generally speaking, people are optimistic, but we're now at valuations that are appropriate as long as the economic and profit pictures continue to improve as they have been," said Susan L. Malley, chief investment officer for Malley Associates Capital Management in New York. 
"As we move into the earnings preannouncement season, people are standing pat in case there are any bad surprises," she said.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 11.79 points, or 0.1 percent, at 9,471.55. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.94 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,855.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.21 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,018.63.
For the week, the Dow fell 0.3 percent, the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent and the S.& P. lost 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq and S.& P. ended a four-week winning streak, while the Dow fell after five weeks of gains.
Stocks were sluggish for most of the session but edged higher late in the day. A report yesterday morning on retail sales for August came in below analysts' expectations, contributing to pessimism about the prospects for an economic turnaround.
But traders had other good news about the economy. 
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that economists polled in a monthly survey predicted that the economy will grow in the second half of the year at the fastest rate in four years.
Market performance was choppy all week as investors commemorated the anniversary of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and wondered whether the market's six-month rally might have come too fast, too soon.
Analysts say the earnings warning season, which begins in earnest next week, will probably give investors guidance on the strength of the economic recovery.
"The market is now getting focused on every single one of the economic numbers," said Janet Engels, director of the Private Client Research Group at RBC Dain Rauscher. "The equity markets have moved up, and therefore the market wants to see that things are clearly improving on both the consumer and business side."
Winners included Qualcomm, the telecommunications company, which rose $1.82, to $42.82, after Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock to buy from neutral.
Microsoft gained 50 cents, to $28.34, after it said it was doubling its annual dividend, to 16 cents a share. Microsoft declared its first dividend just nine months ago. 
Oracle dropped 43 cents, to $12.55, after the company, a maker of business software, reported quarterly profit and revenue that met analysts' expectations; however, sales of new software licenses fell by 6.7 percent.
The Janus Capital Group fell $1.38, to $14.50, after Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on the stock to neutral from buy, citing uncertainty after state and federal regulators announced an investigation into Janus and other mutual fund firms for potentially improper trading.
The price of Treasury bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note gained 19/32, to a price of 99 31/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.25 percent from 4.33 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 24/32, to 103 5/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.16 percent from 5.21 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Sales Climb,But an Index Finds Mood Is Sinking 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
Shoppers spent at a healthy rate in August, providing some underpinning to forecasts of faster economic growth, but consumer sentiment softened in recent weeks amid concerns over layoffs, reports released today showed.
 A third report showed that wholesale prices were not facing price pressures outside of increases in food and energy costs. 
 Retail sales rose a weaker-than-expected 0.6 percent last month, the Commerce Department said. But economists still said that the figure represented a solid advance, reflecting paychecks that have been increased by recent tax cuts. 
A closely watched gauge of consumer confidence from the University of Michigan slipped to a preliminary 88.2 in September from August's final 89.3.
Economists said the sales report suggested the economy was on track to grow at a strong 4.5 percent annual pace or better in the current quarter.
The government said the dollar value of auto sales rose just 0.5 percent in August, after soaring 2.4 percent in July. The latest gain contrasted with reports from automakers, who said unit sales surged about 10 percent. 
Economists said that the discrepancy in the auto numbers -- the part of the report apparently most disappointing to investors -- probably reflected aggressive sales incentives, which lowered prices. 
Excluding auto sales, demand for retail goods rose 0.7 percent, close to expectations. 
The government uses unit auto sales to construct estimates of the gross domestic product. And some economists said that the report, which also included upward revisions to nonauto figures for June and July, implied that the recovery had gained steam. 
"Consumers are spending their tax cuts, and the economy is going to be extremely healthy in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and perhaps rolling into next year," said L. Douglas Lee, president of Economics From Washington, a consulting firm. 
In its report on wholesale prices, the Labor Department said the Producer Price Index for August rose 0.4 percent. But the core index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose just 0.1 percent, underscoring a lack of underlying price pressures. 
"Core P.P.I. inflation is very much in the sweet spot, not too high and not too low," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investor Service. 
The reports will be given close attention by Federal Reserve officials, who gather Tuesday to plan interest-rate strategy. 
The University of Michigan sentiment report highlighted a risk for the economy: the potential for consumer spending to collapse if the moribund jobs market does not improve. 
Confidence sagged early this year in the period leading up to the war in Iraq, and its subsequent recovery appears to have stalled, with unemployment stuck near nine-year highs and consumers worried about job security.

HEADLINE: U.S. SOLDIERS KILL 8 IRAQI POLICEMEN, TOWNSPEOPLE SAY 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

DATELINE: FALLUJA, Iraq, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
American soldiers killed at least eight Iraqi policemen and a Jordanian security guard early this morning in a gun battle outside the Jordanian Hospital here, residents and town officials said. Falluja lies at the heart of Iraqi resistance to the occupation, and the killings will further incite the city, residents said.
 At another Falluja hospital where two wounded police officers lay in spartan beds, witnesses to the fight described a mounting chaos that ended with American tanks and soldiers firing on the hospital and the police officers, as an Iraqi doctor tried to persuade the soldiers to allow him to evacuate the wounded. In addition, one of the wounded officers said American soldiers had continued shooting at them from very close range even after the Iraqis shouted that they were policemen. 
 "I asked the Americans to let me in, and they said, 'No, you have to stop,' " said the doctor, Dhia Mahmoud. He said that when he was allowed to approach, he found a horrifying scene, with bodies torn apart from large-caliber weapons fired at close range. The dead were taken to a morgue in the nearby city of Ramadi, local officials said.
In a statement, a military spokesman said the American soldiers had been fired upon first with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades in the vicinity of the Jordanian Hospital, The Associated Press reported. One soldier was wounded in the attack, the statement said.
In Washington, Pentagon officials confirmed that military authorities were investigating whether allied forces might have been killed accidentally by American troops in the incident today. "That's one of the possibilities they're looking at, but it's still very early," one defense official said.
The firefight in Falluja, about 35 miles west of Baghdad, began long after curfew, when policemen chasing a stolen BMW intersected the path of a military patrol that included at least two tanks, according to Abdul Jalil, a local police officer who was wounded in the shootout.
The tanks opened fire, Mr. Jalil said, and they forced the police vehicles off the road near the Jordanian Hospital, a 100-bed military field hospital built in April about one mile east of the center of the city. The BMW apparently was not caught.
Hearing the shots, guards inside the hospital opened fire on the road, prompting the tanks to attack the hospital, residents and hospital security guards said. Soldiers and tanks then fired for nearly an hour on both the hospital and the police vehicles, the residents and guards said.
Mr. Jalil contended that American soldiers had killed at least one Iraqi policeman from less than 20 feet away, even after he repeatedly identified himself as an officer. His account could not be independently corroborated. The position of weapons cartridges, tank treads and human remains at the scene of the battle showed that, at some point in the fight, American soldiers could have been no more than 50 feet from the wounded and dead police officers.
Police officers in Iraq wear patches reading "IP," for Iraqi police, and the English words "police" and "policeman" are used widely by Arabic speakers.
Two more United States soldiers were killed in a separate raid early this morning in Ramadi, another center of Iraqi resistance,a military spokesman said. No further details were available. Since the beginning of the Iraq war, 292 soldiers have been killed in Iraq and Kuwait, including 152 since President Bush declared on May 1 that major American combat operations had ended.
The attack severely damaged one of the hospital's buildings, which had large holes and soot in its concrete facade. By afternoon, most of the damage had been removed from the building, which sits about 200 feet back from a major road that connects Falluja and Baghdad.
Bloodied scraps of clothing and skin remained on the gravel beside the road where the Iraqi vehicles had stopped. About 50 feet away, hundreds of spent cartridges littered the ground, apparently where United States soldiers had positioned machine guns to rake the hospital. Many from larger-caliber munitions, including 1.5-inch-wide rounds fired by tanks and armored vehicles, could also be seen. Taha Abboud, a hospital security guard, said tanks had also destroyed the hospital's generator.
The deaths seem sure to further poison the relationship between American soldiers and the residents of Falluja, where troops already face grenade or small-arms attacks almost daily. The city is part of the Sunni Triangle, an area north and west of Baghdad that has been a stronghold of support for Saddam Hussein. Sunni Muslim Arabs make up one-fifth of the population of Iraq but have long dominated the country's political and economic life, and many Sunnis fear that the American occupation may end that primacy.
"This is supposed to be a cemetery for the Americans," said Yassir Abd, the brother of Mr. Jalil, the wounded policeman. "We will shoot any artillery or armored vehicles." As if to prove his point, a United States military convoy was fired on in the late afternoon on a major road just over a mile from Falluja Hospital and was trapped for more than an hour.

HEADLINE: Cancun Targets Cotton 

 BODY:
It's not often you see Africans looking like potential big winners at big international gatherings. But this week Francois Traore, the head of Burkina Faso's National Cotton Producers Union, has been positively beaming, and at center stage, at the World Trade Organization's meeting in Cancun. He is part of the West African delegation that has managed, much to the chagrin of United States trade negotiators, to make cotton a test case of the W.T.O.'s commitment to a level playing field for trade in agricultural goods. It is a fitting test case, and it is up to the Bush administration to address the Africans' legitimate demands and give the trade talks a significant boost. 
 Burkina Faso is one of four major West African cotton producers, all of which have long complained that their farmers are being unfairly cut out of the international market by subsidized American cotton. Farmers of many products in poor countries have the same complaints about the way wealthy countries rig the trade game. The fact that cotton is the only commodity to be singled out by the W.T.O. at Cancun may -- as Washington certainly believes -- have to do with the fact that Europeans grow very little cotton. The United States is the principal culprit, and there is an element of ganging up on Uncle Sam at play. There was certainly something cheeky about officials from the EuropeanUnion, whose subsidies for farm products generally exceed those of the United States, cheering on the Africans' proposal. 
 That said, there are plenty of substantive reasons for singling out cotton. America's lavish handouts to its cotton farmers, which can reach $3 billion a year, hurt some of the world's poorest nations by driving world cotton prices below the cost of production. It is one commodity in which these least-developed nations would clearly have a competitive advantage in the absence of America's unfair trade practices. Washington is understandably having a hard time defending a program that costs taxpayers billions to keep 25,000 cotton growers, most of them politically powerful and quite wealthy, in business. The surplus created by this absurd form of rural workfare is then dumped on world markets, at a grievous cost to 10 million West African cotton farmers.
"This is about feeding our people, and getting our children to school," said Fatiou Akplogan, Benin's minister of commerce and industry. The Africans' cotton initiative, formally debated late on the first day of the gathering in Cancun, a Mexican seaside resort, calls on the United States and others to agree now (as opposed to waiting for the end of this round of trade talks next year) to abolish their cotton subsidies within the next three years and to compensate poor cotton-producing nations harmed by these subsidies in the interim. The need to do something to address the suffering of cotton growers in sub-Saharan Africa has such strong moral appeal that the W.T.O.'s own secretary general, Supachai Panitchpakdi from Thailand, took the unusual step of chiming in that he thought the proposal had a lot of merit.
Once dismissive of the Africans' cotton initiative, the American delegation at Cancun is now scrambling to head it off. The Americans are proposing a grandiose but vague plan to support the African cotton and textile industries in all kinds of other ways. The African ministers seem amused at Washington's sudden interest in helping them build a stronger textile industry, and reasonably regard it as an effort to change the subject from the subsidy issue.
Washington could strike a deal without labeling it a compensation scheme. Its more churlish concerns about conceding on this before the Europeans and others make any concessions need to be abandoned. The United States would go a long way toward reclaiming its moral leadership on trade matters if it reached a deal on cotton with the Africans while still at Cancun.

HEADLINE: The Plague of Lead Poisoning 

 BODY:
The federal goal to eliminate lead poisoning in children by 2010 seemed achievable when it was set in 1991. With bans on leaded gasoline and paint in place, progress has been made -- the number of cases detected has fallen by 50 percent. Still, hundreds of thousands of small children, most of them black, Hispanic and Asian, face one of the most preventable environmental hazards in the nation by simply breathing inside their homes. 
 Tests have shown that more than 400,000 children 1 to 5 years old have blood lead levels above that considered toxic by the Centers for Disease Control -- and that number would be much greater if the index was lowered, as many experts wish, and if more children were regularly tested. Most cases occur in large and mid-size cities where formerly good housing is deteriorating. When lead paint peels or is improperly removed, or even when it is scraped as a window is opened, it unleashes a dust fine enough to be both ubiquitous and undetected as children crawl on it and touch it. It takes very little ingested lead to damage the still-forming brains and nerves of children or fetuses, and such damage can lead to permanent and debilitating health and learning problems, like lower IQ's and retardation, and behavioral problems. 
 Where testing has been done, patterns emerge. In Chicago, one in three children tested positive for lead poisoning, mainly in poorer neighborhoods, causing the city to push for increased testing and education. Similar hot spots were found in Providence, Philadelphia and St. Louis. But for sheer density of risk, nothing compares with New York City because of its huge stock of older homes and a lead belt stretching across underserved poor, minority and immigrant communities in Brooklyn and Queens. New York was years ahead of the federal government in outlawing lead paint in 1960. But the city faltered four years ago, passing a law that failed to address the danger of lead dust. That law was struck down on a technicality in the courts this summer, leaving a void on an urgent issue.
A bill before the New York City Council -- sponsored by Bill Perkins, who represents parts of Harlem and the Upper East Side -- would go a long way to protect those most vulnerable by clearly labeling lead dust a health hazard. It also corrects a lapse in the previous law, which shielded landlords from liability. The new law would place the burden of fixing lead problems on building owners, who would have to act in a timely way, using trained workers. City officials say the bill is too expensive and goes too far, including its provision to increase the upper age range of monitored children to age 7, from age 6.
Gifford Miller, the Council speaker, has been criticized for not moving more quickly on the legislation, but he now appears to agree with much of what it seeks to accomplish and has offered improvements, like adding a focus on primary prevention. In New York's current fiscal squeeze, City Hall is right to worry about costs, but the mayor's economists also need to consider the long term. Lead poisoning does not typically kill. Instead it leaves a lifetime of expensive concerns -- like special schooling and medical care -- that society is left to absorb. This is a problem with a clear solution if those in government do the right thing now, while the goal is in sight.

HEADLINE: Patients in Florida Lining Up For All That Medicare Covers 

BYLINE:  By GINA KOLATA

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla. 

 BODY:
It is lunchtime, and the door to Boca Urology's office is locked. But outside, patients are milling about, calling the office on their cellphones, hoping the receptionist will let them in. To say they are eager hardly does them justice. 
 "We never used to lock the door at lunch, but they came in an hour early," said Ellie Fertel, the office manager. "It's like they're waiting for a concert. Sometimes we forget to lock the door and they come in and sit in the dark." 
 Yet few have serious medical problems, let alone emergencies. "It's the culture," said Dr. Jeffrey I. Miller, one of four urologists in the practice. 
Doctor visits have become a social activity in this place of palm trees and gated retirement communities. Many patients have 8, 10 or 12 specialists and visit one or more of them most days of the week. They bring their spouses and plan their days around their appointments, going out to eat or shopping while they are in the area. They know what they want; they choose specialists for every body part. And every visit, every procedure is covered by Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
Boca Raton, researchers agree, is a case study of what happens when people are given free rein to have all the medical care they could imagine. It is also a cautionary tale, they say -- timely as Medicare's fate is debated in Congress -- for it demonstrates that what the program covers and does not cover, and how much or how little it pays, determines what goes on in a doctor's office and why it is so hard to control costs. 
South Florida has all the ingredients for lavish use of medical services, health care researchers say, with its large population of affluent, educated older people and the doctors to accommodate them. As a result, Dr. Elliott Fisher, a health services researcher at Dartmouth Medical School, said, patients have more office visits, see more specialists and have more diagnostic tests than almost anywhere else in the country. Medicare spends more per person in South Florida than almost anywhere else -- twice as much as in Minneapolis, for example.
But there is no apparent medical benefit, Dr. Fisher said, adding, "In our research, Medicare enrollees in high intensity regions have 2 to 5 percent higher mortality rates than similar patients in the more conservative regions of the country."
Doctors say that Medicare's policies are guiding medical practice, with many making calculated decisions about whom to treat and how to care for them based on what Medicare covers, and how much it pays. 
"The bottom line is that the stuff that reimburses well is easier to get done," Dr. Carl Rosenkrantz, a Boca Raton radiologist, said.
Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he knew the situation all too well.
"We have a system that does nothing to look at utilization," Mr. Scully said in a telephone interview. "If you send in a bill and you are legitimate, we pay it."
The effect shows up in the way doctors deal with office visits, for example. Medicare in Boca Raton pays $52.46 for a routine visit, in which a doctor sees a patient with no new problem. That is not enough, doctors say; it costs about $1,500 a day to run an office there, they explain. Payments in other states are different, adjusted for cost of living, but doctors say, and Mr. Scully agrees, that they are generally inadequate. Doctors who try to make a living seeing only Medicare patients for routine visits, he said, "have a very rough time."
Medicare bases its payments on a system in which each kind of service is assigned a "relative value," Mr. Scully said. To increase the payment for routine office visits and stay within its budget, Medicare would have to decrease the relative value of other services.
A committee of doctors meets each year to suggest relative values, he said, but "the most aggressive and active groups tend to be the specialists."
"Year after year," Mr. Scully went on, "the specialists come in and make a very strong argument for higher reimbursements. There's eventually a squeeze on the basic office visit."
In many areas of the country, private insurers pay more for office visits than Medicare does, so doctors can essentially subsidize their Medicare patients.
"If we just saw Medicare patients and didn't see anyone with regular insurance, we wouldn't be able to pay the bills," said Dr. James E. Kurtz, an internist at Chatham Crossing Medical Center in Pittsboro, N.C. 
Elsewhere, many doctors are refusing to see Medicare patients. "Some counties in Washington have no doctors who take new Medicare patients," Dr. Douglas Paauw, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, said. 
Doctors in South Florida do not have a choice. Private insurers there pay the same as Medicare or less, and so many old people live in the area that if doctors want to practice, they must accept them. But how to make a living?
One way, Dr. Robert Colton, an internist in Boca Raton, said, is to see lots of patients, spending just a few minutes with each and referring complicated problems to specialists. 
Dr. Colton did that for a while, seeing as many as 35 patients a day. A typical busy internist, he said, would see 20 patients a day. "I felt like a glorified triage nurse," he said. 
"If you try to handle a complex problem, it slows you down," Dr. Colton said. "You have to sit down with the family, meet with the patients, talk to them. If you say you have coughing and you are short of breath and your knee hurts, I might have sent you to two different specialists."
The goal, Dr. Rosenkrantz said, is to move the patients on. "The worst thing that can happen is for someone to walk into your office and say, 'I have an interesting case for you.' Financially, you'd be dead."
Even seeing patients in the hospital can become an exercise in time management, Dr. Rosenkrantz said. "We have doctors who do rounds at 4 a.m." 
A second driving force behind medical care in Boca Raton is the demands of patients. They want lots of tests and specialists, they refer themselves to specialists, they ask for and get far more medical attention from specialists than many doctors think is reasonable or advisable.
"This Medicare card is like a gold card that lets you go to any doctor you want," Dr. Colton said. "I see it every day. When there's no control on utilization, it's just the path of least resistance. If a patient says, 'My shoulder hurts, I want an M.R.I., I want to see a shoulder specialist,' the path of least resistance is to send them off. You have nothing to gain by refusing."
Patients here say they have mixed emotions. They complain about rushed primary care doctors but readily admit that they seek multiple specialists and multiple procedures.
The primary care doctors are often irritatingly busy, patients say. "In waiting rooms sometimes they are standing against the wall," said Marvin Luxenberg, a retired lawyer who lives in nearby Boynton Beach. Then, he said, "when you get in to see the doctor, you get just three or four minutes of time." 
Dr. Colton says he found a way to give his patients more time. He joined a "concierge" practice, in which patients pay an annual fee in addition to the normal charges for medical services. Dr. Colton's group, MDVIP, charges patients $1,500 a year and limits the number of patients each doctor sees.
But not everyone wants to pay that kind of fee. Many patients just spend their time in specialists' offices. Each specialist handles a different aspect of their care, with no one coordinating it. 
Specialists get no more than primary care doctors for an office visit, but they provide tests and procedures that demand higher Medicare reimbursements. Doctors say those payments allow them to stay in business, especially if they provide the procedures in their own office. 
Medicare pays the doctor and the facility where a procedure is done. For a nuclear stress test, for example, the doctor gets about $200 and the facility gets about $1,200.
"Doctors have incorporated these tests as much as possible into their offices so they can gain from the facility fee," Dr. Thomas Bartzokis, an interventional cardiologist in Boca Raton, said.
Patients say they have lots of specialists, and lots of tests. Asked how many doctors he saw, Leon Bloomberg, 83, a patient of Dr. Miller, thought for a minute and looked at his wife, Esther.
"Between us, we have 10 or 12," Mr. Bloomberg said, including a pain specialist and a neurologist for his neuropathy, a cardiologist for his heart condition, "a pulmonary man" for his asthma, a rheumatologist for his arthritis and Dr. Miller for his prostate. Mrs. Bloomberg has her own doctors, including ones for heart disease and for diabetes. "We have two to four or more doctors' appointments a week," Mr. Bloomberg said.
It is easy to find all these specialists, he said. "You get recommendations at the clubhouse, at the swimming pool. You go to a restaurant here and 9 times out of 10, before the meal is over, you hear people talking about a doctor or a medicine or a surgery." And of course there are the other patients in all those waiting rooms. Mr. Bloomberg even recommends specialists to his own doctors.
But some patients say they are frustrated by what they call a waste of resources. "The doctors are raping Medicare," said Louis Ziegler, a retired manufacturer of flight simulators who lives in Delray Beach.
Mr. Ziegler recalled going to a doctor for a chronic problem, a finger that sometimes freezes. All he wanted was a shot of cortisone. But he got more, much more: "I had diathermy. I had ultrasound. I had a paraffin massage. I had $600 worth of Medicare treatments to get my lousy $35 shot of cortisone."
Dr. Colton, the internist here, is frustrated, too.
"The system is broken," he said. "I'm not being a mean ogre, but when you give something away for free, there is nothing to keep utilization down. And as the doctor, you have nothing to gain by denying them what they want."

HEADLINE: Rapid Growth Seen For U.S. Economy 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
The American economy finally seems poised to roar ahead at rates not seen since the late 1990's, but economists and some political analysts say the surge may not help President Bush's re-election campaign next year.
 A wide range of data suggests that the economy will probably grow at an annual rate of nearly 5 percent in the final months of this year and nearly 4 percent next year -- rates that would normally be spectacular news for an incumbent president. 
 But in a disparity with no real parallels in the last half-century, most economists predict that unemployment will remain almost unchanged at nearly 6 percent through the elections in November 2004.
The incongruous pattern of rapid growth with a stagnant job market stems primarily from an extraordinary gain in productivity, which has allowed companies to produce far more goods with far fewer people. Industrial production has jumped 5 percent since the last recession ended in late 2001, but companies have eliminated one million jobs over the same period. 
The political fallout could be bigger than even the job statistics suggest, because most of the job losses have been in manufacturing, a significant sector for many of the most important swing states in the next election: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri and Illinois.
White House officials are keenly aware of the problem. In the last six weeks, Mr. Bush has traveled to Missouri twice and to Pennsylvania and Indiana to talk about his plans for creating jobs. 
Acting on complaints from manufacturers that China has been manipulating its exchange rates to compete unfairly, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow openly urged the Chinese government this month to adopt flexible rates. Beijing agreed, but it rejected calls to move quickly in that direction.
Political analysts say voters need to feel for themselves that the economy is improving and that they need to start feeling that way by sometime next summer. Economists, meanwhile, worry that the economy could slow if employment does not pick up by sometime next spring.
"It is almost a race against time," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, an economic forecasting company in Waltham, Mass. "The risk is that we continue to shed jobs over the next 13 or 14 months. It's not the mostly likely scenario, but I wouldn't rule it out."
And there are other timing issues. Even if statistics suggest the economy is red hot by early next year, it might take several more months for large numbers of voters to actually feel better about their prospects.
New data released today suggested that people are still nervous. Consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped slightly last month, according to the University of Michigan's latest monthly survey. And retail sales, which climbed rapidly this summer, rose only 0.6 percent last month, short of expectations. 
"Public opinion and consumer confidence are lagging indicators because people need to feel the changes in their own lives," said Andrew Kohut, executive director of the Pew Research Center.
The persistent stagnation in jobs provokes obvious similarities to the "jobless recovery" that contributed mightily to the first President Bush's re-election defeat in 1992.
But the differences are significant. Back then, unemployment was running at 7.8 percent and the economy was growing slowly, a marked contrast to the explosive growth rates many economists are predicting.
The reason for the bleak outlook on jobs boils down to basic math. The number of new workers is climbing about 1 percent a year. If productivity increases by an annual rate of 3 percent -- and the rate has been above 5 percent both this year and last -- economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, needs to be significantly more than 4 percent next year before there is drastic improvement in the unemployment rate. 
"I don't see where the demand is going to come from to produce a falling unemployment rate," said J. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "Very few people are predicting real G.D.P. growth of more than 4 percent."
White House officials dispute that prognosis. If productivity and growth are rising, they contend, then new jobs will follow.
"There is a very strong correlation between real G.D.P. growth and developments in the labor market," said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. "We will see employment picking up by the end of the year, and we will see very strong advances in employment in 2004."
By any measure, there is much evidence to suggest that the economy is about to grow more rapidly. Corporate profits have climbed much faster than expected over the last two quarters. Retail spending grew rapidly this summer, and many companies are suddenly scrambling to keep up with demand. Inventory levels have dropped to quite low levels, which usually means that companies have to increase production.
Business investment, which has been the weakest leg of the economy for some time, has picked up modestly. And the stock market has been buoyant, which is an indicator of optimism among investors and makes it easier for companies to raise money for expansion.
More than a few economists say that the economy might expand at an annual rate of more than 5 percent in the final half of this year. According to the most recent Blue Chip survey of economic forecasters, the consensus forecast is that growth next year will be nearly 4 percent.
But there are some red flags. John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said the economy could still sputter sometime next summer. Much of the current growth, he said, stems from the recent tax cuts and tax rebates. But the jolt of that extra money will fade by early next year.
"The issue is the fourth quarter of next year, and that is where I have a concern," Mr. Makin said. "Demand will still be at a high level, but it may not be growing."
Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, predicted this week that growth would "fade significantly" over the course of next year and that unemployment would begin rising by the end of next year.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, predicted that growth would be even stronger than many forecasters expect, but he also cautioned that many industry executives were reluctant to expand their operations.
"Manufacturers still have doubts that growth is in their hands," he said. "They are still skeptical that they will get a strong recovery."
Continued job stagnation would be bad news for Mr. Bush. Mr. Kohut of the Pew Research Center said recent surveys showed voters placing far higher priority on economic concerns than on terrorism. And while Mr. Bush continues to receive high approval ratings for his handling of terrorism and national security, Mr. Kohut said, his ratings on economic issues have fallen.

HEADLINE: Democrats Find Some Traction On Capitol Hill 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
With President Bush on the defensive over his handling of postwar Iraq, Democrats on Capitol Hill have been scoring a few victories in the Republican-controlled Congress, gaining a measure of political momentum that they hope will grow more pronounced as the 2004 elections draw nearer.
 This week, Senate Democrats won votes on such pocketbook issues as overtime pay and student aid, as well as financing for special education. Last week, their long-running filibuster forced an appeals court nominee, Miguel Estrada, to withdraw. Next week, they are expected to prevail in a Senate vote to repeal new rules, backed by the White House, that would enable large media conglomerates to expand. 
 Political analysts and Democrats say it is no coincidence that the recent gains on overtime and student aid came in the same week that President Bush announced he was requesting $87 billion for postwar Iraq, an announcement followed by a drop in Mr. Bush's approval rating. Some say the numbers have emboldened Democrats and made Republicans, especially those up for re-election, more likely to break ranks with their party and the president.
"The president is losing some of his popularity," said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic whip. Of Republicans, Mr. Reid said: "They no longer feel that he can be a dictator. They no longer feel that he is King George. He is President George now."
Republicans, of course, are hardly relinquishing control on Capitol Hill. This week, they shut Democrats out of talks designed to reach an agreement between the House and Senate on a new energy bill. Senators Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican whip, played down the Democrats' recent gains. 
"We like to let them win one occasionally to keep their morale up," Senator McConnell said, adding that Republican unity was not cracking.
"My response," he said, "is: Prove it. There's no evidence." 
Dr. Frist called the Democrats' gains "isolated victories."
But some scholars and political strategists, both Democrat and Republican, say Democrats have succeeded in taking advantage of the limited muscle they have. News from Iraq, combined with the increasing federal deficit, high unemployment and recent polls on Mr. Bush "have caused Republicans to get a little wobbly," one Republican strategist said.
He added, "It feels like the wheels are starting to fall off a little."
The polls have been running in the Democrats' favor. A Gallup poll, conducted after Mr. Bush's speech on Iraq and released on Thursday, found his approval rating at 52 percent, down from 59 percent at the end of August.
And a recent poll by the Senate Republican Conference, released this week, found voters preferred Democratic Senate candidates to Republicans by 46 percent to 40 percent. The margin of sampling error in both polls was plus or minus three percentage points. 
"A presidential speech, instead of boosting support, is followed by a seven-point drop and suddenly the atmosphere changes," said Thomas Mann, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who follows Congress. "Republicans, who have been reluctant to get off the reservation, now say, 'Wait just one minute.' And Democrats have all the more reason to be unified."
Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University, agreed.
"Any sign of weakness out of the White House is going to be perceived by the president's allies in Congress as an opportunity to act a little bit more like free spirits, and on the part of the opposition to be more aggressive," Professor Baker said. "It's the blood-in-the-water syndrome."
That syndrome may have begun with Mr. Estrada's withdrawal. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Democrats were more resolved than ever to stand firmly against other judicial nominees whose views they regard as out of the mainstream.
"That's a very important change and shift," Mr. Kennedy said. Republicans, though, say the Estrada withdrawal was not a victory for Democrats but a loss.
"If they think of the short term of having him withdraw as a win," Dr. Frist said, "the elections will very quickly demonstrate that's fallacious thinking."
In the vote on overtime, 6 Republicans sided with 48 Democrats to block a Bush administration proposal that would make it easier for businesses to deny overtime pay to white collar workers. 
The coming elections clearly played a role. Three of the Republican defectors -- Senators Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado -- are facing competitive races next year.
"Politicians always like to be able to point to examples when they were independent from their party or their own president because it resonates well back home," said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. 
At the same time, the Democrats took advantage of timing, said Steven Smith, a professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis. Unlike the House, where Republican leaders exert tight control over the legislative schedule, the Senate gives the minority party more opportunity to offer amendments to legislation, an institutional edge that Professor Smith said Democrats used adroitly in raising the overtime issue.
"Republicans are obviously very nervous about jobs," Professor Smith said. "Republican leaders, even in the House, have been saying to their colleagues that what they should emphasize, always, is jobs. So anything connected to jobs, like overtime pay, is generally something on which a few Republicans are going to feel very sensitive."
Mr. Mann, of the Brookings Institution, said the $87 billion price tag had caused "sticker shock on Capitol Hill," drawing attention to the deficit and making it all the more likely that Democrats will win yet another battle: the battle to keep Mr. Bush's tax cut from becoming permanent.

HEADLINE: As Factory Jobs Disappear, Ohio Town Has Few Options 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
For nearly 30 years, Jim Greathouse was part of the blue-collar elite, a tool-and-die man who sometimes earned more than $50,000 a year because his job, making the precision metal molds that factories use to shape parts, required such exacting skills.
 But in June, Mr. Greathouse, 55, lost his job at the Hoover vacuum cleaner factory here, and with so many other factories laying off people, he is at aloss about what to do. 
 "What does it do when you take away all these jobs from people who support families, who raise families?" he asked. "Manufacturing has been the strength of this country. If we can't make anything here anymore, what does that do? The fabric of this society is falling apart." 
Mr. Greathouse has a lot of company. In three years, Ohio has lost more than 160,000 factory jobs, representing one-sixth of its total. That is but a small fraction of the 2.7 million manufacturing jobs lost nationwide in those three years, many of them because of imports. Some economists say that even with a boom all those jobs are not likely to return. 
Factory unemployment has snowballed into a huge social and political issue across the Midwest, after manufacturing in the region boomed in the 1990's. President Bush gave a speech about manufacturing losses on Labor Day in Ohio, and the Democratic presidential candidates are pressing the issue. 
A wide range of figures suggests that the economy is likely to surge, but economists predict unemployment will remain almost unchanged at nearly 6 percent through the 2004 presidential election. Page C1. 
With its century-old stone buildings and handsome brick factories, Canton was long a booming industrial center, but the area has been hit by so many factory closings, bankruptcies and layoffs that many workers are losing hope. Many of the unemployed are reluctantly turning to less steady or lower-paying jobs like hospital aide. Some are studying computer technology.
"I've applied for many jobs, and they politely tell me I'm too old, that they're hoping to find someone they can train and keep for a long time," said Patty Reich, who lost her job as a metallurgical technician at the Republic Steel mill. "For someone like me who is unemployed at age 54, we don't have too much light at the end of the tunnel." 
Ask laid-off workers what is to blame for the woes, and they point to imports, low wages in China, the strong dollar, production moving overseas, President Bill Clinton for embracing the North American Free Trade Agreement and President Bush for focusing only recently on the crisis. 
Robert White, a laid-off steelworker who voted for Mr. Bush three years ago, said: "He's slowly getting his eyes awakened to what's going on. The air has been going out of the balloon for a long time, and he's trying to stop it. But the air is almost out of the balloon." 
In the last three years, Stark County, which includes Canton, has lost 3,500 factory jobs, more than 10 percent of the total. Two years ago in Massillon, just west of Canton, the lone rubber glove factory in the nation shut, moving production to Malaysia and India and throwing 200 people out of work. Last year, Hess Management of Austin, Tex., shut the Danner Press printing plant, costing 325 workers their jobs, and 700 steelworkers at Republic Technologies on the east end of town lost their jobs when Republic filed for bankruptcy. 
This year, an automobile parts company laid off 150 workers, and Hoover, a division of Maytag, 200. Last week, the largest employer in the region, Timken, warned 1,300 workers at three ball-bearing plants here that their jobs were in danger unless costs were reduced.
"If you draw a line across the top third of this state, the manufacturing part of the state, you see a lot of pain, anger and frustration," said John Russo, director of labor studies at Youngstown State University. 
Mr. Greathouse, a wiry, muscular man who went into factory work after dropping out of Kent State University, asked: "When you have C.E.O.'s who think of moving jobs offshore, what are you doing but terrorizing the people who lose their jobs? This is a form of terrorism, also. The country is getting weaker and weaker."
Having just bought a three-bedroom house for $99,000, he said, he might have to consider personal bankruptcy, because he was having problems paying his mortgage and support for his former wife. He has applied to numerous tool-and-die shops with no luck, so he is thinking of returning to college, but says he first needs to speak with a vocational counselor for career advice. 
Alice Hall, who worked for 15 years as a janitor in a steel mill, saw her house undergo foreclosure and has told her 16-year-old daughter that they can no longer afford the girl's dance lessons. Ms. Hall, a small, soft-spoken woman, is taking remedial mathematics and English classes to help prepare for work as a hospital aide. 
"They told me go into medical," she said. "That's a field where you can always get a job." 
But entry-level medical jobs may pay just half the salary of her old job. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Hall sat in the steelworkers' union hall across from the rusting Republic mill with 12 other laid-off workers seething with anger -- at their former employer, at greedy chief executives and at the lack of health insurance.
"It used to be that manufacturing provided people with a decent middle-class living, but now these jobs are falling by the wayside," said Dan Yarnell, who worked at Republic for 26 years. "A lot of people are going to work at Wal-Mart. But how do you live on the $7.50 an hour Wal-Mart pays?"
Many workers embraced protectionism, with some suggesting a law to bar the United States from importing more goods than it exports.
Thomas Briatico, president of Hoover Floorcare, based in North Canton, said all of Hoover's major competitors but one were buying their vacuum cleaners from Asia and Mexico. That foreign competition, Mr. Briatico said, has forced the average retail price of cleaners to drop 10 percent in two years. 
"It's put us at a little bit of a competitive disadvantage," he said. "In China, they pay their workers 55 cents an hour, and the easiest decision for me would be to go outsource in China. The tough decision is to stay here. I'm personally concerned about jobs leaving this country." 
Some Ohioans predict that the state could swing to the Democrats in the election next year.
"This is a fairly conservative state," Professor Russo said, "and last time, it went 3 percent for Bush. But I think there will be an electoral response to all these jobs losses, and Bush gets beat here."
W. R. Timken Jr., chairman of Timken, with 5,000 workers here, is often praised for doing his utmost to keep jobs in Ohio. But he said fierce foreign competition was forcing the company to weigh the future of the three ball-bearing plants.
"The truth is unless we can do something with these plants, they won't be globally competitive," said Mr. Timken, who recently stepped down as chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
Mr. Timken said his company had been hurt by the strong dollar, China's undervalued currency and the harm that imports were causing his customers. Foreign competition was so intense, he said, that the price of manufacturing goods in the United States has fallen 4 percent in the last 10 years as the price of other goods has increased 18 percent. That, he said, has forced Timken and other manufacturers to increase productivity and reduce jobs. 
"Manufacturing has been the key to innovation in the United States and has given the United States leadership in innovation," said Mr. Timken, whose great-grandfather founded the company in 1899 "If you eliminate manufacturing, which accounts for 65 percent of private sector R & D, then innovation will decline, and you will see a nation in decline."
It will take many steps to turn around manufacturing, Mr. Timken said, adding that although tax cuts have help, he wished more of them had gone to spur investment.
"A lot of people say why doesn't President Bush shoot the silver bullet to help manufacturing," Mr. Timken said. "There is no simple answer. We tell people if you want to look at part of the problem, look in the mirror. You buy cars from Japan, shirts from Hong Kong and many imported products in Wal-Mart. American manufacturers are caught in the middle."

HEADLINE: The Baltic Republics 

BYLINE:  By Bill Keller; Bill Keller is the executive editor of The Times.

 BODY:
In the light drizzle of a June evening, an Estonian friend, performing a slightly tipsy parody of a tour guide, led us up the slick cobblestones of Tallinn's old town. We -- my 13-year-old son, Tom, and I -- followed him up a medieval stairway to the upper town, to a viewpoint from which you can look down upon this perfect replica of a northern European port city in the 19th century: the Lutheran spires topped with rooster weathercocks, the cupolas of Orthodox churches, the glimpses of Gothic and Baroque, the narrow streets just lighting up for the dinner trade, the tiled rooftops and chimneys sending up a scent of baking. Except, of course, that it is no replica. It is the real thing, alluringly intact despite centuries of trampling by Danish conquerors and Teutonic knights, Swedes, Russians, Nazis and Soviets.
 Even in the days of Soviet grunge, which have left their relics in the shabby high-rise suburbs, central Tallinn maintained a tidy Nordic charm. Now, after a dozen years of capitalist restoration, it is so postcard perfect that it resembles a Hanseatic League theme park. It was preserved from ruinous conquerors and malignant modernizers by a national pragmatism that my friend summed up as we lurched through the rain. 
 "We Estonians have never fought anybody," he explained. "We've always surrendered at the right time to the right side." 
Tallinn was our last stop on an eight-day, 1,200-mile trip through Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the three Baltic states that were, until a dozen years ago, the northwestern corner of the Soviet Union. I last visited them when sympathetic outsiders still called them "captive nations." Now Donald Rumsfeld, grateful for their official endorsement of America's war in Iraq, embraces them as the newest of "new Europe." (Of course, as my Estonian friend indignantly pointed out at every stop on our long stroll to dinner, Tallinn was an established city five centuries before white men set foot in upstart America.) Now all three countries are matriculating into NATO and the European Union -- Lithuania voting in May to join the E.U., Latvia and Estonia scheduled to vote today.
Our itinerary was essentially three capitals and a coastline. Our mode of transportation was a rented Ford Mondeo, soon littered with the detritus of two guys on a road trip -- Pringles, Nutella, soda bottles, a bag of little dried fish that became our Baltic junk food. The CD player blared Jay-Z and Sean Paul when we weren't investigating the local radio options.
I'm happy to report, first of all, that the Baltics, whose aspirations of independence once struck me as brave but improbable, have been reborn as genuine, modern, entirely appealing European countries. Word of this has spread slowly. Two years ago Jonathan Franzen, in his novel "The Corrections," conjured a Lithuania that was a hyperbole of post-Soviet decay and lawlessness, "rattling down the road toward anarchy." Until recently, the Bradt Travel Guide series (the most reliable of the few English-language tourist books on the Baltics) listed scarce gas stations and warned against the conditions in local hospitals. Even in neighboring countries that have begun to discover the secrets of Baltic tourism, there is still persistent word-of-mouth that they are a little iffy, suitable perhaps for the adventurous, but not entirely civilized. For the record, the Baltic countries are now as safe, stable and traveler-friendly as any destination in "old" Europe. Indeed, if you knew the Baltics when they were vassals of Soviet power, you will marvel at things travelers in most countries take for granted -- the ubiquity of 24-hour gas stations, A.T.M.'s, hassle-free car rentals, good and well-marked roads, convenience stores, Internet cafes and friendly, free-map-dispensing tourist information offices.
We flew, via Helsinki, to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, and picked up our Avis car at a tiny, efficient airport. I've always had a soft spot for Lithuania. According to type-casting, Lithuanians are the most passionate of the Baltic peoples, Estonians the most standoffish and cerebral and Latvians temperamentally (as well as geographically) in between. I know people who give the lie to all three stereotypes, but it is certainly true that the Lithuanians -- who alone among the Baltic states were once a power in their own right, subjugating swaths of Poland and Russia -- were the most daring in grabbing for the freedom dangled by Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980's. This was the first Soviet republic to declare independence. I was there in 1991 when that courage was challenged by Soviet tanks.
Vilnius, of the three Baltic capitals, was the one still deepest in the throes of renovation. The interior of the majestic, neo-Classical Catholic cathedral at the heart of the old city was a honeycomb of scaffolding. We had to make our way under an acre of plastic sheeting to visit the splendid chapel of St. Casimir, a little Baroque orgy of Italian frescoes spilling cherubs into stucco foliage. On Gedimino, the main boulevard of Vilnius and political bellwether of Lithuanian intrigues (it has been variously named for the Polish strongman Jozef Pilsudski, Hitler, Stalin and Lenin, and now for the 14th-century duke who founded the city), there was a whir of saws and clouds of dust as workmen cut new paving stones. Many buildings in the sprawling old town were undergoing face lifts.
Still, an astonishing amount of restoration has already been accomplished in the dozen years of independence. Vilnius is less precious, more lived in than Tallinn, with an active university at its heart, beer gardens along the cobbled streets and a number of residential buildings that keep it from feeling too much like a museum. The city is a treasury of Catholic and Orthodox churches, lovingly buffed and painted, reflecting the rival tides of Polish and Russian influence. Its medieval maze of twisting streets is also rich in cafes, shops and hotels. We stayed in the Stikliai, a luxury hotel cleverly insinuated into a 17th-century building in the Jewish quarter. The furnishings and food were exquisite, although the architects seem to have been sometimes baffled by the challenge of reconciling the 17th and 21st centuries. We stayed in a sloped attic room the size of an Olympic swimming pool, with the furniture clustered at one end and the closet at the other end.
Our first pilgrimage took us out to a western suburb, past the moldering hulks of Soviet-era tenements, to visit the television tower where, in 1991, I watched one of the last gasps of Soviet power. Free-speaking television had become a symbol of freedom, and when Moscow threatened to shut it down thousands of defenders surrounded it and began a kind of defiant festival. Suddenly a parade of tanks -- dispatched by the same renegade hard-liners who later that year would try to overthrow Gorbachev -- roared up the grassy hillside, firing off thunderous artillery rounds. Thirteen Lithuanians were shot or crushed under the tank treads, and the tower become the Alamo of Baltic independence.
A little exhibit has been installed, touchingly amateurish, remembering that day with black-and-white portraits of those who were killed, murky photographs of the attack and crudely typed captions in Lithuanian, Russian and rough English: "All Lithuania is mourning and weeping for the deads." We were the only visitors. We had a Coke in the revolving bar atop the tower, and bought T-shirts. On weekends, I learned from a tourist brochure, the city sponsors bungee jumps from the tower. At first this struck me as sacrilege, or indifference to history, but upon reflection I conceded it might be a sign of Lithuania's mental health. You can't let the past weigh too heavily upon you, I suppose, not when you've got as much past as the Baltics have.
Lithuania has always had the smallest population of Russian-speakers in the Baltic countries, which makes it easier for Lithuanians to be tolerant. We noticed that the bridges over the Neris River in Vilnius still feature triumphal Soviet-era bronzes of noble peasants, sturdy workers and soldiers bearing the hammer and sickle.
For some Baltic residents, a more pressing concern than the Soviet past is the homogenizing influence of their European future. I suspect this fear is overdrawn, but Latvia this year was host to the signature event of pop banality, the Eurovision Song Contest. Estonia had held it the year before. The missionaries of European commercial taste have colonized the storefronts in the hearts of all three Baltic capitals.
Rita Dapkus, a Lithuanian-American who moved here to aid the independence movement and is now a member of the Vilnius City Council, has struck a blow against creeping uniformity by opening a restaurant in an unfashionable shopping center in northern Vilnius, offering food, drink and music of strictly Lithuanian origin. (No Coke, no Pepsi, and the only "coffee" is made from carrots or acorns.) The night we went, a wild, accordion-propelled folk band filled the room with delirious polkas and waltzes. We ate hogs' ears, deviled eggs with pickled herring, Lithuanian goulash, chicken liver patties. Lithuanian cuisine is not for cholesterol watchers, although you can dance it off.
We had a choice of side trips out of Vilnius. We passed on Stalin World, a park an hour's drive from the city in which an entrepreneur with a taste for political kitsch has assembled discarded statuary from the Soviet occupation. It was hard to resist the idea of a concentration camp for Soviet memories, but I felt I'd seen enough of Stalin's world. Instead, we drove to Trakai Historical National Park, a luxuriant mosaic of forests and lakes where the oldest remnants of Lithuanian history are preserved and reconstructed. Perhaps the country's most famous sight is a handsomely rebuilt castle on an islet, reachable by footbridge. From a distance, the orange-brick castle seems to float on a wind-ruffled lake like a Lord of the Rings apparition.
The next day we left Vilnius in a downpour, on a roundabout route to the coast. An hour out of Vilnius, the purple thunderhead lifted and a dazzling light spilled down on the pine and birch forests and pastures, saturating the landscape with greens and yellows. It was as if someone had suddenly turned on fountains of chlorophyll. Tom, serving as D.J. and navigator, yielded up the CD player for a musical salute to Lithuania -- piano preludes by Mikalojus Ciurlionis, the painter, composer and collector of Lithuanian lore who is a cultural medium for the Lithuanian soul. The pianist on the CD was Vytautas Landsbergis, who led the independence movement and became the first president of post-Soviet Lithuania.
After a detour to the town of Siauliai for one of Europe's odder roadside attractions -- the Hill of Crosses, a weedy hill densely planted with thousands upon thousands of crucifixes, a pilgrimage site that honors, among other victims, the Lithuanians deported to Russia in the 19th century -- we made our way to the coast and caught a ferry to a narrow finger of shifting sand called the Curonian Spit. The spit is a sandbar 60 miles long, a national park with cool pine forest down its spine, a chain of four villages along the lagoon side and spacious, powdery white beaches on the Baltic side. On our drive through the forest, we encountered a large family of wild boars panhandling for snacks from delighted human visitors. We spent the night at a bed and breakfast in Nida, a pristine, red-roofed village nestled up against a vast sand dune. The spit has spent much of its history in German custody, and Germans still predominate among the foreign tourists who come to hike, rent bikes, toast on the beach or congregate at the beer gardens tucked into the forest. Thomas Mann lived here for a few years in the 30's, and his cottage is maintained as a museum that draws a steady tide of German literary pilgrims. Except for some remnants of Soviet-era rest homes -- grim concrete barracks hidden back under the pines, still serving as rock-bottom tourist lodging -- you would never suspect that you were fewer than three miles from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, home of the decrepit Baltic fleet.
The rest of our journey hugged the Baltic, north from Lithuania, around the Latvian coast, and finally up into Estonia. The coast is flat, so the road affords no view of the water, but from time to time we would turn left through the coastal forest to discover a fishing harbor or an industrial port. One foray took us to an abandoned Soviet watchtower, no doubt erected more to keep citizens in than spies out. The major beach resorts -- like Palanga in Lithuania and Jurmala in Latvia -- are more Jersey Shore than Riviera, jammed on sunny weekends with families and carousing college kids, and increasingly built up with holiday homes of newly prosperous Balts. Other seaside towns, like Parnu and Haapsalu in Estonia, are famous for their spas. We visited the Fra Mare spa in Haapsalu for a little rejuvenation, and found the experience more clinical than indulgent -- spotless hospital tile and fluorescent lights, staff members dressed in nursing scrubs and posted treatises touting the ostensible therapeutic effects of aromatherapy and mineral baths. After a thousand miles or so on the road, though, our mud wraps and expert massages left us relaxed, happy and sulphur scented.
One night we meandered in from the coast to spend the night at a cavernous stone-and-timber farmhouse converted to a guesthouse, near the medieval town of Kuldiga. Our host was Yuris Akis, an English-speaking double-bass player from Riga who retired from the jazz life into country hostelry. We joined him for a strange, multitasking evening -- drinking beer, watching a muted Formula One race on TV, listening to an a cappella jazz sextet sing Christmas music at top volume, all the while poring over our host's memorabilia from encounters with the likes of Duke Ellington and Oscar Peterson. His wife fired up the sauna for us before bed. We roasted and smacked each other with birch branches, and fell into a clean country sleep.
We had two nights in Riga, which of all the Baltic capitals is the one I could imagine happily living in. It is the largest, with about 800,000 residents, and the most cosmopolitan. It has a lovely old town hugged by leafy parks and a serene canal, and its own architectural treasure -- in particular, scores of immaculately restored buildings in variations of opulent Art Nouveau from the 1890's and early 1900's. Where new buildings have been slotted into the old town, they have mostly been done with reverence for the feel of the place. Walking the shady parks or sipping a beer in one of the cobbled squares to the music of a good local jazz band, you can readily believe this city has been home at various times to Sergei Eisenstein, Isadora Duncan and Richard Wagner. We stayed in a hotel fashioned from a convent whose courtyard frames a perfect view, over tiled rooftops, of the splendid Baroque dome of St. Peter's Basilica. At night, we fell asleep to cello and violin duets drifting up from an alley below our window.
On the last day of our excursion, Tom and I paid a visit to Lennart Meri, the eminence of Estonian independence -- writer, film director, philosopher and, until recently, president. Meri owns the tip of a peninsula north of Tallinn, where he has built a sleek house reinforced against the gales that blow in from Finland and landscaped with hardy evergreens. He has removed most of the evidence that it was once a Soviet military outpost, retaining only a rusty underground bomb shelter as a conversation piece.
As we strolled the grounds, he told me a story absent from Western histories of World War II. He pointed to a distant lighthouse that was, he said, the site of the first American casualty in the war, when a plane from Stockholm crashed in nearby waters. While Estonian fishermen watched, a Soviet submarine surfaced and officers boarded the downed plane. Moments later, shots were fired, and the Soviets emerged with a package of diplomatic post, carried by an American diplomat. The intrigues this coast has witnessed would make a shelf of thrillers. Meri tells the story, though, as current events, an illustration of the perfidy of large neighbors, the precariousness of liberty, the need for powerful friends.
On his patio, Meri poured us coffee and mulled a question about Estonia's national identity -- the eroding influence of global culture, the lingering effects of Soviet dominion -- and concluded that Estonia, like his landscaping project, is a work in progress.
"Except for the Vatican, I don't know any countries that are finished," he said.

 THE FURIES
By Fernanda Eberstadt.
451 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $26.
 CAN a beautiful heiress who's more interested in promoting international capitalism than experiencing motherhood find happiness with an unkempt, down-and-out Marxist who wants to raise a family? This is the question posed by Fernanda Eberstadt's ambitious fourth novel, "The Furies."
On a September afternoon in 1995, Gwen Lewis, director of an institute that's helping to establish a free-market economy in the former Soviet Union, spots a homeless man -- or so she assumes -- sleeping on a bench in Central Park. Days later, she runs into him again in, of all places, Novosibirsk. He turns out to be Gideon Wolkowitz, whose ragtag puppet troupe stages ideologically overloaded shows that equate the I.M.F. with the gulag. Before you know it, the statuesque jet-setter and the balding, bearded, "vaguely hippieish" provocateur are exchanging political barbs -- and lingering glances.
The formula's a tried-and-true one: girl nob meets boy slob. She's drawn to his lowlife earthiness; he considers his uptown girl "the most striking woman he has ever seen." Eberstadt (who's fond of stark dualities) doesn't stint on the contrasts. Gwen studied Russian and has worked for the State Department; Gideon has been a globe-trotting puppeteer since his teens. She's indifferent to religion; he (Marxism notwithstanding) is something of a Jewish mystic. She lives in a luxury high-rise that, "like an ocean liner," has a name; he shares a rent-controlled Lower East Side hovel over a Hispanic Pentecostal storefront church. If Gideon is baffled by "the anonymous-expensive banality of this executive suite that was her home," she's appalled by his seedy menage. (You might find such living situations, she reflects, "in Soviet Russia, but that's what you overthrew governments for.")
Readers familiar with the patrician-romances-proletarian recipe won't be surprised that Gwen already has a beau who's (a) handsome, successful and skilled at getting "the best tables at the right places" but also (b) a hopeless stiff whose pallid charms are no match for Gideon's raw sensuality. (All this, to be sure, we're more or less told flat out: Eberstadt hardly shows us this eminently suitable suitor, whose first name, Campbell, she apparently considers sufficient to get the idea across.) Nor does it come as a surprise when Gwen (unlike Daisy Buchanan) weds her poor boy -- or when the partnership proves not to have been made in heaven. For by this point, the facts are indisputable: Gwen's a spoiled princess who's gone slumming; Gideon's just plain obnoxious.
If these lovebirds are less than lovable, however, the novel's prose -- taut, fresh and vividly descriptive -- can be a positive delight. Like Tom Wolfe, Eberstadt is a precise and witty observer of life in Manhattan, where "murderously ambitous 26-year-olds" sip cocktails at midtown hotel bars" while pianists play "Miss Otis Regrets," where uptown "power nannies" mind their "power babies" and slouching "teenage gods" (a la T. J. Eckleburg in "Gatsby") look down on Times Square from billboards, "clothed and unclothed in Calvin Klein underpants and Calvin Klein undershirts . . . moony, slack-jawed, affectless."
Like Wolfe, too, Eberstadt is no neutral party in the culture wars: she manifestly esteems the more conservative side of each of her protagonists, sharing Gwen's disdain for Gideon's stale leftism while preferring his zeal for parenthood and religion to Gwen's arid, takeout-menu lifestyle, which is more or less equated with the zeitgeist. At one point, Eberstadt even interrupts her narrative, in good Victorian fashion, for an ardent mini-essay on The Way We Live Now, differentiating between love, which "you pour yourself into unchecked, a flood of vulnerability and sacrifice, strong as death, terrible as an army with banners," and a relationship, "a contractual arrangement, subject to renegotiation, dependent on each party's continued satisfaction." If Gwen and Gideon have a rocky time of it, she suggests, it's not just because of their personal failings but because we're "living in an age of antilove," when people "have forsaken love" for mere relationships. But she's got it backward: until modern times, Western marriage was commonly a "contractual arrangement" that had little to do with love. "Age of antilove"? Hardly. In the West, romantic love is more exalted than ever.
Eberstadt's misstep here is curious. So is the startlingly brutal way in which this otherwise empathic author uses homosexuals to put over her points about love and "antilove." First Gwen, sounding very much like an authorial mouthpiece, deplores the "aggressive moral equivalence" of a gay art dealer who doesn't realize his romantic attachment is inferior to hers. Then -- in a flurry of authorial manipulation -- the art dealer mocks same-sex marriage; a pro-gay argument is put into the mouth of a woman we're patently meant to see as a fool; and Gideon, when asked if gays should be permitted to wed, replies: "Sure . . . and monkeys should be allowed to vote." (Eberstadt's gay characters actually laugh at this.)
Presumably Eberstadt shares Gideon's view of same-sex marriage as a "travesty" of wedlock's "sacred import" -- in short, the apotheosis of our "age of antilove." But why would anyone who's "antilove" wish to marry? On the contrary, today's drive for gay nuptials is a sign of love's triumph. Eberstadt manifestly wants to come across in these pages as a fearless adversary of all things facile and ignorant, but those attributes, alas, pervade her meditations on love, sex and commitment.
Until near the end of this book, I assumed that just as "From Here to Eternity" sweeps relentlessly toward Dec. 7, 1941, "The Furies" -- which begins in 1995 and takes us through the next few years, every so often reminding us of the date -- was leading to the fateful convergences of Sept. 11, 2001. No. But such a climax may have been just what was needed at the end of this prolonged literary equivalent of a tight two-shot. A Sept. 11 climax, by zooming back to a wider picture of New York -- and civilization -- in crisis, would have served as a forceful reminder that the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world; that the times we live in are not defined by Calvin Klein posters, takeout menus or, for that matter, the likes of Gwen and Gideon. And that, last but not least, values like commitment, sacrifice and (yes) love are alive and well. Maybe you just have to know where to look for them.

Fancifying

 BODY:
'The Americans," Walt Whitman predicted, will be "the most fluent and melodious-voiced people in the world -- and the most perfect users of words." 
While wincing as Tony Soprano wields a single Chaucerian vulgarity as noun, verb, adjective and adverb, it is easy to wonder over the poet's wisdom. Perhaps, however, wishful Walt did anticipate something terribly prevalent in the American character: our poignant desire to sound genteel, our sincere pursuit of stylish pronunciation, our flirtation with the fancy. 
 And with the French. We are convinced that the French are haughty, stinky and perverse, and we deplore their government's unreliability as an ally. But we go gaga over their language. We call our coffeehouses cafes and our dress shops boutiques. We don't have drivers; we have chauffeurs. (These words we pronounce perfectly, just as we do rendezvous, coup d'etat, derriere, deja vu and menage a trois.) 
 To name the galaxy of intimate female apparel, we adopted the French word lingerie. But its pronunciation we utterly mangle. (The vendeuse in Galeries Lafayette in Paris has no idea what the "lawn-zheray" department is.) To do it right, we need simply take our own "tangerine," replace the "t" with an "l" and drop the second "n." Voila! But instead, we came up with a bastardized pronunciation that seems to sound more Gallic. 
It is probably the soupcon of nasalizing in the first syllable of lingerie that undermines our saying it correctly. (Ditto with ingenue.) But how do we explain our bungling of that final syllable? Could it be that the French "e" sound has a certain cachet? Perhaps it was this yearning for classiness that caused Senator John Warner, just before the second gulf war, to tell the CNN broadcaster Wolf Blitzer (a killer superhero name wasted on a mortal) that the "U.S. military found a cachet of Iraqi weapons."
Our rendering of lingerie would be understandable were we simply to Anglicize it, rhyming the first syllable with "tin" and the last with "tea." (This is how my Argentine ex-husband pronounces the word. He also accents the first syllable and -- sans logic -- uses a hard "g." The charming result in no way contributed to our divorce.)
Whence, though a term many editors deem arcane, is still in vogue. We reach for its high-minded sound, but in so doing often spoil its elegant shorthand by adding the redundant from. President Kennedy, during a 1962 speech in Newport, R.I., stated, "We are tied to the ocean from whence we came." Roger Morris, when discussing his book "Partners in Power," said, "They obviously didn't know from whence Bill Clinton came." Only Adelaide really gets away with it, when in "Guys and Dolls" she sings, "Take back your mink to from whence it came."
In our earnest striving for finesse, we sometimes embellish simple words, adorning them with extra syllables. Genetical and melodical feel more sonorous, less blunt, than their cleaner, three-syllabled selves. An MSNBC anchor, speaking early this year of a possible war with Iraq, said, "Considering the dangerousness of the situation. . . . " A few days later, an ABC newsman reported that "donators are giving over $100 million of their Matisse collection to the Met." And on PBS, Charlie Rose, in a discussion of Dolly, the first cloned sheep, was searching for the tag to identify a bioethicist's field of study. The allure of the deluxe bioethicist was so great that rather than whittle back to bioethics, Rose grafted on, uttering bioethecism.
Myriad such utterances occur in print and on television, not least of them the misuse of the stylish myriad. In late 2002, for example, Leon Panetta, the former Clinton chief of staff, told Blitzer of "a myriad of possibilities" for a new economics team. 
We are often lured to the chichi sounds of plural nouns because we perceive the correct forms as vulgar. We react to a stimuli, observe a phenomena and declare, "This criteria. . . . " President Clinton, in a commencement address, turned to J.F.K. Jr. and said, "I understand that you're an alumni." These errors result from our solemn desire to sound highbrow. But our misuse of the plurals threatens to bring about the extinction, in English, of Latin's singular suffixes. 
The impulse to sidestep coarseness produces "from everyone but you and I," I seeming more polished than me. Good gets short shrift, too. We often tell our friends, "You look well," when not referring to their vision. Our horror of appearing uncouth leads us all -- kings and commoners alike -- to opt for the ubiquitous adverb instead of the terse, accurate adjective. "This perfume smells strongly," we say, or "The fish tasted strangely." When asked how he felt about life on other planets, Carl Sagan said, "I feel passionately about it." One such construction is used so frequently that examples abound. Ben Bradlee of The Washington Post, discussing Jacqueline Kennedy's refusal to speak to him after Dallas, said, "I felt badly about that." Receiving a medal of distinction from Lenox Hill Hospital for making patients happy, Neil Simon said, "It's hard to feel badly when you're laughing." Even Hemingway, master of the taut, wrote in "A Moveable Feast," "I felt badly that Ford had been rude to him." Not one of the above, be assured, was bemoaning difficulty with his sense of touch.
We've borrowed again from the French to name a specific item of lingerie: the brassiere. We may abbreviate the word in this country, but the French have abandoned it altogether (especially on the Cote d'Azur). In France, a woman's undergarment for supporting the breasts is called a soutien-gorge, literally "throat-sustaining."
Speaking of bras, have you ever met a yoga teacher who doesn't instruct her students -- once they've achieved shoulder stands -- to come down from their inverted positions "very, very slowly, one vertebrae at a time"?

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Public Art Both Violent and Gorgeous

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
I PRACTICALLY jumped out of my shoes when the Chinese-born artist Cai Guo-Qiang finished a drawing in a borrowed Long Island studio earlier this summer. I wasn't shocked because the results were fabulous but because the final touch involved gunpowder, a lighted fuse, a bang and an orange flash.
 Tomorrow night, if all goes as planned, Mr. Cai will complete another drawing with explosives, but this one on a colossal scale in the sky over Central Park. The fireworks display, titled "Light Cycle," is to start at 7:45 from five points in the park between the Heckscher ball fields near 64th Street and the North Meadow at 98th Street, producing luminous pillars, a 1,000-foot halo over the Reservoir and a cascade of flares. The entire performance, months in preparation, should last about five minutes. 
 Mr. Cai -- his full name is pronounced sigh gwo chang -- is one of several artists from China who gained international attention during the 1990's, and one of the few who has sustained the momentum. He has been using gunpowder as an art medium for years. With it, in 1993, he created a six-mile-long "wall of fire" extending west from the end of the Great Wall of China in the Gobi Desert. 
In Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994, he attached packets of gunpowder to more than 100 helium balloons suspended in a spiral over the city. They were linked together by a fuse that ran down to a pit dug in the ground near the Atom Bomb memorial. The effect, when the fuse was lighted, was of fiery energy sucked into the earth, a mushroom cloud in reverse.
Last fall, for the inauguration of the Museum of Modern Art's temporary home in Queens, he designed a bridge of light that, for a few dazzling moments, arched over the East River. As magical as the image was, it had a somber aspect, as many of Mr. Cai's projects do. It referred to Sept. 11.
"I gave the city a rainbow, a symbol that comes after the storm," said Mr. Cai, who has lived in New York since 1995, in an e-mail message. Similar thinking underlies "Light Cycle." Commissioned by Creative Time, a nonprofit public-art agency, in cooperation with the city of New York and the Central Park Conservancy, the piece celebrates the park's 150th anniversary and is a metaphor for its seasonal cycles. At the same time, Mr. Cai also intends images of violent energy transformed into beauty to have a protective function for the city, to lie "like amulets over the heart of Manhattan."
The Museum of Modern Art piece last year went off without a hitch, but not all of the gunpowder projects have fared so well. There have been mistakes and accidents. In the case of a 1998 piece for Stockholm titled "Parting of the Sea," the long fuse stretched across a wide body of water sputtered out, leaving thousands of people with nothing to look at. Days before the opening of the 1996 Asia-Pacific Triennale in Australia, the pyrotechnic factory Mr. Cai was working with blew up, destroying his piece. (A hot line, 800-895-7780, will carry news of any "Light Cycle" changes.)
For tomorrow night's production, Mr. Cai has enlisted the expert assistance of Fireworks by Grucci, the Long Island-based pyrotechnics firm that has developed a technology of gunpowder shells guided by programmable microchips. "Light Cycle" will be set off by the push of a laptop key rather than with a match.
Even if the Central Park piece is a washout, though, the conceptual ambition behind Mr. Cai's art, with its spacious, macrocosmic, even galactic view of the world, is never in doubt.
Over the years he has created a long series of gunpowder works titled "Projects for Extraterrestrials," to which the Great Wall and Hiroshima pieces, as well as "Light Cycle," belong. Each is intended to be seen from outer space, "from the perspective of the universe," Mr. Cai says. A second series, "Projects for Humans," consists of proposals to be realized on various celestial bodies for the viewing pleasure of earthlings. A fireworks version of the Great Wall rippling across the moon is one pie-in-the-sky example.
For all its imaginative breadth, Mr. Cai's art is also grounded in history, or histories, including the history of gunpowder. By some accounts, the flammable substance was invented by the Chinese as a byproduct of an alchemical search for immorality, and was regarded as a medicine, a kind of cosmic stimulant. Exported to Europe, however, it became the basis of the new science of weaponry and was eventually used against, and by, China itself.
Such developments have personal resonance for Mr. Cai, an artist who has spent a career negotiating between Chinese and Western cultures and considers himself "in self-imposed exile from both." 
He was born in 1957 in the southern city of Quanzhou, the port from which the explorer Marco Polo began his return trip from China to Venice in the 13th century. From childhood, Mr. Cai remembers the sound of fireworks going off, as they do to celebrate any auspicious occasion. He also remembers the sound of artillery fire from a nearby army base, directed at the island of Taiwan, which lay across the strait.
His father, who worked in a state-run bookstore, fit the classic type of the scholar-artist: he was a landscape painter, practiced calligraphy and revered Chinese history. Implicit in his reverence -- and fundamental to traditional Chinese art -- is the belief that the finest human accomplishments are to be found in the past rather than to be hoped for in the future.
Mr. Cai, growing up in an era of cyclonic social change, followed a more rebellious model. He spent his teenage years immersed in martial arts and even starred in some Bruce Lee-type films. He was intrigued by contemporary Western art that he saw reproduced in magazines, from oil painting to Conceptualism, with its anything-goes freedom. But finding no art school that taught it, he enrolled at the Shanghai Drama Institute to study stage design, a collaborative medium emphasizing space, light, ephemeral time-based effects and audience response.
A Western-influenced Chinese avant-garde began to coalesce in the mid-1980's, but, unwilling to align himself with any group, he kept his distance. While his peers were producing politically pointed Pop paintings and installations, he took to hiking through the desolate Silk Road stretches of northwest China near Tibet, visiting archaeological sites, studying nature and painting portraits of people he met.
In 1984, he began to experiment with lighted gunpowder in paintings and drawings, letting the medium's unpredictability loosen up his ingrained formal control. What he was making at the time were essentially prototypes of the large drawing -- an abstract bridgelike image seared with fire onto paper -- that I saw him complete at Grucci's Long Island plant this summer.
He produces a fair number of such "burn" drawings. They remain important to him, he says, as "an extension of my childhood dream of being a painter." They are also the most collectible and exhibitable works by an artist who for the most part trafficks in evanescent materials. (An exhibition of the gunpowder studies he made for "Light Cycle" is on view at the Asia Society and Museum through Dec. 14.)
And it was ephemeral art -- explosion events, performances, installations -- that made his name. This happened in 1986, after he visited Japan, where he ended up living for nine years. There he developed, among other things, the "Projects for Extraterrestrials." By the early 1990's, he was gaining an international audience, though largely for noncombustible projects.
In a piece titled "Bring to Venice What Marco Polo Forgot" for the 1995 Venice Biennale, he transported an old-fashioned Chinese junk stocked with herbal medicines from Quanzhou to Italy, then sailed it up the Grand Canal on the 700th anniversary of the Italian explorer's return from the East.
"Cultural Melting Bath: Project for the 20th Century" at the Queens Museum of Art in 1997, his first New York solo show, consisted of a communal Jacuzzi with herb-infused water set in a circle of Chinese garden rocks. In an installation visually more arresting than it may sound, the rocks were arranged on the geomantic principles of feng shui to facilitate a flow of harmonious energy through an ethnically diverse city.
He took some heat for his 1999 Biennale contribution. Titled "Venice's Rent Collection Courtyard," it was a replica of a Social Realist sculptural tableau made in China in the 1960's. Pure anticapitalist agitprop, the original acquired near-religious sanctity during the Cultural Revolution. Mr. Cai won the Biennale's Golden Lion award but drew official ire from China, where he was accused of disrespecting a national icon and pandering to a Western appetite for exoticism.
Charges of Orientalism, of perpetuating "Eastern" stereotypes, have also been leveled at the gunpowder pieces. But Mr. Cai refers to his art as "supranational" and insists that it reflects his own past, which included an immersion in Western culture. "Seen from the Eastern perspective, I am actually quite Western," he says. "Since childhood my education has been based on dialectic training in Marxism."
At the same time, his attitude toward Western art, as toward virtually everything else, is elusive and contradictory. The first gunpowder-related piece he did in the United States, a photographic series titled "The Century With Mushroom Clouds: Project for the 20th Century" (1996), is a kind of mock-homage to the invasive, nature-altering 1970's earthworks of Robert Smithson and Michael Heizer, to whom he is sometimes compared. And a 1996 photograph of him igniting a hand-held explosive while facing the Statue of Liberty and the World Trade Center from across the Hudson can be read as a provocative take on the mercurial character of power, even to people to whom earth art means nothing.
What may be less accessible to a Western audience is the Asian side of the East-West equation in Mr. Cai's art, his Daoist Conceptualism. The volatile nature of gunpowder itself embodies a Daoist principle of cosmic energy sparked by the meeting of opposites: physically, minerals and fire; metaphysically, order and chaos, wholeness and fragmentation; nature and culture; creation and destruction, certainty and chance.
"I am looking for the unchanging through the always changing," Mr. Cai says. "The changes in nature are always changing, but the fact of change or evolution never does."
The dynamic of control and accident in the gunpowder pieces suggests the tension of discipline and spontaneity associated with calligraphy, that most honored of Chinese art forms. And calligraphy is intimately associated with the role of the scholar-artist, an identity that Mr. Cai once rejected but has come to accept for himself. This identity, with its model of the artist as a perpetual "amateur," untainted by professional ties, may in part explain why Mr. Cai, along with emigre artists like Gu Wenda and Xu Bing, has so far largely chosen to avoid gallery representation in a favor of a freelance status, working on commission for institutional or festival events.
A project planned with the Pompidou Center in Paris to create a "Chinese" fireworks tower to set beside and match in size the Eiffel Tower is one such event. "Light Cycle" is another. "The nature of the gunpowder project is especially significant at this time and in this city," he says. "The same materials can be used for destruction and terror, but can also be used constructively and beautifully as a creative and healing power."
Mr. Cai is well aware, however, that such events might easily be viewed as mere exercises in optical thrills, art-by-command, like court fetes. In fact, for him the real risk is less in the combustible chemistry of his work than in "the ceremonial banality of the materials, the entertainment quality, the expectations and flashiness brought by employing high-tech production." But he proceeds anyway, trying to mine something unexpected from expectations, ignite a chemical reaction between flashiness and illumination.
Whether you take Mr Cai as a showman or a philosopher, who would want to do without an artist who proposes turning the Grand Canyon into a terrestrial Milky Way? Or who, in 1999, came up with a project that called for everyone on earth to extinguish their lights for the second before and the second after the change of millennium, so that a strung-out planet could, however briefly, "eclipse into oblivion," and recoup some strength?
This is the stuff of a visionary, but unmystical art; complex in ideas, but tailored to a universal citizenry. In a world where politics, culture and nature are all unstable compounds, and everyone lives tensed in expectation of the next Big Bang, such art, like a throw of the I Ching, comes across as a judicious but exhilarating act of faith in the benignity of the unknown.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME; 
Controlling Apartments' Heat Costs

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the weather remains warm, there have already been reports that heating oil prices are likely to be higher than usual through the end of this year. Thus, it makes sense for responsible landlords and boards in charge of large multifamily buildings to look for ways to control energy costs and cut consumption by every means possible.
 "For many people who live in large apartment buildings, the window is their thermostat," said Richard Cherry, president of the Community Environmental Center, a nonprofit energy conservation organization based in Long Island City. 
 In short, one of the most common explanations for higher-than-necessary energy bills in multifamily residential buildings is that much of the heat produced goes out the window. Literally.
Mr. Cherry explained that unlike private homes -- which typically have thermostats that will turn on the heat when the temperature falls below a preset level -- most large residential buildings use what is known as a heat timer. With such a device, Mr. Cherry said, the building superintendent sets the timer to turn the system on and off for a predetermined period of time -- depending, usually, upon the outside temperature. 
The problem with such systems is that unless the heating system is properly balanced, some apartments will be too hot, some will be too cold and some may even be just right. "What then really throws this off, though, is that the superintendent usually ends up providing too much heat to most apartments because one apartment isn't warm enough," Mr. Cherry said.
Henry Gifford, president of Gifford Fuel Saving, a Manhattan energy consulting company, agreed. "The best way to conserve energy and save money is to stop overheating the building," he said. 
One way to do this in a building heated by a two-pipe steam system, a common setup, he said, is to install thermostats on every radiator in the building.
"This saves fuel and improves comfort by stopping the overheating," he said. With thermostats installed on every radiator, he explained, once a room reaches the preset temperature, a valve in the radiator shuts off the steam going to the radiator. The thermostats, which cost about $40 each, also help to alleviate problems when one side of a building has a tendency to be colder than the other and when the upper floors have a tendency to be warmer than the lower floors.
On systems using heat timers, Mr. Gifford said, it is important to properly position the outdoor temperature sensor -- called the weatherhead -- that controls the system. "I would estimate that at least 10 percent of apartment houses in Manhattan have the weatherhead located where it gets some interference for at least part of the day," he said. For example, if the weatherhead is exposed to direct sunlight or is near an exhaust from a kitchen or laundry room, it could send the wrong signals to the heating system.
Another major energy waster, Mr. Gifford said, is the system used to provide hot water. "The money wasted by an improperly set hot water system can be significant," he said, explaining that while the proper temperature for hot water in a residential building should be between 120 and 125 degrees, many buildings have hot water set to 140 degrees and even higher.
"Water over 140 degrees destroys the faucet washers," he said. "That means you end up with leaking faucets, and that means hot water going down the drain, and in the end it all means higher fuel and water and sewer bills." Mr. Gifford said that one way to determine what portion of a building's total fuel bill is used to heat hot water is to multiply the amount of fuel used in July and August by 6. "The resulting figure should be about the amount that it costs annually to make hot water," he said.
"If the hot water portion is 60 or 70 percent of the annual bill, the hot water is probably overheated and-or running down the sewer via leaky faucets," Mr. Gifford said. "If the hot water portion of the fuel bill is 10 to 20 percent of the annual total, then the building is probably overheated. And if the hot water portion is 30 or 40 percent of the annual bill, then things might be working properly. Then again, it could be that both the heat and hot water are set too high."
So how, then, does an owner or board get a better picture of the fuel efficiency of a building? "Get a buildingwide energy assessment," said Mr. Cherry of the Community Environmental Center. Such an assessment, he said, will provide a detailed snapshot of the building's heating and electrical systems and identify areas that need of attention. 
"The assessment will tell you what can be done to make your heating system more efficient and what probably isn't going to be worth doing," he said. Such an assessment may determine, for example, whether it makes economic sense to replace otherwise serviceable windows in the building with highly efficient, though relatively expensive, replacements. The assessment will also identify ways for buildings to save money on electrical energy -- often by doing something as simple as replacing incandescent lighting fixtures with fluorescent fixtures and compact fluorescent bulbs wherever possible. 
Mr. Cherry, who is also a technical consultant for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said that the authority provides free energy assessment for any buildings that receive government assistance. "And if you're not in a government-assisted building, Nyserda will pick up half the cost of the assessment if you hire one of the auditors approved by the authority," he said. (Additional information about Nyserda programs can be found on the authority's Web site at www.nyserda.com.)
Jack Freund, the vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, an organization of Manhattan building owners, said that if an energy assessment indicates that a building is being overheated, "fuel computers" can be installed. With such instruments, Mr. Freund said, the heating system is controlled by heat sensors distributed throughout the building. The sensors send information back to the computer, which determines when and for how long to run the system. "Some of our members have had huge savings with heat computers," he said.
Leo Lehrer, marketing director for the Rent Stabilization Association, said that another way for building owners to save money is to band together and buy in bulk.
"We're finding out that most small to midsized building owners out there really have no idea what a fair price is for fuel oil," he said. 
To address that problem, he said, the Rent Stabilization Association -- where membership is also open to co-op and condominium buildings -- sponsors a "bulk buying" program that results in significant savings for members who participate.
"I've come across building owners who were paying 35 and 40 cents above the R.S.A. price for oil," Mr. Lehrer said, adding that on average, participation in the bulk-buying program can cut members' fuel bills by 5 to 20 percent. 
Dan Karan, project director for the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a nonprofit housing organization in Manhattan, said building owners and boards should carefully examine their fuel-oil bills -- and then shop around -- to ensure they are paying the lowest price possible.
"Many building boards are unaware that the cost of fuel from one dealer to another can vary significantly," Mr. Karan said. "And very often buildings will get a price change from their current dealer without even being aware of it."
Finally, he said, building owners and boards should ensure that their maintenance personnel have a solid understanding of how the heating system works.
"Most superintendents do not understand the financial implications of turning up the heat," he said. "We typically tell them that for every 1 degree you raise the temperature in the building, you're raising your fuel bill by 3 percent."

HEADLINE: Office Rentals Tepid, but Sales Stay Hot 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE sluggish economic recovery has held down demand for office space in the metropolitan area. But an abundance of capital has meant that trophy office buildings in Manhattan have sold for eye-popping prices, such as the $1.4 billion paid for the General Motors Building. This apparent paradox continues the pattern of recent quarters, according to real estate professionals, suggesting that not much has changed in the commercial real estate market since the beginning of the year.
 The executives tie the weak demand by tenants to employment statistics. "We have not seen a lot of new hires; it seems as if we have a jobless recovery," said Peter G. Riguardi, the president of Jones Lang LaSalle, the brokerage and services company. "If that would improve, I'd be a lot more optimistic." 
 But the outlook for the future is still cloudy. Brokers who represent landlords say they see glimmers of activity that could mean space being removed from the market and a firming of rents. But brokers who specialize in representing tenants say that plenty of space is still hanging over the market and that the bottom may not have been reached. 
Nevertheless, with interest rates still relatively low and investors skeptical of other assets, the most desirable buildings in the city are still the subject of bidding wars, like the one for the G.M. Building, which sold for about $800 a square foot, compared with $300 to $400 square foot for more ordinary properties.
"Building prices are strong, but there are not that many for sale," said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of W&M Properties, a management and development company. "Everybody wants a certain type of product, but there is only so much of it."
He said the most desirable buildings are those filled with good-credit tenants tied to long leases. "Properties with rollovers are not popular because of the exposure to vacancy," he said. "That reduces the pool of properties for sale."
The market for retail space has been as uncertain as for offices, with some major deals concluded, but with others falling apart, brokers reported. Home Depot is due to enter Manhattan by opening two Expo Design Centers -- one in a 120,000-square-foot store on 23rd Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas and the other at the site of the old Alexander's store between 58th and 59th Streets and Lexington and Third Avenues.
But months of negotiations to bring the flagship Abercrombie & Fitch store to a 30,000-square-foot space at the southeast corner of 57th Street and Madison Avenue abruptly came to a halt when the retailer decided not to proceed. "That was a real disappointment," said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of Lansco, a brokerage specializing in retail properties. 
Meanwhile, the city's hotel operators are experiencing their third consecutive year of declining revenues, as a result of the falloff in international and business travel and Internet bargain-hunting on the part of leisure travelers, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. Sean Hennessey, the firm's director of hospitality consulting in the metropolitan area, said that a rapid upturn in travel is not expected anytime soon and that increased comparison shopping on the Internet by travelers will make it harder for hotel operators to nudge room rates higher.
"The outlook is weak as far as the eye can see," Mr. Hennessey said. "Any positive impressions are based on expectations, not facts."
The real estate executives who see signs of gathering strength in the office leasing market cite the fact that more space was leased in the first half of this year than in the corresponding period last year, and statistics showing an upward creep in the percentage of the asking rent that tenants are agreeing to pay when signing new leases in some parts of the city.
"Overall activity is up," said Bruce Mosler, the president of United States operations for Cushman & Wakefield, a brokerage and services company that represents both landlords and tenants. "We have leased 11.4 million square feet so far this year, compared to 9.2 million square feet in the same period in 2002."
He said sublet space, which competes with space being offered directly by landlords was down to 30 percent of the space in the market from 35 percent at the same time last year. At the top of the market in 1999 and 2000, sublease space totaled 18.6 and 18 percent of total vacancy, respectively, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
Mr. Mosler said the outlook in Manhattan was for "a slow, steady recovery."
But Gregg Lorberbaum, a managing principal of the New York office of the Staubach Company, a tenants' broker, does not see the fundamentals in place for an increase in demand. "The broad market in this town goes as Wall Street goes, and they are still laying off people and paying smaller bonuses," he said.
He said that layoffs have increased the amount of "shadow space" that is available. This is space that is left vacant or significantly underused after a company's work force is downsized, but is not officially on the market while the company leasing it decides whether to offer it for sublet or keep for future growth.
Those decisions are complicated by accounting rules that require charges against current earnings for the difference between any sublet rent received and the direct rent paid to the landlord. "If a company has to take other writedowns, they probably will throw real estate in as well," Mr. Lorberbaum said. "Nevertheless, shadow space will put downward pressure on rents."
But the accounting rules may complicate property-management decisions, particularly for publicly owned companies subject to the constant scrutiny of financial analysts, Mr. Malkin said. "If a company abandons space, it must recognize the entire lease obligation immediately," he said. "If you are talking about 500,000 square feet for 10 years, that could be a $150 million hit and the company may just decide to sit on the space," he added. "It has a lot to do with managing earnings."
Mr. Lorberbaum said that while effective rents may be firming in some areas of Manhattan, others are still in decline. "We are not close to the bottom in Downtown," he said.
James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, also a tenants' broker, noted the stubbornly high unemployment and the fact that the remaining employees at many companies are being compressed into less space as reasons that more space is coming to the market than is being leased. "There was 500,000 square feet of negative absorption in the second quarter of this year," he said, using an industry term meaning more space was offered than was removed.
He said the outlook is that employment and economic growth for the rest of the year will be slow at best. That makes it a good time for tenants to lock in current rents. "Smart tenants are focused on renewals," he said. "These rents will not go on forever."
The overhang of office space on the market means that tenants can be pickier about where they locate, avoiding older buildings with outdated equipment, known in the industry as Class C space, said Mark S. Weiss, an executive vice president of Newmark & Company Real Estate. Instead, they can choose the newest and best located buildings, known as Class A, or those that are somewhat older, but often in good locations, known as Class B.
"Class A is trading at about 10 percent off asking rents, Class B is 15 to 20 percent off and Class C is not trading at all," he said. "Nobody is making deals in Class C because there is so much Class B available at Class C prices."
John Powers, the president for tristate operations for CB Richard Ellis, the brokerage and services company that recently acquired the New York-based Insignia/ESG, said he expected availability -- the industry term for space that is vacant or available for sublease -- to drop slowly for the rest of the year, and effective rents, which reflect the value of periods of free rent and contributions to alter or finish interior space, to increase. "Availability by the end of the year will be below where it is now, although Downtown will be softer," he said.
CBRE recently published some information rarely made available by brokers: how far actual rents were discounted from the landlord's asking rent, with the data shown by submarkets in Manhattan. The figures disclose a modest recovery in Midtown, from a recent low of 85.12 percent of asking rents early this year to 88.16 percent about midyear.
The situation in Midtown South is more complicated. The discount from asking rent fell as low as 77 percent in the third quarter of last year before rising to 92 percent in the first quarter of this year, at a time when the asking rents were declining from the mid $30's per square foot to the low $30's. Asking rents leveled off in the low $30's at midyear and the taking rate to 85.9 percent.
According to the figures, the Downtown market is softening, even though asking rents have been declining there as well. Taking rents rose from a recent low of 79 percent in the second quarter of last year to as high as 86 percent in the first quarter of this year. But the ratio fell to 73 percent in the most recent quarter, as some big sublease deals at the World Financial Center pulled down the average.
These figures, while interesting, may represent a false precision in a market where landlords are said to be increasingly aggressive in marketing space and tenants are looking for deals. "Nobody really knows where the market is," said Marcus Rayner, a principal in Cresa Partners, a tenants' broker. "If someone is asking $75 a foot for Class A space, I'd try to get it for $50."
In the suburbs, particularly in New Jersey, the office leasing market "is selectively firming up," according to Jeffrey Dunne, a vice chairman of CB Richard Ellis. He said space in the northern part of the state near Parsippany was experiencing more demand than in the central sections near places like Piscataway.
Nevertheless, he said that rents on average are lower now than they were in January, reflecting the trend in the entire metropolitan region.
Sublease space continued to be a large factor in New Jersey. At midyear there were 6.8 million square feet of sublet space available in the northern part of the state, according to FMB Asset Management of Purchase, N.Y., and 17.7 million square feet of direct availability.
In Westchester County, N.Y., the sublet market totaled 839,000 square feet compared with 4.13 million directly available. In Fairfield County, Conn., space available for sublet accounted for 3 million of 7.8 million square feet of total vacancy.

Investment Sales
The Highest Price Ever Paid
The sale of the General Motors Building at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street to the New York developer Harry Macklowe brought the highest price ever paid for a skyscraper in this country, $1.4 billion. Although more than two dozen groups bid for the property, which one real estate executive described as being like the Star of India sapphire and another as "the best building in the city," only Mr. Macklowe was willing to put down a $50 million nonrefundable deposit to win the deal.
The sale demonstrates there is "still a place for trophy properties," said John Cicero, a managing principal in Miller Cicero, a commercial real estate appraisal company. And for Mr. Macklowe, it represents "the crowning achievement of a career in New York real estate," Mr. Cicero said.
Even so, the total value of transactions in the city for the year could end up below the total for 2002 because of the scarcity of properties for sale, said Darcy Stacom, an executive vice president of CB Richard Ellis. "About $1.9 billion has closed, $730 million are under contract and $2.3 billion are in active negotiation, which puts us at about $5 billion," she said. "A typical year is about $6 billion."
Although some real estate executives see a "disconnect" between the soft market for office leasing and the soaring price of buildings, the term does not recognize that some investors consider more than the rent roll as they evaluate properties, said James D. Kuhn, the president of Newmark.
"Trophy properties have replaced blue chip stocks as a safe place to invest in a low-interest-rate environment," he said. "With low rents and great prospects, institutional investors believe rents will catch up with prices." He added that the preferred investment vehicles for many institutions are top rated corporate bonds or prime real estate. 
The General Motors purchase makes sense if rents in the building rise above the $100 a square foot level, he said. Current rents in the building range from the $40's to $70's a square foot for long-term tenants, according to Robert Emden, vice chairman of USI Real Estate Advisors and a specialist in the area near the building. More recently signed leases are in the $80's and $90's and he said new leases on the upper floors "will surely be in triple digits."
But a rapid 1.4 percentage point rise in interest rates during the summer may have killed some deals and forced buyers to scramble to lock in fixed-rate financing, said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a sales broker. "It was the fastest rise in interest rates in 40 years and it is going to have an effect on pricing," he said.
He said the increase was particularly tough on purchasers who had put together deals based on floating rate financing. "They can't keep floating at these levels," he said. "They have to get fixed or get killed." 
The rise in rates also reduced or eliminated the positive arbitrage present in some deals that were being made early in the year -- where the rate of return provided by the rents was higher than the cost of capital, said John Lyons, the president of Granite Partners, a real estate investment bank.
In addition, Mr. Lyons said, the uncertain outlook for interest rates is inducing lenders to increase their spreads, the premium they charge over the basic cost of money to cover their risk, thus increasing the cost of financing.
"Before, lenders would charge 150 basis points over the rate on a 10-year Treasury bond," he said, referring to the hundredths of a percent by which most lending transactions are measured. "Now they want 170 or 200 basis points."

Retail Properties
A Bit More Interest In Prime Spots
Bank branches and drugstores have been the biggest players in the retail sector, where "the general climate was a little better than last year," according to Robert K. Futterman, the head of the brokerage bearing his name.
Mr. Futterman said the retail space in buildings has become a more important factor in the overall price of the properties, particularly if they are located on major shopping routes such as Madison and Fifth Avenues. "People call me and ask me what is the value of the retail space," he said. "And I tell them that the ground level on Fifth Avenue can be $1,000 a foot."
Retail specialists say Home Depot's Expo Design Centers, two of which are planned for Manhattan, are different from the giant warehouse stores in the suburbs. The emphasis is on home furnishings and accessories rather than lumber and garden tools, said Mr. Victor of Lansco. "It will be a refined version, at a higher price point," he said.
Competition for space in the most desirable areas has increased this year compared with last, although rents have not moved up appreciably, according to Faith H. Consolo, vice chairman of Garrick Aug, a retail broker. "If you had six or eight offers for a space in the past, you have a dozen now," she said. 
But more marginal areas, like the meat market district on West 14th Street, are less active, brokers report. "The B locations sit on the market a lot longer," said Gene P. Spiegelman, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield.

Manhattan Hotels
Occupancy and Rates Still Falling
The occupancy rate at hotels in Manhattan dropped to 70.7 percent in the first half of this year, compared with 73.5 percent in the comparable period of 2002, according to PrivewaterhouseCoopers. The average cost for a hotel room also fell, to $171.34 a night from $182.54 in the earlier period. This had the effect of reducing the revenue per available room, a key industry indicator, to $131.12 from $143.84 in the first half of 2002.
Of course, the numbers in Manhattan are still far above the national averages. Nationwide, the average nightly rate was $83.16 last year.
Independently operated hotels were harder hit than those affiliated with chains in every category. The independents' occupancy was off 4.2 percentage points compared with 3.5 points for the chains, and average room rate was down 9.1 percentage points compared with a decline of 4.6 points. These two factors resulted in a decline in revenue per available room of 13.4 points for the independents compared with a decline of 6.6 points for the chains.

Here Come theDividends. But Don't Cheer Yet.

BYLINE:  By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
FOR Robert J. Glickman and the other board members of Corus Bankshares Inc., raising the company's dividend earlier this year was an easy decision.
 On June 4, Corus, based in Chicago, said it was more than tripling the quarterly payment, to 50 cents a share, from 16.5 cents. 
 "My family owns about 50 percent of the stock, so it's not difficult for me to put myself in the shoes of the shareholders," said Mr. Glickman, Corus's president and chief executive. "Before, it was inefficient to pay large dividends. They were taxed too high. Now, we're paying out about 50 percent of our earnings," compared with 17 percent before, he said. 
This year, Congress cut the top tax rate on dividends to 15 percent from more than 38 percent. The cut gave dividends a fresh coat of lacquer; they had lost their sheen in the technology boom of the 1990's, when investors preferred growth stocks that typically did not pay dividends. And with interest rates near 40-year lows, many dividend yields look good compared with those on bonds and money market accounts.
Yet for all the publicity about dividends, many financial advisers and academics say the reasons for investing in dividend-paying stocks, and the best ways to select them, haven't changed. In other words, if dividends had a place in a portfolio before the tax cut, they have a place in it now -- and if they didn't before, they don't now.
"I tell my clients not to be tax-wise but financially stupid," said Deborah J. Frazier, a financial planner in Chapel Hill, N.C. Ms. Frazier counsels clients not to rush into dividend stocks just because they are now taxed more favorably. After all, she said, such stocks can zig and zag in value, just as other stocks do. "I ask them, 'How's it going to feel if your $5,000 is worth 4,800?' "
Certainly, investors now have more dividend-paying stocks from which to choose. As of last Tuesday, 365 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were paying dividends, 14 more than at the end of last year, said Howard J. Silverblatt, an equity market analyst at S.& P.
The year-end number of dividend payers in the S.& P. 500 has not grown by double digits since 1980; in most years in that time, it has fallen. And dividend yields remain relatively low. On June 30, the average yield for the S.& P. 500 for the preceding 12 months was 1.66 percent, Mr. Silverblatt said, versus 4.14 percent on June 30, 1983. The long decline reflects lower interest rates and companies' decisions to refrain from raising or even paying dividends.
But there are signs that dividends are fashionable again. Even Microsoft, once the symbol of growth stocks that paid no dividends, set up a common-stock dividend in January. On Friday, it raised the annual dividend to 16 cents from 8 cents a share.
WALL STREET aims to cash in on the trend. More than a dozen new mutual funds focusing on dividend-paying stocks have filed for registration. And J. P. Morgan published a report in July saying that several well-known companies on Nasdaq, including Oracle and Dell, had enough cash to easily begin paying dividends. The Morgan report was suggesting that wealthy customers consider buying dividend swaps -- contracts that let investors bet on whether dividends will increase or decrease. 
In general, dividend-paying stocks have tended to be as old economy as Oracle and Dell are new. They have been mature and predictable -- in short, dull. "These aren't story stocks like growth stocks," said Michael A. Goldstein, a finance professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. "It's the tortoise and the hare; they're the tortoise -- the long-term, steady performer."
Historically, utilities, banks and insurers have typified dividend payers. When such businesses are well run, they produce a steady stream of cash from operations.
"We've seen plenty of companies fudge earnings and, in the case of a few, even manipulate revenue," said Joseph Lisanti, an editor for Standard & Poor's and co-author of "The Dividend Rich Investor: Building Wealth With High-Quality, Dividend-Paying Stocks." "But you can't fake the dividend. You either pay it or don't."
When assessing a company's dividend, investors often look at two numbers: dividend yield and payout ratio.
Yield is calculated by dividing a company's annual dividend by its stock price. Mark A. Sellers, an equity strategist at Morningstar Inc., likes companies that pay "healthy but not too-high dividends -- a yield of 3 percent or 3.5 percent." He stays away from those that yield more than 4.5 percent; a figure that high suggests that the company may have limited growth prospects and thus a low stock price.
Take Eastman Kodak, which yields 6.49 percent. "They just don't have anywhere productive to invest their cash, so you're not going to get much growth," Mr. Sellers said. "The yield is all you're going to get."
Gerard Meuchner, a Kodak spokesman, said, "We reject the thesis that we have no investment opportunities," adding that the company continues to channel cash into two of its promising divisions, medical imaging and digital services for the entertainment industry. 
Payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend by earnings. As a rule of thumb, Mr. Sellers said, a reasonable ratio is 50 percent. That means a company is paying out half its earnings in dividends and keeping the other half for investments. "But if a company has no growth opportunities, I want its payout to be 100 percent," he said.
But those numbers alone don't tell you everything about a dividend. "You have to understand where the free cash flow is coming from," said Lakshmi Seshadri, a vice president for quantitative equity and derivatives strategy at J.P. Morgan. To do that, you need to do a bit of research on the company, examining, for example, its mix of businesses and prospects.
A guaranteed return isn't the only reason to invest in dividend payers. A dividend can also signal that managers believe their company has good prospects and that they are attuned to shareholders' interests.
"DIVIDENDS are sticky," said Jennifer L. Blouin, an accounting professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "Managers don't like to cut them," she said, for fear that investors perceive the cut as lack of confidence. More than that, a dividend is "a sign that management isn't robbing you," she said. "They're constraining themselves by giving you back your money."
Mr. Goldstein of Babson elaborated: "Dividends are good because they remind the C.E.O. four times a year that it's not his company."
In this view, managers are no different from other people. When they have cash, they like to spend it, and not always sensibly. But prudent managers will return cash to shareholders in dividends if they don't believe they can invest it profitably.
Michael C. Jensen, a professor emeritus of business administration at Harvard, developed the theory that paying dividends, and thus reducing cash on hand, forces managers to return to the market to seek money that they need for new projects. This acts as a reality check on their plans and prevents them from squandering cash.
Some solid companies don't pay dividends. Consider Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company of Warren E. Buffett. Mr. Buffett shuns technology, preferring to invest in companies that sell straightforward stuff like razors, newspapers and insurance. Among his holdings at the end of 2002 were American Express, Coca-Cola, Gillette and Wells Fargo -- all dividend payers.
But Berkshire doesn't pay one. Nor should it, Mr. Goldstein said.
"The reason you don't want a Berkshire Hathaway dividend," he said, "is because you believe Warren Buffett can invest the money better than you can."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Carl Domino; 
Northern Large Cap Value Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
CARL DOMINO typically buys big, unpopular, high-dividend-paying companies for his $650 million Northern Large Cap Value fund.
 "We generally buy companies that don't have such good management and aren't admired by the market," he said from his office in West Palm Beach, Fla. "With dividends, we get paid while we wait for companies to regain their footing and the psychological cloud to lift." He tends to buy stocks when their dividend yield is at least about 2 percent. 
 But the market decline last spring resulted in lower prices and higher yields for many stocks. That allowed Mr. Domino to scoop up shares of what he regards as high-quality companies, increasing the fund's potential return and decreasing risk.
Over all, the companies in the portfolio yield 2.5 percent, on average, versus 1.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The fund gained 2.8 percent, annualized, for the three years through Thursday, versus losses of 3.1 percent for its peer group of funds that buy large value stocks, and 10.6 percent, on average, for the S.& P. 500, according to Morningstar Inc.
The fund gained 14.8 percent in the last 12 months, compared with gains of 11.2 percent for its group and 13.6 percent for the index.
Mr. Domino, 59, is the fund's lead manager and a senior vice president of Northern Trust Investments, the fund's adviser and a unit of the Northern Trust Company. The adviser manages $2.6 billion for institutions and individuals.
Mr. Domino chooses the fund's 45 to 50 stocks from companies with market capitalizations of at least $5 billion. Picking stocks, he says, is like putting together a football team.
First, he said, "build a strong defense, because if you don't give up any points you'll win the game." To him, a good defense means companies with strong cash flow and solid balance sheets.
Strong cash flow protects a company's dividend, he explained, even when the company's turnaround takes longer than he expects. Low debt, he said, helps companies weather the storm, even if their stock prices have hit new lows.
A good offense, Mr. Domino said, results from companies that have a "catalyst for appreciation." Those catalysts can include an economic upturn, new management, demographic trends, revised business strategies or mergers. Managers, he added, should be able to "show us business, financial and operating strategies that increase dividends and growth over the long term."
He expects the total market return of S.& P. 500 companies -- stock-price appreciation plus dividends -- to average 8 to 12 percent a year over the next 5 to 10 years. "Companies are running lean and mean, productivity is way up, and dividends should increase," prompted partly by new tax breaks for dividends, he said.
He first bought shares of Motorola in April, paying $8.21, on average. The shares are now at $10.84 and yield 1.48 percent. He called the company "the best in the electronics and semiconductor business," and said he expects strong performance when the overall technology sector rebounds. "If they show some earnings momentum," he said, "the stock could double from here."
Management is cutting costs and researching new products, he said, but the main catalyst is expected to be a future pickup in consumer demand. The company is using its cash flow to reduce debt, he said.
MR. DOMINO began buying shares of Coca-Cola in February; they now yield 1.9 percent. The company has a good balance sheet and strong cash flow, he said. Its water business is doing well, he added, and its multinational operations will benefit from the dollar's weakness.
He paid $40.11, on average, for the shares. They now trade at $43.99. 
Mr. Domino calls another holding, Morgan Stanley, the "premier brokerage firm" with a good retail business. But the catalysts for price appreciation, he said, are its institutional business services -- for initial offerings, for example, and mergers and acquisitions -- which will be very profitable when capital markets strengthen. While it carries some debt, he said, he is satisfied with its financial strength. The shares now yield 1.88 percent. 
The fund first bought shares in September 2001 at an average of $39.31 and has added to its position; the stock is now at $48.86.

HEADLINE: Beyond File-Sharing; A Nation of Copiers 

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND; Ruth La Ferla contributed to this article.

 BODY:
THE week the music industry brought suit against 261 users of Internet file-sharing services, Donald L. McCabe was in St. Louis to talk about a different form of digital copying. Mr. McCabe, a Rutgers University professor, has made a career of studying the cheating of American high school and college students. His most recent study found that cheating was spreading almost like file-sharing. Of more than 18,000 students surveyed, 38 percent said they had lifted material from the Internet for use in papers in the last year. 
 More striking to Mr. McCabe, 44 percent said they considered this sampling no big deal. Because the Internet makes it easy to copy information, he said, "it's made it much more tempting." 
 "I'm not sure it's shifted values yet," he continued. "But for a lot of students, it's heading in that direction." 
In fact, for many people, that shift has already come. Like file-sharing -- which 60 million Americans have tried -- cutting and pasting from the Internet is just one part of a broader shift toward all copying, all the time. 
Consider a night out in the wireless city: Throw on a faux-vintage sports jersey, grab a bootleg Prada bag and head to the Cineplex for the sequel to a movie based on a television show. Afterward, log on to KaZaA and download the movie's title song, based on a digital sample. While you're online, visit a blog with links to published movie gossip and use your pirated e-mail program to send tidbits to your hundred closest friends. Curl up with a best seller by Stephen E. Ambrose or Doris Kearns Goodwin, who last year admitted to slipping materials from other texts into their books. 
Most of these activities would have been difficult or impossible a generation ago. They differ widely in their legal and ethical implications. (For example, you can't prosecute someone just for producing "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.") But together they suggest a broad relationship between new technology and a value system that seems shaped to it. In a nation that flaunts its capacities to produce and consume, much of the culture's heat now lies with the ability to cut, paste, clip, sample, quote, recycle, customize and recirculate. It is tempting to ascribe the Culture of the Copy to college students, but its values run deeper. The United States economy shed 44,000 manufacturing jobs last month, continuing a long-running trend away from production. Since the 1980's, when liberalized trade laws made it easier to "outsource" manufacturing to subcontractors in the developing world, companies like Nike or Tommy Hilfiger havecompeted in what Naomi Klein, in her 2000 book "No Logo," described as "a race toward weightlessness," in which production is a hindrance, not an asset. In the brand market, value lies not in making things but in copying one's logo onto as many of them as possible. 
D.J.'s, file sharers, handbag cloners, student plagiarists and some bloggers simply do what brand companies do: they reproduce work made elsewhere at lower rates, adding their own signature and mix. The legal ramifications may be different, but the action is the same. 
"The quintessential American company was Enron, which made nothing," said Neal Gabler, author of "Life the Movie." In today's culture, he added, "the product is almost immaterial; it's the consciousness about it."
"What the Internet does is, it pries everything out of moral context and lets people feel knowing about it," he said, because the skills used to cut and paste something with a computer are more valued than those used to manufacture it. 
"In a sense, Internet technology is a metaphor for the new morality. As long as you can get it, it doesn't matter how." 
On a recent morning on Canal Street, crowds of shoppers, most past their undergraduate years, brought the metaphor to life, plucking up fake Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Kate Spade handbags. A New Jersey woman named Linda Dorian, plumping for two bootleg Vuittons, compared her purchases to downloading music. "Somehow everybody seems to be making out," she said. "I don't see any poor rock stars. I don't see any poor designers." 
Besides, she added, buying the fake is cooler, just as Grokster, a file-sharing program, has a cachet the Wal-Mart CD counter cannot match. "Shopping for copies is getting to be a trend," she said. 
As technology has produced a new ecology of copying, it has pushed into uncharted territories of ethics and the law, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, author of "Copyrights and Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property and How It Threatens Creativity" and director of communication studies at New York University. He said he has had 10 percent of his students turn in whole papers copied from the Internet, not realizing that he could Google them into big trouble. "We're coming up on 10 years of widespread use of the Internet," he said. "We should have better discussions of a code of ethics for dealing with these materials. The rule of law will always incompletely and perhaps negatively affect the Internet."
Nearly 70 years ago, the critic Walter Benjamin addressed the aesthetic limitations of the copy in a famous essay about photography and authenticity, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." Benjamin argued that even a perfect copy lacked the contextual meaning of the real thing. Since then, postmodern critics have developed dense theories of simulacra, bricolage and pastiche that could daze a tuna at 20 paces. 
Now the bricoleurs are living next door, and they look nothing like the monographs said they would. "Somehow I don't think it comes from avant-garde theory," said Louis Menand, author of "The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America." The KaZaA community can burn "All About the Benjamins," the song or the movie, without the endorsement of Walter. 
"They wouldn't say it's all a simulacrum anyway," Mr. Menand said. "If they could say that they wouldn't need to copy their papers online." 
In the current universe of the copy, the looseness of context is everything. Most users of music file-sharing services do not copy the products for sale by the music industry. While the industry sells albums, artificially shaped to the capacities of their commercial format, LP or CD, file-sharers tend to rip songs. 
As their favorite musicians recombine digital samples to create new music, downloaders recombine digital songs in new contexts.
"I don't think they think of it as copying music," said Joe Levy, deputy managing editor of Rolling Stone. "It's a very individual experience for them. They want the songs they want in the order they want. Then it becomes not the new Mary J. Blige album, but their own mix. It's a much more individual package of music. Kids view it as an interactive and creative act."
Betsy Frank, the executive vice president for research and planning at MTV Networks, who studies young TV and music audiences, said the people in her focus groups tended to describe copying as an assertive act, a way of navigating a media environment that bombards them with information -- some good, some bad, most of it a little of both. "They can rationalize downloading music or term papers extremely effectively as using their skills to select what works for them," she said. 
The law, of course, will inevitably catch up. When rap acts started sampling James Brown records in the 1980's, complaints raged that they were violating copyrights and the principles of art. In a Bronx home studio in 1987, the producer Jazzy Jay described the law of the copy: "The laws on taking samples are, You take 'em until you get caught." 
Two decades later, musicians usually pay for their samples, and the aesthetic argument -- that sampling was theft, not music -- has quieted. Now sample fees are part of the business model, and no one seems to worry about whether it is art. 
At both stages, value judgments about copying followed technology and money, not the other way around. 
In the culture of copying, technological considerations have trumped ethical ones: if you upload it, they will download. 
LAST week's lawsuits against file-sharers are an attempt to get the public to treat copying not as a question of technological possibility or moral implications, but as a threat to the wallet. A study by Forrester Research found that 68 percent of burners said they would stop if they thought they might get in serious trouble. As in sampling, the moral questions should follow the financial ones, said Josh Bernoff, the principal analyst covering media and entertainment at Forrester. 
But the process still had some hurdles to get over, Mr. Bernoff admitted. Recently he was discussing his research with an executive at a media organization that has been very aggressive about trying to discourage file-sharing. When Mr. Bernoff asked the executive how he had gotten the report, which Forrester sells for $895, the man hesitated. 
"They got a copy from one of the studios," Mr. Bernoff said. "Here is an organization that's saying that stealing hurts the little people, and they took our intellectual property and they shuttled it around like a text file." 
The aesthetic fallout of all this copying will be harder to sort. In a culture that assigns diminishing value to production, can copying really fill the void? The hypothetical night out involves many aesthetic decisions but little that can be called art. 
Mr. Menand noted that his students who downloaded papers from the Internet often picked mediocre work, perhaps thinking it would be less noticeable. The availability of obscure, non-Britney music on KaZaA -- one of the justifications cited by users -- has done nothing to stop Hilary Duff, the overpackaged star of the "Lizzie McGuire" movie and series, from having the No.1 album in the country this week. If this is the democracy of the copy, it is enough to make one long for the elitism of creative genius. 
Ms. Frank, the MTV executive, noted the limitations of unlimited customization, even amid unlimited access. For young Americans, she said, "because of the way they've trained themselves to use media, they never have to be exposed to an idea, an artist, or anything that they did not select for themselves."

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
Putting the Corporation in the Dock

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
"NOTHING is illegal if 100 businessmen decide to do it." 
 After two years of corporate scandals, billions of dollars in investor losses and a tawdry parade of guilty-pleading corporate princelings -- the latest, on Wednesday, was Ben F. Glisan Jr., a former treasurer at Enron -- it's hard not to love a book that opens with that ruefully apt observation, attributed to Andrew J. Young Jr., the former Atlanta mayor and ambassador to the United Nations. 
 That was just the first laugh-out-loud moment in "Gangs of America" (Berrett-Koelher Publishers), Tom Nace's provocative and entertaining examination of the rise of corporate power in America. It is followed by wonderful vignettes of the obscure jurists, lobbyists and business executives who helped slap together the intellectual bricks and legal mortar of the American Corporation. 
The often lopsided conclusions drawn from this engaging history will infuriate or exasperate many readers. Mr. Nace successfully founded the Peachpit Press, a technology publishing house, and is thus a baptized capitalist himself, but he nevertheless thinks that corporations have too much power and he wants citizens to do something about it. Even if you disagree with his conclusions, no one but the most humorless acolyte of the capitalist religion could be bored by the evidence he gathers.
That is a surprising and welcome achievement, because most of the business-bashing books that tumble down on us these days are the literary equivalent of fingernails scraping across a blackboard. And that's a shame, because behind all the caterwauling about "Corporation Rex" are some profoundly important questions about the balance between the virtues of our civic institutions and the demands of our corporate interests. America is long overdue for a less rapturous re-examination of its continuing experiment with the joint-stock, limited-liability business form that we call the corporation. Despite its unfortunately pugnacious title, "Gangs of America" addresses both needs with lively insights and refreshing research.
Mr. Nace opens with a succinct account of how General Motors and a handful of other giant corporations helped engineer the eclipse of America's electric streetcar system in the 1930's and 40's. But, thankfully, this is not another catalog of corporate conspiracies and corruption. Instead, Mr. Nace is curious about how corporations -- those merely imaginary constructions of legal paperwork -- acquired their power and rights.
His research took him deep into the archives of the 14th Amendment, at least as important for corporate Americans as it was for African-Americans. He dusts off some shocking but largely forgotten discoveries about the Supreme Court case that is the Rosetta stone of corporate law. And he examines the little-noticed contributions to corporate power made by Lewis F. Powell Jr., the Supreme Court Justice who died in 1998.
"Powell tended to be a bridge builder between conservatives and liberals on social issues such as abortion," Mr. Nace writes. "But in his advocacy on behalf of large corporations, Powell was anything but moderate." In 1971, two months before his nomination to the Supreme Court, Mr. Powell drafted a memorandum for the United States Chamber of Commerce warning that free enterprise was fighting for its life against passionate antibusiness forces in American society. "As every business executive knows, few elements of American society today have as little influence in government as the American businessman," Mr. Powell wrote just three decades ago. He added, "One does not exaggerate to say that, in terms of political influence with respect to the course of legislation and government action, the American business executive is truly the 'forgotten man.' "
How we got from there to the point where energy executives are intimately involved in the drafting of American energy policy is just one of the fresh strands of historical evidence woven into Mr. Nace's story.
Of course, there are flaws, two of them fairly serious. Mr. Nace almost entirely ignores the American shareholder. He approaches corporations as "them," separate and threatening. In fact, in the spirit of Pogo, the Walt Kelly cartoon character, we must increasingly say that we have met the corporation and it is us. Mr. Nace also slights the contributions the corporate form has made to average Americans' prosperity -- aside from a whimsical acknowledgment that "this book owes its existence to a computer made by Toshiba Corp., software from Microsoft Corp., electricity supplied by Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. and coffee roasted by Peet's Inc."
FORTUNATELY, Mr. Nace's case for the prosecution is ably balanced in bookstores these days by the case for the defense, "The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea" (Modern Library) by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, two writers for The Economist. By itself, "The Company" is too rosy by half about the history of the joint-stock corporation. Where are the greedy appetites, brazen vote-buying and courtroom arm-twisting? And unlike Mr. Nace, these writers think the future belongs to smaller, nimble corporations, not the multinational giants.
But "Gangs of America" and "The Company" agree that the corporate form is best thought of as a "technology," as potentially beneficial as gene-splicing, as potentially dangerous as atom-splitting. Together, they offer a stimulating point-counterpoint perspective on what may be one of the most important debates of this new corporate century.

 CORRECTION:
The Off the Shelf column last Sunday, a review of business books, misstated the given name of the author of "Gangs of America: the Rise of Corporate Power and the Disabling of Democracy." He is Ted Nace, not Tom.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Good Economy. Bad Job Market. Huh?

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
IT was like waiting for Godot. We waited for years for productivity to accelerate, and now, unlike Godot, who never showed up, that day has finally arrived. Productivity is soaring, holding out the promise of rising prosperity. Unfortunately, now we're waiting for the prosperity to kick in. A second term for President Bush could ride on whether it does, and how soon.
 The United States economy has not experienced anything like this since World War II. Normally, a spike in productivity is accompanied by an even greater spike in demand. Simply put, productivity rises when workers produce more and sell more each year, and do so without putting in extra hours. The production part is working just fine. The demand, however, is lacking. 
 That, in turn, is having nasty repercussions for jobs and incomes. The increase in productivity has allowed many employers to cut payrolls or workers' hours. Why pay six people to assemble 90 toaster ovens an hour when only four workers are needed to assemble the 60 ovens that can be sold? Better yet, why not speed up the line and cut the four workers to three, each one forced to work faster? But that leaves three workers unemployed, without income and unlikely to buy toaster ovens -- or much else -- until they get work again. Gradually, the demand for toaster ovens falls to 50, then 40, and another worker is laid off, or everyone's hours and pay are cut. And demand falls even more, producing its own negative dynamic. 
"I hesitate to say that high productivity is bad," said William C. Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman Sachs. "But if it is high, then you need more demand to generate employment, and if you don't get it, then the economy stalls."
Consider what happens when demand outstrips productivity. The toaster oven company installs a computer-controlled system that delivers parts for the ovens directly to the assembly line, simplifying the work of the six assemblers enough for them to raise production to 100 ovens an hour. That generates more sales revenue to distribute in wages, not to mention profits. The raises encourage spending, and as the demand for toaster ovens inches up to 110, a seventh person is hired. 
That is the way recoveries worked in the past, as employment and incomes rose and people engaged in the spending they had postponed during the recession. But demand this time is not firm enough. Even an economy propped up by tax cuts, military spending and other one-time fixes is expanding lately at only a 4 percent annual rate. That is a lot by past standards, but not enough when productivity has been surging at a 4.4 percent annual rate for 18 months.
As a result, the nation's private-sector employers are behaving as if they were caught in a recession, which they very well may be if they continue to act this way. Unable to sell all they can produce, they have reduced by 1.1 percent the total number of hours worked since the start of the recovery in November 2001, and they have put a lid on raises for most of the nation's 108 million jobholders. Wages are rising, but hours are disappearing and the combination leaves weekly pay barely keeping up with inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Some, including members of the Bush administration, counsel patience: demand, they say, will soon pick up enough to outstrip productivity. Job creation will then kick in, and the recovery will settle into a normal pattern.
Maybe. But the optimists aren't considering just how much demand is needed to outrun the unusual speed-up in productivity. 
We had a preview of what is happening today in the aftermath of the 1990-91 recession. Demand in the early months of that recovery was weaker than it is now, but so, too, was productivity. America in those days was still caught in the productivity slowdown that started in 1973. Without enough productivity growth, employers had to start hiring and the nation was well into job creation by the 18th month of recovery.
The productivity drought ended in 1995, and over the next eight years, the average annual productivity growth rate doubled, really surging in the current recovery. Surges are normal in recoveries. As demand rises, employers hold back on hiring, squeezing more work from their existing staffs until they feel confident that the demand will last and strengthen. This time, they are holding back more than ever, still haunted by the collapse of the bubble economy and full of doubts about the sustainability of demand.
Their refusal to hire or expand their operations undermines confidence, making matters worse. But through it all, the rising productivity translates into rising sales revenue per hour worked. That revenue is being fed disproportionately into profits, which finally shot up early this summer, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports. Therein lies the case for sustaining the recovery through a different route than job creation and rising wages.
It is a convoluted path. Rising profits, the argument goes, will fatten dividends and spending by millions of shareholders. A rising stock market will create a wealth effect, another spending stimulus. The multiplying demand and strong profits will eventually diminish the pressure for layoffs and cost-cutting. As hiring resumes, wage income will grow, further increasing demand. Higher profits, in sum, will lead indirectly to job creation, completing the circuit. 
All this assumes, ofcourse, that productivity will continue to rise at a healthy clip, fattening profits until job creation and demand finally take hold. That is still a shaky assumption. The startling productivity improvement may be mainly a result of squeezing workers. That is hardly solid ground for completing the trek from profits to jobs.
ONLY in hindsight will we know the components of today's productivity phenomenon. But some economists are optimistically making the case that years of investment in information technology are finally paying off in what seems to be a permanently higher productivity growth rate -- one that will endure even after employers stop squeezing their workers.
Rarely in the past has productivity held up in the absence of robust business investment, which is certainly absent now. What saves the day are the delayed productivity gains from constantly devising new ways to use the huge earlier investment in technology, says Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
"It is as if thousands of invisible factories were built all over America, not made of bricks and mortar but of business processes," he said. "Now these factories are being pressed into action."
He cites as examples Dell's skill at online computer sales and Wal-Mart's system for tracking inventories in every store and automatically restocking shelves. My own favorite is the A.T.M.-like machines now at airports that deliver boarding passes without the intervention of a counter clerk.
The airline issues the same number of boarding passes with many fewer counter clerks. That is a permanent contribution to productivity, and to airline solvency. My own bet is that demand, and the economy, would revive more quickly if the counter clerks were drawing wages again.

HEADLINE: FASHION WEEK; 
Is Fashion Still Cool?

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
WHO killed the cool in fashion? What exactly was it that drained the excitement out of this fascinating, frivolous, inspiring, transformative, gossamer and endlessly diverting business, one that also happens to be among the largest employers in New York City? 
 It seems mere moments ago that the attention of mainstream America alighted on the humble garment business, transforming models into household names, designers into media darlings and movie stars into dress dummies whose forays onto red carpets became notable less for celebrity pixie dust than for the labels inside their clothes. 
 This interlude -- roughly the mid-1980's to the late 90's -- was a time when fashion was a cultural product generated on the streets of New York by members of a determined but slightly madcap cognoscenti made up of people not likely to find gainful employment in many other fields. Theirs was a world in which people employed deliriously kooky argot, in which fashion editors were heard to say of a dress that it was "worked to its finest inch of nanosecond perfection," where ingenious drag queens counterfeited tickets to runway shows, where obscure models were at the center of personality cults and where creative people found it perfectly acceptable to seek inspiration from the way that heroin addicts or homeless people put themselves together at the start of each day. 
"Is cool still cool?" asked Anna Sui, a designer who served as an unofficial arbiter of fin-de-siecle cool in the cash-rich 90's. Throughout the decade, Ms. Sui's runway presentations were hipster catnip. One was as likely to spot the Beastie Boys perched in the front row of her shows of wittily girlish designs as the sexually ambiguous actor Jaye Davidson, with Kate Moss on his lap. Naomi Campbell once strutted Ms. Sui's catwalk in backless chaps. The standing-room crowd practically hung from the rafters trying to catch a glimpse.
Ms. Campbell now poses for second-string hip-hop clothing lines and seems destined for the scrap heap of demicelebrity. Ms. Moss, the onetime poster girl for loaded issues like eating disorders and heroin chic, has become domesticated as a new mother and part-time artist's muse. Isaac Mizrahi, former darling of the cognoscenti, has designed a collection for the mass-market retailer Target. Ms. Sui herself is now less engaged with scene-making than, like many other Americans, with corporate survival. As she prepared for her spring 2004 show in the tents of Bryant Park during another Fashion Week, which began Friday and continues through next Friday, Ms. Sui casually noted the passing of fashion as a crossroads of all things lustrous and desirable in a boom economy culture. "I'm not sure cool is even a concept anymore," she said. 
This is far from the first time the point has been made. Two years ago, after the 9/11 attacks, fashion joined the rest of the culture in a period of self-appraisal, or at least of enforced sobriety. 
If an irrepressible spirit of expression gradually returned to the business, it did so haltingly and burdened by an unexpected problem, one that had less to do with a terrorist menace than the subtler incursions of the corporate world. It was as if no one knew whom to consult for direction and where to look for the spirited, rebellious or else indifferent outsiders who have historically infused fashion with the unstudied vigor of their style. 
Who would act the role played until it became parodic by people like Sarah Lerfel, the owner of Colette, the relentlessly chic Paris store, where no-name designers were the sine qua non, until it became hipper to wear designers whose products were most often encountered in duty-free shops -- Gucci, Chanel and Louis Vuitton? Who had anything like the spare time to challenge what scholarly journals used to call "the fashion system," when anyone with a pincushion was frantically trying to stay employed? 
"Maybe the concept of edginess doesn't work anymore," Ms. Sui said, adding that the outsider postures of many musicians and entertainers now crowding the airwaves smack less of rebellious expression than careful market research. "You look at Pink, with her red hair and punk clothes, and you think she might be punk, but then she belts out a torch song," Ms. Sui said. "You watch the MTV Video Music Awards, and every single person is saying Coldplay is awesome, but they sound like Michael Bolton to me. You look at Christina Aguilera, and she has all the affectations of somebody who would be a rocker, and then you hear her songs and you think, Is this the Julie London of today?"
In other words, as the retailer and television stylist Patricia Field noted: "Fashion got flipped around. It got to be just about money and about industry, the way in the 80's the art world became an industry and was killed off." 
James LaForce, a seasoned fashion publicist, said: "Fashion used to be about worlds upon worlds you didn't have access to. It was about decadence, excitement, a passion for clothes, that margin for error." Nowadays, Mr. LaForce added, "everything creative has to be done by formula from the moment you say you want to be a fashion designer. The chances for lightning to strike are rare." 
In the not-too-distant past, said Kim Hastreiter, the editor of Paper magazine, "there was real excitement, some bated breath" about the surprises new designers might come up with. Ms. Hastreiter's magazine has been missionary in its pursuit of the new for almost 20 years. 
"That's all gone," she said, "except for Marc." Ms. Hastreiter was referring to Marc Jacobs, a designer whose assertions that he is mystified by the aura of hip that envelops his every association ("I'm the least cool person I know," he has said) can seem coy. 
Consider, after all, the irresistibly offhand allure of the advertising campaigns that Juergen Teller photographs for the Marc Jacobs collections and the phenomenally successful designs Mr. Jacobs commissioned from Stephen Sprouse and Takashi Murakami to add a dimension of superficial hipness to Louis Vuitton bags. 
"Fashion has gone out into Middle America, where Fifth Avenue meets Main Street," Ms. Hastreiter observed, with a sly reference to ads for the Isaac Mizrahi collection picturing the designer at the imaginary and, one would have thought, implausible intersection of the two thoroughfares. 
Few would grudge Mr. Mizrahi his affiliation with Target, whose knack for hiring insider talents and moving them onto a mainstream stage has proved to be a bottom-line success. But the man once beloved of the fashion claque for his theatrical eclat, his knack for tweaked historicism and his droll effeminacy clearly relinquished some of his insider credibility when he took up selling $15 blouses at his new address.
Or did he? 
"The mainstream marketers have everybody figured out," said Evan L. Schindler, the creative director of Black Book, a fashion-oriented lifestyle magazine. "They know how to bottle the subversive, the margins, the fringe." When even ferocious protopunk drug anthems are sanitized to become jingles for television cruise line ads, as happened with Iggy Pop's "Lust for Life," "you have to rethink your ideas of what it means to be cool," Mr. Schindler said.
It would appear that in fashion, as in music and other art forms, there is at the moment "no new movement, no strong movement of coolness," the filmmaker John Waters said. "I'm sure at some point the children will think of something cool to get on the nerves of the generation before them," he added. But, in fashion, an event like that seems pretty far off. 
The truth of this becomes acute as Fashion Week gets under way with the industry celebrating the 10th anniversary of the centralization of the collections under the Bryant Park tents. It is no overstatement to say that in the decade since Seventh on Sixth, the fashion industry trade group, first consolidated a loosely organized collection of presentations into a twice-a-year multistage spectacle, the fashion industry itself has also been transformed. 
Seventh on Sixth gave logistical coherence to the presentation of new designer wares. And the central location strikingly increased press coverage, leading to a glut of runway images in popular magazines and on network and cable television and turning designers into celebrities. 
The value of blanket global media coverage of fashion in the form of sexy women strutting the catwalks in expensive clothes is not lost on Mercedes-Benz, Olympus cameras, Fiji water, North Fork Bank or Siemens mobile phones, which are among the nearly 20 official sponsors of this season's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.
What is much less clear is how much an association with, say, Ortho Evra, the weekly birth control patch, which will be staging an "every woman" fashion show on Tuesday at the Bryant Park tents, adds to the profession's allure. 
"Traditionally, we thought of fashion as something that came from houses, editors, designers, experts, and that has very much gone by the boards," said Virginia Postrel, the author of "The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness" (HarperCollins), a book that examines the cultural obsession with aesthetics. 
"Part of what made fashion seem like high school," Ms. Postrel said, was the existence of " 'in' groups, 'in' people, who knew and decided what was cool."
The velocity of information flow is probably too great now for any group to sustain 'in' crowd status for long. Magazine editors, for decades the creative autocrats of the business, have been forced to relinquish some of their power in favor of the consumer-friendly catalog-style editorials originated in Japanese magazines like Olive and Cutie and brought to a high state of polish by Lucky, Conde Nast's phenomenally successful shopping magazine. 
I F there is any single trend among designers of the moment, it would seem to be one that unexpectedly mimics socially conscious movements like Slow Food and that favors unhip issues like political engagement and the sources for raw materials, and that actually entertains ideas less historically suited to fashion types than to policy wonks and nerds. 
"Whatever we do, we don't call it fashion," said Angela, a member of the Manhattan design collective As Four, whose members live communally and eschew last names. "We have been very bored ourselves, lately," she said of fashion, criticizing its uniformity and the insinuating presence of corporate affiliations. 
"It's like 'The Devil Wears Prada,' " said Kai, a German-born member of the collective, referring to Lauren Weisberger's roman a clef about a magazine much like Vogue. "I don't understand why everybody is so willing to let themselves be taken over by other corporate identities, everybody all the time wearing gray and black. If your body is the host of your soul, why put it in a gray hut when you can build a fantastic house of gold?" 
Few people in style history attained insider status faster than Miguel Adrover, a Majorca-born designer who became famous in an instant when his second collection was shown in 2000, only to be abruptly forgotten a year later, when he lost his design bearings, his media appeal and also his business. Mr. Adrover has emerged from this sobering experience with a philosophy better suited, it would seem, to a Peace Corps mission statement than to a business in which insiders rhapsodize about Hedi Slimane's new free-agent status or the cut of an Olivier Theyskens sleeve. 
"What is fashion at the end of the day?" said Mr. Adrover, who now shows just once a year and whose clothes will be presented Monday night at the tents. Although they are termed a spring-summer 2004 collection, they are meant, he said, to be stylistically durable enough to be worn until they fall apart. "It is not enough to have buzz and show it off," Mr. Adrover declared. "It is not good that fashion is creating these unreal worlds." 
Fashion is one frivolous undertaking that might benefit from regarding its own cultural impact more seriously, he suggested. "Fashion says something about the moments in which we live, and for a while now it has lost reality with what's going on in the world. 
"People are gradually forgetting their individuality and how much power clothes have, that what you wear can get you sex or get you killed," Mr. Adrover added with emotion. 
At various points in recent memory, Mr. Adrover's assertions might have smacked of disingenuousness or, worse, deadly earnestness. At the moment, however, they seem fairly cool.

Slavery in Old New York, A Hospital Bed in the New

 BODY:
PIERRE TOUSSAINT
By Arthur Jones
Doubleday
($24.95, hardcover)
 Long before Toussaint arrived, the Quakers in Manhattan had freed their slaves, but the general slaveholding populace was neither impressed nor inspired to do likewise. Slaves were about 14 percent of the city population. 
 In 1799, after a decade of much debate and many false starts, the New York State Legislature passed the gradual Manumission Act that compelled slaveholders to "free any children born to slaves after July 4, 1799." In a further act, passed in 1817, slaves born before 1799 were to be freed a decade later, on July 4, 1827. The Quakers were the predominant group in the New York Manumission Society, which opened a school for slave children provided they were over 9 and could spell words of one syllable.
 The city that awaited Toussaint bustled. Despite periodic panics and recessions, trade, finance and domestic manufacturing and services were multiplying almost exponentially. Slaves were cheap workers (white women were not much more expensive).

 I have two European square pillows, Hentyle's half-length body pillow, andseveral smaller proppers.

Stare at morning junk TV, eat a bowl of Cheerios -- I am comfortable.
 As usual, "Laura's Room" is proclaimed on an electric-bed-width-door on 10 South, pictures overwhelm white walls. It was my pre-back-to-college admission in August before returning as a sophomore.
 Beepers, phones, rounding residents, heels, terminology. I hear both the on-floor system and Naime simultaneously yelling, "Did someone page GI?"
 Notes and orders being written in charts -- Evelyn shouts, "Who has the keys?" (a reference to the narcotics closet), "Where's Figueroa's chart?" I press the call bell,
 Naime responds, "How may I help?" 
 "Could you please send in my nurse?" Who will it be? I wait to hear whom he calls. Please not Joy, please not Joy. 
 "Karina to 26, Karina to 26." I can relax now; she's one of my nurse moms. Calls me her baby, even though she has two of her own.

At Yale, aCase Study Too Close to Home

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE

DATELINE: New Haven 

 BODY:
WITH picket lines winding around campus buildings and workers and management trading accusations of unreasonable bargaining, the strike at Yale University might seem ideal fodder for executives in training. 
 But for most students and professors at the School of Management here, the strike is not on the syllabus. 
 Some 2,000 technical, clerical, service and maintenance workers at Yale walked off the job late last month, at the start of school, in a dispute over wages and pensions. And though the chants of pickets echoed outside classroom windows, students enrolled in Yale's M.B.A. program said they were too focused on looming responsibilities, including paying off school loans and finding jobs in a difficult economy, to pay much attention. 
"I don't want to sound callous, because it isn't as though I'm not interested in what they're doing," said Rohan Phansalkar, 30, a second-year finance major in the M.B.A. program. "But I am just trying to keep up. The work load is enormous." 
The 484 students at the School of Management, like those at other business schools, are also about to enter what has been one of the most forbidding job markets in years. Many are wary of becoming involved in anything that might take them away from their studies and the good grades that can help them in a job search.
In 2001, some 97 percent of the graduating class were offered jobs within three months of receiving degrees, compared with 80 percent for the class of 2002, according to statistics from the school's development office. "I'm going to be looking for a job, and I don't want to be out there saying something one way or another," one student said.
Indeed, many students at the management school plan careers in financial services or consulting, fields that lack the history of raw labor strife of traditional manufacturing. Of the graduates of 2002 who found jobs, more than 60 percent entered financial services or consulting, and just 15 percent joined manufacturing companies, according to the school's career development office. 
Several students said talk of the strike had not been discouraged by their professors. But the students and several professors said that while they had discussed the strike among themselves, the topic had been largely absent from their classroom discussions. Class time, professors said, has been focused on subjects like decision analysis and game theory or venture capital and private equity.
In the words of Stanley Garstka, deputy dean of Yale's management school, "it's business as usual" at the business school.
As the strike headed into its third week, Dean Garstka conveyed by e-mail that no formal response had been organized by the faculty. "The issues on the table at this point seem to be pretty much the standard ones, pensions and salaries," he wrote. He also estimated that some 65 percent of clerical and technical workers were now on the job -- a figure that the union described as closer to 50 percent -- and said the strike felt relatively low key.
When graduate students at Yale went on strike last year over their right to unionize, "there was more informal discussion," Dean Garstka said. Several classes were held off campus during that time, often at the prompting of sympathetic students, so that no one would have to cross picket lines.
TO get to class this year, students have had to cross a picket line or two outside the management school. But many say that just as the school is a global microcosm of sorts -- one-quarter of its students are foreign -- the opinions on the merits of the strike are varied.
"I wish they did discuss it," Achal Prabhala, 29, said of his professors. Mr. Prabhala, a native of India who is in his second year at the school, said the strike last year had generated more energy and stimulated learning in and out of class. This year, he said, was different. "I think it's fatigue due to the fact that there is yet another strike and students are overwhelmed by all they have to do," he said.
In the classroom, some professors said, students and faculty members might be more comfortable talking about a dispute that was not in their backyard. "It would almost be easier to discuss the strike if it were at Harvard than at Yale," said Sharon Oster, a professor of management and entrepreneurship and the faculty director ofthe school's partnership on nonprofit ventures. "You don't want to be inflammatory since, in some ways, as faculty, you're perceived as representing management." 
Her colleague, Douglas W. Rae, a professor of political science and management who teaches both undergraduates and students at the management school, said that 10 years ago, during another strike, he held classes off campus in a show of solidarity with the workers. But since then, he said, he has questioned the effectiveness of such a limited protest, calling relocation "a hollow gesture." 
There is also the matter of the contract between university and student, he said. "The central mission of a university and a university professor is to teach students," he said.
M. Keith Chen, an assistant professor of economics, said the strike would be part of his course next semester on negotiating strategy. "I plan to use the outcome, a timeline of various strikes, the history, the different strategies used," Mr. Chen said.
But some experts said business students had no real need to spend time studying a labor-management problem like the current strike. In an actual company, "an executive might bring in someone who specializes in collective bargaining -- for example, if they have a unionized element in their company -- but otherwise, you would be dealing with human resource issues," said Nick Salvatore, a history professor at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University.
Still, some business lessons arising from the strike are almost impossible to ignore. The closing of the School of Management dining hall allowed the M.B.A. candidates to taste first hand how one person's strike is another's opportunity. Outside the school's entrance, a shiny white cart selling Amara's Mexican burritos was doing brisk business.

The Unemployed Lose More Than a Paycheck

BYLINE:  By KAREN ALEXANDER

 BODY:
JEFF HALPERN had changed jobs a half-dozen times since receiving his M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1991, but the latest change was different. 
 His position at a start-up energy trading company disappeared in the wake of Enron's collapse, and it took almost seven months for him to land a new position as marketing manager of TheraSense, a company in Alameda, Calif., that develops products for people with diabetes. 
 While he was out of work, Mr. Halpern, 39, became increasingly aware of what he was missing: not just a regular salary, but also the networking opportunities and the experience and knowledge that people accrue in their jobs. 
"It's very easy to allow your skills to stagnate and not stay up on what's going on in the world," said Mr. Halpern, who joined TheraSense in late April. 
Corporate recruiters and career coaches agree. The so-called opportunity costs of unemployment are often hidden and are harder to quantify than lost salary or benefits. But they are nonetheless a burden that can have lasting effects on a career. 
The longer people are out of work, it seems, the harder it can be to find employment. In August, 1.9 million Americans had been looking for work for 27 weeks or more, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure accounts for about 22 percent of the unemployed and does not include 503,000 eligible workers whom government economists classify as "discouraged." These are people who have lost their jobs but are not currently looking for work specifically because they believe that no jobs are available for them. And many recent college graduates have decided to ride out the tight job market by enrolling in graduate or law schools instead of looking for permanent employment, while others have chosen volunteer work.
Mr. Halpern, who has been diabetic for 10 years, decided that he wanted his next job to be in the area of diabetes care. He worked to keep his business skills fresh and to stay on top of medical research and trends. 
He did volunteer work for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and helped a fund-raising event generate about four times as much money as it had in the past. He also attended a career-coaching seminar. And, by each Monday, he made sure that he had something on his calendar for every day of the week ahead.
"It was better than feeling sorry for myself, and during interviews it gave me something to talk about," he said. "I was actually doing something with my time."
Rebecca Zucker, a principal and co-founder of the career advisory firm Next Step Partners in San Francisco, ran the group sessions that Mr. Halpern attended. Using professional skills in volunteer work or community involvement keeps those skills fresh, she said, and bolsters confidence. 
"The insider knowledge that's gained from being in the flow of things is linked to a person's confidence and sense of competence in that field," Ms. Zucker said. "Like compound interest, those experiences build on each other."
Experts say recent graduates of business and lawschools have particular reason to put their skills to work, because another batch of graduates will be flooding the job market within a year.
"If a certain amount of time goes by, and you don't have things to put on your resume, and the year behind you catches up, you are caught in a squeeze play," said Carl Baier, a legal recruiter and managing director of the Palo Alto, Calif., office of Major, Hagen & Africa, a search firm. "I think that's happening now, and I think there's going to be additional scrutiny when things pick up. Employers will ask: 'What types of deals has this person been working on? What have they really been doing?"'
One woman in that situation received her M.B.A. from a school in the Northeast in May 2001 and was offered a consulting job at Accenture in New York. But the market soured, and for more than a year the firm repeatedly pushed back her starting date. She finally began work in October 2002.
The consultant, who spoke about her situation on the condition that she not be identified, said she sought opportunities to use her skills during the wait, in part because she feared that her promised job could be snatched away by one of the new business school graduates following at her heels. 
Though she had a formal job offer from Accenture, the long wait created "a feeling that I had to continue to impress them," she said. 
In addition to traveling and spending time with family members, she did volunteer work and took on a freelance consulting project for a large company. 
"It helped me feel more comfortable that I wasn't withering on the vine," she said, "and I think it helped Accenture feel better, too, that they hadn't picked up a dud."
Now that she's busy on the job, she says she considers the time off "a gift" but rues the lag in her experience. She estimates that it will take 18 months to two years on the job before she feels truly caught up.
"It's not as if I'd gotten to use these skills and made them a part of me," she said. "I went straight from school to being out of work for a year. Now I have my finance and accounting textbooks within arm's reach of my desk because I know I'm going to have to use them. I felt like I was behind."
Her professional and social networking at work have suffered, she said, because she feels out of step with colleagues her own age. 
Robert Baker, 31, received master's degrees in business administration and finance from Boston College in the spring of 2001. He needed five months to find a job, which he has since left. Now he is an assistant vice president for wealth management services at the State Street Corporation in Quincy, Mass.
"As each month goes by, your confidence level decreases, and you start to realize you're not going to get your ideal job," Mr. Baker said of his initial job search after graduation.
Although his business school held weekly support meetings over the summer, he soon began to feel that he had exhausted whatever contacts the school's alumni network could offer.
"In graduate school you're kind of going nonstop, and you start to thrive on that," he said. When the day "consists of just a job search, it's not very dynamic," he said, "and it does take a while to get that momentum back upon returning to work." 
After leaving the first job, Mr. Baker went directly to State Street in June. That quick transition went much more smoothly, he said.
How much a person's career ultimately suffers from an extended period of unemployment varies by industry, the market environment and the individual, Ms. Zucker said.
"It can be nothing more than a blip, or it could be something that keeps them off course for a period of time," she said.
THE best way for an unemployed worker to combat the experience gap, she and other experts said, is to remain as active as possible in his or her field of expertise. "Keeping the momentum is very important," Ms. Zucker said. John Challenger, the chief executive of the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas in Chicago, agreed.
"The most important thing a person can do is get really heavily engaged in organizations and volunteer activities in your industry, or in your field," he said.
"As people are out of work they tend to become marginalized," he added. "As they move out of the mainstream, they become less involved in not only the flow of meeting and developing relationships in business, but even outside of business in the civic and community sphere. They shouldn't do that, but a lot of people go and hide. Making good transitions is really important, but many people get really stuck. 
"I don't want to make it seem so heavy an obstacle that it can't be worked around," Mr. Challenger added. "People do it all the time."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NORTHERN MANHATTAN; 
A Neighborhood on the River Seeks a Waterfront View

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
Urban it is. Urban planning, it is not.
 The dozen or so blocks just north of Sherman Creek on the Harlem River are a mishmash. Between a Con Edison substation and a city tow pound, a street vendor sells mangoes and sugar cane juice. Churches stand next to auto repair shops near a popular nightclub. The waterfront is closed to the public. 
 A nonprofit group that has long wanted to impose some order on the area, which lies just east of the overcrowded, largely Dominican neighborhood of Inwood, has completed an urban design plan to do just that. The plan, designed for the Audubon Partnership for Economic Development by Warren Antonio James, an architect, seeks to open the waterfront and build housing.
 "It's a new neighborhood," said Walther Delgado, the group's executive director. "We have a great need for home ownership and affordable housing." 
 The Sherman Creek approach is different from typical urban planning imposed by outside authorities, Mr. James said. It is a Hispanic-designed plan (he is Puerto Rican) done for a Hispanic organization within a Hispanic neighborhood. The project's direction comes in part from meetings with local residents who, for example, did not want apartment towers.
 On a recent tour of the Sherman Creek area, Mr. James pointed out the fences and gates that block the waterfront, including one spot where a man ducked through an opening in the fence with fishing tackle. The plan envisions a riverfront road and six- to eight-story garden apartments, along with stores.
 Other groups are also working in the area. Just to the south, the New York Restoration Project is building a boathouse and runs boat-building workshops. And the United States Army Corps of Engineers is planning to clean the creek.
 The city is interested. An interagency task force established in April is creating its own plan for the area. 
 "It is an opportunity coincident with two of the main themes of our office: waterfront and housing," said Nicole Poindexter, senior policy adviser to Daniel Doctoroff, the deputy mayor who leads the task force. They have met with Audubon, and recommendations should be ready by next spring.
 But plenty of obstacles stand in the way of the Audubon plan. Con Edison owns much of the land, including areas it leases out, and "at this time we have no plans to sell any property," said Joseph Petta, a utility spokesman. Other property owners would also have to acquiesce. SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: Who Can Afford a Yacht? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Yachts to Call Your Own (if Only for a Vacation)," which described yacht charters as "no longer only for the rich and famous": 
 In one example, the article mentioned a one-week vacation on a yacht, with a captain and chef aboard, at a price of $4,600 (air fare and gratuity not included). 
 Well, $4,600 is already one-fourth of the amount that the Department of Health and Human Services says is the poverty guideline for a family of four for this year. To say people who can afford such charters are not rich ignores the condition of millions of Americans with low incomes, many working, many above the poverty criterion, who struggle to meet basic needs. Let's keep things in perspective.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Are Plaguing Flight Schools in Florida 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: PEMBROKE PINES, Fla., Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Terry Fensome thought his flight school's fortunes had hit bottom in November 2001 when one of his planes was intercepted by fighter pilots who thought they were foiling a terrorist attack on Orlando.
 But the acute embarrassment of that incident -- the student was forced to land, questioned and released -- was nothing compared with the economic misery that has dogged the Pelican Flight Training Center since then, a result of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Mr. Fensome's school is one of dozens in Florida that have struggled mightily in the last two years, beset by collapsing enrollment, security-related red tape and the stigma of being linked to the 9/11 hijackers, several of whom learned to fly in Florida. 
 "We never recovered," said Mr. Fensome, whose school has 30 students now, down from 60 before the attacks, though none of the hijackers trained at Pelican. "The idea that the flight schools were to blame for this was totally off the wall, and it hurt us a lot." 
At least 50 of the state's flight schools have closed since 9/11, most of them mom-and-pop operations that could not survive the drop in business and rising costs. The number of foreign students has plummeted, flight school owners say, because of tough new immigration rules, the battered aviation industry and a general fear of bias since 9/11.
It is a striking reversal for the flight schools. With its warm weather, abundance of airfields and good flying conditions, Florida has long drawn student pilots from the United States and abroad. 
The state had at least 220 of about 2,000 flight schools in the country in 2001, and trained about 20 percent of all pilots in the world, the Florida Department of Transportation said. 
About half of the state's student pilots were foreigners drawn by the stature and lower costs of flight school in this country, flight school owners said. 
Shortly after 9/11, Congress passed a law requiring extensive background checksfor all foreigners learning to fly planes heavier than 12,500 pounds, which is about the size of a 10-seat jet. Since the checks can take months, many student pilots have opted to train in South Africa or Australia, which have a lot of flight academies and less oversight, flight school owners said.
In addition, American flight schools must now be certified by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the State Department keeps a close eye on all foreign flight students. Even applicants to schools for flying small planes, like Mr. Fensome's, must undergo background checks, though they are not as extensive as those for students at the schools for the pilots of jetliners. Only a few Florida flight schools train pilots for larger planes, and since the schools are bigger, they have generally not taken the financial hits of the smaller ones. 
Marilyn Ladner, a vice president of Pan American International Flight Academy in Miami, said her school and others that offer advanced training had lost a lot of foreign students since the attacks because of the requirement for background checks. But Ms. Ladner said most of her revenue loss was due to the poor economy and because the airlines were not hiring.
Arne Kruithof, who owns Florida Flight Training Center in Venice, where one 9/11 hijacker learned to fly, said he had only a handful of students a year ago and his business was then barely surviving. Now, he said, he has 40 students and business is getting back to normal.
Mr. Kruithof, who has taken out loans to aggressively advertise his school in Europe, said, "Everything started recovering last winter, then when the news came that we were going to attack Iraq, we lost all our business again."
Mr. Kruithof's school trained Ziad al-Jarrah, one of the men who hijacked United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. A neighboring flight school, Huffman Aviation, trained Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, identified as leaders of the hijackings. The school's owner, Rudi Dekkers, sold his struggling business last winter. 
Mr. Kruithof said a favorable exchange rate began drawing Europeans back to American flight schools in late spring. But like other flight school owners, he said no Middle Easterners had enrolled.
He said he had contacted the families of some former Middle Eastern students to ask why, and said they had told him the reason was part anger, part fear. "They said we could credit it to a general boycott against everything American," Mr. Kruithof said. 
Their fear is warranted, other flight school operators said, because of what several called the continuing suspicions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement authorities. An example was the interception of Mr. Fensmore's student, a 24-year-old Angolan, after someone heard a radio transmission that supposedly threatened an attack on Orlando International Airport. 
"Can you imagine one of these little things taking out Disney World?" Mr. Fensmore said, pointing to one of his two-seat Katana DA-20's at North Perry Airport, where his company has trained pilots for 18 years. "My student was scared out of his wits."
More recently, someone called the F.B.I. to report that a plane owned by Trade Winds International Flight School in Fort Pierce had circled a nuclear power plant on Hutchison Island, off Florida's Atlantic coast.
"I got a call from Miami air traffic control, and the next thing I knew the F.B.I. showed up at my door," Ernie Carnahan, president of Trade Winds, said. "They asked what color my plane was, apologized and saidit was a case of mistaken identity. But it shows you they are still watching close."
Mr. Kruithof even saw a bright side. Federal agencies immediately answer phone calls and e-mail messages from flight schools these days, he said, while in the past such inquiries often fell through the cracks.
The government has also updated the application forms for foreigners seeking visas for flight instruction, Mr. Kruithof said, replacing forms that he said were so outdated they asked if the applicant had ties to the Third Reich.
Still, with student pilots restricted from flying over Walt Disney World and other potential terrorist targets, some student pilots are nervous, fearing they could unintentionally violate a rule and wind up in jail. 
"There's always going to be that feeling that you're doing something wrong," Brett Montgomery, 19, who is training at Pelican, said. 
Mr. Fensome was bristling because a visit by President Bush on Tuesday to Fort Lauderdale, about 10 miles north of Pembroke Pines, had shut down all flight schools in the area for the day.
"Every time they bring the president or another government official down they close the flight schools and we lose business," Mr. Fensome said, adding that he could not recall any such shutdowns before 9/11. "This knee-jerk stuff is toning down now, but it's never going to go away completely."
While the security crackdown is a nuisance, rising insurance premiums are a far more serious threat to flight schools, Mr. Fensome and others said. Mr. Fensome has grounded 5 of his 15 airplanes to reduce insurance costs, but he still pays $10,000 a month, he said. Mr. Kruithof said his insurance costs have risen by 55 percent since the attacks. 
Many flight school operators say they believe business will fully recover over the next five years, as the economy improves, baby-boomer airline pilots start retiring and the aviation industry starts hiring again.
Until then, Mr. Fensome said he would be content with things as they were one day this week, as he watched four of his little planes scuttle out to the runway. "Four of them," he said, leaning forward to watch the first plane take off. "That's a blessing."

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Police Close Down Nation's Largest Daily Paper 

BYLINE:  By SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Armed police officers in Zimbabwe's capital unexpectedly shut down the nation's biggest daily newspaper, The Daily News, on Friday after the country's highest court ruled that the paper was publishing illegally. 
 The move silenced, at least temporarily, one of the few independent news outlets in an increasingly authoritarian state. The newspaper's editor said the action was one more sign of Zimbabwe's deepening political and economic crisis under President Robert G. Mugabe. 
 "This is an unprecedented assault on media freedom by a government that is terrified of media that offers alternative news," the editor, Francis Mdlongwa, said in a telephone interview today.
Gugulethu Moyo, a lawyer for Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe, which owns The Daily News, said that the paper had faced numerous government-imposed obstacles in its four years of publication, but that the shutdown was unexpected.
With a circulation of 100,000, the Daily News leads a small contingent of publications that make up Zimbabwe's opposition press. The government controls the nation's television and radio networks and the other daily newspapers.
The government tightened the reins on the media last year when the ruling party passed a law requiring media organizations to register with a state commission. The Daily News refused and instead sued, arguing that the law was unconstitutional. 
Ms. Moyo and Mr. Mdlongwa said the law required reporters to disclose their political affiliations and home addresses, forced privately owned publications to surrender business secrets and made journalists criminally liable for reporting inaccurate information. More than a dozen journalists have been charged since the new law took effect.
On Thursday, Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku ruled that the paper should have registered before filing suit. He found the paper in "open defiance of the law." 
Representatives of the paper said they then promised to register. But after 4 p.m. on Friday, police officers converged on the paper's offices in the center of Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, and ordered employees to go home. Police officers are now stationed at the paper round-the-clock. The paper's lawyers are trying to press the court and the government to allow it to resume publication.
The United States Embassy in Harare issued a statement deploring the closure as part of "the government of Zimbabwe's pattern of threats and intimidation against the independent media." 
The newspaper's closure follows a steady deterioration in Zimbabwe's political and economic state under the 23-year rule of President Mugabe, 79. With the inflation rate at a record 450 percent, unemployment at 70 percent and food and gasoline shortages endemic, Mr. Mugabe's government has grown ever more authoritarian.

HEADLINE: Some Wall Street Jobs Are Now on Main Street 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Two years after the terror attack forced Wall Street firms to disperse thousands of employees to suburbs, most of the firms have come back, either to their old homes or to new ones. But many of their workers remain in offices from Connecticut to central New Jersey.
 Having been driven from their headquarters for weeks while they scrambled to restore trading ability, some of the biggest financial companies decided to spread out their operations to reduce their reliance on Manhattan's infrastructure. In several cases, the move to strengthen backup sites has cost New York significant numbers of jobs. 
 In White Plains, Morgan Stanley is renovating an office complex for the relocation of 1,400 employees, the largest shift of jobs out of New York City by any financial company since Sept. 11, 2001. The firm, which is based near Times Square but was the biggest tenant of the World Trade Center, is refitting the complex, built in the 1970's, as a secondary campus that could be a backup trading site in a disaster.
New York City officials hope that Morgan Stanley's move will not set off a new exodus, but others say that the scattering of employees is likely to continue.
"There is a greater consensus that it is no longer ideal to have one campus, but is preferable to have a decentralized operation with two or three central nodes," said M. Myers Mermel, chief executive of TenantWise, a real estate brokerage company in Manhattan. "That decentralization of operations is a huge seminal event in the financial services industry that is going to have repercussions for decades."
The main trade organization for Wall Street, the Securities Industry Association, says that its members moved 20,000 of their 190,000 New York City jobs out of the city in response to the attack. Only half of those jobs have returned, the association estimates, though it says it is hard to distinguish between the impact of the attack and the effects of the long stock market slump and the weakness of the economy.
"New York did lose employment as a result of 9/11, but after the first year, we started to see it stabilize," said Frank Fernandez, chief economist for the association, whose offices remain a few blocks from ground zero. "The dispersion since then has had more to do with cost savings."
New York is still recognized as the financial capital of the world, but the firms that conduct the business of buying and selling stocks, bonds and commodities have been slowly reducing their presence in the financial district in Lower Manhattan for decades, spreading their employees around the city, the region and beyond.
Before Sept. 11, 2001, a quarter of the industry's domestic jobs were in New York, down from 37 percent two decades earlier. With the scattering that followed the attack, the city's share has fallen to 20 percent.
Mr. Mermel estimated that in the last two years Lower Manhattan had lost 64,000 jobs -- in finance and other areas -- and that more than a third of them had wound up outside the city. That dispersal, he said, increases the likelihood that when companies resume hiring, they will place new employees elsewhere.
Morgan Stanley will have the room to do that in White Plains. Early next year, the firm plans to move 700 executives there from its brokerage operation, which was housed in the trade center and, after the attack, in Midtown offices. They will be joined later next year by another 700 employees from the company's trading operations in Midtown. Those moves will leave the firm with about 9,000 employees in New York City.
Morgan Stanley executives decided quickly after the attack, which killed 13 of the firm's 3,700 workers in the trade center, that it would be a mistake to keep operations and employees so concentrated.
They sold a nearly finished office tower in Midtown and bought the former headquarters of Texaco in White Plains. To outfit the site, the firm has hauled out acres of 1970's green carpeting and piles of shaggy rugs and started installing a trading floor with hundreds of computers and thousands of phone lines.
"Our facilities team put the Midtown campus together, so we were very saddened to have to sell that building," said George Drake, managing director for global corporate services at Morgan Stanley. "But this is the right thing to do. We were the first to come up with the concept of developing a campus within the central business district and the first to rethink it."
So far, among the other big financial firms, only Bank of New York is taking such a drastic and costly step as a direct response to the attack. The bank, which has more than 9,000 employees at its headquarters on Wall Street and two other buildings nearby, plans to move 1,500 of them to Brooklyn in the spring.
That site will also be a backup center that could house 2,000 workers in an emergency, said Don Monks, the bank's senior executive vice president for technology and operations.
In response to the terror attack, most other major Wall Street firms have established second or third sites that can be backup centers.
Lehman Brothers, whose headquarters in the World Financial Center were damaged in the attack, moved most of its staff into the Midtown building that Morgan Stanley abandoned. But the firm, which had 1,150 employees in Jersey City before the attack, has added 400 workers there while keeping its head count in New York steady at 6,000.
Other firms have merely beefed up backup centers they had before the disaster so that they can switch their trading there in an emergency.
"Building a trading floor like Morgan Stanley is doing, with false floors and state-of-the-art wiring, is not something one does lightly," said Mr. Fernandez, the economist with the Securities Industry Association. "Some firms just felt that they couldn't afford it."
Though the shutdown of the stock and bond markets on Sept. 11 was unusual, the effects of the disruption were, for the most part, temporary, Mr. Fernandez said. The main concern now is not to avert another disruption at any cost, he said, but to recover from it more quickly if another occurs.
"How fast is fast enough?" Mr. Fernandez asked. "There were people who said after 9/11 that it was probably good that the markets were closed for a period of time. The stock market only fell 7 percent when the market reopened. Had we rushed it, had we come up quicker, the sell-off may have been much worse."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Some 9/11 Aid for Downtown Businesses Went to Swindlers 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Federal authorities in Manhattan are prosecuting at least a half-dozen cases in which people are charged with swindling nearly $600,000 from government programs intended to help Lower Manhattan businesses recover losses from 9/11 and to encourage residency in the area.
 At least a half-dozen more cases, involving $300,000 suspected of having been fraudulently sought or received, have been referred to federal investigators by a state agency administering one program. 
 The grant and loan programs involved have distributed more than $1 billion to businesses and residents in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, which destroyed the World Trade Center and sent Lower Manhattan into an economic tailspin.
Suspected fraud totaling less than $1 million would seem to be small in the overall picture.But officials of the federal and state agencies involved said they had audited only a portion of the money distributed, making it very likely that more suspect grants and loans would turn up. 
"We consider the fraud rate small, but we do take it seriously, and it's not like it's going to be overlooked," said Alex Dudley, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency that administers the federally financed World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program. It has given nearly $540 million to more than 14,000 Lower Manhattan businesses to compensate them for economic losses attributed to 9/11.
Empire State referred the half-dozen or more suspicious cases involving $300,000 to federal investigators, Mr. Dudley said.
The two largest cases already being prosecuted by the United States attorney's office in Manhattan involve, wholly or in part, money awarded under the Business Recovery Grant Program.
In the biggest, two men, Alexander D. Koltovskoy and Vincent M. Pizzi III, are scheduled to stand trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Sept. 22 on charges that they fraudulently obtained $315,000 in grants and loans from the government, including nearly $65,000 in business recovery grants and a $228,000 disaster loan from the federal Small Business Administration.
They are accused of falsely claiming that their executive search company, Alexander Edwards International, was in 2 World Trade Center, the south tower, on Sept. 11, 2001, though prosecutors say it left the trade center in 1999.
The indictment charges that they buttressed their applications with fraudulent documents attesting to their presence in 2 World Trade Center on 9/11 and to having lost $87,000 in equipment, furniture and fixtures when the building collapsed.
Irving Anolik, Mr. Koltovskoy's lawyer, said Friday that his client was the company's president. He said that Mr. Koltovskoy "says he did not willingly or knowingly say anything false in his applications." He added that Mr. Koltovskoy "says that in many instances he was misled" by "contradictory and conflicting information" from officials when he applied to the programs.
A lawyer for Mr. Pizzi did not return a phone call to his office. Mr. Anolik said Mr. Pizzi was the company's manager.
In the second-biggest case, a Maryland resident, David Zimmer, is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday on charges that he stole $270,000 from the Business Recovery Grant Program by claiming that a financial company he headed, DZ Investments, was in Suite 1023 at 40 Rector Street. That is several blocks south of the trade center, but close enough to qualify for the highest level of compensation.
Federal prosecutors said there was no Suite 1023 at 40 Rector. In fact, they said, the entire 10th floor of 40 Rector has been occupied by the New York City Commission on Human Rights for more than 10 years.
Mr. Zimmer, according to the charges, submitted to the Empire State Development Corporation what was "purported to be" a copy of his company's 2000 tax return, listing its address at 40 Rector and reporting more than $3 million in gross receipts. Grants were made based in part on a company's revenues during its last pre-9/11 tax year.
But the criminal complaint said that the company's 2000 tax return on file with the Internal Revenue Service listed its address at a home in Bethesda, Md., and reported zero gross receipts for the year. Mr. Zimmer is also accused of submitting a fake lease showing his company's occupancy at 40 Rector beginning in June 1995.
Mr. Zimmer did not respond to a message left Friday at a phone number, listed in his name, at the Bethesda address.
A spokesman for the Manhattan prosecutors would not say whether tips from the public, suspicions raised by program auditors or other signals had led investigators to focus on DZ Investments and Alexander Edwards International, nor would a spokesman for the office of the inspector general for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which provided the money for the business recovery grants. 
The inspector general's office is under a Congressional directive to audit the department's 9/11-related spending closely.
The other federal court cases each involve several thousands of dollars reportedly swindled from a program under which the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is using federal money to provide grants of up to $14,500 to encourage residents of Lower Manhattan to remain and others to move there. One case has resulted in a guilty plea; the others are pending.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT; 
For Serious Food in Sayville

BYLINE:  By JOANNE STARKEY; E-mail: lidining@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CRAZY DOG has put a bit of snap into the Sayville dining scene. The newcomer is the sibling of the seven-year-old Crazy Dog in Westhampton Beach, and like its big brother, the Sayville restaurant combines a whimsical air and decor with serious food.
 The sprawling, completely renovated building, which was last home to the J.D. Greenery bar and restaurant, offers a variety of seating. There are a half-dozen outdoor tables on the narrow front porch; a couple of tables in the action-filled barroom; a large, modern dining room with dark wood floors, wainscoting and natural-colored fabric on its walls; and an enclosed porch with two walls of large windows. Every table is graced with a white cloth, an ultramodern oil lamp and a spray of orchids. 
 The dog theme runs through the restaurant. A few statues of silly-looking canines are stationed near the entrance and on the bar. Another is perched above the hostess's station. In what seems to be a detail meant to complement the theme, the restrooms are labeled "sires" and "dames" (it could be worse).
 The beautiful barroom is an agreeable place for a drink. Apart from its crazed dog sculptures, it features dark blue walls, a marble bar, a bowl of orchids, a huge round wall mirror and seven tiny hanging lights, each with a purple or blue beaded shade.
 One potential drawback to the restaurant is its noise level. When the place fills up, conversation is difficult. And as much as I love 60's rock, it is not the ideal background music for a meal.
 Noise aside, there's plenty to like here. Service is sweet, caring and attentive, and the food is usually right on target.
 The executive chef is Eric Rifkin, an owner of the restaurants who has a head-turning resume. It includes a stint working with Anne Rosenzweig at the Lobster Club in Manhattan. That first-class experience is reflected in Mr. Rifkin's food, most apparently in the lobster club sandwich, a satisfying triple-decker with big chunks of lobster replacing the more familiar turkey. (That sandwich is also a star at the Crazy Dog in Westhampton Beach.)
 Mr. Rifkin is joined by John Holmes, his chef de cuisine. Long Islanders may remember him as the first chef at Tellers Chophouse in Islip. His experience there is reflected in the large lineup of steaks and chops at the Sayville Crazy Dog.
 Unfortunately, one of the two dishes that failed to measure up was one of those steaks: a very gristly, chewy rib-eye. The 12-ounce filet mignon, on the other hand, was butter-tender and exceptionally flavorful. It was made even better by the onion rings we ordered a la carte: a big platter of crisp wisps. At $4, they would make an economical appetizer for a table to share.
 The other shortfall was the Tuscan pizza, which had savory toppings -- prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, arugula and truffle oil -- but also a too-thick, bready crust.
 Those two losers aside, nearly everything else was off the charts. The top three openers were the chopped salad loaded with assertive ingredients like calamata olives and oven-dried tomatoes; six crunchy fried oysters sitting on a bed of cooling diced cucumber and drizzled with a spicy chipotle aioli; and a seafood special that really impressed: a super-large four-ounce scallop placed over diced sweet potato, asparagus and corn in a scallop shell.
 Rounding out the seven sensational entrees (including the lobster club sandwich and the filet mignon) were three specials and two other choices from the menu. The two from the menu were a caramelized swordfish chop, served with tiny Manila clams, and tender pork osso bucco in a tangy barbecue sauce.
 The three specials were a beautifully cooked wild salmon; giant prawns, served with the heads still on and accompanied by diced tomatoes, pesto, a saffron aioli and broccolini; and a fall-away-tender lamb shank in a chipotle barbecue sauce. The last was crowned with onion rings and paired with both whipped and grilled sweet potatoes.
 We ignored the cheesecakes, which were made elsewhere, and zeroed in on the homemade desserts. The warm peach crisp made from local peaches and gilded with both ice cream and whipped cream was a hit, as were the same homemade doughnuts that wowed me at the Westhampton Beach Crazy Dog. The doughnuts, five sugar-coated, airy pillows with no center holes, arrived with a ramekin of warm raspberry dipping sauce. Two other must-orders were the fallen chocolate souffle with its gooey, rich texture and the very creamy rice pudding enhanced by a dollop of whipped cream.

HEADLINE: The Old South Fork, Not to Be Forgotten 

BYLINE:  By PETER C. BELLER

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON 

 BODY:
WHO remembers the best way to cook bunker, skirt Prohibition or hunt "coots" on Gardiners Bay? The old-timers of the South Fork remember, and after six years and almost 180 interviews their tales of fishing, farming and family life in East Hampton can now be read, listened to and watched.
 Comprising hundreds of pages of recollections and stories from the area's older residents, an oral history of East Hampton was completed and delivered to the town library's Pennypacker Long Island Collection in June. The project, begun in 1997 by Tony Prohaska and his partner, Martha Kalser, sought to capture memories of the South Fork on paper, audio and video tape before a generation of history is lost forever. 
 "People don't know there was a town there before the Hamptons was invented," said Mr. Prohaska, speaking of the decline of an older way of life as summer residents flooded into the area in the past 50 years. 
 Mr. Prohaska, 60, and Ms. Kalser, 65, set up a nonprofit organization and began interviewing friends and relatives. Even after they moved from East Hampton to Delray Beach, Fla., several years ago they continued their work, interviewing other former East Hamptonites who had to retired to the Sunshine State.
 The result, the History Project, is a fully indexed and transcribed series of interviews, some lasting several hours, covering the first half of the 20th century, a period framed roughly by the arrival of the railroad to the South Fork in 1895 and World War II. Photographs, memorabilia and original documents accompany many transcripts.
 "I had an idea of the kind of people I wanted to interview," said Mr. Prohaska, who felt he had to hurry because old age was fast claiming friends who were important sources of information. "I knew I wasn't going to get everybody."
 Each person who was interviewed suggested others who could provide more information on particular subjects, Ms. Kalser said. "Then the list began to grow," she said. "We just had to stop at one point."
 The interviews read like friendly conversations and range through dozens of topics, usually in just a few pages, with frequent references to forgotten place names and long-shuttered businesses and gathering spots.
 Three subjects appear frequently in the interviews: rum-running during Prohibition, the Hurricane of 1938 and World War II, the end of which saw the acceleration of the Hamptons' transition to a summer resort. First-hand accounts of the landing of Nazi saboteurs on an Amagansett beach in 1942 recount a brief time when the region caught the national spotlight.
 But it is reflections on aspects of an everyday life, now all but extinct, that give a real sense of the past.
 Abigail Edwards Field, now 105 years old, describes in one interview the deaths of her husband and two brothers while fishing in the 1938 storm, and in another conversation fondly recalls cooking bunker, now used as a baitfish. 
"Don't fry it because it's so full of the finest little rib bones," she said of the small, oily fish. Instead, her brother Sam would "put them in a dripping pan about so deep and a little water and a tiny bit of vinegar and let them go in the oven very, very slow. Then you could eat that fish and have a grand old time."
 While researching a possible book, Mr. Prohaska interviewed two dozen old-timers before deciding on the oral history project in 1997. One of the earlier interviews, in 1991, was with the late Mary Gosman, whose chowder shack on Montauk Harbor grew into the restaurant complex and wholesale fish market that is one of Montauk's highest-profile enterprises. She lamented the cost of modern medicine.
 "When somebody has a new baby that it's gonna cost $3,000 or more," said Mrs. Gosman, a mother of six. "Dr. Nugent delivered all of mine in my own house in Amagansett, $50 for each one. I've had no trouble whatever."
While the project's organizers intentionally avoided stories about the famous writers, artists and film stars who migrated to the East End, some of their interview subjects are known west of the Shinnecock Canal.
 Perry B. Duryea Jr., the former State Assembly speaker and onetime gubernatorial candidate, spoke about commercial fishing, hunting coots, as black ducks are sometimes known, and driving from Amagansett to Montauk on the "old cinder road," a stretch of Route 27 that was still unpaved.
 "When you put all these pieces together, it really is like a jigsaw puzzle," said Peter Garnham of the Amagansett Historical Society, an adviser on the project. "What happened at this baseball game? Do you remember the time the such and such house was moved? These are the things that don't make the newspapers but are the fabric of local history." 
 The audio recordings will preserve the local Bonac dialect, which harks back to the days when East Hampton was closer in travel time and spirit to New England than to New York City, Mr. Garnham said. The project is the first comprehensive oral history in the area and narrates East Hampton's evolution from a New England outpost to a fishing, whaling and farming center to a service-based economy.
 "We just put it out there," said Ms. Kalser, asked if the interviews perpetuate an overly rosy view of the past. "We didn't go in with an agenda. We had rich people. We had middle-class people, farmers and fishermen, politicians, teachers."
 Carleton Kelsey, a former Amagansett librarian and local historian who was interviewed for the project, said the casual style of interviewing elicits more honesty, not less, because people feel comfortable talking about things they might once have been embarrassed to speak of.
 "The people who were interviewed didn't hold anything back," Mr. Kelsey, 88, said.
 Mr. Prohaska said few people declined his requests to speak to them, although one man asked that parts of his testimony not be published until his death, fearing the frowns of his neighbors.
 Mr. Prohaska and Ms. Kalser are now working with Suffolk County Community College in Riverhead to transfer all the material to a single compact disc, which could be cheaply reproduced and distributed to other libraries and institutions.
 For some older residents, the oral history was a chance to feel that their lives were important and not forgotten.
 "They all seemed to have a life story they were waiting to tell," Mr. Prohaska said. "In a way, we were looking for the people that had that desire but nobody was going to ask them."

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES; 
Two Neighbors Find Common Destination

BYLINE:  By WENDY GINSBERG

DATELINE: GLASSBORO 

 BODY:
ROWAN UNIVERSITY and the borough it has called home since about 1917 -- a mix of peach orchards and big-box stores and a faded downtown -- have been on speaking terms for several years. Now comes the tricky part: profiting from the conversation.
 "Twenty to 30 years ago this was a college town, and the college community came into the downtown," Joseph Brigandi Jr., the borough administrator, said recently. "But then there weren't strip malls and shopping malls nearby. The focus went away from downtown and it got run down." 
 But a failing downtown does not bode well for a university hoping to attract new students, especially since most high school seniors here graduate and then head to college in Pennsylvania. So this 9.2-square-mile town in the shadows of Camden and Philadelphia and the university decided they had to do something drastic -- cooperate-- if either was to survive. 
 "There's no question that we annoy each other," said Dr. Donald J. Farish, president of Rowan and a member of a steering committee that is trying to turn the town around. "It's a family that has to live together and is at times dysfunctional, but we keep our minds on the big picture."
 That picture paints Glassboro and its struggling downtown as a bustling college town, says Dr. Farish, on the order of Nassau Street in Princeton or George Street in New Brunswick. 
 That will be no easy task for this town of about 20,000 that derives its name from its past. As home to Stanger Glassworks and later the Whitney Brothers Glassworks, Glassboro was known as one of the state's top glass manufacturing towns from the late 18th century until 1920. But in 1917, when the glass business here was dying, residents donated land to the state in an effort to entice lawmakers to build a college. Eventually, Glassboro State College was born. 
 Few would even be aware of the existence of the college until 1967, when President Lyndon B. Johnson invited the Soviet premier, Aleksei Kosygin, to a summit here. Once again, the school would drop off most people's radar screens until 1992, when Henry Rowan, a local manufacturer who did not even attend Glassboro, donated $100 million -- at the time the largest sum ever given to a public university -- on the condition that the school be renamed after them. 
 Today, Rowan's collection of 42 buildings, sprawled across 25 acres, hugs the east side of the borough. About a half-mile from the university, a cluster of small shops that flank Glassboro's two main streets compose the downtown area.
 "Students come in here for tours and ask, 'Where are the coffee shops and book stores?"' said Dr. Farish. "I try to distract them and say, 'Hey, look over there cows!"' 
 During the summer, a retired professor at Rowan opened the town's first used book store, which also serves coffee. And while Dr. Farish is pushing for more stores to open downtown, Mr. Brigandi wants to make sure that Glassboro does not end up like neighboring Washington Township, which has a number of large chain stores. What neither man wants is for students to spend their money there or the nearby Deptford Mall.
 "Sometimes, you have a student body that comes primarily from suburbia," said Dr. James J. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. "It's a culture of regional malls and automobiles. You have to change their habits, and it doesn't happen by itself. There has to be something in that downtown for them to go to."
 Besides helping the town attract trendy shops visited by middle-class students with money to spend, the university also wants to nearly triple in size. But that kind of development takes tax dollars away from the borough and causes local homeowners to pay higher property taxes, since according to state law, colleges and universities are not required to pay taxes on land they own.
 "It's a double-edged sword that the presence of the university brings," Dr. Farish said. "It has an important and positive impact, but it also takes away taxes from the town."
 While Mr. Briganti estimated that more than $1 million a a year is lost in property taxes because of Rowan's presence, that is only part of the equation. Rowan brings an estimated $47 million a year to the borough, including $18.1 million in salaries for local residents and $25 million in revenue from students and visitors.
 "There's increasing employment because they're here," Mr. Briganti said. "And there's funding to build a technology park. And while they might not be paying a lot of taxes, they might cause other tax-paying businesses to come into town."
 Dr. Hughes also pointed out that if the university did not exist, many of Rowan's 25 acres would be covered instead with residential homes filled with children, who would each have to be educated at $10,000 a year, and that usually means higher property taxes.
 To offset the loss of property tax income and to maintain civil relations with the town, Rowan gives the borough $58,000 a year. "It's something by way of being a good neighbor," said Dr. Farish. "Rubbing people's nose in things doesn't make it better."
 Dr. Farish's neighborliness is about to be tested again. As recently as last Wednesday, Dr. Farish postponed a vote to authorize negotiations with a modular townhouse manufacturer after residents urged the university not to clear an area off Route 322 tract for student housing -- part of a $27.3 million project -- in one of the borough's oldest wooded tracts.
 Relations between the university and borough were not always so amicable. Just five years ago, before Dr. Farish took over as president, most here agree that there was no cooperation between the two entities. "It wasn't that there was a dislike or anything, but neither side was working together," Mr. Brigandi said. "Anything that happened off campus wasn't their problem."
 Today, university officials are encouraging students and faculty members to become active in the community. To that end, for three years the university has offered an an incentive -- an additional $1,500 a year for 10 years -- to get faculty members to move here.
 Courtney Richmond and Michael Grove, biology professors who are married, were among the first to move in.
 "It wasn't just the money," said Ms. Richmond. "It's great to be able to walk to work. We do experiments all the time and this gives us the ability to walk there because we're right near campus. And a lot of other faculty are moving into this area. It's really positively affecting our social lives."
 But the timing of the initiative was unfortunate. Not long after Rowan bought 17 acres here for a new presidential house and meeting center, the costly plans were tabled. Instead, the university bought a sprawling granite house in nearby Woodbury for $685,000 and then made another $300,000 in renovations.
 Nonetheless, Glassboro officials want to make the most of the rapprochement with the university, and have promised nearly $12 million in improvements, including the construction of a road that would link the university to the downtown. As it is now, students have to weave through a cluster of residential streets to get to the small downtown strip. In addition, borough officials would like to build a hotel with conference rooms adjacent to the university, though the move is opposed by some residents because it would mean the demolition of existing homes, including Betty Morro's 55-year-old house.
 "I'm upset," said Ms. Morro, a 70-year-old widow who lives in the path of the planned thoroughfare. "I don't want to leave my house. My husband built this house. I plan to die here. Where would I go?"
 Across the street, Anthony and DeAnna Kennedy, who are both disabled, are not particularly eager for the new road to be built. "We appreciate the university," said the 49-year-old Mr. Kennedy. "I even went there when it was Glassboro State. But I love this house. We'll be able to go somewhere, I guess, but we don't want to go anywhere."
 Rowan's nascent expansion has also met with some resistance in Camden, where the university wants to take over an entire block to build a $10-million, five-story building.
 That block thrived through the 1970's, when it was primarily home to a cluster of law and insurance offices as well as some small retail businesses. It fell into disrepair in the 1980's, but over the last decade, shops and restaurants have moved in, catering primarily to the expanding Rutgers-Camden campus nearby. Moreover, some of the buildings on the block are historically significant, including an ornate old bank building at North Third and Market Streets.
 Despite the hurdles that face both Rowan and Glassboro, Dr. Hughes of Rutgers says both are on the right path. 
 "Improvements to the community really make the school better," said Dr. Hughes, noting the success that Rutgers has had in New Brunswick and the University of Pennsylvania's efforts to improve its surroundings in West Philadelphia. "You've really got to work hard."

Hey, What Happened to My Rebate?

BYLINE:  By JON SHURE; Jon Shure is president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, which conducts research on state issues.

 BODY:
NOW -- perhaps still sitting in a mailbox near you -- the incredible shrinking rebate.
 Yes it's that time of year again. The State of New Jersey is sending checks to homeowners as its way of saying, "We know your property taxes are too high, so here's a little something." 
 And this year it's a "littler" something than before. That's because even though the State of New Jersey cares about you very much, well, to tell you the truth it's a bit short these days. You know, bad economy, budget crisis and all that. 
 Last year Governor McGreevey helped to close the state budget gap by trimming people whose yearly income surpassed $200,000 from the list of who would receive NJ Saver rebate checks. This year he proposed limiting the checks to those making $100,000 or more, but the Legislature balked. Better to cut the rebate checks in half, lawmakers said, than to cut anyone else off the list. So this year the average check is $250 instead of $500. The Legislature also passed a budget that virtually froze aid to schools and municipalities -- assuring that most people's property tax bills will go up this year by much more than the $250.
 O.K., $250 is nothing to sneeze at. Who couldn't use a few extra bucks?
 But sooner or later, someone is going to convince the people of New Jersey there is a better way. This rebate business like putting a Band-Aid on cancer. It all started in 1976, when New Jersey first imposed a state income tax. We came to it later than most states, and figured that one way to ease the sting would be to make very sure the tax could be used for only one purpose: reducing the burden of local property taxes.
 So far, so good, because no state relies more than New Jersey on property taxes, and this causes big problems. It means some towns can afford better schools and services than other towns because they have abundant property wealth to tax. It also means that elderly residents who bought their houses for a song 50 years ago and long ago paid off their mortgage are now getting clobbered by a tax bill based on the hugely escalated value of their house rather than on their income -- the latter being a far more reliable measure of someone's ability to pay.
 If the state's impulse was well placed, the execution leaves a bit to be desired. Property tax relief means school aid and municipal aid, and the state provides these things. But the decision was also made in '76 that a piece of the property tax pie ought to be handed directly to homeowners (renters too, by use of a formula that calculates approximately what percentage of their rent goes to pay the landlord's property tax bill). The vehicle back then was the Homestead Rebate. And the fact that the first checks went our shortly before Election Day in 1977 was no coincidence. Gov. Brendan T. Byrne was running for re-election and a lot of people thought his presiding over the passage of the income tax would make him a goner.
 Mr. Byrne won in a landslide, and the rebate check became a New Jersey staple. The Homestead Rebate went through various changes over the years, and in the 1990's, Gov. Christie Whitman created NJ Saver to be the largest of four programs that put property tax relief directly into people's hands. It was a very generous plan, based on the value of your house and what share of your tax bill went for school financing (the statewide average being about half).
 In fact, it was too generous. Since the money wasn't there to implement the program in full, Governor Whitman decided to phase it in over five years. She said the state would handle the increased costs through expanded revenue from the growing economy and from continued government efficiency. Then the economy pretty much stopped growing. And while one shouldn't go so far as to say "government efficiency" is an oxymoron, we're talking about a couple billion dollars needed for tax relief here.
 Today, Governor McGreevey maintains the tax rebate tradition, if in a reduced version. What he should do instead is scrap it completely. This patchwork system of adding a program here and there doesn't give enough relief and doesn't deliver it to those most in need. Better to end the charade. Raise broad state taxes based on people's ability to pay -- like the income tax -- and use the money to pay for more of the services that towns and schools today pay from property taxes. It's time to stop nibbling at the edges. The problem is too big for that. And it's only getting bigger -- even as the rebates grow smaller.

HEADLINE: Proposal at W.T.O. Meeting Rejects Changes in Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: CANCUN, Mexico, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
A compromise proposal issued at the meeting of the World Trade Organization here today rejects most of the pleas for change in agriculture from the developing world, including African cotton producers, and generally allows the United States to maintain its billions in annual subsidies.
 The proposal, which had been prepared to help narrow the differences that have stalled progress on a global trade agreement, was met with disappointment by several of the developing nations that formed the so-called Group of 21 to stand together against the world's economic heavyweights, the United States, Europe and Japan. 
 Celso Amorim, the Brazilian minister of foreign affairs, said in an interview that the compromise draft offered "much less than we would expect."
"The changes for us are very modest, but if not for the G-21 we would have gotten nothing," he added. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Amorim said the coalition of developing nations would not be divided by the setback.
"We are alive and fighting," he said, "not in a confrontational way but with dialogue."
Under the proposal, Europe would begin eliminating export subsidies for agricultural goods. In exchange, the W.T.O. would broaden categories covered by trade rules, to include investment. Developing countries do not want the rules expanded in such a fashion, for fear that the trade laws will undermine their national laws covering labor, human rights and environmental protection. Environmental groups say the proposal could erode current environmental protections in favor of foreign investment. Negotiators have until Sunday night to amend the proposal, and then accept or reject it.
This round of trade talks, begun two years ago in Qatar, was called to help developing countries and was expected to produce a big reduction in the $300 billion paid every year to farmers in the world's richest nations. Those subsidies, which have undermined the lives of millions of farmers in the world's poorest nations, have been deemed unfair by the World Bank.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said in a short statement that he found the new proposal "constructive."
The proposal offered a reprieve to American cotton farmers, some of the most heavily subsidized in the world. And it urged beleaguered African farmers to plant other crops. There is no mention of paying compensation for the losses to the farmers, as requested.
Chanting "Down Down W.T.O.," some 2,000 protesters tore down fortified barricades today that had been erected by the police to keep demonstrators away from the talks. Some protesters rolled a battering ram cobbled from garbage cans and a tree trunk, vowing to "tear down the barriers of imperialism."
Dozens of women carrying wire cutters began slicing holes into the tall chain-link security fence. Meanwhile other protesters, led by a group of South Korean activists, tied rope to the frame and pulled the fence to the pavement.
Police officers made minimal effort to stop the protest. And after accomplishing their goal, W.T.O. opponents from at least 20 countries, many of them students, sat in the street and applauded their solidarity. There were no clashes between the protesters and the police.
Globalization opponents said the demonstration was the climax of a week of action intended to draw attention to the people and places they say have been harmed by existing free-trade treaties and unfettered foreign investment. Parallel to the trade organization's meeting, nonprofit organizations from around the world have held forums to present alternative economic development strategies that they say would put poor countries on a more level playing field with the United States, Europe and Japan.
Protests -- some playful and others deadly serious -- have tried to dramatize the plight of millions of small farmers who cannot compete with subsidized products from the United States and Europe that flood world markets. Demonstrators threw corn on speakers at news briefings by the United States and took off swimsuits to spell out "No W.T.O." with their bodies in the sand.
On Wednesday, a march by several thousand farmers turned violent when a few dozen protesters broke through barricades and lobbed sticks and pieces of concrete at police. In the heat of the fighting, a South Korean farmer, wearing a sign that said "W.T.O. Kills Farmers," climbed to the top of a barricade and fatally stabbed himself. "Sometimes violence is the only choice of the poor or the weak," said Kim Seok, a South Korean demonstrator.
Newspapers here ran almost daily warnings of terror by the protesters. Authorities transformed this resort into a bunker, with thousands of federal police manning roadblocks and navy ships floating off the coast.
But the protests in Cancun have not escalated to the violence that marred the WTO meetings in Seattle in 1999. Protesters acknowledged that their attitudes had been tempered by international terrorism and their opposition to the war against Iraq. Still, they said, their commitment to the cause remained strong.
"We believe that people on an international level are gaining a real conscience of the problems of agriculture," said Rafael Alegria, the leader of an international farmers' organization called Via Campesina. "We feel that the people are supporting us in our just demands."

HEADLINE: Pregnant Workers Filing More Complaints of Bias 

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
WITH the economy uncertain and many companies looking to keep down costs and pare their employment rolls, growing numbers of workers are filing charges of pregnancy discrimination. 
 Lawyers specializing in labor law as well as leaders of women's advocacy groups around the country say they have detected an increase in pregnancy discrimination cases in recent years. And at the federal level, claims of discriminatory treatment during pregnancy filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have increased 39 percent over the last 10 years, to 4,714 in 2002. That is a tiny fraction of the number of working women, but Jocelyn C. Frye, director of legal and public policy for the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group for women in the workplace, said that this was because pregnancy discrimination cases rarely reach the federal level. Many complaints are handled by state agencies, settled or simply dropped. 
 "Most women are not inclined to go to court, especially with a baby coming," she said. Even so, the number of women calling her organization for information on how to handle discrimination has increased over the last two years, she said. 
Ellen Bravo, the director of 9to5 National Association of Working Women in Milwaukee, said, "Pregnancy discrimination is still alive and well and escalating." She attributed some of the increase in complaints to corporate downsizing, but said a heightened awareness of women's rights at work also played a role. 
Jennifer James, 24, says she believes she was a victim of pregnancy discrimination when she lost her job at a brewery-style restaurant in Lake Grove on Long Island.
According to a suit being brought on her behalf in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by the equal-employment commission, Ms. James was promoted from server to supervisor at the restaurant, one of a chain owned by John Harvard's Brew House, which is based in Braintree, Mass.
But Ms. James said that things fell apart in April 2001, after she told her manager that she was pregnant. "He asked me, 'Are you sure about this?' and 'Have you considered your options?"' she said in a recent interview.
In the weeks that followed her disclosure, she said, she found herself taken off the schedule and unable to get work at any John Harvard restaurants. According to the commission's complaint, the company misbehaved by "denying her any work assignments despite her repeated requests and terminating her employment in approximately August 2001."
John Harvard's president, Michael Hackney, declined to discuss details of the case other than to say that Ms. James's pregnancy had nothing to do with what happened to her. He said his firm was the "model of diversity" with 40 percent of its general managers being women. 
Deborah Weinstein, a labor and employment lawyer in Philadelphia who also teaches employment law at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said the increasing number of pregnancy cases can be traced to more women working, and a greater awareness of workers' rights. The introduction of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, she said, has also led more pregnant women to assert their rights under the law.
At the same time, the weak economy is forcing companies to cut back, inevitably laying off some pregnant women or women on maternity leave when they let groups of employees go, legal experts said. 
Pressure to improve performance and profitability has led some managers to panic when they hear that a crucial employee is pregnant, said Mark S. Spring, a lawyer in Sacramento with Carlton, DiSante & Freudenberger, who represents employers in labor disputes.
Mr. Spring also recalled a case in which he represented a company where a manager was being pushed for better performance. "The regional sales manager was under pressure to increase the performance in his region, and as a result he shifted this pregnant woman onto a much smaller territory in his region before she went out on leave," he said. She sued, and the company ended up settling that case. 
Over the last two years, Mr. Spring said, he has seen a steep rise in the number of pregnancy discrimination cases at his firm, with three to four cases going on at any given time, compared with one such case every few years in the past.
Ms. Bravo of 9to5 says she believes that pregnancy discrimination cases are undercounted because many women are afraid to make waves. Some accept demotions because they are happy to have a job and others believe that a lawsuit could be career suicide. 
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is using the John Harvard case to shed light on what it believes is the growing problem of pregnancy discrimination, said Kam S. Wong, a trial lawyer for the commission.
But cases of pregnancy discrimination rarely reflect a companywide prejudice, said Charles Joseph, a lawyer in Manhattan with Joseph & Herzfeld who represents employees in labor disputes "It's usually idiot individuals within corporations."
Mr. Joseph generally advises employees who suspect discrimination to try to work things out with direct supervisors before lodging a formal complaint with human resources or upper management. 
It is also important for an employee to keep records if pregnancy discrimination is a concern, he said. 
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 gives narrow entitlements to pregnant women, said Ms. Weinstein of Wharton. Employers are required to treat pregnant employees in the same manner they would treat nonpregnant employees with similar abilities or limitations.
They are not required to make special accommodations related to pregnancy because pregnancy is not a disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act. "You can be fired if you don't do your job," she said.
In several cases, the courts have ruled in favor of employers who fired pregnant women who were consistently late even though the women said they were experiencing morning sickness. While the Family and Medical Leave Act entitles women to take some time off from work to deal with severe morning sickness or prenatal examinations, they may not be protected if lateness affects their job performance and an employer reprimands or fires other nonpregnant employees for similar behavior.
Experts on women's employment emphasize that communication with managers about the issues surrounding pregnancy is critical. "Go to your boss, make recommendations," said Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president for research and information services at Catalyst, a nonprofit research firm in New York focused on helping to women advance in business. "Tell them you'll train someone before you go out on leave, and assure him or her you won't disappear when you take time off after delivery."
But such assurances, Ms. Brumit Kropf said, "may not work for every manager in America."
Indeed, Ms. James, the former John Harvard supervisor, said she reassured her manager she would still be committed to her job and take only four weeks of maternity leave. "I wasn't expecting special treatment," she said. "I would have done anything to keep my job, the secure income, especially with the baby coming."

The Philharmonic Struggles in Uncertain Times

BYLINE:  By BRIAN WISE

 BODY:
THE Long Island Philharmonic begins its 25th season on Friday, an anniversary that many orchestras would mark with special programming, commissioned works, tours or recordings. But the ensemble's board spent the summer trying to whittle away a $300,000 deficit and searching for a new executive director. Management and musicians alike hope that the performances of Dvorak's "New World" Symphony scheduled for the opening programs will be a celebration of the orchestra's own rebirth.
 "Dollar-wise we have been in worse shape in the past, but one of the main concerns now is the direction of the economy," said John Russell, president of the Philharmonic's board. "Whether or not we can expect corporations and government entities to return to their former levels of support, that's the concern." 
 The economic troubles, which last season included paying the musicians late, come in the midst of criticism by players about the group's artistic direction. Among the complaints are the steady reduction of the length of the subscription season and an increased reliance on popular fare, which some say comes at the expense of the creative programming that helped the Philharmonic attain a strong reputation as a regional orchestra under conductors like Christopher Keene, its founding music director, and Marin Alsop, music director from 1990 to 1996.
 Like many American orchestras, the Philharmonic saw its funding base decline after Sept. 11, 2001, accelerating financial problems it was already having because of the weak economy and forcing it to cut many educational programs.
 A move to shore up the orchestra's finances came in June 2002, when the board hired Chris Von Zwehl as its executive director. He is an entrepreneur who helped raise money for Empire Waterlink, a New Jersey company building a ferry service with New York, but has no musical background. When Mr. Von Zwehl resigned in May, the orchestra named Brian McCaffrey, a board member, to take over until a replacement is found.
 "The candidate has to know something about music, although I don't think that's the primary quality we're looking for," said Larry Austin, chairman of the Philharmonic's board and a member of the search committee. "The primary quality is executive leadership style, and number two is being able to manage the organization. But he's got to know the difference between Tchaikovsky and Billy Joel."
 While the orchestra has had brushes with bankruptcy before, the present problems appear to have descended quickly upon an unsuspecting board, largely because of cuts in state and local government assistance. The orchestra has traditionally received what Mr. McCaffrey called "a significant amount of money" from the state, but in recent years has seen less from that source.
 The present deficit of $300,000 affects an annual budget of $2.1 million, which pays for hall rentals, marketing and production costs, as well as paying the musicians and David Wiley, the music director.
 Ticket and subscription sales account for 19 percent of the orchestra's revenue, foundation grants account for 3 percent, gifts 6 percent, sponsorships 17 percent, and fundraising, which includes the orchestra's annual gala concert, 35 percent. State and local governments contribute 15 percent. The Philharmonic does not have an endowment.
 Mr. McCaffrey said the orchestra was appealing to corporations, private donors and foundations for money. So far, it has not asked for pay cuts in musicians' salaries, which are 32 percent of its annual budget. New contract negotiations with the players are scheduled to begin next year.
 Last season, the orchestra had to scramble to pay the musicians for the final concerts. Eventually, the union, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, was instrumental in getting the players paid.
 Among musicians, there is criticism of the programming under Mr. Wiley, who was appointed in 2001. This season, for example, the "Classics" series, traditionally devoted to core orchestral literature, includes one program consisting of film scores as well as others with familiar, light fare like Grieg's "Peer Gynt" Suite. 
 "Finding a balance between pops and classics is an age-old question," Mr. Wiley said. "But we don't sacrifice classics to do more pops." He added: "After 9/11, we did not remove any of the classics programs. The board, staff and I thought that it was essential to our identity and to the quality of the group."
 Mr. McCaffrey, acting executive director, said the orchestra was trying "to offer a little bit wider range of programming." He continued: "There are people who clearly will go to a pops concert that will also go to a classical one. This is an active discussion with this board all of the time. How do we shift with the times? What do the listeners want to hear? How do we maintain our mission and provide a broader range? What you see now is that evolution. I don't think it's dominated by pops, but it has that element."
 The Philharmonic was founded by the late folk singer Harry Chapin and C.R. Merolla, president of the Bank of Babylon, who met in 1978 to unite two struggling local orchestras, the Long Island Symphony and the Suffolk Symphony. By the mid-80's, the Philharmonic was featured on several recordings and a series of radio concerts on WQXR in New York. The orchestra has long engaged international-caliber soloists. 
 This season features only one major soloist, the cellist Lynn Harrell, who opens the season playing Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky. The rest of the programs cut costs by featuring local musicians, and several of the orchestra's own players as soloists. The unpaid Long Island Symphony Chorus has been engaged for two programs.
 Meanwhile, over the years, subscription concerts have been reduced. In the 1980's and early 90's, the orchestra presented as many as eight sets of programs a year, consisting of two or three concerts each. This brought together the musicians, two-thirds of whom commute from New York City, New Jersey and Westchester County, for at least one concert per month from September through May.
 This season there are five programs, consisting of two concerts each, plus a pops concert and a New Year's Eve celebration. Management points out that there are two more concerts this year than last.
 Mr. McCaffrey remains optimistic that new sponsors will be found to help the group become financially healthy. The Melville-based healthcare product distributor Henry Schein is sponsoring the November subscription concerts, he said, adding that other deals are in the works. The board is also in talks with several concert promoters about plans for a benefit fundraising concert at the Nassau Coliseum for November.
 "The notion would be to hopefully get some name artists, hopefully Long Islanders, to come and play and help us raise money," Mr. McCaffrey said.
 The Long Island Philharmonic will perform on Friday at 8 p.m. at Tilles Center in Brookville, and on Saturday at 8 p.m. at Staller Center in Stony Brook. Information: (631)293-2222 or www.liphilharmonic.com.

HEADLINE: Blown Away 

BYLINE:  By TOM CLAVIN

 BODY:
WITHOUT weather satellites, and before radar had been introduced as a forecasting tool, the people of Long Island never saw the meteorological beast before it pounced on Sept. 21, 1938, 65 years ago next Sunday.
 A mighty hurricane roared in from the Atlantic. Sustained winds were 120 miles per hour as the storm's eye came ashore at Westhampton Beach. Fifty-one people died on the Island, which suffered about $365 million worth of damage, estimated in today's dollars. 
 In the days before such storms were given official names, the 1938 hurricane was dubbed the Long Island Express because it advanced at speeds of up to 60 m.p.h. and, after finishing with the Island, it hit five New England states in just six hours. It remains the most devastating weather event on Long Island, and with about 600 total deaths it was the fourth deadliest hurricane in United States history. In addition to those killed, 63,000 were left homeless, 8,900 buildings were destroyed, 3,300 boats were lost and two billion trees were destroyed. 
 Numerous signs of the storm's brutality remain on the East End. (Being on the west side of the storm, the rest of Suffolk County and Nassau sustained less damage.) The landmark Old Whalers Church in Sag Harbor has a curiously boxy, squat appearance, its huge steeple having been toppled in the storm and never replaced. The fishing village on the strip of land between Fort Pond Bay and Fort Pond was obliterated, never to be rebuilt. The most prominent reminders are the Shinnecock Inlet and the Shinnecock Canal, gouged out of the land by the storm and later dredged and lined and made hospitable for boat traffic.
 A person born the day of the '38 Storm would just be approaching the traditional retirement age today. But many who lived through it and were old enough to understand what was happening are still around, and their memories of the event tend to be vivid.
 Sherrill Foster, the East Hampton town historian, was a junior at East Hampton High School in the fall of 1938. Someone, she said, called the principal on Sept. 21 to tell him that a hurricane was approaching. "'We don't have hurricanes here,' he said, and slammed the phone down," Ms. Foster, 81, said recently in her home in East Hampton. "But when the kindergarteners were let out and they were being blown up against the chain-link fence, it was clear this was no ordinary storm.
 "We were told to go to our seats in the auditorium," she continued. "Most of the students, like my brother Edwin, just left and walked home. The Montauk kids were being put up in East Hampton because it was already too late to call out the buses. I sat in the auditorium, and the two gym teachers, male and female, came in with a record player. They put a record on and started dancing to reassure the students, but it was obvious they were scared to death." She was soon brought home in her father's milk truck.
 "It was a frightening day and night, and there was some damage to the farmhouse," Ms. Foster remembered. "The next day, a gorgeous one, my mother took my brother and me to Montauk. Napeague Stretch was under water. After we got through we went to the fishing village, where we had relatives and my mother had lived as a child. It was gone."
 The residents of the fishing village survived, and the oral history collection at the Montauk Library explains how. It includes a reminiscence by Gus Pitts, one of the port's first charter boat captains. Interviewed in 1994 -- he died last year at age 97 -- he recalled being on Lake Montauk that afternoon and seeing "the tidal wave coming over the jetty" and then "a puff of wind" blowing his father's car into the air, never to be found. His family and about 100 other residents of the village survived because they climbed aboard a Long Island Rail Road train on a track six feet higher than the beach and it took them west to higher ground.
 Ria Del Bene, an 83-year-old Westhampton Beach resident, remembers watching the water draining from Moniebogue Canal behind Main Street. "Not being knowledgeable about tidal waves, I didn't realize that the water gets sucked out, then comes back in a tidal wave," she recalled. She also watched as "the wind picked up a large wild cherry tree, at least 100 years old, pulled it up, roots and all, and then laid it on the ground like a huge bouquet."
 Richard Hendrickson, a Bridgehampton farmer who has been an official observer for the Weather Service for 73 years, said Long Island and Manhattan were actually lucky because of the speed of the storm. 
 "It was the fastest-moving hurricane ever recorded," said Mr. Hendrickson, who is 91. "If it had been slower, it would have flooded the South Fork and washed away half of both eastern forks. Then it would have flooded the Sound, raising water levels all the way to the city, flooding the lower half of Manhattan."
 In 1938, Mr. Hendrickson was raising breeding hens and selling the eggs from the thousands of chickens he owned. During the storm, two of his six henhouses were blown away. The chickens did not fare any better. "The wind blew the chicks against my six-foot-high fence and the rain drowned them," he recalled.
 With the hurricane far from being a distant memory, the questions 65 years later are: Could it happen again, and what have we learned?
 The answers are yes, and not much, said Michael Wyllie, the meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service office in Upton. "We haven't seen anything like the 1938 storm, and maybe that has prompted some complacency," he said. "But if a strong Category 3 hurricane like that one hit today, it would be the biggest natural disaster the country has seen, period. We have built up the coast of southern Long Island pretty much with abandon. We just did whatever we wanted to do. There really hasn't been much in the way of regulation in those 65 years."
 During the last two decades there have been some big blows, especially Hurricane Gloria in 1985 and Bob in 1991. Mr. Wyllie pointed out, however, that both were Category 1, the weakest class of hurricane, and because the eye of Bob passed to the east of Montauk Point, the Island was spared the worst of the storm's winds.
 "The damage was a few billion dollars in 1938 because of the lower population and development," Mr. Wyllie said, adjusting for inflation and including damage beyond the Island. "Estimates are, if we got hit with that same storm today, we're looking at a $75 billion loss." The record for storm damage is held by Hurricane Andrew, which wreaked an inflation-adjusted $20 billion worth of havoc on South Florida in 1992.
 The $75 billion estimate was echoed by AIR Worldwide Corporation in Boston, a risk-assessment company that recently completed a study on the impact of a storm similar to the one in 1938. Karen Clark, chief executive of the company, said that $40 billion of the estimated total damage would occur in Suffolk, Nassau, Queens and Brooklyn.
 "The biggest influence on that figure is if a storm were to hit Long Island at high tide like the one in '38 did," Ms. Clark said. "A lot of the damage would be caused by the storm surge."
 Stephen Leatherman, director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University in Miami and a consultant at Southampton College of Long Island University, has predicted that a "killer hurricane" will ravage the South Shore of Long Island in the next 15 to 20 years. 
 "There's even more vulnerability now than in 1938," said Dr. Leatherman, who recently completed a three-year laser-mapping of the shoreline from the Moriches Inlet to Montauk. "Since '38 the sea level on the South Shore of Long Island has crept up a half a foot or so, and beach recession has averaged 1.5 feet per year. This tells you the beaches and the dunes are more narrow, meaning less of a barrier against the storm surge. And of course the amount of building that has gone on is enormous. It's phenomenal. I've looked at some of the aerial photos from the '30s and compare them to what I see today, and you can hardly recognize it."
 Dr. Leatherman noted that Hurricane Fabian, which hammered Bermuda on Sept. 5, followed a track similar to that of the '38 Storm before turning northeast.
 "That's just one hurricane that gave us pause, so there is definitely a vulnerability," he said. "Looking at the historical data, there's roughly a 75-year frequency to these big ones. I think right now we're pretty close to the median time when you have to really worry. To think it won't happen is like expecting someone flipping a coin and getting 10 heads in a row."
 Yet this and similar warnings have mostly gone unheeded during six decades of real estate development, including a heavy buildup of South Shore bay- and oceanfront properties. When a mere northeaster in 1992 wrecked a stretch of the barrier beach west of Westhampton Beach, the homes there were not only rebuilt bigger and better, but its residents also incorporated a new village, West Hampton Dunes, to protect their right to rebuild oceanfront residences after storm damage. 
 A similar motivation underlies the effort now under way to incorporate the Village of Dune Hampton along the eastern coast of Southampton Town. The actor Roy Scheider has been the most visible proponent of Dune Hampton and an opponent of the town's recently enacted Coastal Erosion Hazard Law, which bans permanent shore-hardening structures and seeks to restrict oceanfront development.
 "Living at the beach is risky, and you pay high insurance prices for the privilege," Mr. Scheider said. "There are many of us here, we've been here a long time, and we accept the risk.
 "I know there are people who consider us damn fools and that you shouldn't live at the beach anyhow, but it's a free country and it's our choice," Mr. Scheider continued. "We paid the price to be here, and we'll pay the price to not be here. But it's our decision, and that should be respected."
 The attitude of waterfront owners can be vexing to lawmakers. "People love to live on the beach, and they are willing to live with the risk until the risk comes, and then they'd like you to bail them out," said Dennis Suskind, a Southampton town councilman. "That's human nature."
 The risk may be greater than some oceanfront homeowners realize. "Storm surge damage is excluded from a lot of insurance policies today," Ms. Clark said. "Someone who lives on the water, unless he has separate flood insurance their normal policy won't pay for surge damage."
 But Dr. Leatherman said it is tough to walk away from an oceanfront home. "It's just such high-value real estate," he said. "And let's face it, people have gotten away with it for a long time now, haven't they?"
 Say a hurricane mimics the 1938 storm and aims for Long Island. Is the region toast? While higher population and shoreline development might be the bad news, the good news is more sophisticated forecasting and stronger structures.
 "Today, with our satellites, we look at these things very closely," Mr. Wyllie said. "With Fabian, we were able to track its every move. We would have ample time to get people away. Question is, will they move?" 
 Move where? is the big question on the South Fork, which is notorious for the traffic jams along Route 27 on normal days, let alone emergency evacuations. "I find it interesting and humorous sometimes that we have coastal road evacuation signs when there's only one road off the South Fork," Mr. Suskind said.
 But Mr. Wyllie said that residents of the East End would not have to leave the area altogether to be safe. 
 "We've done a lot of work with Suffolk County emergency managers, and I'm pretty comfortable that they would be very proactive in getting word out and moving people," he said. "We're able to predict by combining various factors how high the wall of water will be on the shoreline when a hurricane makes landfall. Unfortunately, on Long Island it's really high, one of the highest in the country." He explained that Long Island, jutting out from the Eastern Seaboard, tends to trap and intensify the surge from any storm moving up the coast. 
 The laser-mapping project may well help in this regard too. "The maps we have are very much outdated, and we don't really know the flood zones very well," Dr. Leatherman said. "We can't pinpoint what areas of the Hamptons will be safer than others, other than, obviously, the higher ground, where you're more vulnerable to wind damage. People in waterfront and low-lying areas have to run from the storm surge, then see what's left the next day. From the Hamptons in general, there isn't a way out because it's just going to be panicked people sitting in motionless cars as two-by-fours are being tossed into their windows by the wind. But we can find the areas people will be best protected."
 Mr. Suskind said that because of stronger guidelines from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the building and rebuilding being done on the South Shore is much sturdier and storm-resistant than it was years ago. "As a homeowner here, you can't escape a hurricane," he said. "What you can do by following the FEMA regulations is increase the chance of withstanding a storm and decrease the risk of damage."
 Whatever the benefits of better forecasting, better-built structures and preparedness, a hurricane as powerful as the one in 1938 would have a highly destructive impact.
 Last September, the weekly Southampton Press published a three-part series of articles on the impact on the East End of a hypothetical Hurricane Emily following the same track as the 1938 storm. The articles were based on FEMA and National Hurricane Center scenarios of a Category 3 storm, not the strongest but probably the most powerful likely to make it this far north. By the time the fictional storm had moved on, fewer than 30 percent of the homes on the South Shore from Moriches Bay to Amagansett remained.
 With this possible scenario in mind, Mr. Wyllie has attended as many as 70 town meetings around Long Island to promote hurricane preparedness and the need for evacuation plans, and to counsel people to have realistic expectations.
 "We're certainly not ready for such a storm," Mr. Wyllie said. "But we can save lives; that's the top priority. Property damage? Forget about it, that's gone."

The Big Screen Comes to Haddonfield

BYLINE:  By Robert Strauss

 BODY:
Hooray for Haddonfield.
 On Monday, this Victorian-style hamlet in Camden County will become the Hollywood of New Jersey as Governor McGreevey signs the New Jersey Film Production Assistance Program there. 
 After the 1 p.m. signing ceremony at Haddonfield Memorial High School, the actor Paul Sorvino and his production company will begin auditioning teenagers for a film he intends to shoot, at least partly in Haddonfield, entitled "Trouble with Callie." Other stars expected to attend the ceremony are William Baldwin, Michelle Lee and Chazz Palminteri.
 The film may be the first to take advantage of the new program, which is designed to give loan guarantees of up to $1.5 million to film projects that do at least 70 percent of their production and spend 50 percent of their expenses in New Jersey.
 Micah Rasmussen, the governor's spokesman, noted that the governor has promised to bring 200,000 new jobs to New Jersey, and that film and television production can become a big part of that. "Outside of California, the New York/New Jersey area has historically been a center for film production," Mr. Rasmussen said. "The more we can attract to New Jersey, the better it will be for the economy here." Robert Strauss

HEADLINE: Summer's a Memory, And Fall Is Frenetic 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER

DATELINE: MOUNT LAUREL 

 BODY:
THE central planning document for the Willey family takes up the better part of a kitchen wall. It is a 120-day calendar with each child's activities marked in with color-coded markers.
 Church youth group. Poetry. Drama class. Riding lessons. Tuesdays are kept clear for family time and Wednesday is date night for the parents. 
 Marian Willey, a mother of nine, approaches the calendar with dread this time of year. 
 "I'm allergic to September," Ms. Willey said. "The holidays and spring are busy too, but at least those are fun. This is when you have to make all your decisions about the rest of the year, and you better plan carefully."
 Throughout New Jersey, kitchen calendars are filling up with sports schedules, music lessons, and scout meetings. The schedules are being downloaded into hand-held organizers or jotted into leather-bound planners to help keep the state's hectic families on track.
 Families are so busy now that many are engaged in triage, juggling not one but two or three activities a day - often at the same time -- enabled by fast-food drive-in-windows and carpools.
 The frenzy is nationwide, as any parent from Tacoma to Teaneck can attest. But New Jersey -- the epitome of the suburban state -- seems especially prone to the pressure to schedule one more soccer practice or piano lesson.
 Why has life seem to have become hectic to the point where parents and children alike are driven beyond the point of distraction, literally, in car pools and packed minivans laden with with lacrosse sticks, soccer gear and last week's take-out dinner? 
 Many of today's suburban parents -- who excelled in school and in their high-pressure professions --are eager to repeat their success in childrearing. While they no doubt have a genuine desire to offer their child the best of life's opportunities, along with that comes other pressures that ratchet up the mania. Even the most secure parent can not help but compare his or her own child's talents to the neighborhood superstar. 
 Maurice Elias, a psychology professor at Rutgers, said that the state's highly educated and affluent population, lying adjacent to the supercharged New York City professional market, contributes to the culture of overachievement that washes over much of New Jersey.
 In addition, said Professor Elias, the mulitiplicity of media outlets has also created higher expectations for parents than in earlier generations.
 "News stories convey the exceptional, the incredible kid who does it all," he said. "But here it is, right in your living room, so you think it's pretty easily attainable and that everybody is like that. In reality it is the exception."
 He added: "There should be something like the surgeon general's warning on these reports that says, 'Don't think your family can do this without an unbelievable amount of luck and hard work.' New Jersey is more susceptible to this because we are in the middle of so many major media markets."
 But it is Mrs. Willey, who grew up in Indiana, who has it down to a formula: "I think it takes two days in Indiana to do everything you do in one day in New Jersey."

No Shortage of Activities
 From sports to scouting to Irish step dancing and Hebrew school, New Jersey's school children are busy.
 For instance, the state has 4.5 million high school athletes playing everything from basketball and football to bowling, fencing and ice hockey, according to the New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association.
In fact, New Jersey has 170,000 registered soccer players alone, an increase of 5,000 this year.
 New Jersey Youth Soccer, the official organization for travel and recreational leagues, is the third largest in the country, with 55 youth soccer organizations, behind just Massachusetts and northern California.
 Or take the state's annual music teachers' conference -- the fourth largest in the nation.
 But here is where the head game for overachieving parents kicks in like passing gear in a new Infiniti: while the hectic pace of life is a constant lament, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether parents' complaints are a plea for help or a form of one-upmanship. .
 "I do think it's wrong that we are so busy," said Karen Baicker, a freelance writer and editor with two elementary school children in Maplewood. "I wonder if sometimes we have gotten to a place where this is how we're comfortable. We've made choices to make ourselves busy."
 Then there is the other take, according to Betsy Wald, co-director of the Maplewood Family Resource Center.
 "Parents right now feel such a grave responsibility toward the happiness and well-being and success of their child," Ms. Wald said. "As soon as they're born, we put a lot of pressure on them to see how well or how quickly they can develop."
 For some it can be the modern-day equivalent of keeping up with the Joneses.
 "There's a heavy social component to it," said Richard DiLisi acting dean of the graduate school of education and a developmental psychologist at Rutgers. "If the neighbors are doing soccer or computer or violin they feel they have to do it too."
 And it all starts early, Professor DiLisi said. "If a 4-year-old child did not go to preschool, who would he or she play with? That's how it starts, and it just continues."
 While parents may head into a heavy schedule of activities with good intentions, childhood experts maintain that there is also a downside.
 For instance, Professor DiLisi said educators are growing increasingly concerned about students arriving at college who have been scheduled their entire lives and have a difficult time making their own decisions.

Forced to Make Choices
 "In my generation there was Little League, but by and large what you did was go outside and play," he said. "As boys we learned how to divide up the teams so it would be fair - or not. Now the parents do all that."
 He went on: "We're a very achievement-oriented society. "We want the best for our children, but we don't see the dark side."
 Tracing the American family over the past several decades, he explained that smaller families combined with greater affluence have made it possible for parents to invest more time and money into scheduled activities. Even during the latest economic trough, parents were able to cut back on other expenditures but still be able to pay for music lessons and fees for or sports tournament.
 Professor DiLisi said that when children are small it is their parents who make the decisions. As they reach age 11 or 12 they begin to make decisions about which activities are most important to them, but the overall time commitment does not shrink because the activities the children select are at a higher level and require more practices or rehearsals.
 Jim Loper, associate director of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association said many sports that were once seasonal now go year-round, forcing students to choose just one, or juggle heavy commitments to different sports.
 Mr. Loper said that whilehis organization limited the number of high school games to three a week, many athletes went beyond that and played additional games for club or travel teams on the weekends.
 "We know that's what's going on out there," he said, "and it's really too much."
 In many families, it is the children themselves who set the hectic pace.
 Michael Meyers, 16, is a drum major and trumpet player in Ramsey High School's Big Blue marching band. In addition, he is a member of the all-state chorus, and is about to start his Eagle Scout project. This fall he will be in drama workshops after school. And in November he will begin swim team practice. He also works part-time at the local library and attends Catholic religious classes. Somehow, he never took piano lessons.
 "There are a lot of kids who do just as much as I do and they all perform well," Mr. Meyers said. "It's the life style we lead.".
 At times, he said, he just feels burned out.
 "But you're kept so busy you get used to it," said Mr. Meyers. "When I'm between programs for a couple of weeks, it feels really slow."
 Chris Del Vecchio, 18, is the head drum major for the Ramsey Big Blue, and he traveled to Japan last year with the school's jazz band. He is also in the national honor society and runs winter and spring track.
 In the fall, the marching band practices Mondays and Thursdays from 6 p.m.to 9 p.m. On Saturday there is another practice at 9 a.m., then the band plays at a school football game. After the game, the band heads to one of its own competitions, usually in Connecticut, with members returning home well after midnight. Every week.
 And fall is Mr. Del Vecchio's light season. In the winter and spring, he has track practice every day after school, and meets that often run as late as 10:30 on weeknights.
 "There's no Christmas break or Spring break or anything," he said.
 Mr. Del Vecchio said he runs track mostly to polish his resume for college and to stay in shape, but that band is his passion.
 "I love it," he said. "I started in elementary school but in high school, when you could join the marching band, that's when I really started loving band."

Making a Commitment
 With fierce competition to gain acceptance to the country's best colleges and universities, many students hope mastery of an obscure sport or art form will catch the admission officer's eye.
 Janet Lavin Rapelye, dean of admission at Princeton, said highly selective colleges carefully evaluate the level of commitment a student shows to extracurricular activities.
 "We're looking for students in meaningful activities, not many activities," Ms. Rapele said. "We're not making any value judgment about which activities are better."
 "But," she added, "students who decide in their junior year to sign up for all new activities to impress the admissions officer , that's not what we're looking for."
 Even for families who recognize their commitments are out of control, it is not always easy to cut back.
 "That's a nice idea but its not always possible," said Ms. Wald, the family counselor from Maplewood. "But there are some ways that can help everybody feel they're not sacrificing their relationships to become ships passing in the night or each other's chauffeurs." 
 She said children could handle different levels of commitment to their time at different ages, and that resistance was a sure sign that an activity had run its course.
 "If a child is really resisting and wearing everybody out, then I think it's important to look at it realistically and ask if the child is really getting anything out of it," she said. "Don't be afraid they're quitters. They might just need to explore something else."
 Yet while New Jersey would seem to be an epicenter of overscheduling, it is also home to some efforts to slow down.
 Marcia Marra, a mother of three in Ridgewood, started a program called Ready-Set-Relax that asks schools, coaches and families to set aside one night a year in which there is no after-school activities, and it is planning its third annual night off for March. And Ms. Marra said that at least 10 other New Jersey communities had been in contact with her about running similar programs in their towns.
 "It's just one night to build awareness, but there is a lot of dialogue going on about these issues," she said. "It takes a lot of determination and conviction to go against the odds and say 'no' to overscheduling. It is easy to sign up for things without thinking about how out of control it is going to make your family."
 In fact, Ms. Marra said even that the most determined parents -- ones who had carefully drawn up their final schedules by August -- could be thrown off track in September.
 "Two weeks after school begins, more things come home in the backpack - the four-week lacrosse clinic, the chorus that didn't exist last year," she said. "Then it catches up to them while they're not looking. They think they've done a good job of managing and then they're saying 'How did we get to this place where we don't have one night free?"'

Looking for an Alternative
 Sometimes it takes a leap of faith to go activity-free -- and then risk complaints from children who say that they are bored. Parents also fear that without organized activities their children would spend even more time watching television or sitting at the computer.
 "You have to ride out those times and you'll be amazed how resourceful they can be," Ms. Marra said. "I know with my own kids, if I give them a chance and don't jump in and rescue them they'll eventually set up a lemonade stand or make a maze out of toys or figure out a game."
 Beth BaRoss is trying to hold the line.
 "When we moved to Ridgewood a few years ago, we made it a point to cut back and stop trying to keep up with the Joneses," said Mrs. BaRoss who has two daughters in the middle school.
 Her daughters are limited to activities that will take them out of the house no more than two afternoons a week. Nothing is scheduled for the evenings unless it is babysitting. Her daughters are involved in Girl Scouts, acting, and painting and they play on recreational sports teams on the weekends. 
 Yet Mrs. BaRoss said the family is still busy.
 "We're not just hanging around," she said. "We go together and do things. We go to Home Depot together."
 Mrs. BaRoss refuses to make any commitments for her children until the fall, and is just now juggling her schedule. Spring is difficult too, she said.
 "May? June? Forget it. That was crazy," she said. "You know it's really sad when you're sitting in the concert and you're just so glad when it's over. Those things are really important."
 Mrs. BaRoss acquired her resolve to keep the family schedule under control the hard way. She has had two bouts of cancer, 10 years ago and then again 7 years ago.
 "That," she said, "makes you stop and really think."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the pace of family life in the fall gave a misspelled surname at one point for the dean of admissions at Princeton, who said her university weighed the types of activities of its applicants, not the number of them. She is Janet Lavin Rapelye, not Rapele.
The article also misstated the number of high school students who take part in team sports. According to the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, it is 215,000; nationally, there are almost 4.5 million.

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
Isolated North Koreans Carry Big Hopes to the U.S.

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: WARRINGTON, Pa., Sept. 8 

 BODY:
"Ever heard of Rocky Balboa?"
 "Sylvester Stallone?" 
 "He's the underdog. Odds are against him. Little resources. Facing Apollo Creed, the world champion."
 Quizzical looks all around.
 The owner of a rib joint from North Jersey was explaining public relations to the women's soccer team from North Korea. 
 "You're in Philadelphia, home of the underdog, and you're playing the world champions," Robert Egan, the chef with a wiseguy sense of humor, told a table full of North Korean coaches and officials. "You should go to the Art Museum and run up the steps. Great publicity. Everyone in the U.S. will see that and say, 'Oh my God, we're playing Rocky!"' 
 If he could find a meat locker, the garrulous Egan said, maybe the players could pound sides of beef as Rocky did in the 1976 movie. Crazy as it sounded, it might be worth a try. If any country needs an image makeover, it is North Korea.
 While the United States is engaged in tense, halting negotiations over the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the nations' soccer teams will soon meet on more sporting terms in the Women's World Cup. North Korea opens the 16-team tournament against Nigeria in Philadelphia on Sept. 20 and will face the defending champion United States on Sept. 28 in Columbus, Ohio, a match that will carry much political and athletic intrigue.
 Although North Korea seldom plays beyond its borders, it defeated favored China to win the Asian qualifying tournament in June. In six matches against regional competition, the North Koreans scored 50 goals and allowed but 3. Some consider the team a dark-horse candidate to win the Women's World Cup, which was moved to the United States from China because of the SARS epidemic. 
 "As sporting officials, we hope these meetings can improve relations between countries who misunderstand each other," said Jang Su Myong, director of international relations for the North Korean soccer federation.
 Even as he said this, Jang seemed to realize the limits of soccer diplomacy. The United States men faced Iran during the 1998 World Cup in France and played a match that was highlighted by friendly handshakes and collegial posing for photographs. Yet five years later, Iran also finds itself grouped with North Korea and Iraq in President Bush's "axis of evil."
 "Sometimes this is very helpful," Jang said of the olive branch of sports. "Sometimes this is very difficult."
 The new realities of post-9/11 America are evident here. Along with their own security detail and political attaches, the North Koreans are accompanied by an armed American security consultant. And it is clear from modest travel lodge accommodations that the North Korean team is not flush with money. At home, the state-run economy has collapsed and the nation is starving. The Women's World Cup organizing committee will pick up most costs once the tournament begins. Until then, local residents have embraced the team here in this suburb 20 miles north of Philadelphia.
 State Senator Stewart J. Greenleaf, a Republican from Montgomery County, Pa., has assisted the team in logistical matters. The Ukrainian-American Sports Club has lent its soccer fields for practice. A Korean-American church organization has provided a bus and vans for transportation. Egan, who owns a restaurant in Hackensack, N.J., cooks for the team, offering American dishes to supplement such Korean staples as kimchi.
 "I thought it was important to show that we are a generous and kind and peace-loving country, to give them the opportunity to see that side of us," said Greenleaf, who visited North Korea in 1996 and has assisted in humanitarian aid. "We have to say we tried everything to establish good relations, particularly with what's going on now."
 While North Koreans officials discussed whether to allow television cameras into a scrimmage, Greenleaf suggested it would be a good idea.
 "Considering how our countries have been snarling at each other," he said at practice, "I think a few smiles would help a lot."
 Egan, who is also president of a trade organization that seeks to improve relations between the United States and North Korea, said he had been given permission to seek commercial sponsorship for the team. He approached 20 companies, he said, but all declined. "Not in this climate," he said.
 His most outlandish proposal was made to a sports drink company. To demonstrate the incendiary power of the North Korean team, he said he suggested a commercial featuring a nuclear explosion that would occur as a player struck the ball.
 "Doesn't anyone have a sense of humor?" Egan said.
 As he cooked for the team at the Ukrainian-American Sports Club here, Egan stuck his head out of the kitchen and shouted to a team official, "Mr. Pak, have we solved the nuclear crisis yet?"
 Officials at the table burst into laughter.
 Perhaps because of comfortable surroundings, Egan's disarming manner and a desire to accommodate as North Korea seeks to lower hostilities with the United States and improve its image abroad, the soccer team appears slightly more accessible than it was at the 1999 Women's World Cup.
 During that tournament, also played in the United States, the North Koreans once held a news conference without any players or coaches.
 Four years later, on the 55th birthday of North Korea, players appeared relaxed and expectant at dinner. Team officials talked genially if guardedly over sodas and beer. 
 "We have very powerful physical fitness," Coach Ri Song Gun said through an interpreter. That was evident at the practice just concluded, during which players jogged up and down the field while carrying teammates.
 The North Koreans held the United States scoreless in the first half before losing, 3-0, in the previous World Cup, finishing 10th over all among 16 teams. This team possesses more international experience, tackles aggressively and is confident in knowing that it defeated China, the 1999 World Cup runner-up, in three consecutive Asian tournaments.
 "Each team has its own goal to be a champion," goalkeeper Ri Jong Hui, the team captain, said. "We have the same goal as the other teams."
 Recently, the North Koreans have begun to excel more broadly in women's sports. Its men's sports remain at a lower level, but women's sports are generally less developed around the world, making it easier to groom a team or an individual into an international power.
 At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, 16-year-old Kye Sun Hi became the first North Korean woman to win a gold medal by taking the extralightweight judo competition. She received an apartment and a car, and a movie was made of her life. Jong Song Ok won the women's marathon at the 1999 world track and field championships.
 As in the former Eastern bloc, sports in North Korea are intended to serve a dual role as state propaganda. They also serve to embellish the cult of personality of President Kim Jong Il, known as the Dear Leader. Last October, when Ham Pong Sil won the women's marathon at the Asian Games in Pusan, South Korea, she said she had been motivated by a promise to friends written in blood on her wrist and further inspired because "I could feel the Dear Leader Kim Jong Il was looking after me."
 Ri Kum Suk, a forward who scored 15 goals during the Asian qualifying tournament, is typical of the North Korean soccer players. She began playing seriously at age 14, was placed in one of the country's three sports schools and now, at age 25, is a graduate student. 
 Most of the players are students, teachers or workers in the field of physical education, and they participate in a national soccer league with 10 teams in the first division, officials said.
 A translation of Coach Ri's remarks referred to Ri, the forward, as "the best scorer as the world knows," which might come as a surprise to Mia Hamm.
 If North Korea defeats the United States and wins the Women's World Cup, it will rival the accomplishment of the North Korean men's 1-0 victory over Italy in the 1966 World Cup, still one of soccer's greatest upsets. The disgraced Italians returned home to be pelted with rotten tomatoes; Pak Doo Ik, who scored the lone goal, was honored in North Korea with a Mercedes-Benz, an apartment and the titles of People's Athlete and Labor Hero of the Republic.
 It is clear that the women's team also expects success here. The North Koreans autographed a ball for the Ukrainian-American Sports Club and suggested that the club hold on to the ball, saying it would be valuable if North Korea won the Women's World Cup.
 "If they can defeat the Americans, they can enhance national pride in North Korea and they can have an impact on diplomatic negotiations," Moon Jung In, dean of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, said in an interview there. 
 "They can affect U.S. sentiment, that the North Koreans are not monsters."

HEADLINE: The Legal Theory of No Legal Theory

 BODY:
 LAW, PRAGMATISM,
AND DEMOCRACY
By Richard A. Posner.
398 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $35.
 RICHARD A. POSNER is an extraordinary person. If he did not exist, it would be hard to believe that he could. He is a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, and -- one would think -- a busy man. But he writes on almost every legal issue of the day, from Bush v. Gore to Roe v. Wade. He has published "Public Intellectuals" and a biography of Benjamin Cardozo. Thirty years ago, his book "The Economic Analysis of Law" began a revolution in legal theory whose effects are still being digested. Ten years ago, "Sex and Reason" scandalized just about everyone by coolly and rationally analyzing the way the law should treat sex and its consequences. Posner keeps up a rate of production of polemical essays on politics, law and moral philosophy that would do credit to an entire law school. He writes with a flair that puts most journalists to shame and a depth of knowledge that puts most professors to shame. 
Putting professors to shame is what he excels at; it is a large part of the purpose of "Law, Pragmatism, and Democracy." Although Posner teaches at the University of Chicago Law School, he uses "academic" essentially as a term of abuse. One target of his derision is the recent academic enthusiasm for "deliberative democracy." Deliberative democrats think that what democracy involves is not the messy, noisy, winner-take-all of the electoral process, but a collective and cooperative search for the right answer to our common problems -- the sort of thing that Dewey wrote about for more than half a century. Posner's take on the matter is that the enthusiasts for deliberative democracy want to substitute the moral prejudices of professors for the wishes of the plain man or the slightly less plain politician. 
His other target is the "formalist" view of law, which says that courts should always ask one question only: what does the law require? In the formalist view, there will always be a single answer, and the task of judges is to declare it. The present Supreme Court is addicted to presenting its decisions in formalist terms. But, Posner unflinchingly insists, although the court eventually made the right decision in Bush v. Gore, it gave such an incoherent and unconvincing account of what it was doing that it ultimately impaired its own authority. Conversely, in Clinton v. Jones, the court made a mistake that a pragmatic judge would not have made, because that decision opened the door to the whole sorry farce of the impeachment of President Clinton. 
Posner's targets have nothing positive in common. The link is that they are the antitheses of what he wants to argue for -- legal and democratic pragmatism. True to form, he does not suggest that we should all run out and read the works of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James and John Dewey (although he himself appears to have done so). He wants to argue for pragmatism in the ordinary sense of the term: paying greater attention to the consequences of what we do than to high principle, making institutions work a bit better on the assumption that perfection is out of reach and is, in any case, a dangerous goal.
Still, Posner is an intellectual to the end of his fingers, and like most others of the breed, he hates to leave his opponents in possession of any territory that he can seize. This means that "Law, Pragmatism, and Democracy" is several books in one. Roughly a third of it will be useful to students in law school who need a quick route into the role of pragmatism in American law. Another section of the book does some very neat work on the connection between what we nowadays call "liberal democracy" and what the ancients called "mixed government." 
The founding fathers, Posner says, did not want to set up a democracy but a mixed government. That is in fact what they created -- with monarchical elements in the presidency, aristocratic elements in the Senate and Supreme Court and democratic elements in the lower house. The whole thing was intended to be a balance of interests in the way Cicero said successful republics must be. Some of us have said for 40 years that what we call "representative democracy" is what an earlier age understood as elective aristocracy. It is good to have Posner on our side. 
The only regret is that he does little to spell out the reason for wanting populist elements in a mixed constitution -- essentially, that once you have agreed that government is a job for the full-time expert and that "rule by the people" is literally impossible, you need some way in which the ordinary man can stop the elite from walking off with the store. The London mob used to smash the windows of the rich; universal suffrage serves the same purpose with less damage. Posner writes only about the representation of interests, which is not the Athenian view that democracy was a mechanism for putting the fear of God into the ruling elite.
Posner's preferred account of democracy was provided by Joseph Schumpeter, the Viennese economist best known for his description of capitalism as propelled by "gales of creative destruction." In exile in America during World War II, Schumpeter wrote "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," a book with which Posner has fallen in love. At least, he has fallen in love with the two chapters in which Schumpeter destroyed what he called the classical theory of democracy and defended what he considered a realistic one. 
Schumpeter argues that democracy is a system in which would-be rulers compete for the people's vote. The number of voters does not greatly matter; what matters is that the government is the winner of a genuinely competitive election. Posner, who is fascinated by economics, seizes on the way that Schumpeter's theory emphasizes competition between elites. It looks, as many writers have said, like the beginnings of an economic theory of democracy. And Posner has some interesting thoughts on ways in which we might make American democracy more competitive -- giving would-be third parties a fairer chance to enter the political marketplace, for instance. 
But Schumpeter was not an enthusiast for making politics more competitive. He was profoundly distrustful of the ordinary man, whose views he thought irrational and ill informed, and he deplored the activities of that great American institution, the pressure group. Posner mildly criticizes Schumpeter for not saying enough about what should happen between elections. If you think that politics should operate like a market, it's a fair point; nobody makes once-and-for-all choices in the ordinary marketplace. In fact, the one thing that Schumpeter said about what should happen between elections was that the voters should not put pressure on government, but should simply allow it to govern.
Many readers of "Law, Pragmatism, and Democracy" may choose to leave Posner's discussion of democratic theory for last, turning first to his illustrations of pragmatic adjudication in action to see what the "cash value" of the theoretical chapters is. Posner's premise is that there is no such thing as legal reasoning. Lawyers and judges know a lot about legislation, previous cases and the like. But on all else, they should defer to experts in nonlegal fields, who provide the raw materials for interpretation and decision. But if there is no such thing as legal reasoning, what will limit judges from going off in any direction? A large constraint, Posner argues, is the need not to be overruled too often and too embarrassingly by a higher court.
The Supreme Court, however, cannot be overridden; it works with looser constraints than any other court. Its task is to make sensible decisions that will have good consequences for the country as a whole. In Bush v. Gore, for instance, there was a need to bring an end to the electoral mess, and there were ways of doing this discreetly. Justice Scalia is told off particularly severely for political ineptitude. Silence was the prudent position; his concurring judgment gave the dissenters a target and a chance to grandstand. 
In Clinton v. Jones, the pomposity of the court's declaration that "no man is above the law" blinded the justices to the need to let quite a lot of people be a little above the law. Given what sexual harassment suits are like, Posner says, the president should have been protected while in office; a narrowly tailored immunity would have served the nation well. 
These agreeably unprincipled views look less appealing when Posner turns to the erosion of civil liberties during emergencies. Here, the message is that civil libertarians should stop whining, and get used to the idea that in a crisis we have less freedom. No doubt -- though one would expect a thinker like Posner to regret the loss rather than celebrate it so enthusiastically. Still, his argument is an elegant illustration of what is lost by pragmatism's abandonment of principle. Perhaps we ought to be grateful for it, as just one more of Richard A. Posner's many provocations.

HEADLINE: Is Buddhism Good for Your Health? 

BYLINE:  By Stephen S. Hall; Stephen S. Hall is the author, most recently, of "Merchants of Immortality: Chasing the Dream of Human Life Extension."

 BODY:
In the spring of 1992, out of the blue, the fax machine in Richard Davidson's office at the department of psychology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison spit out a letter from Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama. Davidson, a Harvard-trained neuroscientist, was making a name for himself studying the nature of positive emotion, and word of his accomplishments had made it to northern India. The exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists was writing to offer the minds of his monks -- in particular, their meditative prowess -- for scientific research.
 Most self-respecting American neuroscientists would shrink from, if not flee, an invitation to study Buddhist meditation, viewing the topic as impossibly fuzzy and, as Davidson recently conceded, "very flaky." But the Wisconsin professor, a longtime meditator himself -- he took leave from graduate school to travel through India and Sri Lanka to learn Eastern meditation practices -- leapt at the opportunity. In September 1992, he organized and embarked on an ambitious data-gathering expedition to northern India, lugging portable electrical generators, laptop computers and electroencephalographic (EEG) recording equipment into the foothills of the Himalayas. His goal was to measure a remarkable, if seemingly evanescent, entity: the neural characteristics of the Buddhist mind at work. "These are the Olympic athletes, the gold medalists, of meditation," Davidson says. 
 The work began fitfully -- the monks initially balked at being wired -- but research into meditation has now attained a credibility unimaginable a decade ago. Over the past 10 years, a number of Buddhist monks, led by Matthieu Ricard, a French-born monk with a Ph.D. in molecular biology, have made a series of visits from northern India and other South Asian countries to Davidson's lab in Madison. Ricard and his peers have worn a Medusa-like tangle of 256-electrode EEG nets while sitting on the floor of a little booth and responding to visual stimuli. They have spent two to three hours at a time in a magnetic resonance imaging machine, trying to meditate amid the clatter and thrum of the brain-imaging machinery. 
No data from these experiments have been published formally yet, but in "Visions of Compassion," a compilation of papers that came out last year, Davidson noted in passing that in one visiting monk, activation in several regions of his left prefrontal cortex -- an area of the brain just behind the forehead that recent research has associated with positive emotion -- was the most intense seen in about 175 experimental subjects. 
In the years since Davidson's fax from the Dalai Lama, the neuroscientific study of Buddhist practices has crossed a threshold of acceptability as a topic worthy of scientific attention. Part of the reason for this lies in new, more powerful brain-scanning technologies that not only can reveal a mind in the midst of meditation but also can detect enduring changes in brain activity months after a prolonged course of meditation. And it hasn't hurt that some well-known mainstream neuroscientists are now intrigued by preliminary reports of exceptional Buddhist mental skills. Paul Ekman of the University of California at San Francisco and Stephen Kosslyn of Harvard have begun their own studies of the mental capabilities of monks. In addition, a few rigorous, controlled studies have suggested that Buddhist-style meditation in Western patients may cause physiological changes in the brain and the immune system.
This growing, if sometimes grudging, respect for the biology of meditation is achieving a milestone of sorts this weekend, when some of the country's leading neuroscientists and behavioral scientists are meeting with Tibetan Buddhists, including the Dalai Lama himself, at a symposium held at M.I.T. "You can think of the monks as cases that show what the potential is here," Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who has pioneered work in the health benefits of meditation, says. "But you don't have to be weird or a Buddhist or sitting on top of a mountain in India to derive benefits from this. This kind of study is in its infancy, but we're on the verge of discovering hugely fascinating things."
In the 2,500-year history of Buddhism, the religion has directed its energy inward in an attempt to train the mind to understand the mental state of happiness, to identify and defuse sources of negative emotion and to cultivate emotional states like compassion to improve personal and societal well-being. For decades, scientific research in this country has focused on the short-term effects of meditation on the nervous system, finding that meditation reduces markers of stress like heart rate and perspiration. This research became the basis for the "relaxation response" popularized by Prof. Herbert Benson of Harvard in the 1970's. Buddhist practice, however, emphasizes enduring changes in mental activity, not just short-term results. And it is the neural and physical impact of the long-term changes, achieved after years of intense practice, that is increasingly intriguing to scientists.
"In Buddhist tradition," Davidson explains, "'meditation' is a word that is equivalent to a word like 'sports' in the U.S. It's a family of activity, not a single thing." Each of these meditative practices calls on different mental skills, according to Buddhist practitioners. The Wisconsin researchers, for example, are focusing on three common forms of Buddhist meditation. "One is focused attention, where they specifically train themselves to focus on a single object for long periods of time," Davidson says. "The second area is where they voluntarily cultivate compassion. It's something they do every day, and they have special exercises where they envision negative events, something that causes anger or irritability, and then transform it and infuse it with an antidote, which is compassion. They say they are able to do it just like that," he says, snapping his fingers. "The third is called 'open presence.' It is a state of being acutely aware of whatever thought, emotion or sensation is present, without reacting to it. They describe it as pure awareness."
The fact that the brain can learn, adapt and molecularly resculpture itself on the basis of experience and training suggests that meditation may leave a biological residue in the brain -- a residue that, with the increasing sophistication of new technology, might be captured and measured. "This fits into the whole neuroscience literature of expertise," says Stephen Kosslyn, a Harvard neuroscientist, "where taxi drivers are studied for their spatial memory and concert musicians are studied for their sense of pitch. If you do something, anything, even play Ping-Pong, for 20 years, eight hours a day, there's going to be something in your brain that's different from someone who didn't do that. It's just got to be."
Jonathan D. Cohen, an expert on attention and cognitive control at Princeton, has been intrigued by reports that certain Buddhist adepts can maintain focus for extended periods. "Our experience -- and the laboratory evidence is abundant -- is that humans have a limited capacity for attention," he says. "When we try to sustain attention for longer periods of time, like air-traffic controllers have to do, we consider it incredibly effortful and stressful. Buddhism is all about the ability to direct attention flexibly, and they talk about this state of sustained and focused attention that is pleasant, no longer stressful."
If nothing else, the meeting at M.I.T. this weekend shows that Davidson, one of its principal organizers, has managed to persuade a lot of marquee names to join him in making the case that it has become scientifically respectable to investigate these practices. Participants include mainstream scientists like Eric Lander, a leader of the human genome project; Cohen, a prominent researcher into the neural mechanisms of moral and economic decision-making; and Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel-Prize-winning Princeton economist who has pioneered research into the psychology of financial decision-making.
"Neuroscientists want to preserve both the substance and the image of rigor in their approach, so one doesn't want to be seen as whisking out into the la-la land of studying consciousness," concedes Cohen, who is chairman of a session at the M.I.T. meeting. "On the other hand, my personal belief is that the history of science has humbled us about the hubris of thinking we know everything." 
The "Monk experiments" at Madison are beginning to intersect with a handful of small but suggestive studies showing that Buddhist-style meditation may have not only emotional effects but also distinct physiological effects. That is, the power of meditation might be harnessed by non-Buddhists in a way that along with reducing stress and defusing negative emotion, improves things like immune function as well.
The power of the mind to influence bodily function has long been of interest to scientists, especially connections between the nervous, immune and endocrine systems. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and Ronald Glaser, researchers at Ohio State University, for example, have done a series of studies showing that stress typically impairs immune function, though the exact woof and weave of these connections remains unclear.
Interestingly enough, the Buddhist subjects themselves are largely open to scientific explanation of their practices. "Buddhism is, like science, based on experience and investigation, not on dogma," Matthieu Ricard explained in an e-mail message to me last month. The religion can be thought of as "a contemplative science," he wrote, adding, "the Buddha always said that one should not accept his teachings simply out of respect for him, but rediscover their truth through our own experience, as when checking the quality of a piece of gold by rubbing it on a piece on stone, melting it and so on."
In July, I joined Davidson and several colleagues as they stood in a control room and watched an experiment in progress. On a television monitor in the control room, a young woman sat in a chair in a nearby room, alone with her thoughts. Those thoughts -- and, more specifically, the way she tried to control them when provoked -- were the point of the experiment.
Davidson hypothesizes that a component of a person's emotional makeup reflects the relative strength, or asymmetry, of activity between two sides of the prefrontal cortex -- the left side, which Davidson's work argues is associated with positive emotion, and the right side, where heightened activity has been associated with anxiety, depression and other mood disorders.
His research group has conducted experiments on infants and the elderly, amateur meditators and Eastern adepts, in an attempt to define a complex neural circuit that connects the prefrontal cortex to other brain structures like the amygdala, which is the seat of fear, and the anterior cingulate, which is associated with "conflict-monitoring." Some experiments have also shown that greater left-sided prefrontal activation is associated with enhanced immunological activity by natural killer cells and other immune markers.
When one scientist in the control room said, "All right, here comes the first picture," the young woman visibly tensed, gripping her elbows. Electrodes snaked out of her scalp and from two spots just below her right eye. And then, staring into a monitor, the young woman watched as a succession of mostly disturbing images flashed on a screen in front of her -- a horribly mutilated body, a severed hand, a venomous snake poised to strike. Through earphones, the woman was prompted to modulate her emotional response as each image appeared, either to enhance it or suppress it, while the electrodes below her eye surreptitiously tapped into a neural circuit that would indicate if she had successfully modified either a positive or negative emotional response to the images.
"What's being measured," Davidson explained, "is a person's capacity to voluntarily regulate their emotional reactions." 
Daren Jackson, the lead researcher on the study, added, "Meditation may facilitate more rapid, spontaneous recovery from negative reactions."
The visiting monks, as well as a group of meditating office workers at a nearby biotech company, have viewed these same gruesome images for the same purpose: to determine what Davidson calls each individual's "affective style" (if they are prone, for example, to hang onto negative emotional reactions) and if that style can be modulated by mental effort, of the sort that meditation seeks to cultivate. It is the hope of Davidson and his sometime collaborator Jon Kabat-Zinn that the power of meditation can be harnessed to promote not only emotional well-being but also physical health.
Since founding the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 1979, Kabat-Zinn and colleagues have treated 16,000 patients and taught more than 2,000 health professionals the techniques of "mindfulness meditation," which instructs a Buddhist-inspired "nonjudgmental," total awareness of the present moment as a way of reducing stress. Along the way, Kabat-Zinn has published small but intriguing studies showing that people undergoing treatment for psoriasis heal four times as fast if they meditate; that cancer patients practicing meditation had significantly better emotional outlooks than a control group; and not only that meditation relieved symptoms in patients with anxiety and chronic pain but also that the benefits persisted up to four years after training. Kabat-Zinn is conducting a study for Cigna HealthCare to see if meditation reduces the costs of treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome.
For the time being, meditation science is still stuck in a cultural no-man's land between being an oxymoron and something more substantive. "We're very early in the research," said Davidson, who admitted that "the vast majority of meditation research is schlock." But a well-designed study published in July by Davidson, Kabat-Zinn and their colleagues provides further evidencethat the topic is legitimate. 
In July 1997, Davidson recruited human subjects at a small biotech company outside Madison called Promega to study the effects of Buddhist-style meditation on the neural and immunological activity of ordinary American office workers. The employees' brains were wired and measured before they began a course in meditation training taught by Kabat-Zinn. It was a controlled, randomized study, and after eight weeks, the researchers would test brain and immune markers to assess the effects of meditation.
There was reluctance among some employees to volunteer, but eventually, about four dozen employees participated in the study. Once a week for eight weeks, Kabat-Zinn would show up at Promega with his boom box, his red and purple meditation tape cassettes and his Tibetan chimes, and the assembled Promega employees -- scientists, marketing people, lab techs and even some managers -- would sit on the floor of a conference room and practice mindfulness for three hours.
In July, the results of the experiment at Promega were published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, and they suggest that meditation may indeed leave a discernible and lasting imprint on the minds and bodies of its practitioners. Among the Promega employees who practiced meditation for two months, the Wisconsin researchers detected significant increases in activity in several areas of the left prefrontal cortex -- heightened activity that persisted for at least four months after the experiment, when the subjects were tested again. Moreover, the meditators who showed the greatest increase in prefrontal activity after training showed a correspondingly more robust ability to churn out antibodies in response to receiving a flu vaccine. The findings, Kabat-Zinn suggested, demonstrated qualitative shifts in brain activity after only two months of meditation that mirror preliminary results seen in expert meditators like monks.
These results are still embraced cautiously, at best. Indeed, the Wisconsin study took five years to publish in part because several higher-profile journals to which it was submitted refused even to send it out for peer review, according to Davidson. And yet, by the time the study was over, the subjective experience of participants complemented the objective data: meditation ultimately left people feeling healthier, more positive and less stressed. "I really am an empiricist in every aspect of my life," said Michael Slater, a molecular biologist at Promega. "I doubt dogma, and I test it. I do it at the laboratory bench, but also in my personal life. So this appealed to me, because I could feel the reduction in stress. I could tell I was less irritable. I had more capacity to take on more stressors. My wife felt I was easier to be around. So there were tangible impacts. For an empiricist, that was enough."
Granted, that's not enough for many other people, especially the scientific skeptics. But Slater made an offhand comment that struck me as a highly convincing, though thoroughly unofficial, form of peer review. "My wife," Slater said quietly, "is dying for me to start meditating again."

HEADLINE: The Tax-Cut Con 

BYLINE:  By Paul Krugman; Paul Krugman is a Times columnist and a professor at Princeton. His new book is "The Great Unraveling: Losing Our Way in the New Century."

 BODY:
 1. The Cartoon and the Reality
Bruce Tinsley's comic strip, "Mallard Fillmore," is, he says, "for the average person out there: the forgotten American taxpayer who's sick of the liberal media." In June, that forgotten taxpayer made an appearance in the strip, attacking his TV set with a baseball bat and yelling: "I can't afford to send my kids to college, or even take 'em out of their substandard public school, because the federal, state and local governments take more than 50 percent of my income in taxes. And then the guy on the news asks with a straight face whether or not we can 'afford' tax cuts."
 But that's just a cartoon. Meanwhile, Bob Riley has to face the reality.
Riley knows all about substandard public schools. He's the governor of Alabama, which ranks near the bottom of the nation in both spending per pupil and educational achievement. The state has also neglected other public services -- for example, 28,000 inmates are held in a prison system built for 12,000. And thanks in part to a lack of health care, it has the second-highest infant mortality in the nation.
When he was a member of Congress, Riley, a Republican, was a staunch supporter of tax cuts. Faced with a fiscal crisis in his state, however, he seems to have had an epiphany. He decided that it was impossible to balance Alabama's budget without a significant tax increase. And that, apparently, led him to reconsider everything. "The largest tax increase in state history just to maintain the status quo?" he asked. "I don't think so." Instead, Riley proposed a wholesale restructuring of the state's tax system: reducing taxes on the poor and middle class while raising them on corporations and the rich and increasing overall tax receipts enough to pay for a big increase in education spending. You might call it a New Deal for Alabama.
Nobody likes paying taxes, and no doubt some Americans are as angry about their taxes as Tinsley's imaginary character. But most Americans also care a lot about the things taxes pay for. All politicians say they're for public education; almost all of them also say they support a strong national defense, maintaining Social Security and, if anything, expanding the coverage of Medicare. When the "guy on the news" asks whether we can afford a tax cut, he's asking whether, after yet another tax cut goes through, there will be enough money to pay for those things. And the answer is no. 
But it's very difficult to get that answer across in modern American politics, which has been dominated for 25 years by a crusade against taxes.
I don't use the word "crusade" lightly. The advocates of tax cuts are relentless, even fanatical. An indication of the movement's fervor -- and of its political power -- came during the Iraq war. War is expensive and is almost always accompanied by tax increases. But not in 2003. "Nothing is more important in the face of a war," declared Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, "than cutting taxes." And sure enough, taxes were cut, not just in a time of war but also in the face of record budget deficits. Nor will it be easy to reverse those tax cuts: the tax-cut movement has convinced many Americans -- like Tinsley -- that everybody still pays far too much in taxes.
A result of the tax-cut crusade is that there is now a fundamental mismatch between the benefits Americans expect to receive from the government and the revenues government collect. This mismatch is already having profound effects at the state and local levels: teachers and policemen are being laid off and children are being denied health insurance. The federal government can mask its problems for a while, by running huge budget deficits, but it, too, will eventually have to decide whether to cut services or raise taxes. And we are not talking about minor policy adjustments. If taxes stay as low as they are now, government as we know it cannot be maintained. In particular, Social Security will have to become far less generous; Medicare will no longer be able to guarantee comprehensive medical care to older Americans; Medicaid will no longer provide basic medical care to the poor.
How did we reach this point? What are the origins of the antitax crusade? And where is it taking us? To answer these questions, we will have to look both at who the antitax crusaders are and at the evidence on what tax cuts do to the budget and the economy. But first, let's set the stage by taking a look at the current state of taxation in America.

2. How High Are Our Taxes?
The reason Tinsley's comic strip about the angry taxpayer caught my eye was, of course, that the numbers were all wrong. Very few Americans pay as much as 50 percent of their income in taxes; on average, families near the middle of the income distribution pay only about half that percentage in federal, state and local taxes combined.
In fact, though most Americans feel that they pay too much in taxes, they get off quite lightly compared with the citizens of other advanced countries. Furthermore, for most Americans tax rates probably haven't risen for a generation. And a few Americans -- namely those with high incomes -- face much lower taxes than they did a generation ago. 
To assess trends in the overall level of taxes and to compare taxation across countries, economists usually look first at the ratio of taxes to gross domestic product, the total value of output produced in the country. In the United States, all taxes -- federal, state and local -- reached a peak of 29.6 percent of G.D.P. in 2000. That number was, however, swollen by taxes on capital gains during the stock-market bubble.
By 2002, the tax take was down to 26.3 percent of G.D.P., and all indications are that it will be lower still this year and next.
This is a low number compared with almost every other advanced country. In 1999, Canada collected 38.2 percent of G.D.P. in taxes, France collected 45.8 percent and Sweden, 52.2 percent.
Still, aren't taxes much higher than they used to be? Not if we're looking back over the past 30 years. As a share of G.D.P., federal taxes are currently at their lowest point since the Eisenhower administration. State and local taxes rose substantially between 1960 and the early 1970's, but have been roughly stable since then. Aside from the capital gains taxes paid during the bubble years, the share of income Americans pay in taxes has been flat since Richard Nixon was president.
Of course, overall levels of taxation don't necessarily tell you how heavily particular individuals and families are taxed. As it turns out, however, middle-income Americans, like the country as a whole, haven't seen much change in their overall taxes over the past 30 years. On average, families in the middle of the income distribution find themselves paying about 26 percent of their income in taxes today. This number hasn't changed significantly since 1989, and though hard data are lacking, it probably hasn't changed much since 1970.
Meanwhile, wealthy Americans have seen a sharp drop in their tax burden. The top tax rate -- the income-tax rate on the highest bracket -- is now 35 percent, half what it was in the 1970's. With the exception of a brief period between 1988 and 1993, that's the lowest rate since 1932. Other taxes that, directly or indirectly, bear mainly on the very affluent have also been cut sharply. The effective tax rate on corporate profits has been cut in half since the 1960's. The 2001 tax cut phases out the inheritance tax, which is overwhelmingly a tax on the very wealthy: in 1999, only 2 percent of estates paid any tax, and half the tax was paid by only 3,300 estates worth more than $5 million. The 2003 tax act sharply cuts taxes on dividend income, another boon to the very well off. By the time the Bush tax cuts have taken full effect, people with really high incomes will face their lowest average tax rate since the Hoover administration.
So here's the picture: Americans pay low taxes by international standards. Most people's taxes haven't gone up in the past generation; the wealthy have had their taxes cut to levels not seen since before the New Deal. Even before the latest round of tax cuts, when compared with citizens of other advanced nations or compared with Americans a generation ago, we had nothing to complain about -- and those with high incomes now have a lot to celebrate. Yet a significant number of Americans rage against taxes, and the party that controls all three branches of the federal government has made tax cuts its supreme priority. Why?

3. Supply-Siders, Starve-the-Beasters and Lucky Duckies
It is often hard to pin down what antitax crusaders are trying to achieve. The reason is not, or not only, that they are disingenuousabout their motives -- though as we will see, disingenuity has become a hallmark of the movement in recent years. Rather, the fuzziness comes from the fact that today's antitax movement moves back and forth between two doctrines. Both doctrines favor the same thing: big tax cuts for people with high incomes. But they favor it for different reasons.
One of those doctrines has become famous under the name "supply-side economics." It's the view that the government can cut taxes without severe cuts in public spending. The other doctrine is often referred to as "starving the beast," a phrase coined by David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget director. It's the view that taxes should be cut precisely in order to force severe cuts in public spending. Supply-side economics is the friendly, attractive face of the tax-cut movement. But starve-the-beast is where the power lies.
The starting point of supply-side economics is an assertion that no economist would dispute: taxes reduce the incentive to work, save and invest. A businessman who knows that 70 cents of every extra dollar he makes will go to the I.R.S. is less willing to make the effort to earn that extra dollar than if he knows that the I.R.S. will take only 35 cents. So reducing tax rates will, other things being the same, spur the economy.
This much isn't controversial. But the government must pay its bills. So the standard view of economists is that if you want to reduce the burden of taxes, you must explain what government programs you want to cut as part of the deal. There's no free lunch.
What the supply-siders argued, however, was that there was a free lunch. Cutting marginal rates, they insisted, would lead to such a large increase in gross domestic product that it wouldn't be necessary to come up with offsetting spending cuts. What supply-side economists say, in other words, is, "Don't worry, be happy and cut taxes." And when they say cut taxes, they mean taxes on the affluent: reducing the top marginal rate means that the biggest tax cuts go to people in the highest tax brackets. 
The other camp in the tax-cut crusade actually welcomes the revenue losses from tax cuts. Its most visible spokesman today is Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, who once told National Public Radio: "I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub." And the way to get it down to that size is to starve it of revenue. "The goal is reducing the size and scope of government by draining its lifeblood," Norquist told U.S. News & World Report.
What does "reducing the size and scope of government" mean? Tax-cut proponents are usually vague about the details. But the Heritage Foundation, ideological headquarters for the movement, has made it pretty clear. Edwin Feulner, the foundation's president, uses "New Deal" and "Great Society" as terms of abuse, implying that he and his organization want to do away with the institutions Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson created. That means Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid -- most of what gives citizens of the United States a safety net against economic misfortune.
The starve-the-beast doctrine is now firmly within the conservative mainstream. George W. Bush himself seemed to endorse the doctrine as the budget surplus evaporated: in August 2001 he called the disappearing surplus "incredibly positive news" because it would put Congress in a "fiscal straitjacket."
Like supply-siders, starve-the-beasters favor tax cuts mainly for people with high incomes. That is partly because, like supply-siders, they emphasize the incentive effects of cutting the top marginal rate; they just don't believe that those incentive effects are big enough that tax cuts pay for themselves. But they have another reason for cutting taxes mainly on the rich, which has become known as the "lucky ducky" argument.
Here's how the argument runs: to starve the beast, you must not only deny funds to the government; you must make voters hate the government. There's a danger that working-class families might see government as their friend: because their incomes are low, they don't pay much in taxes, while they benefit from public spending. So in starving the beast, you must take care not to cut taxes on these "lucky duckies." (Yes, that's what The Wall Street Journal called them in a famous editorial.) In fact, if possible, you must raise taxes on working-class Americans in order, as The Journal said, to get their "blood boiling with tax rage."
So the tax-cut crusade has two faces. Smiling supply-siders say that tax cuts are all gain, no pain; scowling starve-the-beasters believe that inflicting pain is not just necessary but also desirable. Is the alliance between these two groups a marriage of convenience? Not exactly. It would be more accurate to say that the starve-the-beasters hired the supply-siders -- indeed, created them -- because they found their naive optimism useful. 
A look at who the supply-siders are and how they came to prominence tells the story.
The supply-side movement likes to present itself as a school of economic thought like Keynesianism or monetarism -- that is, as a set of scholarly ideas that made their way, as such ideas do, into political discussion. But the reality is quite different. Supply-side economics was a political doctrine from Day 1; it emerged in the pages of political magazines, not professional economics journals. 
That is not to deny that many professional economists favor tax cuts. But they almost always turn out to be starve-the-beasters, not supply-siders. And they often secretly -- or sometimes not so secretly -- hold supply-siders in contempt. N. Gregory Mankiw, now chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, is definitely a friend to tax cuts; but in the first edition of his economic-principles textbook, he described Ronald Reagan's supply-side advisers as "charlatans and cranks." 
It is not that the professionals refuse to consider supply-side ideas; rather, they have looked at them and found them wanting. A conspicuous example came earlier this year when the Congressional Budget Office tried to evaluate the growth effects of the Bush administration's proposed tax cuts. The budget office's new head, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, is a conservative economist who was handpicked for his job by the administration. But his conclusion was that unless the revenue losses from the proposed tax cuts were offset by spending cuts, the resulting deficits would be a drag on growth, quite likely to outweigh any supply-side effects.
But if the professionals regard the supply-siders with disdain, who employs these people? The answer is that since the 1970's almost all of the prominent supply-siders have been aides to conservative politicians, writers at conservative publications like National Review, fellows at conservative policy centers like Heritage or economists at private companies with strong Republican connections. Loosely speaking, that is, supply-siders work for the vast right-wing conspiracy. What gives supply-side economics influence is its connection with apowerful network of institutions that want to shrink the government and see tax cuts as a way to achieve that goal. Supply-side economics is a feel-good cover story for a political movement with a much harder-nosed agenda.
This isn't just speculation. Irving Kristol, in his role as co-editor of The Public Interest, was arguably the single most important proponent of supply-side economics. But years later, he suggested that he himself wasn't all that persuaded by the doctrine: "I was not certain of its economic merits but quickly saw its political possibilities." Writing in 1995, he explained that his real aim was to shrink the government and that tax cuts were a means to that end: "The task, as I saw it, was to create a new majority, which evidently would mean a conservative majority, which came to mean, in turn, a Republican majority -- so political effectiveness was the priority, not the accounting deficiencies of government."
In effect, what Kristol said in 1995 was that he and his associates set out to deceive the American public. They sold tax cuts on the pretense that they would be painless, when they themselves believed that it would be necessary to slash public spending in order to make room for those cuts.
But one supposes that the response would be that the end justified the means -- that the tax cuts did benefit all Americans because they led to faster economic growth. Did they? 

4. From Reaganomics to Clintonomics
Ronald Reagan put supply-side theory into practice with his 1981 tax cut. The tax cuts were modest for middle-class families but very large for the well-off. Between 1979 and 1983, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, the average federal tax rate on the top 1 percent of families fell from 37 to 27.7 percent.
So did the tax cuts promote economic growth? You might think that all we have to do is look at how the economy performed. But it's not that simple, because different observers read different things from Reagan's economic record.
Here's how tax-cut advocates look at it: after a deep slump between 1979 and 1982, the U.S. economy began growing rapidly. Between 1982 and 1989 (the first year of the first George Bush's presidency), the economy grew at an average annual rate of 4.2 percent. That's a lot better than the growth rate of the economy in the late 1970's, and supply-siders claim that these "Seven Fat Years" (the title of a book by Robert L. Bartley, the longtime editor of The Wall Street Journal's editorial page) prove the success of Reagan's 1981 tax cut.
But skeptics say that rapid growth after 1982 proves nothing: a severe recession is usually followed by a period of fast growth, as unemployed workers and factories are brought back on line. The test of tax cuts as a spur to economic growth is whether they produced more than an ordinary business cycle recovery. Once the economy was back to full employment, was it bigger than you would otherwise have expected? And there Reagan fails the test: between 1979, when the big slump began, and 1989, when the economy finally achieved more or less full employment again, the growth rate was 3 percent, the same as the growth rate between the two previous business cycle peaks in 1973 and 1979. Or to put it another way, by the late 1980's the U.S. economy was about where you would have expected it to be, given the trend in the 1970's. Nothing in the data suggests a supply-side revolution.
Does this mean that the Reagan tax cuts had no effect? Of course not. Those tax cuts, combined with increased military spending, provided a good old-fashioned Keynesian boost to demand. And this boost was one factor in the rapid recovery from recession that developed at the end of 1982, though probably not as important as the rapid expansion of the money supply that began in the summer of that year. But the supposed supply-side effects are invisible in the data.
While the Reagan tax cuts didn't produce any visible supply-side gains, they did lead to large budget deficits. From the point of view of most economists, this was a bad thing. But for starve-the-beast tax-cutters, deficits are potentially a good thing, because they force the government to shrink. So did Reagan's deficits shrink the beast?
A casual glance at the data might suggest not: federal spending as a share of gross domestic product was actually slightly higher at the end of the 1980's than it was at the end of the 1970's. But that number includes both defense spending and "entitlements," mainly Social Security and Medicare, whose growth is automatic unless Congress votes to cut benefits. What's left is a grab bag known as domestic discretionary spending, including everything from courts and national parks to environmental cleanups and education. And domestic discretionary spending fell from 4.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1981 to 3.2 percent in 1988. 
But that's probably about as far as any president can shrink domestic discretionary spending. And because Reagan couldn't shrink the belly of the beast, entitlements, he couldn't find enough domestic spending cuts to offset his military spending increases and tax cuts. The federal budget went into persistent, alarming, deficit. In response to these deficits, George Bush the elder went back on his "read my lips" pledge and raised taxes. Bill Clinton raised them further. And thereby hangs a tale.
For Clinton did exactly the opposite of what supply-side economics said you should do: he raised the marginal rate on high-income taxpayers. In 1989, the top 1 percent of families paid, on average, only 28.9 percent of their income in federal taxes; by 1995, that share was up to 36.1 percent.
Conservatives confidently awaited a disaster -- but it failed to materialize. In fact, the economy grew at a reasonable pace through Clinton's first term, while the deficit and the unemployment rate went steadily down. And then the news got even better: unemployment fell to its lowest level in decades without causing inflation, while productivity growth accelerated to rates not seen since the 1960's. And the budget deficit turned into an impressive surplus.
Tax-cut advocates had claimed the Reagan years as proof of their doctrine's correctness; as we have seen, those claims wilt under close examination. But the Clinton years posed a much greater challenge: here was a president who sharply raised the marginal tax rate on high-income taxpayers, the very rate that the tax-cut movement cares most about. And instead of presiding over an economic disaster, he presided over an economic miracle.
Let's be clear: very few economists think that Clinton's policies were primarily responsible for that miracle. For the most part, the Clinton-era surge probably reflected the maturing of information technology: businesses finally figured out how to make effective use of computers, and the resulting surge in productivity drove the economy forward. But the fact that America's best growth in a generation took place after the government did exactly the opposite of what tax-cutters advocate was a body blow to their doctrine.
They tried to make the best of the situation. The good economy of the late 1990's, ardent tax-cutters insisted, was caused by the 1981 tax cut. Early in 2000, Lawrence Kudlow and Stephen Moore, prominent supply-siders, published an article titled "It's the Reagan Economy, Stupid."
But anyone who thought about the lags involved found this implausible -- indeed, hilarious. If the tax-cut movement attributed the booming economy of 1999 to a tax cut Reagan pushed through 18 years earlier, why didn't they attribute the economic boom of 1983 and 1984 -- Reagan's "morning in America" -- to whatever Lyndon Johnson was doing in 1965 and 1966? 
By the end of the 1990's, in other words, supply-side economics had become something of a laughingstock, and the whole case for tax cuts as a route to economic growth was looking pretty shaky. But the tax-cut crusade was nonetheless, it turned out, poised for its biggest political victories yet. How did that happen?

5. Second Wind: The Bush Tax Cuts
As the economic success of the United States under Bill Clinton became impossible to deny, there was a gradual shift in the sales strategy for tax cuts. The supposed economic benefits of tax cuts received less emphasis; the populist rationale -- you, personally, pay too much in taxes -- was played up.
I began this article with an example of this campaign's success: the creator of Mallard Fillmore apparently believes that typical families pay twice as much in taxes as they in fact do. But the most striking example of what skillful marketing can accomplish is the campaign for repeal of the estate tax. 
As demonstrated, the estate tax is a tax on the very, very well off. Yet advocates of repeal began portraying it as a terrible burden on the little guy. They renamed it the "death tax" and put out reports decrying its impact on struggling farmers and businessmen -- reports that never provided real-world examples because actual cases of family farms or small businesses broken up to pay estate taxes are almost impossible to find. This campaign succeeded in creating a public perception that the estate tax falls broadly on the population. Earlier this year, a poll found that 49 percent of Americans believed that most families had to pay the estate tax, while only 33 percent gave the right answer that only a few families had to pay.
Still, while an insistent marketing campaign has convinced many Americans that they are overtaxed, it hasn't succeeded in making the issue a top priority with the public. Polls consistently show that voters regard safeguarding Social Security and Medicare as much more important than tax cuts. 
Nonetheless, George W. Bush has pushed through tax cuts in each year of his presidency. Why did he push for these tax cuts, and how did he get them through?
You might think that you could turn to the administration's own pronouncements to learn why it has been so determined to cut taxes. But even if you try to take the administration at its word, there's a problem: the public rationale for tax cuts has shifted repeatedly over the past three years.
During the 2000 campaign and the initial selling of the 2001 tax cut, the Bush team insisted that the federal government was running an excessive budget surplus, which should be returned to taxpayers. By the summer of 2001, as it became clear that the projected budget surpluses would not materialize, the administration shifted to touting the tax cuts as a form of demand-side economic stimulus: by putting more money in consumers' pockets, the tax cuts would stimulate spending and help pull the economy out of recession. By 2003, the rationale had changed again: the administration argued that reducing taxes on dividend income, the core of its plan, would improve incentives and hence long-run growth -- that is, it had turned to a supply-side argument.
These shifting rationales had one thing in common: none of them were credible. It was obvious to independent observers even in 2001 that the budget projections used to justify that year's tax cut exaggerated future revenues and understated future costs. It was similarly obvious that the 2001 tax cut was poorly designed as a demand stimulus. And we have already seen that the supply-side rationale for the 2003 tax cut was tested and found wanting by the Congressional Budget Office.
So what were the Bush tax cuts really about? The best answer seems to be that they were about securing a key part of the Republican base. Wealthy campaign contributors have a lot to gain from lower taxes, and since they aren't very likely to depend on Medicare, Social Security or Medicaid, they won't suffer if the beast gets starved. Equally important was the support of the party's intelligentsia, nurtured by policy centers like Heritage and professionally committed to the tax-cut crusade. The original Bush tax-cut proposal was devised in late 1999 not to win votes in the national election but to fend off a primary challenge from the supply-sider Steve Forbes, the presumptive favorite of that part of the base. 
This brings us to the next question: how have these cuts been sold?
At this point, one must be blunt: the selling of the tax cuts has depended heavily on chicanery. The administration has used accounting trickery to hide the true budget impact of its proposals, and it has used misleading presentations to conceal the extent to which its tax cuts are tilted toward families with very high income.
The most important tool of accounting trickery, though not the only one, is the use of "sunset clauses" to understate the long-term budget impact of tax cuts. To keep the official 10-year cost of the 2001 tax cut down, the administration's Congressional allies wrote the law so that tax rates revert to their 2000 levels in 2011. But, of course, nobody expects the sunset to occur: when 2011 rolls around, Congress will be under immense pressure to extend the tax cuts.
The same strategy was used to hide the cost of the 2003 tax cut. Thanks to sunset clauses, its headline cost over the next decade was only $350 billion, but if the sunsets are canceled -- as the president proposed in a speech early this month -- the cost will be at least $800 billion.
Meanwhile, the administration has carried out a very successful campaign to portray these tax cuts as mainly aimed at middle-class families. This campaign is similar in spirit to the selling of estate-tax repeal as a populist measure, but considerably more sophisticated.
The reality is that the core measures of both the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts mainly benefit the very affluent. The centerpieces of the 2001 act were a reduction in the top income-tax rate and elimination of the estate tax -- the first, by definition, benefiting only people with high incomes; the second benefiting only heirs to large estates. The core of the 2003 tax cut was a reduction in the tax rate on dividend income. This benefit, too, is concentrated on very high-income families. 
According to estimates by the Tax Policy Center -- a liberal-oriented institution, but one with a reputation for scrupulous accuracy -- the 2001 tax cut, once fully phased in, will deliver 42 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income distribution. (Roughly speaking, that means families earning more than $330,000 per year.) The 2003 tax cut delivers a somewhat smaller share to the top 1 percent, 29.1 percent, but within that concentrates its benefits on the really, really rich. Families with incomes over $1 million a year -- a mere 0.13 percent of the population -- will receive 17.3 percent of this year's tax cut, more than the total received by the bottom 70 percent of American families. Indeed, the 2003 tax cut has already proved a major boon to some of America's wealthiest people: corporations in which executives or a single family hold a large fraction of stocks are suddenly paying much bigger dividends, which are now taxed at only 15 percent no matter how high the income of their recipient.
It might seem impossible to put a populist gloss on tax cuts this skewed toward the rich, but the administration has been remarkably successful in doing just that.
One technique involves exploiting the public's lack of statistical sophistication. In the selling of the 2003 tax cut, the catch phrase used by administration spokesmen was "92 million Americans will receive an average tax cut of $1,083." That sounded, and was intended to sound, as if every American family would get $1,083. Needless to say, that wasn't true. 
Yet the catch phrase wasn't technically a lie: the Tax Policy Center estimates that 89 million people will receive tax cuts this year and that the total tax cut will be $99 billion, or about $1,100 for each of those 89 million people. But this calculation carefully leaves out the 50 million taxpayers who received no tax cut at all. And even among those who did get a tax cut, most got a lot less than $1,000, a number inflated by the very big tax cuts received by a few wealthy people. About half of American families received a tax cut of less than $100; the great majority, a tax cut of less than $500.
But the most original, you might say brilliant, aspect of the Bush administration's approach to tax cuts has involved the way the tax cuts themselves are structured. 
David Stockman famously admitted that Reagan's middle-class tax cuts were a "Trojan horse" that allowed him to smuggle in what he really wanted, a cut in the top marginal rate. The Bush administration similarly follows a Trojan horse strategy, but an even cleverer one. The core measures in Bush's tax cuts benefit only the wealthy, but there are additional features that provide significant benefits to some -- but only some -- middle-class families. For example, the 2001 tax cut included a $400 child credit and also created a new 10 percent tax bracket, the so-called cutout. These measures had the effect of creating a "sweet spot" that could be exploited for political purposes. If a couple had multiple children, if the children were all still under 18 and if the couple's income was just high enough to allow it to take full advantage of the child credit, it could get a tax cut of as much as 4 percent of pretax income. Hence the couple with two children and an income of $40,000, receiving a tax cut of $1,600, who played such a large role in the administration's rhetoric. But while most couples have children, at any given time only a small minority of families contains two or more children under 18 -- and many of these families have income too low to take full advantage of the child tax credit. So that "typical" family wasn't typical at all. Last year, the actual tax break for families in the middle of the income distribution averaged $469, not $1,600.
So that's the story of the tax-cut offensive under the Bush administration: through a combination of hardball politics, deceptive budget arithmetic and systematic misrepresentation of who benefits, Bush's team has achieved a major reduction of taxes, especially for people with very high incomes.
But where does that leave the country?

6. A Planned Crisis
Right now, much of the public discussion of the Bush tax cuts focuses on their short-run impact. Critics say that the 2.7 million jobs lost since March 2001 prove that the administration's policies have failed, while the administration says that things would have been even worse without the tax cuts and that a solid recovery is just around the corner.
But this is the wrong debate. Even in the short run, the right question to ask isn't whether the tax cuts were better than nothing; they probably were. The right question is whether some other economic-stimulus plan could have achieved better results at a lower budget cost. And it is hard to deny that, on a jobs-per-dollar basis, the Bush tax cuts have been extremely ineffective. According to the Congressional Budget Office, half of this year's $400 billion budget deficit is due to Bush tax cuts. Now $200 billion is a lot of money; it is equivalent to the salaries of four million average workers. Even the administration doesn't claim its policies have created four million jobs. Surely some other policy -- aid to state and local governments, tax breaks for the poor and middle class rather than the rich, maybe even W.P.A.-style public works -- would have been more successful at getting the country back to work.
Meanwhile, the tax cuts are designed to remain in place even after the economy has recovered. Where will they leave us?
Here's the basic fact: partly, though not entirely, as a result of the tax cuts of the last three years, the government of the United States faces a fundamental fiscal shortfall. That is, the revenue it collects falls well short of the sums it needs to pay for existing programs. Even the U.S. government must, eventually, pay its bills, so something will have to give.
The numbers tell the tale. This year and next, the federal government will run budget deficits of more than $400 billion. Deficits may fall a bit, at least as a share of gross domestic product, when the economy recovers. But the relief will be modest and temporary. As Peter Fisher, under secretary of the treasury for domestic finance, puts it, the federal government is "a gigantic insurance company with a sideline business in defense and homeland security." And about a decade from now, this insurance company's policyholders will begin making a lot of claims. As the baby boomers retire, spending on Social Security benefits and Medicare will steadily rise, as will spending on Medicaid (because of rising medical costs). Eventually, unless there are sharp cuts in benefits, these three programs alone will consume a larger share of G.D.P. than the federal government currently collects in taxes.
Alan Auerbach, William Gale and Peter Orszag, fiscal experts at the Brookings Institution, have estimated the size of the "fiscal gap" -- the increase in revenues or reduction in spending that would be needed to make the nation's finances sustainable in the long run. If you define the long run as 75 years, this gap turns out to be 4.5 percent of G.D.P. Or to put it another way, the gap is equal to 30 percent of what the federal government spends on all domestic programs. Of that gap, about 60 percent is the result of the Bush tax cuts. We would have faced a serious fiscal problem even if those tax cuts had never happened. But we face a much nastier problem now that they are in place. And more broadly, the tax-cut crusade will make it very hard for any future politicians to raise taxes.
So how will this gap be closed? The crucial point is that it cannot be closed without either fundamentally redefining the role of government or sharply raising taxes.
Politicians will, of course, promise to eliminate wasteful spending. But take out Social Security, Medicare, defense, Medicaid, government pensions, homeland security, interest on the public debt and veterans' benefits -- none of them what people who complain about waste usually have in mind -- and you are left with spending equal to about 3 percent of gross domestic product. And most of that goes for courts, highways, education and other useful things. Any savings from elimination of waste and fraud will amount to little more than a rounding-off error.
So let's put a few things back on the table. Let's assume that interest on the public debt will be paid, that spending on defense and homeland security will not be compromised and that the regular operations of government will continue to be financed. What we are left with, then, are the New Deal and Great Society programs: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And to close the fiscal gap, spending on these programs would have to be cut by around 40 percent.
It's impossible to know how such spending cuts might unfold, but cuts of that magnitude would require drastic changes in the system. It goes almost without saying that the age at which Americans become eligible for retirement benefits would rise, that Social Security payments would fall sharply compared with average incomes, that Medicare patients would be forced to pay much more of their expenses out of pocket -- or do without. And that would be only a start.
All this sounds politically impossible. In fact, politicians of both parties have been scrambling to expand, not reduce, Medicare benefits by adding prescription drug coverage. It's hard to imagine a situation under which the entitlement programs would be rolled back sufficiently to close the fiscal gap.
Yet closing the fiscal gap by raising taxes would mean rolling back all of the Bush tax cuts, and then some. And that also sounds politically impossible. 
For the time being, there is a third alternative: borrow the difference between what we insist on spending and what we're willing to collect in taxes. That works as long as lenders believe that someday, somehow, we're going to get our fiscal act together. But this can't go on indefinitely. Eventually -- I think within a decade, though not everyone agrees -- the bond market will tell us that we have to make a choice.
In short, everything is going according to plan.
For the looming fiscal crisis doesn't represent a defeat for the leaders of the tax-cut crusade or a miscalculation on their part. Some supporters of President Bush may have really believed that his tax cuts were consistent with his promises to protect Social Security and expand Medicare; some people may still believe that the wondrous supply-side effects of tax cuts will make the budget deficit disappear. But for starve-the-beast tax-cutters, the coming crunch is exactly what they had in mind.

7. What Kind of Country?
The astonishing political success of the antitax crusade has, more or less deliberately, set the United States up for a fiscal crisis. How we respond to that crisis will determine what kind of country we become.
If Grover Norquist is right -- and he has been right about a lot -- the coming crisis will allow conservatives to move the nation a long way back toward the kind of limited government we had before Franklin Roosevelt. Lack of revenue, he says, will make it possible for conservative politicians -- in the name of fiscal necessity -- to dismantle immensely popular government programs that would otherwise have been untouchable. 
In Norquist's vision, America a couple of decades from now will be a place in which elderly people make up a disproportionate share of the poor, as they did before Social Security. It will also be a country in which even middle-class elderly Americans are, in many cases, unable to afford expensive medical procedures or prescription drugs and in which poor Americans generally go without even basic health care. And it may well be a place in which only those who can afford expensive private schools can give their children a decent education.
But as Governor Riley of Alabama reminds us, that's a choice, not a necessity. The tax-cut crusade has created a situation in which something must give. But what gives -- whether we decide that the New Deal and the Great Society must go or that taxes aren't such a bad thing after all -- is up to us. The American people must decide what kind of a country we want to be.

HEADLINE: Top Gun Vs. Total Recall 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
ONLY in America could a guy who struts in an action-hero's Hollywood costume and barks macho lines from a script pass for a plausible political leader. But if George W. Bush can get away with it, why should Arnold Schwarzenegger be pilloried for the same antics? 
 At least Mr. Schwarzenegger is a show-biz pro. He never would have signed on for a remake of "Top Gun" without first ensuring that it would have the same happy ending as the original. He never would have allowed himself to look as scared as the abandoned kid in "Home Alone" while begging the nation for cash and patience last Sunday night. He would have dismissed B-movie dialogue like "dead or alive" and "bring 'em on" with a curt "hasta la vista, baby!" 
 And while both men have signed on to the same Hollywood fantasy for fixing an economy spiraling into billions of dollars of debt -- cut taxes, spend more -- the foreign-born Mr. Schwarzenegger comes by his fiscal pipe dreams the old-fashioned American way. He earned his multi-millions himself rather than through sweetheart deals available exclusively to the well-pedigreed. 
This is why the hypocrisy attending the Arnold phenomenon from all sides -- Republicans, Democrats, the media -- is an entertainment in itself. Decades after John Kennedy embraced the Rat Pack and Ronald Reagan conflated the heroism of World War II movies with his actual (noncombat, stateside) war experience, voters are inured to the reality that show-business tricks are in the arsenal of every would-be national politician. Only Washington remains shocked, shocked that there could be a "circus" in which our political culture becomes indistinguishable from "Extra" (on which Rob Lowe came out for Arnold).
The fun in watching Mr. Schwarzenegger is that, unlike Mr. Bush and most of his other political peers, he doesn't pretend to be above Hollywood stunts; he flaunts his showmanship and policy ignorance as flagrantly as those gaudy rings he wears. Rather than wait a few weeks to trade quips with a late-night TV comic, as Mr. Bush and Al Gore did in the 2000 campaign, he just cut to the chase and announced his candidacy to Jay Leno. The political press then pooh-poohed his decision to give his first interview to Pat O'Brien of "Access Hollywood" instead of, say, Tim Russert. But Mr. O'Brien, who began his career working for David Brinkley at NBC News in Washington, points out that most of his supposedly more serious colleagues were condescending to Mr. Schwarzenegger as a show-biz joke anyway, with their dim wordplays on the titles of his movies. "Everybody ought to take a deep breath and realize the guy is a candidate now, not the Terminator," Mr. O'Brien says. "There aren't enough of those metaphors to last until the election." 
When Ronald Reagan was asked to predict what kind of governor of California he'd make, he famously answered: "I don't know. I've never played a governor." As his biographer, Lou Cannon, has written, Reagan ran for that office not knowing how bills were passed or budgets were prepared. In this sense, Mr. Schwarzenegger has admitted to being somewhat Reaganesque. His ideology, though, is way to the left of his party, despite all the lip service he pays to being a fiscal conservative. (Howard Dean is a fiscal conservative, too.) Mr. Schwarzenegger is pro-choice, pro-gay rights, pro-gun control, pro-green. He has said that the Clinton impeachment made him "ashamed" to call himself a Republican.
It is hilarious to watch conservatives -- the same conservatives who often decry phony Hollywood liberals and their followers -- betray their own inviolate principles to bask in Arnold's hulking movie-star aura so that they might possibly gain a nominal Republican victory in the bargain. Even the 1977 Oui magazine interview in which Mr. Schwarzenegger bragged about participating in orgies -- not to mention his repeated admissions of drug use -- can't frighten them away.
Arnold may have ducked questions about affirmative action, but that hasn't stopped Fox's star-struck Sean Hannity from gushing that he's "as forthright as any politician I've ever interviewed in my life." As for the Oui confessional, Bill O'Reilly said: "So what? He's a new guy." Rush Limbaugh at first questioned Mr. Schwarzenegger's conservative bona fides, but of late has been hedging,praising Arnold for "the charisma, the star power, the stage presence . . . the likability, the personality" and saying that he never meant to imply that he "is not worthy." No less a religious conservative than Pat Robertson came out for La-La-Land's pro-gay, pro-choice Republican as well: "I'm a body-builder. . . . So I think the weight lifters of the world need to unite."
Ann Coulter has a term for conservatives who wimp out like this -- "girly boys." But she's gone all girly herself over Arnold, telling Larry King that "I'm impressed enough that he's in Hollywood, he's married to a Kennedy and he still calls himself a Republican -- that's good enough for me." Perhaps. Her friend, Bill Maher, has taken a somewhat darker view of these unlikely political conversions. "If his father wasn't a Nazi," he has said of Arnold, "he wouldn't have any credibility with conservatives at all."
In the glitz arena, Mr. Schwarzenegger's opponents have a deficit as large as the dollar shortfall in the state's budget. Desperate bit players will do desperate things to grab a spotlight. Cruz Bustamante, the Democratic lieutenant governor, has had to liken himself to Danny DeVito, Arnold's co-star in "Twins." Arianna Huffington has lured extras to a rally by promising them the chance to be on television -- as if her nonstarting campaign might be confused with "American Idol." Tom McClintock, the conservative Republican state senator, has compared himself to the eponymous hero of "Seabiscuit." (This sad analogy has also been trotted out in the fledgling 2004 presidential race, by Dennis Kucinich.) Poor Governor Davis: the closest he's come to Hollywood glamour is an interview Cybill Shepherd gave to The San Francisco Chronicle testifying that he was "a good kisser." Or at least he was 36 years ago, which she pinpointed as the occasion of their last lip lock.
Serious politicians try to pretend that they won't go in for contrived sets and props, but of course they do. Even Dr. Dean, the least show-biz of presidential candidates (so far), felt compelled to appear at a New York City rally in front of a backdrop commissioned from a graffiti artist, as if to plant the subliminal visual cue he had an urban hip-hop following. (In fact, he has scant discernible black support, hip-hop or otherwise.) John Kerry -- after posing in a wet suit in Vogue and on a Harley-Davidson in Time -- made the "official" announcement of his candidacy in front of a retired aircraft carrier in South Carolina, about as much a sweet spot on the map for him as Woody Allen's Manhattan would have been for Strom Thurmond.
Washington commentators see through these theatrics when the special effects are ham-fisted enough (as in Mr. Kerry's case) or when they literally have Hollywood written all over them (as in Mr. Schwarzenegger's). But since 9/11, too many journalists have been all too willing to look the other way when the Bush administration engages in Hollywood showmanship to cover up its failings. Some have gone so far as to help foment the fictions. Showtime, the cable network, boasts that no fewer than three journalists, including the Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, were involved in assuring the accuracy and balance of the docudrama "DC 9/11: Time of Crisis," first shown last Sunday while the actual George W. Bush was addressing the nation. But this film, made with full Bush administration cooperation (including that of the president himself), is propaganda so untroubled by reality that it's best viewed as a fitting memorial to Leni Riefenstahl. The script vouched for by Mr. Krauthammer and a couple of other Beltway boys presents Dick Cheney as a mere supplicant to the all-knowing Mr. Bush and somehow lets the administration (though not its predecessor) off the hook for letting Osama bin Laden and his Saudi enablers slip away.
New polls reveal that Americans increasingly realize that they have been had. Reruns are not kind to this White House's scripted costume drama of May 1; the seams show. More and more viewers recognize that the banner reading "Mission Accomplished" in the "Top Gun" spectacle was idle set decoration, especially given that the number of American casualties in that mission has more than doubled since then. They know, too, that the president's uniform was from stock, and perhaps by now have heard how his speech was deliberately delayed almost three hours after his tailhook landing so that it would fall into that magical twilight hour that cinematographers find most romantic. Some may even realize that the president's breezy dialogue upon deplaning -- "I miss flying, I can tell you that" -- was too ironic by half, given that he had actually missed some of his required flights during his stay-at-home stint for the Texas Air National Guard while others fought the Vietnam War.
There was only one bit of unadorned realism in the White House's slick "Top Gun." The servicemen and women on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln were not dress extras; they were actual troops whose deployment at sea had been extended from 6 months to nearly 10, the longest by a carrier in 30 years, to help fill the maw of an understaffed war. According to the Navy's press office, members of the Lincoln's crew photographed with the president on that day may have already been redeployed on another carrier. It is the real-life terminators on the prowl in Iraq, not the sentimental White House screenwriters responsible for "Mission Accomplished," who are poised to write the ending for that crew and all their fellow troops now.

HEADLINE: Yankee, Leave Home! 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL; ALAN COWELL is a correspondent in the London bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
IT is not exactly the routine for Queen Elizabeth II to visit a theme park, but she did so in June, traveling to the miniature models of Legoland near the royal palace at Windsor to survey a tiny likeness of herself in molded plastic inspecting the equally Lilliputian guard. Neither is it quite the norm for Prime Minister Tony Blair to do sound bites for television and Web site commercials. But he did so this summer, urging Americans to visit Britain "for great times with good friends."
 The reason for both events was a sinking feeling among Britain's tour operators that this year, after the Iraq war, SARS and a stubborn economic slowdown, visitors -- particularly Americans -- might well stay away, jeopardizing Britain's $120-billion-a-year tourism industry. As the peak summer season unfolded, it rapidly emerged that the British were not the only ones to worry. 
 Across Europe, from the Colosseum to the Eiffel Tower, the number of American visitors has been declining, caused in part by the dollar's weakness against the euro and the British pound, but also by a mix of factors ranging from terrorism fears to a reluctance to visit countries, most notably France, that opposed the war in Iraq. 
 Even on the Normandy beaches, where American veterans traditionally journey, Americans this year have been staying away, according to tour operators there. The story is similar from Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin to the Tower of London.
 Nor is it just a question of numbers. Americans spent more time and money than most other tourists when they visit European cities. "The golden age is over," an Italian bus driver told a tour guide, Sylvie Hogg, in Rome after ferrying American visitors around the city without receiving the kind of tips he would once have expected.
 And, even though some hoteliers and tour operators say they expect the Americans to return soon, the latest decline seems to fit a dismal pattern that has dented their business for several years. In Britain, in the year 2001, a foot-and-mouth outbreak deterred visitors even before the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and the war in Afghanistan. Then, as the global economy continued to contract in 2002 and stock markets remained in the doldrums, President George W. Bush's focus on Iraq and the war on terrorism seemed to spread more nervousness among Americans about venturing too far.
 "Whenever Bush talks about terrorism, we groan because Americans stay home," said Nello Rispoli, co-owner of the midrange Villa Lara hotel in Amalfi, Italy. Some causes of the slowdown originate far beyond Europe. SARS scared off many would-be travelers across the globe, and economic woes were more or less universal all year.
 But for Europeans, this has been an unusual summer in other ways. Soaring temperatures broke records in England. Punishing heat waves killed thousands of people in France alone, and raging forest fires, some set by arsonists, devoured parts of southern France, Spain and Portugal.
 And even though the statistics are not all in, there was ample evidence early this summer that plain old dollars and cents had contributed to a lot of tourism's woes. This year, the dollar has weakened by some 15 percent against the euro and around 10 percent against the British pound, while the pound itself is 10 to 15 percent lower against the euro, the currency used in 12 of the 15 European Union countries excluding Britain, Sweden and Denmark.
 Continental Europeans, thus, found London a cheaper destination than in recent years, and in June, some 1.5 million visitors from Western Europe traveled to Britain -- a 17 percent increase over 2002 and the busiest tourism month on record, according to VisitBritain, the main tourism marketing group. But, in that same month, the number of American and Canadian visitors to Britain, 440,000, was 15 percent lower than last year, prompting increased advertising in the United States. That included the TV ad with Prime Minister Blair. Although he appears only briefly, it clearly shows his concern that Americans were staying away.
 The war itself also reinforced a trend for fewer American visitors at attractions like the Tower of London. "The war most definitely impacted, but our numbers were down for the U.S. market last year anyway," said Jacque Gazzard, spokeswoman for Historic Royal Palaces, which runs the Tower of London.
 Tour operators said business might have been improving slightly later in the summer. But there was no bonanza. "These people are mostly on coach trips or cheap charter flights," said Derek Eydman, a London cabdriver, gesturing to crowds of visitors as he drove past Buckingham Palace. "The big money spenders are the Japanese and Americans, and there are not many of them at the moment."
 Across the Channel, there was a somewhat different dynamic. As a result of France's having led European opposition to the war in Iraq, many Americans, fearing unpleasant encounters or to express disapproval, seem to have avoided the country. In April, before the war ended, the number of American visitors was down by 38 percent compared with one year earlier. But Robin Massee, a spokeswoman for the French Government Tourist Office in New York, said that improved visitor totals in July and August could mean that for all of this year, the decline in the number of American visitors may be only 10 percent.
 At the Eiffel Tower, Luc Echavidre, its administrator, said the slump had persisted into early August, with the number of visitors down 11 percent compared with last year. "We certainly have the feeling that there are less Americans," he said. "There is a general drop in the number of foreign tourists, especially Americans." Later in the month, however, visitor numbers started improving, said Isabelle Esnous, a spokeswoman for the Eiffel Tower.
 Danielle Servais, 57, a waitress at a five-star resort who was born in France but became an American citizen after moving to the United States in 1967, was visiting Paris from West Palm Beach, Fla. "I think the real reason is the economy," she said, discussing why other Americans might have been put off. "The dollar is very low and people have lost a lot of money on the stock exchange." 
 But there was another uncertainty for Americans, she said. "They are not very comfortable with coming to France this year," Ms. Servais said while sitting in a cafe near the Opera in central Paris. "They are afraid not to be welcomed, they are afraid to have a bad feeling here."
 That is only part of the story, as some French people have been quick to note.
 In a letter to Le Figaro published Aug. 15, a reader, Serge Raffet, wrote that the real reason for Americans to stay away from France was that it was "the land of disorder" with repeated strikes affecting everything from airline flights to garbage collection. "Those are the reasons for the Americans to go look elsewhere," he wrote.
 There are some suggestions that "elsewhere" could include Italy.
 "It looks like things started picking up again in July," said Franco Paloscia, head of the press office for the Italian Government Tourist Board. But he said that in the earlier part of the year visitors were down by around 9 percent from last year. Yet, American concerns about European hostility or insecurity may have been exaggerated.
 Not one of a dozen Americans interviewed on the streets of London, Paris, Rome and Berlin said that they had encountered any hostility during their visits. "We don't feel unsafe in Europe," said Susan Staup, from Orange County, Calif., as she strolled along the Unter den Linden, one of Berlin's most famous thoroughfares.
 For their part, many Europeans maintained that the free-spending Americans were not easily replaced.
 "There has been no one to fill the gap of the Americans," said Marylea van Daalen, the wife of the general manager at the five-star Hotel Adlon in Berlin. At the same time, there is some evidence that budget and backpack travelers -- usually below the age of 30 -- have been far less willing to cancel journeys to Europe.
 "The majority of our guests are still from the U.S.A.,"' said Norman Kolb, manager of a hostel in Berlin call Lette'm Sleep that charges around $17 per person per night.
 "I would say that 90 percent of all American guests at our hostel are between 18 and 22 years old," Mr. Kolb said. "They don't seem to care much about issues like the war on Iraq, terrorism and tensions between European and the United States governments. Their main concern is where to find a cool party at night."

From a Texas 'Trump,' Plans That Amaze (or Annoy)

BYLINE:  By KATE MURPHY

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
SOME developers with grand dreams, like Donald Trump, put their mark on urban America by building the tallest, boldest buildings around. 
 Then there is Tilman J. Fertitta, who has brought two things to downtown Houston that it never had before: a 90-foot Ferris wheel and a miniature train that chugs through a tunnel in a tank filled with sharks. 
 Mr. Fertitta, the chiefexecutive and largest shareholder of Landry's Restaurants Inc., develops what are known as "eatertainment" projects, and as part of his grand vision, he is buying or signing long-term leases on prime coastal properties nationwide. 
But his most vigorous activity so far is in Texas. In Houston, the neon-trimmed ferris wheel appeared six months ago as part of a seven-acre entertainment complex on the banks of Buffalo Bayou. It is joined by a merry-go-round, an aquarium, carnival games, two restaurants, a ballroom and, most spectacularly, the shark train. 
"I said to myself, 'Kids love trains and kids love sharks; why not drive a train through sharks?' " said Mr. Fertitta, sitting proudly in the little train as sharks swam menacingly around his head.
Mr. Fertitta, 46, builds developments that can transform entire towns. Five years ago, he opened a 40-acre boardwalk of shops, restaurants and rides in the coastal town of Kemah, southeast of Houston. To cope with weekend crowds of up to 50,000 people, Kemah, a once-sleepy shrimping village, had to double the size of its police force, to 20. On Galveston Island, Landry's accumulated six blocks along the seawall and built a complex of restaurants and attractions, including a fake volcano that erupts every half-hour in the evenings. 
Mr. Fertitta himself owns a 22-acre beachfront resort in Galveston and is building a 70,000-square-foot convention center next to it. Farther down the Texas coast, in Corpus Christi, his company has proposed to lease the city marina and build an entertainment complex on the surrounding 10 acres.
All this activity has generated no small measure of controversy, and Mr. Fertitta finds himself parrying criticism from two sides: preservationists who deride his projects as tacky, and financial analysts who question whether they make business sense.
But he shows no signs of backing away from any of them, and he has a solid base of support. Just about everywhere he goes, municipal authorities are desperate for his investments and the jobs and tax revenue they create.
Certainly, his detractors don't mince words. "Tilman Fertitta is like the Donald Trump of the Southwest," said Frances Farenthold, known as Sissy, who represented Corpus Christi in the Texas Legislature from 1968 to 1973 and is a staunch opponent of the proposed deal in that city. "He's taking over the whole Gulf Coast and putting up Ferris wheels. I can't think that's the highest and best use of our shoreline."
Neither can Cynthia Fowler, a Houston resident and board member of Scenic America, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving the landscapes and architectural character of communities. She called Mr. Fertitta's $40 million midway-style complex in her city's business district "just plain cheesy and wildly inappropriate for that location."
And Gary L. Gray, a management consultant and Kemah resident, dismissed the "glitzy tourist trap that's cheapened the character and ruined the old, salty flavor of this town."
SUCH barbs clearly wound Mr. Fertitta, who defends his projects with the intensity of a misunderstood artist. "There's nothing cheesy about them," he said, seeming both intimidating and imploring with his steel-gray eyes, boyish buzz cut and tendency to lean into his listener.
Slings come from stock analysts, too. They contend that he should stick to restaurants, which include the chains Landry's Seafood House, Joe's Crab Shack, the Crab House, Willie G's, Cadillac Bar, Rainforest Cafe, Charley's Crab, Chart House and Salt Grass Steak House. "A shark train and erupting volcano are really cool, but you've got to wonder what the longevity of these things are," said Barry Stouffer, a restaurant analyst in Nashville for BB&T Capital Markets.
A look at Mr. Fertitta's past entertainment projects shows that he knows how to negotiate favorable deals. The development in Houston, for example, is on city land for which Landry's has a 40-year lease that is fixed at $150,000 a year; in most commercial leases, the price rises along with property values. The city, which is suffering from falling tax revenues, even persuaded the Texas Department of Transportation to let the company build a pay-parking lot under a nearby highway overpass.
"We clearly needed something that would draw people downtown and the sales taxes that would go along with that," said Annise Parker, a Houston city councilwoman.
Mr. Fertitta has received sweeteners elsewhere, too. Kemah sold his company a waterfront street for $300,000, a price that city officials described as "heavily discounted." Galveston is providing the financing for the convention center that Mr. Fertitta is building. His company will operate it using proceeds from the city's hotel occupancy tax and will receive half the profits. And he has refused to budge on demands that Corpus Christi limit competition and make $20 million in improvements to the city-owned marina before he invests a cent. Under pressure from activists like Ms. Farenthold, otherwise eager city officials there told him that they need some concessions before they can consider any deal. 
Local governments tend to be eager to sign on with Mr. Fertitta because his brainstorms promise to bring in revenue. Landry's is the largest private employer in Galveston, and Roger Quiroga, the city's mayor, said its investments had prompted "the biggest economic boom we've seen in decades." In Houston, there are long lines at the shark train on weekends and evenings in the previously moribund downtown.
The outlook isn't all rosy. The crowds at the Kemah entertainment complex have fallen off, for example. Landry's debt has risen sharply this year, its cash balance has shrunk and its restaurant sales, which still account for most of its business, have tapered off.
The company says it expects sales to rebound and to top $1 billion this year. Mr. Fertitta's food empire now includes 285 restaurants in 36 states. For a while in the mid-1990's, he gained national attention by having lavish fund-raisers at his Houston home for President Bill Clinton. 
Landry's went public in 1993, and today Mr. Fertitta owns 21 percent of the stock, a stake worth $127 million at the current share price of $22, up from a low of $4 in 1999. He is annoyed by analysts' criticism of his company's relatively low rate of return on its restaurant investment, saying that while his better-performing rivals gravitate to suburban strip malls, he is buying prime coastal real estate. "I can't sail a boat 100 miles along the coast of the United States without hitting one of my restaurants," he boasted.
Mr. Fertitta has been buying up struggling restaurant chains at a furious pace recently -- "bottom feeding," in the words of Bob Goldin, a restaurant consultant at Technomic Inc. in Chicago. He continues to look for entertainment outlets, even getting into a bidding war in March with Ripley Entertainment Inc. of Orlando, Fla., for a bankrupt aquarium in Denver and ultimately paying $13.6 million, triple the asking price, to buy it. What many of his purchases have in common is water -- whether sloshing in giant fish tanks or lapping on nearby shores, from the beach in Malibu, Calif., to the Hudson River. (The company has Chart House restaurants in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Weehawken, N.J.) 
Mr. Fertitta's detractors fear that he now has Trump-style casinos in mind and will push for legalized gambling in Texas. Asked about that, he slapped both hands on a table and said, "Show me where I've been lobbying for gambling." But, he added: "If gambling does come, I'm not going to sit by while someone next door beats my brains out."
Mr. Fertitta's developments evoke Las Vegas in their grandiosity, and he is involved in every detail. He flies in his helicopter among his properties, where minions scurry behind him jotting down his orders, as when he asked that a piece of granite be installed over a slightly scuffed section of Sheetrock at the Houston complex. 
"He once tore out the same wall four times before he was satisfied," said Matthew D. Wiggins, who leases property to Mr. Fertitta in Kemah. "I couldn't see anything wrong with any of them, but that's why he's got his pile of money and my pile is a whole lot smaller."

On a Boxing Weekend in Las Vegas, Only Businesses Are a Sure Bet

BYLINE:  By JULIE DUNN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
BY the time this day is over, F.A.O. Schwarz here expects its sales to be 25 percent higher than on a typical weekend, and to have sold at least a dozen of its popular large stuffed animals, like the 4-foot-tall elephant that retails for $650. 
 Las Vegas is always a lure for big spenders who want to forget their troubles and have fun. But this weekend is special because of the boxing match, pitting Oscar De La Hoya against Shane Mosley for the superwelterweight title, that was scheduled to be held last night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. 
 "These weekends are an economic carnival," said Don King, the veteran boxing promoter, who did not promote this fight. "Las Vegas will be alive and kicking with millions of dollars being recycled this weekend. From the panhandlers and busboys to the casinos and airlines, everybody finds their niche." 
Jake Sammaripa, the spokesman for the Las Vegas F.A.O. Schwarz store, said he expected many foreign visitors, especially South Americans. "And no one ever balks at the prices," he said. "Everyone has kids that they need to buy presents for."
At Hyde Park Jewelers at Caesars Palace's Forum Shops, Sandi Perry, the general manager, said that Rolex, Cartier and Breitling watches, with an average price of $4,000, are hot-selling products with the boxing crowd. "We'll probably sell at least three times the normal amount," she said. "These men love watches. We get people who come in with pockets full of cash looking to buy something right away, especially late at night."
Silver Porsche Boxster convertibles and yellow Hummers, which each rent for more than $300 a day, have sped off the lot at Dream Car Rentals. "We don't really see a big increase in business with the heavyweights like Tyson and Holyfield, but with the welterweights, especially De La Hoya, we see a noticeable increase," said Rick Sheps, owner of Dream Car Rentals. "It seems to be a younger, more affluent crowd."
Despite a struggling economy in some regions and a steady decline nationally in the number of jobs, tourism in Las Vegas is flourishing. "On any given day, there are 250,000 visitors in Las Vegas," said Rob Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. "And there is no question that the crowds that come to town for fights like this also like to gamble."
According to the visitors authority, 87 percent of the people who decide to visit Las Vegas do some gambling, and the average gambling budget is $503 a person. "In tough economic and political times, Las Vegas represents the quintessential American escape," Mr. Powers said. "It's seen as a very solid value."
HAVING a closely watched boxing match puts the city, and spending, into high gear. Many consider Mr. De La Hoya, who released a pop album in 2001 that was nominated for a Grammy, to be the most marketable boxer around. 
"Oscar is a throwback to a different era," said Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission. "There are only a few fighters that transcend the sports pages, but De LaHoya is a very special commodity."
Just for stepping into the ring, Mr. De La Hoya has been guaranteed more than $12 million; Mr. Mosley stands to make at least $4.5 million. 
"It's going to be as large as any fight we've ever hosted," said J. Terrence Lanni, chief executive of MGM Mirage, owner of the MGM Grand, which also has the exclusive closed-circuit viewing rights. 
Las Vegas casinos have marketed the fight to their high rollers -- who regularly spend $250,000 and more -- offering free rooms, limousine transportation and ringside seats.
But the investment is expected to pay off quite well. "We'll be nearing $100 million for the weekend, and that is a very big number," Mr. Lanni said. 'It'll be at least four times a normal weekend." 
Not just high rollers were in town for the fight. "The stars and big shots get flown in on Lear jets and put up for free -- the rest of us are here just trying to get a glimpse of Julia Roberts or something," said Joe Madrid, a labor contractor from Fresno, Calif., as he drank beer and played video poker at the MGM Grand. "The fight brought us here, and it's worth it because we like Vegas." 
With MGM Grand's rows of blackjack tables and slot machines close to capacity, victory seems all but certain. "At the end of the day, there will only be one man standing in the center of the ring," Mr. King said. "But the real winner is Las Vegas."

From the Middle East to Cuba, The Fine Art of Political Bluster

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY NAFTALI; Timothy Naftali directs the Kremlin Decision-Making Project at the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. His book on Nikita S. Khrushchev, written with Aleksandr Fursenko, will be published by W. W. Norton in 2004.

 BODY:
FROM 1954 to 1965, a faceless bureaucrat named Vladimir Malin was the official note-taker at meetings of the leadership of the Soviet Union. His handwritten minutes, kept in a ledger like that used by Western accountants, were the holy grail of the Central Intelligence Agency's unsuccessful efforts to penetrate the Kremlin. They remained closed until last week, when they were released by archivists at the Russian State Archives of Contemporary History in Moscow.
 The documents reveal a troubled Presidium struggling to feed its people, and a leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, struggling to assert himself abroad and stay competitive with the United States. Malin's notes also provide a valuable companion to the secret tape recordings made by the Kennedy White House during the Cuban missile crisis, a record showing the American mind-set during the most dangerous moments of the cold war. 
 Excerpts follow from translations made by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, which is producing an English-language edition of the documents under an agreement with the Russian archives. More excerpts are available online at www.millercenter.virginia.edu.
 TIMOTHY NAFTALI
When American troops entered Lebanon in July 1958 to stabilize its government, the Soviet Union feared that the next move by the United States would be to invade Iraq, where a pro-Western government had just been toppled. Speaking with his colleagues Aleksei N. Kosygin and Anastas I. Mikoyan, Khrushchev suggested sending a stern letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower comparing the entry into Lebanon to Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939. Although he was Communist Party leader, at this point Khrushchev did not always get his way: 
Kosygin: Shouldn't we state our positions on the Middle East -- that we don't have any material interests there? 
Khrushchev: All the world knows that we have no material interests whatsoever. Our interests are limited to one thing, what is congruent with the aspirations of countries all over the world: to ensure peace in the Middle East, to ensure the independence of Arab countries and noninterference, etc. This is correct.
This letter should be prepared from the position of strength, not one that is pleading, but from a position fully aware of our strength and responsibility. It is necessary to say here that we make this appeal because we cannot be indifferent, but we don't want to resolve this question by means of war.
Mikoyan: I wouldn't mention Hitler. It is necessary to say that all wars in history have shown that they can lead to this kind of end. If we mention Hitler, it will infuriate Eisenhower. If we draw a parallel to Poland here, they will start coming after us. Even if we do not mention Hitler, everyone will understand what these wars lead to.
Khrushchev: For the sake of compromise, I don't insist on it. 
By 1961 Khrushchev was master of the Presidium. On the eve of his first and only summit meeting with John F. Kennedy, he informed the Kremlin that he intended to confront the American president over the Western military presence in Berlin. Khrushchev explained that Moscow should be willing to shut down the air corridor to the city, even at the risk of war: 
Our position is very strong, but of course we will have to really intimidate them now. For example, if there is any flying around, we will have to bring those airplanes down. 
Could they respond with a provocative act? They could. But if we don't bring the planes down, this would mean that we are capitulating. . . . In a word, politics is politics. If we want to carry out our policy, and if we want it to be acknowledged, respected and feared, it is necessary to be firm.
In 1961, Khrushchev failed in his effort to force NATO out of West Berlin through intimidation. Irritated by Washington's resolve, Khrushchev informed his colleagues in January 1962 that this was not the time to ease up on the United States, using a glass of water as a metaphor: 
We should increase the pressure, we must not doze off, and, while growing, we should let the opponent feel this growth. But don't pour the last drop to make the cup overflow. Be just like a meniscus, which, according to the laws of surface tension in liquid, is generated in order that the liquid doesn't pour out past the rim. 
Here's our policy: to always have a wine glass with a meniscus. Because if we don't have a meniscus . . . we let the enemy live peacefully. . . . We must not let him, but we must not do the provoking ourselves.
Khrushchev was not sure what role Kennedy would play in his strategy. He felt the American people were far more stridently anti-Communist than the president:
This is a young and capable man; it is necessary to give him his due. But he can neither stand up to the American public, nor can he lead them.
While on a state visit to Bulgaria in 1962, Khrushchev came up with the idea of deploying nuclear missiles to Cuba. The meniscus strategy was failing, and Khrushchev believed that as long as the United States remained too confident, bilateral agreements would be impossible and third-world allies, especially Fidel Castro's Cuba, would be vulnerable. On his return to Moscow, Khrushchev surprised his colleagues with a proposal to deal with American power, rendered tersely by Malin as "an offensive policy":
Come to an agreement with F. Castro, conclude a military agreement regarding joint defense. 
Deploy nuclear-missile weapons.
Deliver them secretly. 
Then declare. Missiles will be under our command.
This will be an offensive policy.
But the Soviets were unable to deliver the missiles secretly. The operation was only half completed when American spy planes detected the activity. On Oct. 25, after the United States Navy imposed a blockade around Cuba, Malin recorded Khrushchev's decision to back down to avoid a nuclear war. There was little for Khrushchev to cheer, but he felt his ploy scared the White House:
The Americans say that the missile launchers in Cuba must be dismantled. Perhaps this ought to be done. This is not capitulation on our part. If we fire, they will also fire. There is no doubt that the Americans have turned into cowards. . . .
We have now made Cuba the focus of the world. The two systems have met head on. Kennedy is telling us to take our rockets out of Cuba. We reply, "Give us a firm guarantee, a promise that the Americans will not attack Cuba." That's not bad. . . .
We must let the enemy feel secure and obtain from them an assurance with regard to Cuba. Moreover, it should not be brought to the boiling point. We can also defeat the U.S.A. from U.S.S.R. territory. From now on, Cuba will not be what it was before.
They, the Americans, threaten an economic blockade, but the U.S.A. will not attack Cuba. We must not intensify the situation, but conduct a rational policy. This way we will strengthen Cuba and save it for two to three years. While in a few years it will be even harder for the United States to deal with it. 
You have to play, but without taking revenge, without losing your head. The initiative is in our hands, there is no need to be afraid. They started and then became afraid. It is not advantageous for us to wage war. The future does not depend on Cuba, but on our country.
Khrushchev also determined how the decision should be conveyed to Castro:
We have succeeded with some things and not with others. What we have today is a positive situation. What is positive about it? The whole world is fixated on Cuba. The rockets have played their positive role. Time will pass. If it is necessary, the missiles can appear there again.
The missiles were removed, and the Soviets never tried to reintroduce them. On the home front, however, Khrushchev did not abandon his use of improvisation and intimidation. Two years later, his colleagues removed him from office.

The Lost Vocabulary of Disinterested Politics

BYLINE:  By GEOFFREY NUNBERG; Geoffrey Nunberg, a Stanford linguist, is heard regularly on NPR's "Fresh Air" and is the author of "The Way We Talk Now."

 BODY:
ALL of the candidates in California's recall election seem to be discussing the delicate semantics of "special interests." 
 Arnold Schwarzenegger began his campaign to lead California by pledging to become "the people's governor," vowing that he would accept no money from the "special interests who have a stranglehold on Sacramento." When it turned out that he had accepted contributions from developers and other wealthy individuals, he explained that those weren't special interests but merely "powerful interests who control things." 
 What he had meant, he said, was that he would refuse contributions only from public employee unions or other groups he might have to negotiate with as governor. He apologized for the confusion by saying, "I was not articulate enough to explain that." 
In fairness to Mr. Schwarzenegger, "special interest" is a phrase that everyone uses selectively. He is guilty merely of having acknowledged explicitly what everyone else prudently leaves unsaid.
But the words that everyone takes for granted are usually the ones that work the most mischief in political life. The British politician Aneurin Bevan once said that the student of politics "must always be on his guard against the old words, for the words persist when the reality behind them has changed."
As it happens, Mr. Schwarzenegger's campaign language, like the recall itself, is a legacy of the Progressive era. The California recall process was adopted in 1911 under Gov. Hiram Johnson, the Progressive who had been elected on a pledge much like Mr. Schwarzenegger's, to "return the government of California to the people." But in Johnson's case the "stranglehold" was exercised not by the public employee unions but by the Southern Pacific Railroad. 
Like many Progressives, Johnson put his faith in electoral reforms like the recall and the referendum, which "place in the hands of the people the means by which they may protect themselves."
The Progressives battened on that opposition between "the people" and "the interests," as they referred to the trusts, corporations and financial combines. By 1922, Walter Lippmann noted, the language of that struggle had become a cliche. 
"The question of a proper fare on a municipal subway is symbolized as an issue between the People and the Interests . . . so that finally in the heat of a campaign, an 8-cent fare becomes un-American," he said. "The Revolutionary fathers died to prevent it. Lincoln suffered that it might not come to pass. . . ."
Even so, the notion of "interest" was central to the age's thinking about democracy. The word crops up over and over again in the writings of Henry Adams, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Herbert Croly, Lippmann and John Dewey. It oscillated among its personal, economic and political meanings, as writers struggled to define the paramount political virtue of disinterestedness.
Much of the Progressives' language survived the era, along with their reforms, but both were altered and denatured. By the time Robert LaFollette ran for president on the Progressive ticket in 1924, it was clear that "the interests" had adapted to the political and administrative reforms of the era, a fact that could be seen in the appearance of the expression "politics as usual." Money still talked, even if it had to speak in a different tone of voice.
LaFollette was probably the last major politician to rail against the trusts and corporations with the bald phrase "the interests." By the New Deal, it had been replaced by "special interests," and later by "special interest groups."
In those phrases, though, the meaning of "interest" was no longer restricted to economically powerful groups like corporations and, later, labor unions. By 1948, a letter writer to The New York Times could describe opera fans as a special interest group that shouldn't be subsidized by public funds. And in modern usage a special interest can be just about any group that favors a particular law or policy, though always with the implication that its demands are at odds with the interests of "the people."
The Weekly Standard inveighs against "special interest legislation" like the California law that gives workplace protection for cross-dressing employees. An Environmental Protection Agency administrator talks about the special interests that tried unsuccessfully to get greenhouse-gas emissions classified as pollutants. A sample grant application from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety gives "anti-tobacco" as an example of a special interest group. And Hootie Johnson, the chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club, insists that the club will not "capitulate to special interest groups" by agreeing to admit women.
The modern usage obscures the difference between having an interest and being one. We may talk about banking interests or labor interests, but "the women's interest" and "the cross-dressing interest" don't come easily to the tongue.
"Special interest" blurs the distinction between the economic and political senses of "interest" that the Progressives struggled to reconcile. Now everyone is "interested," in the old sense of the word -- the environmentalists as much as the carmakers, the American Cancer Society as much as the tobacco companies.
The passing of the old sense of interest took disinterestedness over the side along with it. Usage critics exaggerate when they lament the disappearance of the sense of disinterested that means, roughly, "impartial." That meaning still accounts for a majority of its uses in the press. 
But disinterested isn't a word that comes up much when we try to define political virtue. There's no place to stand that's free from what William Dean Howells called "the sordid competition of interests," now that interest itself has been given so broad a charter.
Yet there's one feature of the Progressives' notion of interest that has survived. We still think of special interests as groups that have obtained a back-door influence on law or policy, whether it's purchased by campaign contributions or bartered for political support. Whether the word is applied to women's groups or tobacco companies, the implication is that they wouldn't be able to put their views across in a direct popular appeal.
What's curious is how many interested parties that definition exempts: corporations that take out advertisements or create foundations to promote their political opinions, people who buy newspapers or television networks to disseminate their views, millionaires who use their own money to finance their political ambitions or a recall election. Those aren't special interests, but merely "powerful interests who control things," as Mr. Schwarzenegger put it. Hiram Johnson would have found nothing to fault in that language, either.

Governor Reagan's Solution? Well, Raise Taxes
 A BUDGET crisis. An actor who wants to be governor so he can cut taxes and bloated government. California has seen this script before. How did Ronald Reagan deal with the mess he inherited in 1967? First, he pronounced the problem much worse than he thought it was. Then, he raised taxes -- by a lot. 
 In his new book, "Governor Reagan: His Rise to Power," (PublicAffairs), the journalist Lou Cannon describes the drama: "No amount of budget reductions, even if they had been politically palatable, could have balanced California's budget in 1967. The cornerstone of Governor Reagan's economic program was not the ballyhooed budget reductions but a sweeping tax package four times larger than the previous record California tax increase obtained by Governor Pat Brown in 1959.
"Reagan's proposal had the distinction of being the largest tax hike ever proposed by a governor in the history of the United States. He sought tax increases on sales, personal income, banks and corporations, insurance companies, liquor and cigarettes. When Reagan unveiled the plan on March 8, it carried a price tag of $946 million. When it passed the Senate with various attachments, including a tax on services that the press dubbed the 'shoeshine tax,' the total was $1 billion. And this from a governor two months in office who had campaigned on the virtues of tax reduction!"

They Are Cute, But They Condescend
SOCIAL deconstruction has become blood sport, or at least a source of revenue for the book business. The latest example of the genre -- "A Field Guide to the Urban Hipster" (Broadway Books) -- takes stock of a slew of familiar figures -- "Glam Rockers," "Thugz," "Laptop Rock Artists," "Ravers," "Elizabeth Street Shopgirls" and "Alternaboys," among others.
Who gets the sharpest assessment? Perhaps it is the "Indie Rocker." Here's how it goes:
"Noted for elitism and misdirected precocity, these Hipsters profess stringent anticorporate/anticommercial ideals, yet the rabidity of these convictions does little to dilute their sensitive temperaments. They are musically obsessed and often condescend to those less familiar with the minutia of music released on independent rock labels, or 'indie rock.'
"These Hipsters often serve as clerks at small, independently owned record shops. In such terrain, approach is strongly discouraged. Though cute and cuddly, they will strike with sardonic, cynical commentary at the first hint of dilettantism or ignorance."

HEADLINE: An Unsustainable Policy on Iraq 

 BODY:
After a summer of worsening news from Iraq, it is time to rethink America's postwar strategy.
 President Bush is right to refuse to be pushed by guerrilla violence and political pressure into leaving Iraq prematurely. But avoiding that will require more than proclaiming victory over a tyrant who remains at large and asking Americans to remain resolute against terrorism, as Mr. Bush did most recently in a campaign commercial of a speech on Friday at Fort Stewart in Georgia. 
 Mr. Bush has so far failed to explain satisfactorily how he plans to secure Iraq without a crippling, indefinite American military commitment; speedily achieve Iraqi self-government; and share the burden of rebuilding Iraq's industries and society so the United States can leave on its own terms. And his maneuvering room may soon shrink, since the Democratic challengers are desperate to break out of the herd on Iraq. If Mr. Bush does not demonstrate a clear and convincing strategy soon, he may face political pressure to bring home American troops under conditions that would be embarrassing for America and perilous for the Middle East. Of all the possible scenarios, the most important one to avoid is a poll-driven scramble to bring the troops home that suffers the same lack of preparation the administration showed at the end of major combat.
Moving forward will require new thinking from an administration that has shown little inclination to learn from its mistakes. The United States needs help from its allies in Europe, but those countries are unlikely to provide it unless Mr. Bush abandons his "my way or the highway" approach. Simply saying it's time to pay up, as Mr. Bush did last Sunday, does not begin to address the concerns of economically stressed allies who felt trampled before the war. The lingering strains were evident on Friday in Geneva, where Secretary of State Colin Powell quickly rejected France's proposal for an unrealistically rapid buildup to Iraqi elections in the spring. 
The administration is going to have to tackle the controversy over security. The arithmetic on this point is disturbing. There are now roughly 180,000 American troops in Iraq and Kuwait, some 20,000 of them from Army Reserve and National Guard units. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld insists no more American troops are needed. The violence makes us wonder about that, but it's not clear how long the American military can sustain even the present strains of occupying Iraq. Sixteen of the Army's 33 combat brigades are now there and five more are on other foreign assignments. The remaining 12 are needed for rotation in Iraq or standby duty related to North Korea. The Army is considering back-to-back combat tours for the first time since Vietnam.
The reserves are stretched to the breaking point. Some units have been mobilized since shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Last week, tens of thousands of reservists learned that their tours were being extended into next year.
Yet it is hard to see relief. Mr. Rumsfeld places great hope in an Iraqi takeover of security. That would indeed be the best option, but it's tough to imagine that he can quickly orchestrate the leap from what is little more than about 40,000 newly minted policemen to the kind of modern army needed to fight terrorism. And Washington will need to do something about its intelligence to weed out old-regime loyalists and other unreliable elements.
In the shorter run, if Washington softens its stubborn resistance to broader U.N. involvement, peacekeeping troops from countries like Pakistan, India, Turkey and Egypt could be useful. Unfortunately, that shift cannot really get under way until things become a lot less dangerous than they are right now. Besides the American military, the only other forces potent enough to help make that happen are those of some Western European countries. The most optimistic assessment of what the United States could expect from these modest-sized militaries, many of them with commitments elsewhere, is probably about 30,000 additional troops.
The other critical key to an exit strategy is to adopt a faster timetable for restoring Iraqi self-government. That will require the United States, which lacks Middle East experts and Arabic speakers in its policy-making ranks, to win support from Iraq's majority Shiite Muslim population, some of whose leaders have already denounced Mr. Bush's democratization vision. Washington must do so without alienating the minority Sunni Muslims, who represent a major security threat to the occupation forces. To accomplish this delicate feat, the administration should consider working quietly with Iraq's neighbors, like Iran and Syria.
Finally, getting help with the huge cost of rebuilding Iraq will mean sharing lucrative reconstruction and oil contracts with foreign companies, even though that means less of the pie for well-connected American companies, like Halliburton, once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.
One wild card is that while administration officials like to refer to the "post-Saddam era," Saddam Hussein apparently is still alive and still a political threat. Capturing or killing Mr. Hussein would be a major victory for the president. But we hope that he would not use it as a distraction from the bigger picture. The American people will face up to their responsibilities not to leave Iraq a broken and dangerous mess, but only if Mr. Bush presents a workable plan, with its full financial and human costs honestly acknowledged.

HEADLINE: The World: Over There; 
Trying to Figure Out When to Say It's Over

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AS Americans became accustomed to wars with murky outcomes over the last half-century, they also became used to asking, "How do we know when we've won?" Their second question was usually "When can we all go home?"
 The Bush administration tried to fast-forward past such questions last week, as its critics used its call for an additional $87 billion for Iraq to demand specific answers. Inside the White House, as a senior administration official put it, the current question is "When can we make this look more like Bosnia or Kosovo?" 
 Those are places where American troops do not make up a majority of forces on the ground, and where peacekeepers operate without excessive concern that their Humvees or the United Nations headquarters will be blown up. They are also places where problems with the daily reconstruction is boring enough to stay off the evening news. 
The message in President Bush's two major speeches last week -- on Sunday night from the White House and in Quantico, Va., on the eve of the Sept. 11 anniversary -- was that Americans shouldn't expect that moment in Iraq anytime soon.
A few months ago, White House officials were scoffing at comparisons between the occupation of Iraq and the lengthy post-World War II occupations of Japan and Germany a half-century ago. But last week, both President Bush and his defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, were invoking those successful experiments in nation-building as they counseled patience.
"We committed years and resources to this cause," Mr. Bush said of the postwar rebuilding. "And that effort has been repaid many times over in three generations of friendship and peace."
But for all the bear-any-burden talk, a drive is on to hasten the moment when America may be able to declare victory -- or at least its first stages.
The number of American troops in Iraq fell to 127,000 last week, down roughly 10 percent from a few weeks ago. Meanwhile, the Pentagon and L. Paul Bremer, the American administrator, envision Iraqi security forces totaling 186,000 by 2005. They already count 46,000 Iraqi police now on the job, heading toward a goal of 65,000 or 75,000. They want a new Iraqi Army of 40,000 (right now 1,000 are being trained) and 15,000 members of a civilian defense corps, though they acknowledge it could take five or six years to get there. They also want 3,700 border guards, twice the current number. And for every one of those Iraqis who step into the street or the desert, some American is supposed to be going home.
Meanwhile, the race is on to rebuild the decrepit oil industry, so that the dream the administration dangled a few months ago -- a country that could generate $100 billion a year -- might come true. Next year, Iraq will be lucky to pump $10 billion worth, and progress depends on preventing terror groups from blowing up wells and pipelines.
At least that is the hope. But even as the the aggressive goals are set, the president seems caught between two strains of thought in his administration that define a complete victory in Iraq very differently.
Publicly, Mr. Bush has said he plans for Iraq to radiate democracy in a way that will transform the whole Middle East from a cradle of strife and terror.
But that is a task that will take "a generation," his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, acknowledges. This suggests a long-term presence, like the one that has kept tens of thousands of American troops in South Korea for half a century, but Ms. Rice and others insist that once the current stage has ended, the remaining American force can be light, mobile and smaller.
The other approach, recommended by conservatives who oppose using the military for nation-building, and by some Democrats running for president, is to keep the American role limited: having ousted the bad guy, they say, the task is to stabilize Iraq and get out. Democracy? It would be nice, they add, but you can count the Jeffersonians in Baghdad on one hand. Reconstruction? Washington will help, but George Marshall doesn't work here anymore.
Mr. Rumsfeld appeared to give voice to that view while answering reporters' questions last week. "I don't believe it's our job to reconstruct the country," he said, words that may be thrown back at him as Congress begins hearings on the administration's request for $13 billion to do exactly that -- from getting the electricity back to establishing a financially credible central bank. 
"The Iraqi people will have to reconstruct that country over a period of time," Mr. Rumsfeld added. "Our goal is not to create a dependency in Iraq. To the extent you are too heavy a footprint, you don't help them, you hurt them because foreign forces in a country are an anomaly."
These different messages -- "we're there for the long term" versus "we're on a glide path out of town" -- have created confusion. Mr. Bush made it sound on Sunday like an open-ended commitment. Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Bremer and, in closed-door meetings, Vice President Dick Cheney sound as if they want to speed the pace of exit. "I'm anxious about it," said John Hamre, a deputy secretary of defense under Bill Clinton who led a survey group to Iraq for Mr. Rumsfeld this summer. 
"The president committed himself the other night to a serious effort that will take years," said Mr. Hamre, now the president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies here. "That was a brave thing to do. But then I hear others changing the yardsticks, saying that what we need to do is just bring the economy back to its prewar levels, or to set up the structure for an Iraqi political process" -- a goal different from getting a working democracy and government in place. 
Even if the Iraqis can police the country and keep mines off the roads, will they be equal to dealing with the Qaeda and Hezbollah members who have infiltrated Iraq? That has been a problem in Afghanistan, where the Taliban are creeping back. "How can you make this 'the central front' in the war on terrorism while you are pulling back?" Mr. Hamre asked.
The pace of troop withdrawal will be driven largely by the security situation. And it is that situation that the administration misjudged. A high-ranking official said early this month that planners before the war envisioned Iraqi soldiers surrendering in units. "We'd strip them of their heavy armor, give them back their rifles and put them out on the street as a security force," he said.
It didn't happen that way. The troops melted away, and some dug up mobile grenade launchers and used them. "Guerrilla war wasn't in the plan," another administration official, angry at Mr. Rumsfeld, said.
Two years ago, Mr. Bush dreamed of devising exit strategies for American forces from Bosnia and Kosovo. He had to give that up, and he knows that in Iraq, even more so, there is no turning back. 
A year ago, a top State Department official, Richard Haass, who left the administration two months ago, warned that the war on terrorism offers no easy exit. "What we need," he said, "is an endurance strategy."

This is how bad things are for George W. Bush: He's back in a dead heat with Al Gore.
 (And this is how bad things are for Al Gore: He's back in a dead heat with George W. Bush.) 
 One terrorist attack, two wars, three tax cuts, four months of guerrilla mayhem in Iraq, five silly colors on a terror alert chart, nine nattering Democratic candidates, 10 Iraqi cops killed by Americans, $87 billion in Pentagon illusions, a gazillion boastful Osama tapes, zero Saddam and zilch W.M.D. have left America split evenly between the president and former vice president.
"More than two and a half years after the 2000 election and we are back where we started," marveled John Zogby, who conducted the poll. 
It's plus ca change all over again. We are learning once more, as we did on 9/11, that all the fantastic technology in the world will not save us. The undigitalized human will is able to frustrate our most elaborate schemes and lofty policies.
What unleashed Shock and Awe and the most extravagant display of American military prowess ever was a bunch of theologically deranged Arabs with box cutters.
The Bush administration thought it could use scientific superiority to impose its will on alien tribal cultures. But we're spending hundreds of billions subduing two backward countries without subduing them.
After the president celebrated victory in our high-tech war in Iraq, our enemies came back to rattle us with a diabolically ingenious low-tech war, a homemade bomb in a truck obliterating the U.N. offices, and improvised explosive devices hidden in soda cans, plastic bags and dead animals blowing up our soldiers. Afghanistan has mirror chaos, with reconstruction sabotaged by Taliban assaults on American forces, the Afghan police and aid workers.
The Pentagon blithely says that we have 56,000 Iraqi police and security officers and that we will soon have more. But it may be hard to keep and recruit Iraqi cops; the job pays O.K. but it might end very suddenly, given the rate at which Americans and guerrillas are mowing them down.
"This shows the Americans are completely out of control," First Lt. Mazen Hamid, an Iraqi policeman, said Friday after angry demonstrators gathered in Falluja to demand the victims' bodies.
Secretary Pangloss at Defense and Wolfie the Naif are terminally enchanted by their own descriptions of the world. They know how to use their minds, but it's not clear they know how to use their eyes.
"They are like people in Plato's cave," observed one military analyst. "They've been staring at the shadows on the wall for so long, they think they're forms."
Our high-tech impotence is making our low-tech colony sullen.
"It's 125 degrees there and they have no electricity and no water and it doesn't make for a very happy population," said Senator John McCain, who recently toured Iraq. "We're in a race to provide the services and security for people so the Iraqis will support us rather than turn against us. It's up for grabs."
Senator McCain says that "the bad guys" are reminding Iraqis that America "propped up Saddam Hussein in the 80's, sided with Iraq in the Iraq-Iran war, told the people in Basra in '91 we'd help them get rid of Saddam and didn't, and put economic sanctions on them in the 90's."
He says we have to woo them, even though we are pouring $87 billion -- double the amount designated for homeland security -- into the Iraqi infrastructure when our own electrical grid, and port and airport security, need upgrading.
"If anyone thinks the French and Germans are going to help us readily and rapidly," he says, "they're smoking something very strong."
Mocking all our high-priced, know-nothing intelligence, Osama is back in the studio making his rock videos.
The cadaverous caveman has gone more primitive to avoid electronic detection, operating via notes passed by couriers.
We haven't forgotten all Mr. Bush's bullhorn, dead-or-alive pledges.
But he's like a kid singing with fingers in his ears, avoiding mentioning Saddam or bin Laden, or pressing the Pakistanis who must be protecting Osama up in no man's land and letting the Taliban reconstitute (even though we bribed Pakistan with a billion in aid). He doesn't dwell on nailing Saddam either.
His gunsmoke has gone up in smoke.

HEADLINE: Dizzying Dive to Red Ink Poses Stark Choices for Washington 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
When President Bush informed the nation last Sunday night that remaining in Iraq next year will cost another $87 billion, many of those who will actually pay that bill were unable to watch. They had already been put to bed by their parents.
 Administration officials acknowledged the next day that every dollar of that cost will be borrowed, a loan that economists say will be repaid by the next generation of taxpayers and the generation after that. The $166 billion cost of the work so far in Iraq and Afghanistan, which has stunned many in Washington, will be added to what was already the largest budget deficit the nation has ever known. 
 With a force that has surprised even critics of the administration, the Iraqi occupation has pushed to the forefront a budget deficit that had previously existed mostly as an abstract red stain on Democratic bar charts. With no extra money available for the foreseeable future, real choices are being illuminated on Capitol Hill -- choices between electronic bombs and electrical grids, between low taxes now and lower retirement payments later. 
Should Washington reconstruct Iraq's schools and hospitals, lawmakers are asking, or America's? Should it pay for more than 100,000 American troops to stay in Iraq, or for 40 million seniors to be offered prescription drugs through Medicare? And if it tries to do it all, should it keep cutting taxes?
The Bush administration says it can do all of the above, once the tax cuts inaugurate a burst of economic growth. Democrats and virtually every mainstream economist say that something will have to give, very possibly the government's retirement promises to millions of aging baby boomers.
These questions have emerged as the most fundamental political issue dividing the two parties, affecting almost every vote on Capitol Hill and every speech in the current presidential campaign. The deficit, once confined to Congressional committee rooms and Washington research organizations, has become a constant refrain among all the Democratic candidates, who use it to attack the administration's tax cuts and financial stewardship. (None, however, have proposed a cutback in spending or a serious rethinking of big-ticket entitlement programs.)
The bleak choices now facing politicians and policy makers were hard to imagine when George W. Bush was inaugurated just 32 months ago, before the drastic turnabout of the federal budget. As the decade opened, the overheated economy of the 1990's had left the government with a flush of cash that seemed never-ending. There were 281 billion extra dollars in the budget that year, and the Bush administration, looking a decade ahead, predicted that a cumulative $5.6 trillion surplus would build up by 2011.
It seemed to be the brink of a golden era for Washington, "an unprecedented moment in history," in the words of the administration's first budget plan, issued a month after Mr. Bush was inaugurated. He vowed that almost all the national debt would be paid off and that retirement and health plans would be strengthened for the future by setting aside trillions in savings. Balanced budgets, so long in arriving, seemed to promise an end to wasteful interest payments and years of arguments pitting military spending against domestic programs.
And then, within months, the glittering promises crumbled. The budget was upended by what economists now say were three independent forces gathering in power at once: a steep economic decline, a political consensus to slash taxes and the effects of the 2001 terrorist attacks. The surplus disappeared, replaced the next year with a budget deficit that has since grown to a record size. The $5.6 trillion surplus once predicted for the 10 years ending in 2011 is now a $2.3 trillion cumulative deficit under the best-case prediction issued by the Congressional Budget Office two weeks ago.
The $8 trillion difference between those numbers has little precedent in American history. The long-term budget forecast has declined as much in the last two years as the total revenue collected by the United States government from 1789 to 1983.

A Fall Worthy of Milton
"It really has been a Miltonian experience, from the heights to the depths," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, invoking "Paradise Lost" as a metaphor for the budget's fall.
The current fiscal year, which ends this month, was supposed to have ended with a surplus of $353 billion, the Congressional Budget Office predicted two years ago; today, the office says the year will end in a $401 billion deficit. Next year's deficit was projected to be $480 billion, but the new Iraq spending will bring that to $540 billion or higher -- close to the 5 percent of the gross domestic product that many experts warn is a serious danger zone for the economy.
And now the painful effects of the budget's free fall are beginning to emerge. Though the deficit hardly spells ruin for the federal government, it already means spending battles over a variety of popular nonmilitary programs, from education to space flight to veterans hospitals. To make room for the initiatives the administration favors -- like $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and at least $100 billion in new defense spending -- other programs are being squeezed more tightly than they have been in years.
Disputes have broken out in Congress this year on spending items that used to be routine, like construction of housing for military families, which the administration proposed cutting by 6 percent. The administration invoked the deficit earlier this year in explaining the size of its proposed 2004 budget for the Environmental Protection Agency, which was 5.5 percent less than this year's spending. (Congress is likely to restore some of those funds.) And next year's budget could fall short of paying for more than 100,000 housing vouchers now used by low-income families, said a study by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities; it would be the first time in 30 years that existing vouchers were not renewed.
The pressure is likely to get worse, particularly if the occupation of Iraq continues to consume $4 billion a month. Joshua Bolten, the White House budget director, said in a recent interview that this coming year's 4 percent increase in discretionary spending might well be reduced below 4 percent in 2005, which would be far below the average recent increase for programs that are not entitlements. Congressional Republicans deny the Democratic charge that the deficit was deliberately created to shrink government, but nonetheless acknowledge that it will be a useful tool to achieve that goal.
"There's no question that annual federal deficits have been the only effective check on Congressional spending in the modern era," said Representative Mike Pence, an Indiana Republican and a member of a conservative House caucus pushing for big cuts in spending. "There's been a lot more willingness on the part of our appropriators to exercise discipline in the last eight months than in the previous Congress. It doesn't justify all that red ink, but it's kind of a silver lining in that cloud."
Mr. Pence was referring to cuts in existing programs, but both the administration and the Democrats have proposed dozens of new spending items, from the occupation of Iraq to combating AIDS in Africa to improved domestic security. For the foreseeable future, every major new program now under debate in Congress, including a $400 billion prescription drug benefit for the elderly sought by both parties, will be paid for with borrowed money.
There is no sign yet, however, that either overall spending or tax cutting is changing course. The conservative Cato Institute noted tartly last month that Mr. Bush had never vetoed a spending bill, had advocated huge farm and Medicare programs and had presided over double-digit increases in spending each year of his term. Barely a month goes by when House Republican leaders do not propose a new form of tax cut, and Congressional Republicans join the administration in saying they fully intend to extend the tax cuts that are now scheduled to expire in 2005, which would add another $1.6 trillion to the cumulative deficit by 2013.
This course prompted the Congressional Budget Office to issue an unusual warning in its forecast last month: If Congressional Republicans and the administration get their wish and extend all the tax cuts now scheduled to expire, and if they pass a limited prescription drug benefit for Medicare and keep spending at its current level, the deficit by 2013 will have built up to $6.2 trillion. Once the baby boomers begin retiring at the end of this decade, the office said, that course will lead either to drastically higher taxes, severe spending cuts or "unsustainable levels of debt."
The long-term effect of the budget's imbalance was the reason the deficit was the leading concern in a survey of economists last month by the National Association for Business Economics, topping even unemployment. Deficits can be useful in stimulating a lethargic economy, but if they persist for years, they could push up interest rates and impose huge costs on Social Security and Medicare at precisely the moment that the baby boom generation will begin expecting its retirement benefits. The Committee for Economic Development, a group of business executives, warned earlier this year that persistent deficits could lead, for the first time in the nation's history, to a lower living standard for future generations.

A Surplus Smaller Than It Seemed
Economists in and out of government have begun studying the budget's plunge as a significant phenomenon in financial history, and reject the partisan contentions in Washington that the deficit can be blamed on any single factor, like the tax cuts or the 9/11 attacks. The biggest reason for this year's deficit, they say, has been the recession, while the tax cuts and military-related spending will have a much greater effect on the long-term deficit. Tax cuts alone will grow from 26 percent to 44 percent of the decline in 2011, according to the Brookings-Urban Tax Policy Center. What has been remarkable, economists say, is that all three forces combined at once beginning in 2001 to utterly change the government's financial outlook.
"It really was the perfect fiscal storm," said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, an analytical company in St. Louis that developed the economic model of the country in use by many government agencies, including the Treasury Department. "So many different things all seemed to happen at once."
The initial problem, several economists said, was that the surplus was never as large as it seemed. The economy of the late 1990's was operating beyond its capacity, Mr. Prakken said, and the stock market boom generated so much quick wealth at the highest levels that the resulting tax revenues were bound to return to earth.
"The reality of the surplus projections was never really as good as it looked," Mr. Prakken said. "Because the surplus was essentially ephemeral, it declined at a much faster rate than the economy did, really breathtaking in its reversal."
It was essentially a forecasting error, parallel to the "irrational exuberance" that Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan saw among investors during the 1990's. Mr. Reischauer said that even the Congressional Budget Office did not appreciate how much of its forecast was based on unrealistic expectations; in fact the legal constraints on the office have occasionally led to projections that were far from their mark. But before the mirage disappeared and the downward direction of the economy was clear, a consensus developed in Washington that the surplus justified a major change in tax policy.
Mr. Bush had campaigned on the promise of returning the surplus in the form of a big tax cut, and Democrats disagreed only on the size and distribution of the cut, preferring to direct more to middle-class taxpayers. (Democrats proposed a tax cut of $750 billion that year.) The budget had been balanced in the late 1990's using a combination of spending controls and higher taxes on the wealthy. But by 2001, the controls had expired and seemed unnecessary. Mr. Bush's election, giving Republicans control of both Congress and the White House, broke a stalemate that had long prevented the adoption of major tax legislation.
"Once the gridlock was broken, it was hard when staring at the surplus to argue that there shouldn't be a tax cut," said Mr. Reischauer, now president of the Urban Institute. "Of course there was debate about who should get what share of it. But because there seemed so much certainty about the persistence of these surpluses, there wasn't a proper caution that would have led lawmakers to say, 'We don't know what the situation will be in the next downturn, we don't know the priorities of future Congresses, so we should not have a set of tax cuts that phase in over a 10-year period.' "
Mr. Bolten, previously the president's deputy chief of staff, challenged the notion that the administration had been hypnotized by the surplus numbers. He said the White House was aware of the economy's direction at the time of the first tax cut, and intended it in part as a brake against further decline.
"The concept of an insurance policy was very much on the president's mind at that point," Mr. Bolten said. "And it turns out to have been one of the best, if not the best, timed tax cuts ever."
But by the summer of 2001, the economic slide was too swift to be stopped by a tax cut that would take years to become fully effective. In August of that year, after the $1.35 trillion tax cut passed, the Congressional Budget Office revised its estimate of the cumulative surplus to $3.4 trillion from the $5.6 trillion forecast in January.

The Ramifications of 9/11
A month later, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked, and the budget outlook worsened. The attack not only exacerbated the downturn, but it also brought heavy increases in domestic security spending, and eventually led to costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The budget office estimated that another $300 billion in military spending would result (long before Iraq entered the picture), and by January 2002 had taken its projection of long-term surplus down to $1.6 trillion.
It was clear by then that the 2003 budget would be in deficit, although the full amount was not known until just a few weeks ago, after the passage of two more tax cuts: a $30 billion cut in 2002 and a $350 billion cut in May of this year. The most recent cut was made in full knowledge that the nation was looking ahead to several more years of deficits, and it was that cut that brought the loudest criticisms.
"Once it was clear that the confident predictions had blown up and the picture was frightening, they still refused to step on the brakes," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "Instead, the administration pushed the accelerator down closer to the floor. It's flabbergasting."
Mr. Bolten, however, said concern about the deficit was secondary to reviving the economy.
"I think we were always aware of what the budget projections were," he said. "But in hindsight, I would not have argued that we should have done something different, and I don't think any of the economic advisers would. The priority was properly placed on getting the economy back to growth. And if that meant larger deficits in the short run, well, if there was ever a time to run deficits, this is it."
He argued that the current-year deficit was still reasonable by historical standards as a percentage of the nation's economy, and said the administration believed the long-term deficit would be cut in half in five years. President Bush said the same thing a few days ago, saying that goal could be achieved "if Congress holds the line on discretionary spending."
It is hard to find an independent economist who agrees with that optimistic forecast, barring a nearly miraculous return to extremely high growth or draconian cuts in spending. Economists at the Wall Street firm of Goldman Sachs, for example, have said all year that their forecast was far gloomier than the administration's, and issued a statement last month saying the new numbers confirmed their warnings.
The numbers make it hard to see how Mr. Bush's goal can be reconciled with his intention of extending the tax cuts when they expire. The deficit could be cut in half by 2006 if the tax cuts expire on their current schedule and spending is held to an average increase of 2.7 percent a year -- far below its current level of increase -- numbers in the budget office's forecast say. But if the tax cuts are extended, even assuming that low level of spending increase, the deficit would not be cut in half until 2012, by which time the nation would have accumulated more than $3 trillion in new debt.
When Mr. Bush's political spending priorities, like the Medicare drug benefit, are added to the tax cuts, the deficit is extended even further. For that reason, many conservatives are beginning to bridle at the administration's proposals. As the conservative Heritage Foundation recently put it in arguing against the drug benefit, "In the future, as lawmakers examine the need to extend those tax cuts and make them permanent, they will be haunted by budget projections showing an enormous expansion in Medicare spending."
The conservatives, of course, are arguing against expanded government spending because it might endanger the future of the tax cuts. The liberals are arguing the reverse. Both sides, however, are in rare agreement with the economists that their two goals cannot be pursued at once, without resorting to borrowing that will make life in America a very different experience for generations to come.

HEADLINE: TWO YEARS LATER: THE ARAB CONNECTION; 
SAUDIS PROMISING ACTION ON TERROR

BYLINE:  By DON VAN NATTA Jr. with TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Last month four senior American government officials traveled to Saudi Arabia to revisit the troubled topic of the desert kingdom's antiterrorism efforts. Unsure of what to expect, the American delegation was pleasantly surprised when a pro forma appointment with Crown Prince Abdullah went on for more than two hours.
 During the trip the Saudis also committed themselves to carrying out a series of measures to combat terrorism, United States law enforcement and intelligence officials said. Among the actions, Saudi officials said, were a ban on cash contributions in local mosques and the removal of donation boxes for charities from shopping malls. American officials believe that Saudi mosques and charitable organizations are crucial pipelines for terrorist financing. 
 The agreement signified unusual progress in the often tense and frustrating relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia since 9/11. The Saudi government did not allow American law enforcement officials to interview the families of the 9/11 hijackers in Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the attacks, and were so forceful in their refusals that American officials said this week that they simply gave up trying. 
One senior law enforcement official said efforts to seek interviews with the 9/11 hijackers' families had more recently "fallen through the cracks" in Washington. But he said that in the new openness between Saudi Arabia and the United States, augured by the August meetings, American officials might broach the issue again. Another American official in the Middle East said the Saudis offered limited cooperation by obtaining DNA samples from family members of some of the hijackers and turning them over to Americans to help in identifying the hijackers' remains.
Also, the Saudis were scheduled to have their procedures to combat money laundering reviewed by an international monitoring group this month. But they asked that the review be postponed, a United States official said. Such lapses cause some veteran observers of Saudi Arabia to maintain reservations about the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts.
"I think the Saudi Arabian government's record, as far as dealing with terrorism, is mixed," said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which will hold hearings on terrorist financing later this month. "Since they were attacked on their own soil in May, they have acted more aggressively. But if the past is any indication, I think they hope the terrorists will go away. And, at the end of the day, that doesn't wash."
Adel al-Jubeir, the foreign affairs adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah, said that Al Qaeda's two main targets were the United States and Saudi Arabia, and that the two nations had forged a working relationship to address the threat. "The cooperation between our two countries is unprecedented," he said. "We are both in the same boat. Working together is not a luxury; it is a necessity."
On Monday, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow begins a 10-day visit through the Middle East and Central Asia to discuss terrorist financing and economic development issues with regional leaders, including Crown Prince Abdullah. While in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Snow is expected to discuss the country's efforts to thwart terrorist financing. He will also ask Saudi Arabia to help pay for the reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, requests that some analysts say may be incompatible. 
"You have to be very careful what you ask for from the Saudis because if you have a list of more than one item you frequently don't get to the second," said Lee Wolosky, a former official with the National Security Council in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. Saudi officials in Riyadh say they have done everything that the Americans have asked them to do. They complain that bureaucratic hurdles have slowed their efforts to crack down on terrorism.
For many months after 9/11, the Saudi government was slow to respond to signs of growing terrorist activity in the country. But the Saudi royal family was shaken by a triple bombing against American targets in Riyadh, the capital, on May 12, United States and Saudi officials said. Since then the Saudis have moved more vigorously to capture terrorists inside the kingdom and have been more cooperative with American counterterrorism investigators, the officials said. 
At the August meetings, which included officials from the National Security Council, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State and Treasury Departments, the Saudis agreed to allow the permanent deployment of more than a dozen F.B.I. and Internal Revenue Service agents in the kingdom as part of a joint terrorism task force with Saudi law enforcement officials. The task force was created in May and works at an undisclosed location in Riyadh.
"The idea was to say we need to have a vision of what are our shared objectives in the war on terrorist financing," said one senior Bush administration official involved in the meeting. "There was complete and total agreement that there is more that needs to be done."
Saudi Arabia has drawn intense scrutiny in the fight against terrorism because 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 attacks were Saudis, and Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, is a member of one of the kingdom's wealthiest families.
Since May the Saudis have broken up six to eight Qaeda cells operating within the country, including several in the past few weeks, Saudi and American officials said. They also made renewed efforts to cooperate with Russia against terrorism. The Russians have long suspected the Saudis of financing Muslim separatists in Chechnya. Last week, Crown Prince Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, traveled to Russia for talks that included terrorism as well as oil and trade agreements. It was the first visit by a Saudi leader to Moscow in 75 years.
In the discussions with their American counterparts, Saudi law enforcement officials said they would try to channel monetary donations away from mosques into more regulated entities that would allow the Saudi authorities to keep a closer eye on the source and destination of such money. All Muslims are expected to contribute a portion of their income to charities, a practice known as zakat. The Saudi government has not yet announced any specific measures, and in practice officials on both sides acknowledge that policing donations at mosques may prove daunting, akin to forbidding churchgoers in the United States from making donations at Sunday services. 
Since May, the Saudis have acknowledged that their terrorist problems are far worse and more difficult to combat than they had imagined, American officials said.
Only weeks after the May bombings in Riyadh, Saudi security forces cornered a senior Qaeda operative suspected of orchestrating the attacks and fatally shot him as he tried to flee in his car on a Riyadh street. The retribution visited upon the suspect, Yousif Salih Fahad al-Ayeeri, known by a nom de guerre translated by the Saudis as Swift Sword, was hailed in Saudi Arabia as a significant blow to the Qaeda network in the country and proof that the Saudi authorities were willing to bring the war on terrorism home.
But less than a month later, security officials stumbled upon enormous caches of terrorist weaponry -- 20 tons of explosives and detonators, rocket-propelled grenades and high-powered rifles -- at three different locations. Several senior Saudi officials said the discoveries served to underscore the reality that despite what they believed to be an aggressive crackdown on terrorists, the Saudi royal family faced the prospect that scores of heavily armed Qaeda terrorists were entrenched inside the kingdom and might be plotting further attacks against Saudi targets or members of the royal family themselves.
"It was another shock to the system," said Jamal Khashoggi, a former newspaper editor who is now a senior adviser to the Saudi ambassador in London. "Clearly, the terrorists were planning a big attack inside the kingdom, and they had the weapons and manpower to do it." 
American officials familiar with Saudi Arabia said the recent bombings had a major effect. An American diplomat in the Middle East said they had "fundamentally changed the way Saudis view terrorism and threats and the best way to deal with them." The official said that Saudi citizens were now demanding the arrest, or even elimination, of militant Muslims -- a sea change in a country that has long been hospitable even to radical Islamists.
"They have realized that there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of terrorists inside Saudi Arabia," a senior American official based in the Middle East said.
In addition to the dragnet that ensnared Mr. Ayeeri, the Saudis have arrested more than 200 people since May who the authorities say are connected to Al Qaeda. Last Tuesday, as part of its enhanced effort to track terrorists domestically, the Saudi Interior Ministry asked families with missing sons to report their disappearances to the government. The ministry said the move is a reflection of the government's "concern to protect Saudi citizens against suspect groups who try to drag people into criminal activity."
The Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef, said last month that he believed that Al Qaeda had established training camps inside the kingdom. Saudi security forces have staged regular raids on safe houses and farms all over the kingdom. In several shootouts, at least 16 suspected members of Al Qaeda and 11 Saudi police officers have been killed.
"The populace now says, 'Make us feel safer,' and one of the extraordinary things is the Saudis are now publicizing each arrest, each raid," said the American official based in the Middle East. "Before May 12, they'd arrest guys, then deny publicly that they had arrested them. There was a head stuck in the sand. After each shootout, the public says, 'We want more of it, this is good, finish the job.' "
But American law enforcement and intelligence officials say they still struggle for better cooperation with the Saudis on several issues, especially efforts to stop the cash flow from private Saudi sources to terrorist organizations, including the militant Palestinian group Hamas. 
Saudi officials have told the Americans that they have cut off all government financing of Hamas, and they have offered to cut off private financing of the group, too. 
"They say, 'If you see any businessmen or private individuals giving to Hamas, please let us know,' " another American official said. "Frankly, we don't see any money going to Hamas from private Saudis, nor have we seen the Saudis taking any steps to shut if off -- they don't even have a legal mechanism to shut it off." 
Several American officials said those shortcomings were also evident in how the Saudis handled the capture of Mr. Ayeeri. Although he was believed to be a major conduit of financing for Qaeda operations, the Saudi authorities did not confiscate his financial records, which American officials say were kept in his apartment. 
Critics of the Saudi government say there need to be more high-profile terrorism prosecutions within the kingdom if the Saudis sincerely want to stanch the flow of money to terrorist groups.
"This will require days and weeks and months of consistent focus and urgency of the sort the Saudis expressed immediately after the Riyadh bombings," said William F. Wechsler, who coordinated efforts to curtail terrorist financing as a National Security Council member in the Clinton administration. "It's a problem that has to be worked because it can't be solved overnight. The proof will be in the months and years ahead."

HEADLINE: You're the New Governor. Enjoy Sacramento. 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
Most Fridays, Gov. Gray Davis wraps up his work week and heads far away from here -- 350 miles away, to his West Hollywood condominium. 
 When George Deukmejian, a Republican, was elected governor in 1982 and settled here for two terms with his family, he got a chilly welcome from Democrats in the Legislature. They blocked him from moving into the governor's residence, and he lived in a rented house. 
 Arnold Schwarzenegger says he will commute to the capital from his house in Los Angeles if he is elected governor.
"In Los Angeles many people drive an hour to work every day," he told an Austrian interviewer. "That's about the flight time from Los Angeles to Sacramento."
Sacramento can be an uninviting place for a governor, and the living arrangements are only the start of it.
With the Oct. 7 recall election less than a month away, some veteran politicians and Sacramento insiders are offering this advice to the 135 candidates on the ballot: Be careful what you wish for. It's a nice place to visit, but you might not want to govern here.
Though the campaign is still in full swing, there is a lot of talk about the trouble ahead for whoever is governor as the state continues to struggle with its biggest economic downturn since the early 1990's.
"For any new governor, it is not going to be a cup of tea by any means," said Kenneth L. Khachigian, a Republican strategist who worked for Mr. Deukmejian in the 1980's and more recently for Representative Darrell Issa, one of the recall's early financial backers. "Sacramento is an equal opportunity place of difficulty, whether you are an outsider or an insider."
Perhaps the biggest problem will be one of dashed expectations, said Mark Baldassare, the director of research at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan group that conducts statewide polls.
Whether Mr. Davis wins or loses, he said, there is a general impression among voters that the recall has shaken things up so thoroughly that the state's many problems can only improve. Mr. Baldassare held meetings here last week with focus groups of voters. He said he heard just what he heard last month from groups in Los Angeles: unrealistic optimism.
"People think that the next day things are going to change, that a magic wand will be waved and that things will get better," Mr. Baldassare said. "We know that government doesn't work that quickly, and certainly there is no process to follow for this election."
California is at odds with the Bush administration on a host of issues, including medical marijuana, financial privacy, water policies and air quality standards. The governor would inherit those difficulties, but the state's most immediate and pressing problems are its own.
The budget remains a mess, with billions of dollars in additional cuts or new revenues needed. Thousands of state workers are likely to be laid off before the year's end, further cutting into already depleted state services. The state's unemployment insurance trust fund is nearing insolvency, and for the first time, community colleges and the University of California are limiting enrollment.
The Legislature is so divided along party lines that the governor, Democrat or Republican, could face partisan hostility at every turn. And should there be a new governor, the inertia of the bureaucracy could prevent quick fixes.
About 3,600 state employees are appointed by the governor, and more than 700 of those require Senate confirmation, said Robert J. Waste, a professor of public policy at California State University at Sacramento. Typically, he said, it takes a new governor about eight months to get major appointments in place.
"This time nobody is going to wait around for eight months for a new governor to produce a full cabinet," said Professor Waste, who studied the handover from Gov. Pete Wilson to Mr. Davis in 1998. "The electorate doesn't sound like they are in the mood for any long-term transition."
If Mr. Davis loses, his help will be critical to the next governor in setting up the new administration, said Tim Hodson, director of the Sacramento university's Center for California Studies. 
Even with a smooth handover, said Dr. Hodson, a Democrat who worked for 17 years in the Legislature, a Republican governor -- perhaps Mr. Schwarzenegger or State Senator Tom McClintock, the two highest-profile Republicans -- would find it hard to cut deals with the Democratic-controlled Legislature.
"The Democrats will have a self-interest in not cooperating with a Republican governor in order to make that governor look weak and easily knocked off in 2006," he said.
Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, the top Democrat on the ballot, would face his own set of problems if he became governor, Dr. Hodson said. The Republicans, emboldened by having ousted Mr. Davis, would be unwilling to make big concessions to Mr. Bustamante, whom they would consider vulnerable in 2006.
There are still other potential pitfalls.
An initiative expected to qualify for the March ballot would significantly change the state's chronically flawed budget process. It would lower the requirement for raising taxes, from a two-thirds vote in both houses of the Legislature to a 55 percent threshold.
In the current Legislature, the change would let the Democrats raise taxes to close the budget gap without the votes of Republican lawmakers, who have resisted tax increases, and without extensive concessions to the governor.
This prospect has many Democrats in Sacramento unwilling to consider serious compromises with the Republicans, at least until the initiative's fate becomes clear. 
Another ballot initiative, now in the early stages of signature gathering, would roll back a recent tripling of car license fees, deepening the deficit. Some candidates, including Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. McClintock, said they would repeal the increased fees in any case, hastening the need to find more cuts.
"The places where you can squeeze or trim back have been done," said Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, a nonpartisan group in Sacramento. "The state's supply of smoke and mirrors has largely been exhausted."
But Lou Cannon, whose biography of Ronald Reagan will be published next week, said Mr. Reagan's experience as governor in the 1960's and 70's proved that it was possible to rise above the institutional drags on the office, especially when voters were hungry for change.
"Reagan made a huge series of mistakes," Mr. Cannon said, "and we can now see that most of them didn't amount to the proverbial hill of beans. I don't think it matters so much whether a new guy getsalong with the Legislature. It matters whether he is able to articulate a program."
Mr. Reagan, it should be noted, also had some problems with his Sacramento living arrangements. He moved out of the governor's residence early in his first term after his wife, Nancy, declared it a firetrap.

HEADLINE: Burmese Defy U.S. Demands For Release Of Activist 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
It has been almost four months since the leading Burmese pro-democracy activist, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, was detained by Myanmar's military junta, and diplomats who follow developments in the country from here say it appears unlikely that she will be given her freedom any time soon.
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi does not appear to be on a hunger strike, as American officials had said earlier this month, but her condition is still in question, diplomats said. No outsider except a representative of the International Red Cross has seen her in more than three months. 
 The most optimistic view of the situation, one Western ambassador said, is that in response to the international pressure, the junta would release Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to house arrest. That could happen within the next couple of weeks, but even if that were to occur, he said, she would not be allowed to engage in political activity.
In interviews this week, diplomats from several countries also dismissed the junta's announcement two weeks ago of a so-called road map to democracy for Myanmar, formerly Burma. One diplomat noted that it is basically a rehash of promises made previously by the junta, which seized power after crushing a peaceful popular uprising in 1988.
The United States has taken the lead in demanding that the junta release Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, with strong public statements and tough economic sanctions. The lack of any concrete results reveals the limits of United States influence there, American officials acknowledge.
China is the key to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's freedom, diplomats from several countries said, but it has shown no inclination to put pressure on the junta, a reliable ally. Gen. Khin Nyunt, who became prime minister of Myanmar last month in a government reshuffling, commended the Chinese leadership back in 1989 for the crackdown on the students at Tiananmen Square.
Chinese officials have said that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's detention is a domestic matter for the Burmese to sort out. Last month, China made a $200 million loan to the Myanmar junta to buy Chinese goods, including military equipment. 
The United States would also like to see Thailand, Myanmar's neighbor, be more aggressive in pushing for Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's release and for democracy there. But Thai generals and businessmen have carried on financially profitable dealings with the junta over the years, and the Thai government has been cautious in its public remarks.
"We've expressed concern that she be released as soon as possible," said Sihasak Phuangketkeow, spokesman for the Thai Foreign Ministry. "But we have to be realistic. We are neighbors. The United States is far away."
Mr. Sihasak said that Thailand had encouraged the junta to develop a road map to democracy, and that it should be seen as a positive step.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy, has been under detention in one form or another for the last 14 years. During her absence from the public view, her popularity grew rather than faded, contrary to the junta's hopes. 
That became apparent after she was released from house arrest in early 2002, and was eventually allowed to travel outside the capital for political rallies. The outpouring of support surprised most foreign analysts, perhaps reflecting the popular resentment of military rule. 
During a political tour in the northern part of the country in May, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters were set upon by a gang wielding rocks, slingshots and nail-studded clubs.
The junta denied any connection to the mob and said that only a few people had been killed. American officials said that although the exact number was not known, close to 100 people had died, and that there was no way the mob could not have been controlled by the junta, in a country where the military controls everything. 
"It was horrific," an American diplomat said of the attack, on May 30. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi narrowly escaped death or serious injury, and the generals quickly imprisoned her, calling it "protective custody." 
In response, the Bush administration supported and Congress passed economic sanctions that are the toughest imposed on a country since the penalties against Cuba, American diplomats said. 
The sanctions freeze the Myanmar government's assets in the United States, deny visas to Burmese officials and ban imports of the country's goods.
It is too early to know what effect the sanctions will have, but it is the ban on imports that is likely to hurt most. Finished textile goods, made by poorly paid workers, are a major Burmese export to the United States.
The government has said that 300,000 women will lose their jobs in textile plants because of the sanctions. The number is probably closer to 100,000, foreign analysts say, and the junta has already reduced the country's economy to ruin.
It is not clear what caused the State Department to assert two weeks ago that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was on a hunger strike, a claim it had to retract in the face of the Red Cross statement. Some diplomats and analysts think it may have been a calculated ploy by the Bush administration to force the junta to give the Red Cross access to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, which had been denied.

HEADLINE: L.I.@WORK; 
It Was Northrop Grumman's Party All the Way

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
STANDING in front of a Northrop Grumman building in Bethpage on Monday, surrounded by military aircraft on display, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton proclaimed the company's "unparalleled contribution" to defense and the economy. Executives talked about plans to hire a thousand more engineers. Politicians wore pleased expressions and discussed the ripple effects of Northrop Grumman's prosperity.
 Yogi Berra would say it was deju vu all over again. After more than a decade of contraction, the Northrop Grumman Corporation is back. Largely on the strength of a $1.9 billion defense contract announced last month, the company seems poised to reclaim its once-dominant role in Long Island business circles and civic life. 
 All of this history was in the air Monday, but not spoken of directly, as the company held what it called its first Technology Day. Although most of the crowd dispersed after Senator Clinton departed, those who remained toured a Technology Tent, checked out aircraft instrumentation and armored vehicles and attended panels intended to address different technology trends.
 Oddly, for an event intended as a convocation of technology leaders, it seemed primarily a showcase for Northrop Grumman. The Technology Tent, which included emergency-response simulations and night-vision video surveillance programs, a cyberwarfare center and various military planes, all open for inspection, was entirely a Northrop Grumman affair.
 Philip A. Teel, the sector vice president for Northrop Grumman's airborne early warning and electronic warfare systems and its ranking executive on Long Island, said the composition of the displays reflected not a desire to showcase the company's own products, but rather an unfamiliarity with what other local companies were producing. But that seemed a bit odd, given Northrop Grumman's stated intent to stimulate and lead a cooperative regional effort. 
 "This is the first Technology Day, and we didn't know where to begin," Mr. Teel said. "It would have been difficult to figure out which set of partners on the Island to select. Next year, we'll probably do that."
 Northrop Grumman's local resurgence largely reflects the expansion of federal spending on military and homeland security contracts in the wake of Sept. 11. More than in past decades, when its profits came primarily from developing andbuilding military aircraft, today Northrop Grumman is focused on information technology. Most of its customers are still government agencies. 
 The company's traditional manufacturing niche on Long Island "is pretty much gone now," Senator Clinton said in a telephone interview Tuesday. 
 "Northrop Grumman has become a high-tech company that deals with advanced weapons systems," she added. "I think it's a tremendously positive development for other Long Island companies," which she called "potential suppliers."
 The panel discussions, which were organized by several prominent business leaders, offered more of a bird's-eye view of regional investment, ongoing research and development and the early stages of capital planning. The panels were lead by Robert B. James, an associate director of Brookhaven National Laboratory; Peter Goldsmith, the president of the Long Island Software and Technology Network and a one-time Grumman employee; Yacov Shamash, the dean of the graduate engineering program at State University's Stony Brook campus; and Ken Morelly, the president of the Long Island Forum for Technology.
 The panels seemed to underscore Northrop Grumman's intent to reclaim its erstwhile role as local economic leader and galvanizer. As such, they were a success, Mr. Teel said. As he put it: "We really did want to highlight the issues in technology on Long Island and to get the technology leaders together with the participation of senior elected officials." 
 There was little mention throughout the day of the recent past, when Northrop Grumman's Long Island operation relinquished its leadership hold. But for many Long Islanders, that period was a transformative time. Grumman's merger with Northrop in 1994 and the subsequent employment cutbacks shocked Long Island into a broadly supported effort to wean itself from dependence on defense spending and to diversify its economy.
 As Northrop Grumman's presence on Long Island waned, market-oriented companies like Computer Associates and Symbol Technologies expanded. These newer companies, entrepreneurial in spirit and focused on private-sector clients -- in many ways the converse of the old Grumman culture -- filled the vacuum. Their executives joined the boards of new trade and professional organizations that sprung up and supported their programs. 
 Northrop Grumman officials and their handpicked guests did not mention this transformation on Monday. Although two of the day's stated purposes were to spur dialogue among Long Island's technology leaders and to promote the region as an engineering mecca, neither Computer Associates nor Symbol Technologies were represented on the panels, two startling omissions. Mr. Teel said that executives from both companies had been invited but could not attend. 
 The Long Island Association, the region's largest business organization, was invited, but its president, Matthew T. Crosson, did not attend, said John A. Vosilla, a Northrop Grumman spokesman. Neither the Hauppauge Industrial Association nor the Regional Business Partnership, the region's other ranking business organizations, made the guest list.
 In all, Northrop Grumman sent out 419 invitations, more than a quarter of which went to its own employees. Mr. Vosilla said about 170 people had confirmed that they would attend, but he did not know how many people actually showed up.
 The guest list was heavy with prominent names from the defense contracting era, rounded out by administrators and representatives from government-financed institutions, including several State University campuses and research institutions like the Brookhaven laboratory.
 Mr. Teel said he invited senior executives and administrators from those companies and institutions with which he was familiar. Most of the companies were in the aeronautics and defense sector. Six executives from BAE Systems were invited, three from Dayton T. Brown and four each from EDO and Telephonics.
 The old economy slant of the guest list did not diminish the significance of the event, said Mr. Goldsmith, the LISTnet president. "Throughout Long Island, you have people working on similar but complementary projects who aren't aware of each other," he said.
 Monday's program, he added, "helped people exchange information and allowed these institutions to start working together."
 Arthur Rossoff, a founder of the Long Island Museum of Science and Technology, called the event a success. "I didn't see this as a technical meeting," he said. "It was intended to energize the industrial high-tech community, to impress the representatives from Congress and to identify Northrop Grumman as a business leader of the community. I think it accomplished all of those things rather well."

PERSON: Frank L. O'Bannon 

HEADLINE: Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon, 73, Dies; Had a Folksy Touch 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Frank L. O'Bannon, a folksy Democrat serving his second term as governor of Indiana, died yesterday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 73.
 The cause was a stroke, which he had suffered last week in a hotel room in Chicago, where he had been attending a conference on Japanese-American trade, his office said. 
 A Democrat, Mr. O'Bannon favored the death penalty and wanted stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments installed on the state Capitol grounds, a plan that was blocked by a federal judge in 2000. 
His political career began in 1970, when he succeeded his father in the State Senate. He represented his hometown of Corydon, in southern Indiana, for 18 years, 11 as the Democratic floor leader.
He was elected lieutenant governor on a ticket with Evan Bayh in 1988. He ran for governor in 1996, when Mr. Bayh, barred by Indiana law from serving more than two four-year terms, was stepping down. Mr. O'Bannon defeated Stephen Goldsmith, the mayor of Indianapolis at the time, by 4 percentage points.
When Mr. O'Bannon was sworn in, the economy was strong, and Indiana had amassed a $2 billion surplus. He oversaw a plan that cut taxes by $1 billion while providing more money for schools and universities.
He was popular for his down-to-earth streak: among other things, he invited all of the state's fourth graders to his inauguration -- fourth graders in Indiana study the state's history -- and hundreds turned out. Even his opponent in 2000 -- Representative David McIntosh, a Republican who gave up his seat in the United States House of Representatives to challenge Mr. O'Bannon -- said he was personable.
"Everywhere I'd go, people would say that to me: 'How are you going to run against someone who is everyone's grandfather?' " Mr. McIntosh said recently. "And it was the truth. He was a congenial guy that everyone liked."
But after his second inauguration, the going got rough. The economy began sinking, and Indiana, where manufacturing was a mainstay, lost 120,000 jobs. Tax revenues were far lower than expected, and the governor's approval ratings dropped.
"As the state's economic fortunes began to turn downward, he became the person that people began to blame," said Robert Schmuhl, a professor of American studies at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend.
Born on Jan. 30, 1930, in Louisville, Ky., Mr. O'Bannon graduated from Indiana University in 1952 and spent two years in the Air Force before going back to the university for a law degree. He received it in 1957, the year he married Judith Mae Asmus, whom he had met on a blind date as an undergraduate. She survives him, as do their three children, Jonathan O'Bannon, of Floyds Knobs, Ind.; Polly Zoeller, of New Albany, Ind.; and Jennifer O'Bannon, of Indianapolis; and five grandchildren.
He began his career as a lawyer in Corydon. He also worked at his family's weekly newspaper, The Corydon Democrat.
He covered local news, took photographs, even collated sections of the paper after they came off the press. He wrote The Democrat's editorial after John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.
Mr. O'Bannon was chairman of The Democrat's parent company, the O'Bannon Publishing Company, which owns two other weekly newspapers in Indiana. He still took photographs, though not for publication: he had a digital camera the size of a credit card and he pulled it out of a pocket at news events, including a recent balloon race and the trade conference in Chicago.
Despite having been an elected official for not quite half his life, Mr. O'Bannon still seemed to view himself as an ordinary guy. Jackie Carpenter, the managing editor of The Democrat, remembered seeing him in July, in front of the paper's office, watering the plants.
She also remembered how, on her first story as a new reporter some 20 years ago, she had to cover a civic meeting at which Mr. O'Bannon happened to be present. She was nervous, she recalled last week. 
"But he came right up to me and put me right at ease," she said. "With him, it all got right down to a personal level."

HEADLINE: Frankfurt Show: Mood Is Upbeat 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD FEAST

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
The events of two years earlier were never far from the minds of all the eager auto executives who flocked to the Messe here for Tuesday's preview of the biennial auto show. Last time around, it was the day of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. An event intended to honor the automobile's role in society crumbled as stunned show-goers gathered around TV sets to watch an appalling drama unfold. 
 The mood at this year's show, despite the memory of two years ago, was more upbeat. The international auto industry is daring to celebrate again. 
 Rick Wagoner, chairman and chief executive of General Motors, noted, "We all have great hopes that the economic turnaround in Europe, the U.S. and other key markets is on course."
For Mr. Wagoner and his peers, that means introducing new products -- lots and lots of them. Jean-Martin Folz, chief executive of PSA-Peugeot-Citroen of France, explained their importance when he identified the reason for his group's sales success in Europe. PSA's market share improvement since 1998, he said, "stems quite simply from the popularity of the products manufactured by Peugeot and Citroen."
That's why there were so many world premieres in Frankfurt. A score of production-ready newcomers made their debuts, along with a similar number of fascinating concept vehicles that signal more to come.
"The new-model flow has survived the slowdown," said John Lawson, managing director of European automotive equity research at Smith Barney in London. It had to, because no new products now would spell future failure.
Among the production car highlights in Frankfurt were the new Volkswagen Golf and General Motors' Opel Astra compact hatchbacks, direct competitors in Europe's largest market segment. Between them, they are expected to find a million new customers a year in the region. The Golf is conservative and evolutionary, while the latest Astra looks sleek and futuristic by contrast.
Volvo's latest S40 sedan, based on the Focus model from Ford, Volvo's parent company, is a small-scale replica of the big Volvos. The S40, along with a forthcoming V40 wagon, will constitute more serious competition for the BMW 3-Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-class. 
In another entry, Smart, the trendy car division at DaimlerChrysler, displayed its first four-seater -- appropriately called ForFour. A crossover version is destined to spearhead a Smart foray into the United States in 2006.
BMW unveiled its X3 sports activity vehicle (a scaled-down version of the X5 sport utility vehicle) and 6-Series coupe. A cabriolet version of the 6-series will be at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January. All will go on sale early next year. 
Aston Martin's 186 m.p.h. DB9 coupe, featuring high-tech construction, will replace the DB7. 
If money is no object, the Mercedes-Benz SLR supercar, built by McLaren, the Formula One race car maker, can be yours. With a top speed of more than 200 m.p.h., this car will cost you around $350,000.

HEADLINE: Clinton Aims Barbs at Bush At Gathering For Hopefuls 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: INDIANOLA, Iowa, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton seized the Democratic stage tonight, offering one of his strongest denunciations of President Bush since leaving office as he tried to rally Democrats here around candidates who have yet to stir the excitement he did in 1992.
 Speaking without notes or a prepared text, Mr. Clinton invoked the circumstances of the 2000 presidential election as he argued that the Bush administration had squandered the domestic and foreign policy gains he had made in his eight years in office. 
 "That election was not a mandate for radical change, but that is what we got," Mr. Clinton said, adding, "We went from surplus to deficit, from job gain to job loss, from a reduction in poverty to an increase in poverty, from a reduction in people without health insurance to an increase of people without health insurance." 
The former president said that Mr. Bush had wasted an opportunity to unite the country and enhance its international standing in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks. "Instead of uniting the world, we alienated it," he said. "And instead of uniting America, we divided it by trying to push it too far to the right."
The setting for Mr. Clinton's rare public speech on the American political scene was the annual steak fry held by this state's senior senator, Tom Harkin. It was attended by seven of the nine Democratic presidential candidates.
Six of them also spoke to the crowd tonight, but Mr. Clinton's speech, even though it was arguably not one of his strongest performances, almost entirely obscured their words and served instead to underscore the contrast between the political skills of Mr. Clinton and those of this year's crop of candidates. Indeed, two of the best-known Democrats, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, left the stage about 15 minutes before Mr. Clinton arrived, citing scheduling conflicts.
Mr. Clinton seemed aware of the danger that his presence might overshadow the 2004 contenders, or highlight their shortcomings, and he went to great lengths to dispute the notion that the Democrats were putting up a weak field this year. He went out of his way to praise eight of the nine candidates. (The Rev. Al Sharpton of New York, who was not here, was the only one not to receive any mention from Mr. Clinton.)
"I like this field -- I get tired of saying the field can't beat the incumbent president," said Mr. Clinton, adding: "When somebody tells you the people who are running for president aren't big, they just mean they aren't famous yet."
Mr. Clinton used his own economic situation to mock Mr. Bush's tax cut. Mr. Clinton said he might, as a very wealthy former president living in Chappaqua, N.Y., be paying more taxes than just about anyone else in America. "I get my tax cut, and they are going to take 300,000 poor children and kick them out of after-school programs," he said.
The candidates and the host, Mr. Harkin, fell over one another to praise Mr. Clinton and dispel any idea that Mr. Clinton, who was impeached but not removed from office, was not welcome in Democratic circles. Mr. Harkin even praised Mr. Clinton for bringing rain to this drought-afflicted region, though the rain stopped the moment Mr. Clinton took the stage. And the audience was dotted with signs reading, "Welcome back, Bill," and "We Miss You."
"When you listen to Rush Limbaugh and all those right-wingers, you'd think that Bill Clinton was still in the White House," Mr. Harkin said. referring to the radio talk show host. "He still drives those right-wingers nuts, and that's another reason we love Bill Clinton."
Mr. Edwards, who has patterned his campaign after Mr. Clinton's 1992 race, even appropriating some of Mr. Clinton's language, said, "I am tired of Democrats walking away from Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who led the greatest period of economic growth in our country's history." 
And Mr. Kerry, speaking before Mr. Clinton, took notice of the former president's propensity for lengthy speeches at public gatherings, a propensity that Mr. Kerry shares. "I saw in the program that Bill Clinton is going to speak for about 20 minutes," he said. "And in that 20 minutes, if that's what you believe it is, he's going to deliver more common sense and more sense of the country than George Bush has in two and a half years."
Mr. Clinton, in fact, spoke for 22 minutes. His voice was hoarse and strained, and his speech wandered at times, as his crowd grew restless. 
Wearing blue jeans and cowboy boots, and appearing thinner then he had at any point in the White House, Mr. Clinton took the stage to the sound of his 1992 campaign theme song, "Don't Stop (Thinking about Tomorrow)" by Fleetwood Mac. And when he was done, Mr. Clinton did as Mr. Clinton always does at these kinds of events: He stayed behind to shake every hand he could find, lingering for nearly an hour as the Iowa sky turned dark behind him.

HEADLINE: Following a Trend, Downtown Looks to the Arts 

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
When the World Trade Center was conceived in the 1960's, its developers didn't worry much about the absence of museums, opera houses, symphony orchestras or jazz clubs in Lower Manhattan. Yet almost all involved in the planning to rebuild at ground zero have agreed on at least one thing: whatever comes next should include cultural institutions.
 Developers have asked arts groups to submit proposals by today for the new world being formulated by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the rebuilding. 
 What has changed? Why are established uptown entities like New York City Opera and the 92nd Street Y now willing to consider a downtown location? Why are prominent theater people urging that a national theater be built there? 
The answer can be found in part in Bilbao and Barcelona, Spain, and Manchester, England, as well as in Los Angeles and Detroit. By giving new urgency to notions of transformation, the destruction that took place on Sept. 11, 2001, has brought home to downtown Manhattan the phenomenon of urban renewal through culture. 
"In the past 10 years or 15 years there has been a shift in terms of looking at the importance of culture," said Lynne B. Sagalyn, director of the real estate program at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. "There has been an emphasis on using arts districts as a focus of development. Museums are opening in all kinds of places where you wouldn't expect to see a whole bunch of culture. This is an international trend." 
In Manchester last year the opening of the Imperial War Museum North, designed by Daniel Libeskind, the master-plan architect for ground zero, was part of a $635 million dollar investment in culture over the last eight years. "What we see in Manchester, we can see in cities across the country," said that city's culture secretary, Tessa Jowell. "In every place cultural institutions have combined with more traditional regeneration projects to inspire civic pride and give us all a sense of place."
In Bilbao the metropolitan area's revitalization plan emphasizes the importance of cultural enterprises like the Guggenheim Museum and the Euskalduna Concert and Conference Hall. In Barcelona the socialist Catalan government has tried to revitalize a poor neighborhood with the construction of a new museum and a Center for Contemporary Culture. In Los Angeles and Detroit new symphony halls are part of the phenomenon.
Of course New York isn't Manchester or Detroit or Los Angeles. But downtown developers have been looking at such places as role models for years. In the early 1990's Carl Weisbrod was already trying to figure out how to enlarge the economy of downtown New York. Mr. Weisbrod, then the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, collected recruiting materials from cities around the United States to see what they were doing to attract business. He said he was struck by how similar the formula was in almost every case. 
"The need for cultural institutions stood out," he said. "Good schools and housing, which one would think would be very high on the list, were almost afterthoughts."
Mr. Weisbrod became president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business improvement group, in 1995. He began promoting downtown Manhattan as a cultural mecca with only modest success. A handful of museums opened, but the essential lure remained what it had always been: a trip to the Statue of Liberty and maybe Ellis Island, usually taken by tourists who bought some trinkets and T-shirts, ate a hot dog and went home. Hardly the stuff of an economic makeover. Even rudimentary marketing ideas like a tour package were stymied by the impossibility of buying advance tickets to visit the Statue of Liberty, making it difficult for visitors to plan other stops in the area. 
But the horror of the Sept. 11 attacks turned attention downtown. In the discussions that accompanied the rapid push to rebuild, the quest for culture became an ideological demilitarized zone for local residents, artists, developers and their critics. The arts were seen as a shield protecting the reverential from the commercial and the tacky.
"In some respects it's a sacred site," said Herbert Gans, the sociologist, referring to ground zero. "If it gets too commercial, it sounds too crass. You put some culture in there, it makes it more respectable and more community minded."
It doesn't hurt that with business people interested, money will probably be available to help pay for building new arts centers downtown. "That's why we have so many people bidding," said Mitchell Moss, professor of urban planning at New York University. The logic of using the arts as a lure is impeccable, he added. "The arts are to New York the way golf is to San Diego," he said. "No one goes to San Diego for the arts, and they don't come to New York to play golf. People sort themselves out by the kind of activities that give them pleasure."
Michael Sorkin, an architect and critic whose office is downtown, expresses sharp disapproval of the reconstruction process in a new book, "Starting From Zero" (Routledge). Yet even he doesn't object to the cultural part. "I don't buy the whole package," he said in an interview. "I don't think we need the office buildings or the shopping malls. But I'd be glad to have the culture."
The notion of culture as a force for urban renewal certainly isn't new to New York City. In "The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York," Robert Caro described the conception for Lincoln Center in 1957 as "razing 18 square blocks of slums, stretching north from the Coliseum and rearing on their ruins a huge, glittering cultural center that would house -- in grandeur -- not only university, opera and Philharmonic but a dozen other related institutions." 
In retrospect the displacement of the 7,000 families living in those slums may seem cruel, especially so more recently as the Lincoln Center concept of a cultural cluster has fallen into disfavor. But it did alter a neighborhood almost precisely the way the planners envisioned. 
"In that sense Lincoln Center was successful," said Alexander Garvin, who until April was the director of planning at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and is the author of "The American City," an important textbook on urban planning. 
But he added: "Lincoln Center was conceived a half-century ago. Times have changed, and the arts like clothing have to be updated."
Just as the city's planners stepped back and re-evaluated the West Side in the 1950's, Mr. Garvin argues the same process is now underway downtown. He describes Lower Manhattan in developer's terms, as the third largest "downtown" in the United States, after midtown Manhattan and Chicago. If you accept this view, he said, the area's cultural resources are sorely lacking. 
"It simply isn't in the ballgame with smaller cities like Boston and San Francisco," he said. "It was a mistake not investing in cultural facilities in Lower Manhattan. They aren't the only thing you need, but I'm saying they're an essential ingredient."
The downtown renewal is far from a mirror image of the project that remade the Upper West Side. The people who have come to live and work downtown are not poor. Rather they are seen as potential consumers of culture. 
"You talk to major employers in the city of New York and they will tell you, when they talk candidly, that they've moved most of the employees that they can out of the city because it's a very expensive place," said Lawrence F. Graham, executive vice president of Brookfield Financial Properties, which owns the World Financial Center and is a significant player downtown. "So the people they have left are typically very high productivity, the people who can generate huge profits. Who are they? People between 25 and 40 who are smart and want to be in a very interesting urban place. Culture is part of the key to that."
Therein lies the future, until another idea comes along.

An article on Monday about the role of cultural institutions in plans for the World Trade Center site and in urban development elsewhere misstated the title of Tessa Jowell, who commented on the investment in culture in Manchester, England, and other cities. She is Britain's secretary of state for culture, media and sport, not Manchester's cultural secretary. A caption with the article misstated the site of the Imperial War Museum North in Britain. As reflected in the article, it is in Manchester, not Liverpool.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Ad Buyers Cold To TV Season But Still Plan To Spend Big

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
An old cigarette slogan asked the leading marketing question, "Are you smoking more now but enjoying it less?" It is a sentiment that sums up perfectly how most of Madison Avenue feels as the broadcast television networks prepare to start the 2003-4 season. 
 Agencies agreed in the spring to spend record sums -- estimated at as much as $9.3 billion -- to buy commercial time in the prime-time season, which formally begins a week from today. But as media-buying executives assess the prospects for the 36 new series on the six broadcast networks, they are underwhelmed. 
 The executives say they cannot foresee the kind of big, breakout hits of recent seasons like "American Idol," "C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation," "Survivor" and "Will & Grace," which have viewers buzzing the next morning and nonviewers eager to catch what they missed.
"With the average household having 100 channels of broadcast and cable, you've got to be spectacular to break through," said Tim Spengler, executive vice president and director for national broadcast at Initiative Media in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
The only show expected to achieve spectacular status is "Whoopi," the freshman sitcom on NBC with Whoopi Goldberg. But its achievement will be of the failing kind, the forecasters say, according the show the dubious distinction of being the most likely to be canceled before the other 35. 
The handful of shows that do succeed, the forecasters say, will do so because they are being graded on a curve, much like last season. Such shows are known as time-period hits, drawing high ratings because they follow returning favorites. 
For example, the crime drama "Cold Case" on CBS, about detectives' efforts to solve old crimes, follows "60 Minutes" on Sunday. The spicy sitcom "Coupling" on NBC, about the romantic entanglements of six thirtysomethings, gets the cushy lead-in of "Will & Grace" on Thursday. The multicultural comedy "Like Family" on WB follows "Reba" on Friday; NBC's drama "The Lyon's Den," with Rob Lowe as an idealistic lawyer caught up in the corruption of a big Washington law firm, gets to follow "Law and Order: Criminal Intent" on Sunday. And the family comedy "Two and a Half Men" on CBS, with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer, runs after "Everybody Loves Raymond" on Monday.
(The fate of one such series, "I'm with Her" on ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, has suddenly been called into question because it is to follow the popular sitcom "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter" on Tuesday. John Ritter, the star of "8 Simple Rules," died Thursday while taping the fourth show of the season, and the network faces a difficult decision on whether to scrap the show, recast Mr. Ritter's character, or continue the show with a different lead character.)
"Nothing will transcend from the cover of Television Week to the cover of Newsweek," said John Rash, senior vice president and director for broadcast negotiations at Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, a unit of Interpublic, referring to the industry trade publication formerly known as Electronic Media. "The networks are still in desperate need of and in a desperate search for the seminal series."
As for the numerous new series deemed to be losers in waiting, few are in cushy time slots after proven audience-getters. Others are being called poorly written or miscast. 
" 'Whoopi' will be the first," said Stacey Shepatin, senior vice president and director for national broadcast at Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of Interpublic, though by this point, she added, laughing, "NBC might keep it on just to shut everyone up" who is predicting its rapid demise. (The show received decent ratings in its debut last Tuesday, although it has yet to face new shows from all its competitors.)
Among the other forecasted flops are: on ABC, the sitcom "Married to the Kellys" on Friday and the dramas "10-8" on Sunday and "Threat Matrix" on Thursday; the drama "The Brotherhood of Poland, N.H." on CBS on Wednesday; on Fox Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation, the sitcoms "Luis" on Friday and "The Ortegas" on Sunday and the drama "Tru Calling" on Thursday; the sitcom "Happy Family" on NBC on Tuesday, also despite a good sneak preview; on UPN, a unit of Viacom, the drama "Jake 2.0" on Wednesday and the sitcom "The Mullets" on Tuesday; and the sitcom "Run of the House" on Thursday on WB, a unit of AOL Time Warner and the Tribune Company. 
"The list of casualties will far exceed the list of hits," said Rino Scanzoni, chief investment officer at Mediaedge:cia in New York, part of the GroupM division of the WPP Group. "Most new shows probably have a 1 in 10 chance of survival." 
Why then spend record sums on TV commercial time, especially when ratings for broadcast networks are at an all-time low? Television is widely considered the safest medium for advertisers carefully counting dollars in a struggling economy. Also, of the marketers that are increasing advertising budgets, many, in categories like automobiles, entertainment and fast food, tend to spend more in television than other media. And though ratings continue to decline, network television still offers one of the few ways to efficiently reach large numbers of people.
Generally, agency executives are better at identifying losers than predicting winners, particularly series that do better among middle-American viewers like "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," "J.A.G." and "Providence." Their skill in calling winners is also abetted by the recent trend among network programmers to clone new series from existing hits.
For instance, in the 2002-3 season, almost all forecasters predicted that two crime dramas on CBS, also a unit of Viacom, would do well. One, "C.S.I.: Miami," was spun off from "C.S.I.," and the other, "Without a Trace," was inspired by it. Both were hits -- "Without a Trace" even more so than had been expected, thanks to those heartland viewers starved for what Mr. Rash called "cop culture that becomes pop culture." And both are back for 2003-4.
Likewise, virtually every agency executive is listing among potential winners the military crime drama "Navy NCIS" on CBS, which blends plot elements of "J.A.G." and the "C.S.I." shows.
" 'Navy NCIS' is a safe bet," said Karen McCallum, media supervisor at McKee Wallwork Henderson in Albuquerque. "It's got patriotism, and even inherits the 'J.A.G.' time period. It will definitely play in Peoria."
Speaking of which, many series teetering on the line between success and failure in the executives' forecasts are intended to be daring or provocative. The question is how mainstream audiences will respond.
Those series include the sitcom "It's All Relative" on ABC on Wednesday, featuring two gay fathers; the drama "Joan of Arcadia" on CBS on Friday, in which a teenage girl receives mysterious visits from God; the drama "Las Vegas" on NBC on Monday, which serves up sex, sin and slot machines; and "Skin" on Fox on Monday, with a lead character described as "the most successful producer of adult entertainment in Los Angeles."
" 'Las Vegas' and 'Skin' have a lot of potential, but only one has the chance to do much," said Steve Sternberg, senior vice president and director for audience analysis at Magna Global U.S.A. in New York, part of the Magna Global division of Interpublic.
"I'm not sure which one," Mr. Sternberg added, because they are scheduled opposite each other at 9 p.m. Eastern time, 8 p.m. Central.
That will happen often in the new season, as shows with similar themes or audience appeals confront each other. The new youthful drama "Tarzan" on WB on Sunday is up against the returning youthful drama "Alias" on ABC. The new drama "The Lyon's Den" on NBC on Sunday faces off with the returning drama "The Practice" on ABC. The new crime drama "Karen Sisco" on ABC, based on the United States marshal Jennifer Lopez played in the movie "Out of Sight," tackles NBC's venerable "Law and Order" on Wednesday. And "Joan of Arcadia" is up against "Miss Match" on NBC on Friday, both aimed at young women.
NBC, owned by General Electric, "is very positive about the early episodes of 'Miss Match' they've seen, which are getting better and better with each episode," said John Muszynski, executive vice president and chief broadcast investment officer at Starcom Worldwide in Chicago, part of the Starcom MediaVest division of the Publicis Groupe. He said "Las Vegas" "looks good, if a little edgy," and praised "The O.C.," which has performed well for Fox in preview episodes.
Mr. Muszynski said, "I'm already hearing on our floor about parties for the return of 'The O.C.,' " which will soon take a break until after Fox finishes broadcasting the Major League Baseball postseason games.
For those willing to wait even longer for a series they might like, there is hope: Networks like CBS, Fox and NBC are already ordering pilots for shows for the 2003-4 midseason -- and the 2004-5 season.

PERSON: Frank L. O'Bannon 

HEADLINE: Frank L. O'Bannon, 73, Governor of Indiana, Dies 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Frank L. O'Bannon, a folksy Democrat serving his second term as governor of Indiana, died on Saturday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 73.
 The cause was a stroke, which he suffered last week in a hotel room in Chicago, where he had been attending a conference on Japanese-American trade, his office said. 
 A Democrat, Mr. O'Bannon favored the death penalty and wanted stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments installed on the State Capitol grounds, a plan that was blocked by a federal judge in 2000. 
His political career began in 1970, when he succeeded his father in the State Senate. He represented his hometown, Corydon, in southern Indiana, for 18 years, 11 as the Democratic floor leader.
He was elected lieutenant governor on a ticket withEvan Bayh in 1988. He ran for governor in 1996, when Mr. Bayh, barred by Indiana law from serving more than two consecutive four-year terms, was stepping down. Mr. O'Bannon defeated Stephen Goldsmith, the mayor of Indianapolis at the time, by 5 percentage points.
When Mr. O'Bannon was sworn in, the economy was strong, and Indiana had a $2 billion surplus. He oversaw a plan that cut taxes by $1 billion while providing more money for schools and universities.
He was popular for being down to earth. Among other things, he invited all the state's fourth graders to his inauguration -- fourth graders in Indiana study the state's history -- and hundreds turned out. Even his opponent in 2000, Representative David McIntosh, said he was personable.
"Everywhere I'd go, people would say that to me: 'How are you going to run against someone who is everyone's grandfather?' " Mr. McIntosh, a Republican who gave up his seat in the United States House of Representatives to challenge Mr. O'Bannon, said recently. "And it was the truth. He was a congenial guy that everyone liked."
But after Mr. O'Bannon's second inauguration, the going got rough. The economy began sinking, and Indiana, where manufacturing was a mainstay, lost 120,000 jobs. Tax revenues were far lower than expected, and the governor's approval ratings dropped.
"As the state's economic fortunes began to turn downward, he became the person that people began to blame," said Robert Schmuhl, a professor of American studies at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend.
Born on Jan. 30, 1930, in Louisville, Ky., Mr. O'Bannon graduated from Indiana University in 1952 and spent two years in the Air Force before going back to the university for a law degree. 
He received it in 1957, the year he married Judith Mae Asmus, whom he had met on a blind date as an undergraduate. She survives him, as do their three children: Jonathan, of Floyds Knobs, Ind.; Polly Zoeller of New Albany, Ind.; and Jennifer, of Indianapolis; and five grandchildren.
He began his career as a lawyer in Corydon. He also worked at his family's weekly newspaper, The Corydon Democrat.
He covered local news, took photographs, even collated sections of the paper after they came off the press. He wrote The Democrat's editorial after John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.
Despite having been an elected official for decades, Mr. O'Bannon still viewed himself as an ordinary Hoosier. Jackie Carpenter, the managing editor of The Democrat, recalled seeing him in July, in front of the paper's office, watering the plants.
Ms. Carpenter also recalled how on her first story as a new reporter some 20 years ago she had to cover a civic meeting at which Mr. O'Bannon happened to be present. She was nervous, she said last week. 
"But he came right up to me and put me right at ease," she said. "With him, it all got right down to a personal level."

The Ex-extemporaneous Howard Dean

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
The pins have already started to penetrate.
 Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, laughed off criticism by his competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination this week by saying that he felt like a pincushion. Then he quietly began making tiny alterations to his standard stump speech, measuring facts and assertions twice before speaking. 
 President Bush's tax cuts, denounced by Dr. Dean for months as "$3 trillion" or, sometimes, "$3 trillion, including interest," became a $2.4 trillion cut, plus $600 billion in interest, during a rally on Friday in Plymouth, N.H. The 91 percent of new mothers in Vermont who used to get home visits within two or three weeks now get visits "mostly in their homes, some in doctors' offices," within three or four. And when Dr. Dean told supporters at the Bektash Temple in Concord, N.H., on Friday that his campaign had 150,000 donors and the next-best number was 20,000, he slipped in a "that I know of," just in case. 
The changes, perceptible perhaps only to the aides and reporters who trail him, show a subtle but significant shift for a candidate who sells himself as unscripted. After a week of accusations that he chooses terms carelessly or says different things at different times, Dr. Dean is now balancing his shoot-from-the-hip instinct with his place in a national spotlight where enemies and observers, armed with Internet research tools and digital video recorders, parse every word.
"If I can use precise language," he explained Friday, "I now do if I can."

Ouch, Another Pinprick . . .
Or, if he remembers to.
One of the sharpest pins yet came on Friday from Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who compared Dr. Dean to Newt Gingrich, the architect of the Republican revolution in 1994, for assailing Medicare and Social Security in the 1990's. At a news briefing at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire, Dr. Dean called the comparison "a sad end" for Mr. Gephardt. 
End of what? His campaign? His career?
But a statement issued at the same time from Dr. Dean's headquarters in Burlington, Vt., used the phrase "sad day" instead. An aide explained, "That's what he was supposed to say." 
Supposed to? Turns out he had been prepped in a five-minute huddle with aides. He managed to hit the "politics of the past" line but muffed the "sad day" bit.
"I didn't know I said 'end,' "Dr. Dean said. "From a Freudian point of view, you could have a lot of fun."

. . . But Only Wimps Flinch
Fun it may not be, but Dr. Dean said the attacks made him stronger, recalling a conversation he had with Gary Hart, who became a presidential also-ran in 1984 and 1988, about how wimps did not make it to the White House.
"It's not a bad process, to be honest with you," he explained over club sandwiches and a spinach-strawberry salad on Saturday at a supporter's home. "If I'm going to go up against George Bush, I'm going to get much more from Karl Rove than I get from these guys."
The attacks this week came from his rivals Senator Joseph I. Lieberman (who said Dr. Dean's comments on the Middle East abandoned 50 years of American foreign policy traditions toward Israel); Senator John Edwards of North Carolina (who took issue with his claim to be the only white politician talking to white audiences about race); and the Rev. Al Sharpton (who called on him to oppose Internet voting in Michigan because many African-Americans are on the short end of the digital divide). Even the Republican governor of New Hampshire chimed in, saying a Dean presidency would be bad for the local economy.
There were no apologies. Instead, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos for the ABC News program "This Week," Dr. Dean bickered over Mr. Stephanopolous's phrasing about his early support of Nafta, which he now says needs major reform.
"You were a strong supporter of Nafta," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Dr. Dean retorted: "Where do you get that idea that I'm a strong supporter of Nafta? I didn't do anything about it. I didn't vote on it. I didn't march down the street supporting it. I wrote a letter supporting it."
At lunch on Saturday, he quibbled with another reporter, saying he was just a "supporter" of the trade bill, no adjectives necessary. But Dr. Dean was one of several governors scheduled to attend a White House signing ceremony on the trade bill in 1993 (he said he cannot remember if he made it), and in 1995, on the very same ABC News program, Dr. Dean said, "I was a very strong supporter of Nafta," according to a transcript.
Asked whether he would be "better off" if he did not make absolute statements like the one on race, Dr. Dean said he would be "less controversial" but also "less appealing." 
He repeated his complaint that Mr. Gephardt's comparison of him to Mr. Gingrich amounted to old-style Washington politics. Then, regarding the criticism of his statement about the Mideast -- which has been joined by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts -- he compared two of his opponents to their mutual nemesis, President Bush.
"I think what Kerry and Lieberman are doing is exactly what the president does," he said. "They divide by fear."

A Cacophony of Hoofbeats
Some have compared Dr. Dean to Seabiscuit, the thoroughbred who came from nowhere to become the most popular and successful horse to race in the 1930's. But now he is sounding a bit like War Admiral, the Triple Crown winner who for months shunned Seabiscuit's offer for a match race. 
Mr. Kerry, the candidate formerly known as the front-runner in the presidential primary race, today challenged Dr. Dean to a head-to-head debate, saying that the stages crowded with nine candidates did not give him ample opportunity to highlight their differences. Joe Trippi, Dr. Dean's campaign manager, demurred.
"There's seven other guys in this race," Mr. Trippi said. "The guy has something to say, he's got plenty of debates to say it. Lieberman hasn't had any problem doing so."

HEADLINE: POORER COUNTRIES PULL OUT OF TALKS OVER WORLD TRADE 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: CANCUN, Mexico, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
World trade talks intended to help the developing nations unexpectedly collapsed today when delegates from Africa, the Caribbean and Asia walked out, accusing wealthy nations of failing to offer sufficient compromises on agriculture and other issues.
 While not as disastrous as the breakdown of talks in Seattle four years ago, the failure to reach an accord today was widely regarded as a huge setback for the World Trade Organization, the 146-nation group that was presiding over the talks here. The group, based in Geneva, will now almost certainly fail to make its self-imposed deadline of January 2005 for reaching a new agreement that dismantles global trade barriers. 
 The failure today also means the faltering global economy will not receive a jump-start by the expansion of markets, which some economists contend would inject hundreds of billions of dollars into international commercial activity. 
"We all could have gained here and now we have all lost," said Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade negotiator, commenting on the collapse of the talks. 
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, sounded less pessimistic but still spoke with some frustration. "The harsh rhetoric of the 'won't do' overwhelmed the concerted efforts of the 'can do,' " he said.
Wealthy nations had hoped an agreement at the five-day talks in this resort city would help fend off a new wave of protectionism, especially in the United States, where manufacturing jobs have been disappearing by the tens of thousands. Already, questions about the benefits of unfettered world trade have infected the presidential campaign.
Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the W.T.O., tried to be optimistic tonight, saying, "We must return to the task before us with renewed vigor," to complete this round of trade negotiations, which will continue at a low level at the group's Geneva headquarters.
"If we fail, the losers will be the poor and weaker nations," he said.
The immediate cause of the breakdown was proposed new trade rules for investment and government procurement, which had been promoted by the European Union but opposed by the poorer nations. But agriculture was the pivotal issue. Developing nations had established themselves as a potent force in talks here this week, challenging the earlier supremacy of the United States and Europe in trade talks.
Banding together in what was known as the Group of 21, the developing nations thought they had made their case that the $300 billion in subsidies paid every year to the world's wealthiest farmers undermined the livelihoods of millions of poor farmers around the world. But they said the proposals made by the United States and Europe to redress what the developing nations regard as a major injustice fell far short of their expectations.
Richard L. Bernal, a delegate from Jamaica, said a group of African, Caribbean, Asian and Latin countries felt they had little choice but to quit the talks. The United States and Europe, he said, were not generous enough on reducing their agriculture subsidies, on helping poor African countries dependent on cotton, or on understanding their difficulties in taking on such complex trade responsibilities as investment.
"There is nothing for us small countries in this proposal," he said. "We don't want any of this."
Yet those nations said tonight that they blamed no one for the failure and vowed to work for a trade agreement on agriculture now that the talks move back to Geneva. Celso Amorim, the Brazilian minister of foreign affairs and a spokesman for the group, said those nations had demonstrated that they were a new force in the trading organization.
"This is the real start in negotiations over agriculture," he said. "Whatever the process, the pieces will be picked up again." 
Mr. Zoellick said he would move ahead on free-trade agreements with individual nations or regions, noting he had a long list of countries that wanted to negotiate with the United States. Meanwhile, he said, he would wait for things to "calm down" at the World Trade Organization.
"I hope we can help those countries come around," he said, without identifying them.
Mr. Zoellick said he believed that the talks were unlikely to reach a conclusion by their deadline. The message he heard from many members, he said, was "not now."
Mr. Lamy, the European trade commissioner, said the failure in Cancun "is not only a severe blow for the world trade organization, it is a blow to all." Still, he said, "We are going to remain committed to strengthening this rules-based multilateral trading system."
Progress toward a new agreement on trade, which was started two years ago at a W.T.O. meeting in Doha, Qatar, has repeatedly been stalled. Trade officials had missed every deadline until last month.
Then the United States broke an important political and emotional deadlock. American negotiators agreed to accept a proposal they had rejected last December to give the world's poorest countries access to life-saving medicines. That agreement -- which is unaffected by the setback today -- breathed life into the trade negotiations and demonstrated that the United States would join Europe in working out a compromise over initial objections from their pharmaceutical firms.
Members of some antiglobalization nonprofit groups that have been demonstrating outside the heavily guarded talks broke into song when the collapse was announced, cheering that the talks they considered unjust had failed.
But Phil Bloomer, director of Oxfam's campaign against the agriculture policies of rich nations, said he took no delight in the failure of the talks, which he said was a blow to poor nations that needed immediate relief for their farmers.
"It appears the United States and the European Union were not prepared to listen and take the necessary steps to make global trade rules work for the poor as well as the rich," he said.
If a new agreement is reached, the World Bank has estimated, global incomes would increase by as much as $520 billion by 2015, and 144 million people would be lifted out of poverty.
But developing nations said no deal was better than a bad deal.
Several delegates said they walked out today rather than negotiate new trade rules covering investment or government procurement, in part because they feared the new rules would be too intrusive and limit a country's freedom to regulate the environment or workers' rights in the face of international trade laws protecting foreign investors.
"We wanted to negotiate issues that are essential for us -- agriculture subsidies, closed markets," said Yashpai Tandon, a delegate from Uganda. "Why would we now add investment? It is too much."
He singled out the dispute over cotton subsidies as a major disappointment. Four of Africa's poorest nations had asked that the subsidies given to American and European cotton farmers be reduced and the African farmers be paid $300 million in compensation for the losses they suffered because of unfair competition from wealthy farmers. Instead, a draft proposal suggested that the question be studied and that the African farmers plant other crops.
"It got to be too much for us," said Bakary Fojana, a delegate from Guinea. "The cotton offer was unjust and ignored what was demanded by African nations. Coming into this meeting everyone said, 'yes, cotton is an important question; yes, agriculture is important.' But when it came down to negotiations, our daily problems were ignored."

HEADLINE: A Scramble in Bangkok For a $10 Million Reward 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
The capture of a senior figure in Al Qaeda near here last month has set off a mad and, some say, unseemly scramble. Thai police, military, and intelligence units have all approached the American Embassy with their hands out, asking for a share of the reward for the capture of the fugitive, Riduan Isamuddin, better known as Hambali.
 Speculation has been rife in the Thai news media that the United States was offering $4 million in bounty for Mr. Isamuddin, who was captured 50 miles north of here. American officials allege that Mr. Isamuddin was part of the inner circle of Osama bin Laden and that he had a role in a number of the terrorist attacks against the United States in the past decade, including the ones on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 "The government is very serious about combating terrorism, but it is also very serious about collecting the reward for the arrest of terrorist suspect Hambali," The Bangkok Post wrote on Thursday. "And it wants to know how much is due."
Publicly, American officials have responded by saying that no bounty was ever offered specifically for the capture of Mr. Isamuddin.
But there is in fact a cache of United States cash to be divided up, and it is bigger than the rumors suggest, according to American and Thai officials. It is more, in fact, than the Central Intelligence Agency intended to give.
The C.I.A. proposed dispensing $1 million to the various Thai security and drug units that helped in the capture of Mr. Isamuddin. But White House officials decided for unknown reasons to raise the payout, and the United States is now paying $10 million, American and Thai officials said.
Washington's generosity is causing headaches for the C.I.A. There are intense rivalries and jealousies among the Thai police, military and intelligence units. Often they refuse to share intelligence information, and one unit would not take kindly to another one getting more of the reward money, a Western diplomat said.
The C.I.A. also wants to make sure that the reward goes to the police officers and soldiers who played a part in Mr. Isamuddin's detection and arrest, and is not siphoned off by senior officers.
The agency is looking for charities to receive donations from the money, like a fund for widows and orphans associated with the police or the army.
A spokesman for the C.I.A. in Washington declined to comment on any details of a reward for Mr. Isamuddin's capture.
The Bush administration has good reason to be generous with Thailand, which has provided significant, and quiet, assistance in the campaign against terrorism. Last year, two top Qaeda leaders -- Abu Zubaydah, thought to have been Al Qaeda's operations chief, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a planner of the 9/11 attacks -- were secretly brought here for interrogation after being captured in Pakistan.
But one Western official was somewhat amused at the notion that reward money should be paid to any Thai government agency involved in Mr. Isamuddin's capture. The operation was carried out essentially by the C.I.A, the official said, echoing what American and Australian officials have said previously. Mr. Isamuddin was seized in an apartment in the city of Ayutthaya on Aug. 12.
To avoid jeopardizing the arrest mission, the Thai police were not even made aware of it until the last minute, American officials said. A special Thai military unit, known for its discipline, was brought in to raid the apartment, which had been found by the C.I.A., and seize Mr. Isamuddin. The Thai soldiers turned him over to American agents who were right behind them.
Within a few hours, Mr. Isamuddin was on a C.I.A. plane that had been flown in for the operation. It is not known where he is being held. Intelligence officials have said they believe he was planning attacks on an economic summit meeting to take place here next month and to be attended by leaders from 21 nations, including President Bush.
Mr. Isamuddin fled his native Indonesia in the mid 1980's, and eventually joined Mr. bin Laden in Afghanistan. He is suspected of a role in terrorist attacks going as far back a plot hatched in the Philippines in the mid-1990's to blow up jetliners over the Pacific. He has also been linked to the attack on the destroyer Cole in October 2000 and the bombings of nightclubs in Bali in October 2002.
When President Bush announced Mr. Isamuddin's capture, he described him as "one of the world's most lethal terrorists." Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him a "very big fish."
Yet he was not on the F.B.I.'s list of its 25 most wanted terrorists, so no specific bounty was placed on his head. For Mr. bin Laden, for example, the United States is offering a reward of $25 million.
The $10 million will come from a State Department program called Rewards for Justice, American officials said. The C.I.A. will determine who receives reward money and how much. The same program gave $30 million to the person who provided the information that led to the killing of Saddam Hussein's sons.

HEADLINE: Japan's Premier Looks Strong for Party Vote 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi today entered the final week of campaigning for the presidency of the governing Liberal Democratic Party with an overwhelming lead in surveys, almost assured of a second term, in which he pledges to continue efforts to revitalize the nation's economy.
 All news media surveys indicate that Mr. Koizumi seemed likely to win a majority over his three rivals and avoid a runoff after the Saturday election, in which the party's lawmakers and local members cast votes. With the Liberal Democratic Party controlling the legislature, its president will in effect become the head of government for a three-year term ending September 2006. 
 The four candidates appeared together today here in western Japan, standing on top of a bus in a public square. In a separate debate today, Mr. Koizumi pledged to pursue economic policies including privatizing public institutions and modernizing banking systems, while his challengers criticized him for failing to revitalize the economy first.
Buoyed by the surveys and signs of an economic recovery that include new growth figures, Mr. Koizumi was already looking beyond the party election, according to news accounts, considering dissolving the powerful lower house of Parliament next month and calling an election in November. He has been a staunch ally of President Bush, and many investors here and abroad prefer him to his challengers.
The Japanese public, according to polls, continues to support Mr. Koizumi, 61, partly because of an absence of an attractive challenger. That reason represents a big change since a wave of populism propelled him to power in April 2001 and earned him rock-star popularity among voters weary of bland politicians. Expectations that he would transform Japan's economy and political culture have largely declined, polls show.
"I don't think much will change, regardless of who wins, though out of the four, I guess Koizumi is the most able," said Shinji Wada, 52, a ship worker who was listening to the candidates speak here.
Recalling a time when Mr. Koizumi's popularity was such that calendars and other goods featuring his portrait were hot-selling items, Mr. Wada added: "Two-and-a-half years ago, I had high expectations that he would carry out real reforms, in the economy and politics. I don't have such expectations anymore."
Still, on top of the bus today, while his rivals stood stiffly next to him, Mr. Koizumi showed the common touch that won him record-high ratings when his term began. He waved to the crowds, and the crowds waved back, many aiming camera-equipped mobile phones at him.
Party members are rallying behind Mr. Koizumi, who remains more popular than the Liberal Democratic Party. The leader of the party's upper house members, Mikio Aoki, threw his support behind him despite being one of his harshest critics, saying for example that it would be wrong to privatize the postal service. But he seemed to attach greater importance to the help Mr. Koizumi's standing would give his party in elections. 
In exchange for Mr. Aoki's support, some experts predict that Mr. Koizumi will appoint a conservative to a key cabinet position.
One challenger, Masahiko Komura, 61, a former foreign minister, said, "I am frightened to hear the prime minister say that the idea of supporting someone irrespectively of policy agreement is a progressive idea." The support, he said, "is clearly created in back-room wheeling and dealing."
The other rivals are Shizuka Kamei, 66, a former party policy chief, and Takao Fujii, 60, a former transportation minister.
Mr. Koizumi's challengers said that while structural reforms were necessary, they favored more spending to boost the economy.
When campaigning began last week, Mr. Koizumi reiterated his pledges to overhaul the government sector. He focused on privatizing the postal services by 2007 and the country's four public road corporations by 2005, both of which have provided support bases for party members.
Other traditional backers of the Liberal Democrats, including the health and construction industries, are lukewarm about him, but are expected to support his party over the opposition Democratic Party. "The Democratic Party's policy would be even more severe to them than Koizumi's," said Jun Iio, a professor of politics at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. 
The trade organizations make up a large chunk of the Liberal Democratic Party's 1.4 million members. Those members will hold 300 votes in the election, while the party's 357 lawmakers each have one vote. If no one wins a majority, or 329 votes, in the first round, the 357 lawmakers alone will choose from the top two candidates.
Many have criticized Mr. Koizumi for buckling to those conservative voices during his first term.
"Structural reforms, structural reforms -- that's what he always says," Mitsuko Tanaka, a 60-year-old housewife, said after listening to the prime minister speak today. "But it's been two and a half years, and I don't feel that the economy's improving. Stores are closing. Crime's going up because people don't have jobs."
Others, however, said that Mr. Koizumi was on the right track, and that resistance inside the party and the long economic slump made rapid change impossible.
"I think he's fulfilled half of his promises in his first term," said Takahiro Miyai, 26, a social services worker. "I wouldn't want another leader, so that we would have to start from zero."

HEADLINE: Clinton, a Davis Ally, Tries to Provide Boost 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
The beleaguered governor of California imported some out-of-town talent today for aid in his struggle to stay in office.
 Former President Bill Clinton and Gov. Gray Davis -- one charismatic and one admittedly not -- appeared together at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church here to plead the case against the recall of Mr. Davis, which will be decided by California voters on Oct. 7. 
 Mr. Davis, standing before a purple-robed gospel choir and speaking above an organ accompaniment, looked a bit bemused at the church, which is Los Angeles's oldest black congregation. Mr. Clinton, who has appeared several times at the church and in countless other black churches, clutched a Bible and looked utterly at home.
"Gray Davis and I have been friends for a long time, and I don't want this happening to him," Mr. Clinton said toward the end of his 25-minute remarks. "But this is way bigger than him. It's you I'm worried about. It's California I worry about. I don't want you to become a laughingstock or the beginning of a circus in America where we throw people out for making tough decisions." 
He added: "Don't do this. Don't do this." The congregation roared its approval.
Mr. Clinton is only the first of a parade of national Democratic figures who will be in California this week to fight the recall and motivate core Democratic constituencies to vote. 
Former Vice President Al Gore, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Senators John Kerry and Bob Graham will appear with Governor Davis to urge a no vote on the recall.
Mr. Clinton said this morning that it was entertaining to watch the recall race from afar, with its colorful characters and highly compressed schedule. "It beats watching 'Friends' or reruns on TV," he said.
But he warned that the election was not a sideshow and not merely about who occupied the governor's chair in Sacramento.
"If you do this recall, you may create a problem that you won't get over for a long, long time," Mr. Clinton said. "This spreads instability and uncertainty among your people and among people around the country."
He repeatedly invoked Scripture in his argument, using the tale of Jesus and the harlot to suggest that those behind the recall were not entirely blameless for the state's troubled political and economic condition. "Let he among you who is without sin cast the first stone," said Mr. Clinton, who knows something himself about sin and redemption.
He likened an election to a contract and said Mr. Davis had been elected last fall to serve a four-year term. The threat of recall could deter politicians from making tough decisions, he said, fearing that one unpopular move could cost them their jobs.
The former president was introduced by Mr. Davis, whom he has been privately advising on strategy, and delivered an impassioned argument against the recall. His appearance clearly buoyed Mr. Davis and his aides, who are gaining confidence that they can defeat the recall movement. Recent polls show that the percentage of voters favoring the recall had been shrinking from a wide margin just a few weeks ago to a near tossup.
Republicans, meantime, have an internal battle raging between those who support Arnold Schwarzenegger as the party's most electable candidate and those backing State Senator Tom McClintock, a bedrock conservative with 20 years of experience in state government. 
A two-day state Republican convention ended today with neither man commanding a strong majority of party allegiance.
Mr. Schwarzenegger today was in Orange County, where he picked up the endorsement of the California State Firefighters Association. In brief remarks, he did not address the Republican split but said he could provide the leadership the state needs.
Opening for Mr. Clinton at the church this morning, Governor Davis referred to "powerful forces" in California and Washington who were trying to overturn the will of the people, citing the challenge to the presidential vote count in Florida in 2000 and the effort to impeach Mr. Clinton.
"This recall threatens the very fabric of democracy," Mr. Davis called, and several in the congregation responded, "That's right."
"It is not good for you, it is not good for California," he said. "I ask that you defeat it."
Mr. Davis's biggest applause line, however, was his introduction of Mr. Clinton: "Some days I wake up and wish he was still president. He'll always be the president for us."
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Davis were joined at the church by many of California's top Democratic elected officials, all in their Sunday finery to spread the antirecall message to an audience already largely converted to the cause. Polls show that African-Americans overwhelmingly oppose the recall.
Betty Ford, a retired schoolteacher and a member of the First A.M.E. congregation, said after the service that she had already decided to vote against the recall. Ms. Ford said Mr. Clinton and Mr. Davis had strengthened her conviction with "very persuasive arguments."
"The financial condition of California can't be totally blamed on Governor Davis," she said. "That was the point President Clinton made when he talked about the problems he had as president. You have to give a person time to solve these problems."
Monica Ballard, another worshiper, said of Mr. Davis, "Of course he made mistakes, but he's admitting his mistakes."
Ms. Ballard said the 135 candidates on the ballot to replace him were far worse. 
"All the people running for governor now are clowns," she said. "They're making us look bad. I like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I think he should really stick to acting."
Neither Mr. Davis nor Mr. Clinton mentioned Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, who defied Mr. Davis's wishes by putting his name on the replacement ballot. 
The state Democratic Party on Saturday endorsed him as their preferred candidate if the recall succeeds, but most of the party's effort and money will go toward defeating the recall.
After the church service, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Davis walked through the touristy Olvera Street plaza in downtown Los Angeles. 
Tomorrow they will appear together at the dedication of the William Jefferson Clinton Elementary School in Compton. 
Mr. Clinton then headlines a big-dollar fund-raiser for the antirecall campaign at the Beverly Hills home of the billionaire Ron Burkle, a longtime contributor to Democratic causes. 
The former president will be in Northern California on Monday night and Tuesday for two policy speeches.

HEADLINE: ZANKEL HALL MUSIC REVIEWS; 
Madrigal Meets Digital as Voices Span the Centuries

BYLINE:  By ANNE MIDGETTE 

 BODY:
Zankel Hall's underground location has led some people at its opening events to joke that the designers should have included a turnstile for more direct access to the subway, which has always made its presence felt in Carnegie Hall's main auditorium upstairs and reverberates through Zankel with even more vigor. 
 A logical next step would be performance pieces involving subway musicians, something effectively realized on Sunday afternoon when two Latino vocalists in the R train offered a kind of preperformance event before the Zankel Hall program of the Theater of Voices ensemble, although few subway passengers got off to compare the two. 
 They might have liked the main event. Zankel's format of shorter concerts without intermission is pleasantly streamlined and dramaturgically effective. Theater of Voices gave four pieces on Sunday, two from the 13th and 14th century, including four selections from the Bamberg Codex, and two pieces from the last decade. 
Unfortunately the program was not quite as well executed as it was conceived, so after a strong beginning one was left a little disappointed.
The strong beginning was Ingram Marshall's 1997 "Hymnodic Delays," based on four early American hymns, which I would have been happy to hear four times through. 
Mr. Marshall, seated onstage, filtered the voices of four live singers through a digital delay system. "How long," began the soprano, and "how long" continued to echo as she moved on, so that the intermingling of four voices yielded not a quartet but a polyphony dominated by the falling minor seconds of repeating notes from the delay. It was a duet between live and taped, present and past.
Without being arch or intrusive, Mr. Marshall found 20th-century expressions of the musical illustration of Renaissance madrigals. When "thousands walk together" on the road to death, the four voices were refracted into thousands in a marching tread; when "death like an overflowing stream sweeps us away," the pitches themselves were dragged downward, as if they could not resist the inexorable tide. The piece was economical in its means and eloquent in its clarity.
It set a standard the rest of the program couldn't quite live up to, in part because outside the shelter of the tape delay, the exposed performers sounded less sure. "Le Lai de la Fonteinne," a 12-verse song to the Virgin by Guillaume de Machaut, proved a large chunk to swallow, given the dutifully pretty but rather flat execution of the three sopranos who sang it. Steve Reich's "Proverb" was a warm meditation on a sentence by Wittgenstein, with thoughtful vibraphone patterns like water running over shallows, but the vocal performances lacked the rhythmic acuity to make the piece's facets sparkle as they might have.
As for the subway: my subjective experience in three concerts was that its noise is unobtrusive on the left side of the hall and unmistakable on the right, a hypothesis to be tested at many future Zankel concerts.

HEADLINE: Without Glue of Euro, Bond May Dissolve 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
One day after Swedish voters ruled out for years to come the likelihood of adopting the euro single currency, Europe's great project to bond its disparate players into a single force to rival the United States seemed doubtful.
 The Swedish referendum rejecting euro membership by a staggering 14 percentage points not only bolstered euroskeptics in the other holdout countries -- Britain and Denmark -- but also reinforced the possibility that, far from being one, Europe could soon be perceived as falling into three castes. 
 The first, led by France and Germany -- architects of the single currency, intended to shield against the wars that stud the Continent's history -- would embrace primarily the 12 nations using the single currency. Paris and Berlin are allies distinguished as much by their inability to inspire economic growth as by their refusal to support the United States in Iraq. 
The second, in terms of economic and political power, would be a loose alliance of eurozone holdouts, while the third would be drawn from the 10 countries, largely from the former Soviet empire, expected to gain their long-coveted European Union membership next year. Those nations are committed to joining the euro but must first make wrenching economic adjustments.
"The dog that never barked in the European Union is this notion of reinforced cooperation, where some countries go ahead in different areas -- internal security, defense and now the euro," said Katinka Barysch, chief economist at the Center for European Reform, in London. "We are heading to a new debate about a European Union with much larger internal differences." 
Within the 15-nation body, national agendas are nothing new. Britain, for example, seeks prominence in efforts to build European military cooperation, but remains aloof from both the euro and agreements that have opened borders across much of Continental Europe.
But the Swedish vote, some analysts suggested, may have taken that process a step further by enshrining the idea that individual exceptions outweigh commitments to the pan-European ideal. Technically, for instance, Sweden had already agreed to accept the euro in a 1994 referendum on joining the European Union.
"If Great Britain wants to be Atlantic, and Poland prefers Washington to Brussels and if Spain believes just as strongly in Hispanidad as it does Europa," Sergio Romano wrote in his column in the Corriere della Sera of Milan, "it is difficult to imagine that a market and a coin are enough to create a European patriotism."
The distinctions seem likely to persist. Swedish leaders said it could be 10 years before they sought euro entry again, while euroskeptics in Britain argued that, as Janet Bush, an anti-euro campaigner, put it, "it is now highly unlikely that British public opinion will be moved on the euro for many years to come."
In some ways, the outcome showed how hard-headed, relatively prosperous Swedes had come to view the eurozone recession. They looked askance at France's and Germany's failure to adhere to the euro's internal rules as they tackled deficits.
The euro's "biggest adversaries were and are the governments in Berlin and Paris," said an editorial in the Berliner Zeitung, which added that France's and Germany's economic retreat "is increasingly paralyzing the entire Continent." 
For all that, it seems unlikely that the Swedish vote will galvanize the big eurozone countries into changing policy. "I view it as a wake-up call, though I'm afraid they won't hear it," said Daniel Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies in Paris. 
The vote seemed as significant for its repercussions outside Sweden as for its consequences within.
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, in a credibility crisis over Iraq, had already postponed a pro-euro "road show" planned for this summer. Mr. Blair's spokesman repeated today that British membership depended on arriving at a "clear and unambiguous" assessment that it would be in Britain's economic interest to join. But the prospect of efforts toward a referendum before the next election, expected by 2006 at the latest, seems remote. 
Analysts here said the Swedish vote might encourage euroskeptics in Denmark, which rejected euro membership three years ago. The vote may also prove a setback for politicians in neighboring Norway who are trying to nudge the country toward joining the European Union.
But some say the Swedish vote reflected the emotions of a Continent whose people feel remote from ruling elites and who sense that the European project negates their democratic aspirations. "This was an antiestablishment cry," said Goran Rosenberg, a leading Swedish columnist. "This was a sign or a warning, and not just for Sweden."

Shares Drop as Mixed Reports Raise Doubts on Economy

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks declined in quiet trading yesterday, as mixed economic data about manufacturing raised doubts for some investors about the strength of the economic recovery.
 Insurance stocks were among the biggest losers, on worries that Hurricane Isabel could cause billions of dollars in damage if it hits the East Coast, as expected, later this week. 
 Early yesterday, the Federal Reserve Board said that industrial production crept up 0.1 percent in August, which was less than had been forecast, even as slower auto production brought factory manufacturing down by 0.1 percent. Production was held back by the blackout in midmonth. 
"We had the industrial production number, which was lackluster and below expectations," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the United States equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Banking.
"Other than that, there's nothing negative. But it continues to concern people about the economy, because we've been seeing stronger manufacturing numbers, and this number kind of reverses the trend," Mr. Fitzpatrick said.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.74 points, or 0.24 percent, to 9,448.81. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased 3.82 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,014.81. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 9.33 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,845.70.
Insurance stocks fell as insurers braced for possible losses from Hurricane Isabel, which was edging closer to land.
Shares of the American International Group, the biggest insurance company by market value, fell $1.20, or 2.0 percent, to $58.85. Allstate, which analysts said had the most exposure to damage from the storm among publicly traded insurers, fell 43 cents, or 1.19 percent, to $35.56. The S.& P. insurance index fell 1.10 percent.
Hurricane fears helped lift shares of Home Depot, the world's No. 1 home improvement retailer, as people stocked up on generators, batteries and other storm-related gear. Home Depot shares gained $1.19, or 3.77 percent, to $32.78.
Boston Scientific soared after researchers said its new heart device was effective at treating clogged heart arteries, putting the company in a strong position to compete with Johnson & Johnson. 
The device -- a tiny medicine-coated tube used to prop open clogged heart arteries -- significantly reduced the need for repeat procedures in a significant clinical trial. Boston Scientific shares jumped $4.62, or 7.52 percent, to $66.02, their highest level in at least a decade.
Market watchers said they were awaiting comments from the Federal Reserve when it meets today. Though the Fed is expected to leave official interest rates unchanged, Wall Street will closely watch the Fed's view of recent economic growth. 
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed, unable to escape a tight trading range as most investors stayed put ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting.
Yields hovered near five-week lows. Analysts noted that the unwinding of hedges related to new corporate debt deals helped lift the market in the afternoon.
Traders faced with fresh corporate debt issues sell government bonds ahead of these deals to hedge any fall in the corporate market. After unloading the corporate paper, they buy back the government debt.
By late in the day, the 10-year note lost 1/32, to 99 30/32. Its yield was unchanged. And the 30-year bond dropped 8/32, to 102 29/32. Its yield rose to 5.17 percent from 5.16 percent on Friday.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.765	99.497	High Rate	0.930	0.995	Investment Rate	0.947	1.017	Low Rate	0.90%	0.95%	Median Rate	0.92%	0.99%	Total applied for	$31,626,906	$25,995,580	Accepted	$12,424,779	$12,939,518	Noncompetitive	$1,450,509	$910,809	

Both issues are dated Sept. 18. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 18, and the six-month bills on March 18, 2004.

HEADLINE: Production Inches Higher, While Manufacturing Declines 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Industrial production rose in August, the Federal Reserve said yesterday.
 Separate reports from the Commerce Department showed that business inventories declined in July, while the current account deficit held at a record in the second quarter. 
 Production at factories, mines and utilities increased 0.1 percent in August after rising 0.7 percent in July, more than previously stated, the Federal Reserve said. 
The report was aided by a 2.1 percent jump in computer equipment production, the biggest gain since July 2000. 
The results fell below the median forecast of a 0.3 percent gain in part because of a 0.1 percent decline in manufacturing, the first since April, after a blackout in the Northeast and Midwest crimped auto production, economists said.
"I don't think this report undermines what we're seeing in terms of recovery for the rest of the economy," said Richard DeKaser, an economist at National City in Cleveland. "With inventories so low, there's a good case to be made for an uptick in production the rest of the year."
Business inventories, the value of goods on hand at manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers, fell 0.1 percent, to $1.179 trillion after no change in June, the Commerce Department said.
The current account, the broadest measure of trade because it includes investments, was unchanged at $138.7 billion. 
The current account is in deficit because Americans are spending or investing more on foreign goods and services than they are able to produce or save. The size of the shortfall equals 5.14 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. That is more than four times what it was 10 years ago.
Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to hold the benchmark overnight bank lending rate today at 1 percent, the lowest since 1958..
The proportion of industrial capacity in use was unchanged at 74.6 percent after a July revision. When the economy was expanding from 1992 through 2000, an average 82.5 percent of plant capacity was in use.
The 0.1 percent decline in manufacturing work at factories, which accounts for 90 percent of the industrial production report, came after a 0.5 percent increase in July. The other two big components, mining and utilities, gained. 
Mine production rose 0.2 percent after a 0.3 percent drop a month earlier, while electric and gas utility output rose 1.9 percent after a 3.8 percent gain in July.
Economists said the power failure in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest curtailed some manufacturing and cut production at power plants. Utilities probably made up for the shortfall because of air-conditioning demand during higher-than-average temperatures in August.

HEADLINE: Facing Huge Debt, Large Farm Co-op Is Closing Down; 
Farmland Industries Battled Major Food Conglomerates

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo. 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Farmland Industries, the nation's largest farmer-owned co-op, dedicated a new headquarters here that seemed to symbolize the company's emergence as a corporate giant.
 The glass-sheathed building, with its sleek entrance and plush executive suites, helped consolidate the work force of a company that had grown from a collection of small farm co-ops into an agricultural powerhouse with sales of more than $12 billion. 
 But today, Farmland is preparing to close its doors. Weighed down by huge debts and a severely depressed fertilizer business, Farmland was forced to file for bankruptcy protection last year. The company is now proceeding toward liquidation. 
The collapse of Farmland has some farm groups worried that co-ops are losing their ability to compete with big food companies.
Small farmers also worry that the demise of a big farm co-op will give big food and agriculture companies even greater market power over farmers, particularly the 500,000 farmers who collectively own Farmland.
"This doesn't bode well for farmers," said Tom Buis, a spokesman for the National Farmers Union. "The marketplace for a lot of farm products has failed because we're seeing less and less competition in the industry. It's fair to say if you've got just one buyer you're not going to get a good price."
Yet some big farm co-ops, like Land O'Lakes, Dairy Farmers of America and Sunkist, have remained competitive and use their size and heft in the marketplace.
Farmland, some agriculture industry experts say, was simply a victim of its own mismanagement.
"They took a lot of risk," said Roger Ginder, a professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University. "Farmland borrowed heavily to finance its operations," he added, "and in the end this created a lot of problems."
The problem at Farmland, even people inside the company now agree, was an overaggressive expansion effort, too many building projects, too much reliance on debt and too much dependence on a fertilizer business that fell apart.
But no one expected Farmland to come apart so quickly. The failure has shocked the farm community. Thousands of farmers here in Missouri and as far west as Idaho and south to Mississippi are expected to lose more than $700 million in equity or investments in the collapse of the co-op.
After spending hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to compete with the world's biggest food companies, Farmland (whose motto is "Proud to be farmer owned") is now being sold in parts to rival corporations.
Cargill and Koch Industries, for example, bought its fertilizer plants. And last month, Smithfield Foods, the nation's biggest pork producer and processor, made a bid to acquire Farmland's pork processing business for $363 million. Last week, Cargill, which operates another big processor, the Excel Corporation, announced its own bid of $385 million.
The Smithfield deal led some farmers and legislators to cry foul because of worries about the dominance of big agriculture.
Nine United States senators, including Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, signed a letter asking the Department of Justice to investigate how the Smithfield acquisition would affect farmers and consumers.
Jerry Hostetter, a spokesman for Smithfield, which is based in Smithfield, Va., denied accusations that the combination would weaken competition in the meat processing market and said the acquisition would not be harmful to small farmers.
"This is the same Midwest paranoia," Mr. Hostetter said in a telephone interview a few weeks ago. "The small farmer thing has been around a long time."
Cargill, one of the nation's biggest food processors, will soon have to answer similar questions from farm groups that worry about consolidation.
For years small farmers have complained about their shrinking share of the nation's food dollar and how a series of mergers has put most of the nation's processing capacity in the hands of a few big corporations. They, in turn, use their market power to try to keep the prices paid to farmers low.
Of course, some economists say the story is far more complex. They say federal farm aid, trade restrictions, the propensity of farmers to overproduce and the fact that farmers are selling a commodity and not a processed, higher-valued food product, help reduce the farmer's share of the food dollar.
The fact remains, however, that farmers seem less powerful in the marketplace. And many farmers said they believed that co-ops were one of the few market equalizers.
That was the mission of Farmland, which was founded in 1929 here in Kansas City. At first, it helped farmers to band together to get cheaper oil and other farm supplies. Later, Farmland -- which is owned by smaller co-ops around the country -- began operating petroleum refineries, gas stations, feed mills and even convenience stores.
When it made a profit, much of the money went back to farmers in the form of cash payments and equity in the local co-ops. Farmland is required by law to pay about 20 percent of its profits to farmers; it actually paid close to 50 percent.
But in recent years, as big food processors and marketers have grown into giant corporations, co-ops like Farmland have been pressured into getting bigger to keep costs down and supply giant retailers. For capital, the co-op went to its banks.
"Farmers need critical mass to play in these industries," Mr. Ginder at Iowa State University said. "You get the ability to command enough volume to deal with, for example, a Wal-Mart, which is not going to deal with too many suppliers."
In the 1990's, the cash cow for Farmland's growth spurt was fertilizer. From 1990 to 1999, Farmland reported nearly $700 million in cumulative profits, largely from increasing fertilizer sales. A big part of that money went back to farmers in the form of payouts. The rest was used for expansion.
One big beneficiary of the strategy of expansion was Farmland Foods, which became the sixth-largest pork producer in the nation by processing more than seven million hogs a year; it had sales of $1.8 billion in 2002.
The good times, however, came to an end in late 1999 and 2000, when the price of natural gas, an important raw material in fertilizer, began soaring. 
When the price of natural gas shot up from about $2 for an amount of gas with one million B.T.U. of energy, to over $10 in December 2000, Farmland executives figured they would soon decline. They did not, and the results were devastating.
"The fertilizer business didn't just slow down, it hit a brick wall," says Robert B. Terry, who took over as chief executive in May 2002. "And this wasn't just Farmland, it was the industry. Everyone has been wrecked."
The losses hit when Farmland was in the midst of an acquisition and building binge. The company had re-entered the beef business; it was building a huge and expensive fertilizer plant in Coffeyville, Kan.; older fertilizer plants in Dodge City and Liberal, Kan., were being upgraded; and Farmland had spent about $100 million on a new computer software system.
As the losses mounted, Farmland tried to merge all of its operations with Cenex Harvest States, another giant farmer-owned co-op that had petroleum, fertilizer and grain interests. That deal fell apart when shareholders in Cenex (since renamed CHS) voted against the combination, partly because of concerns about Farmland's increasing debt.
By early 2002, the fertilizer business was losing a lot of money. Farmland reported that revenue had dropped to $3.4 billion in the last half of 2001 from $4.7 billion in the period a year earlier. It had a net loss of nearly $50 million.
Worried about the co-op's prospects, and its ability to pay the high interest rates on its debt, bondholders began demanding early repayment, exacerbating the cash problems.
"Farmland issued bonds that were redeemable on demand, and that was critical," Mr. Ginder said. "So it sort of became like a run on the banks."
Mr. Terry's predecessor as chief executive, Robert Honse, stepped down three weeks before the co-op filed for bankruptcy protection.
The executives who are now working to liquidate the co-op say Farmland borrowed too heavily to compete in too many capital intensive businesses. And once in those businesses, Farmland found it hard to get out when it started losing money.
"The businesses we're in are important to the members," said Steven Rhodes, Farmland's chief financial officer. "They interact with them; they buy fertilizer from them. So they don't want to get out."
Co-ops also typically have difficulty raising money, because they cannot sell shares to the public. Most of their capital comes from retained earnings -- what is left after making payments to farmers.
"There are fundamental differences between corporations and cooperatives," says Michael Cook, an agricultural economics professor at the University of Missouri. "Corporations don't have to pay out earnings and redeem equity."
So are big co-ops like Ocean Spray or CHS still viable? Can they compete with giant food corporations?
"Yes," Professor Ginder said. "The capital constraint is a constraint, but that doesn't mean all co-ops are going to fail. They just need to find more creative ways to get that capital, and they need to use it more carefully."
Some of the better co-ops, experts say, are narrowly focused, like the Dairy Farmers of America or Florida's Natural Growers.
For Farmland, however, it is too late to find a focus. Company executives are working to create a trust that will liquidate the co-op's assets.
Eventually, Farmland will leave its six-story headquarters here. That will mean dismantling the large mural that hangs on the first floor. Painted in 1956, it depicts the growth of American agriculture and the founding of the Union Oil Company, which eventually became Farmland Industries.
The mural shows the co-op pioneers, as well as farm families, animals, tractors and, in the far right corner, the "two skeptics," as they were called, the men who doubted the co-op system would ever work.
The mural is painted in heroic tones, as a symbol of how wrong the skeptics were; and how right the pioneering farmers were.
While few experts believe that co-ops are doomed, farmers are still lamenting the fall of the biggest farmer-owned co-op of them all.
"We're disappointed," said Dale Locken, chief executive of the South Dakota Wheat Growers Association, which had a large equity stake in Farmland. "We'd like to have that equity. But you have to learn to just move on."

HEADLINE: Illinois Considers Buying Drugs in Canada 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois is considering whether his state should begin buying prescription drugs from Canada for its employees, a decision that he says could save tens of millions of dollars, but could also put him at odds with the Food and Drug Administration over the issue.
 "It doesn't matter where you go in our state, you meet people who are struggling with the cost of prescription drugs," Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat, said in an interview this afternoon. "If you can buy the same drug made by the same company, and it is safe and it costs less, then that makes sense." 
 In a faltering economy, Illinois taxpayers spent $340 million this year, a 15 percent increase over last year, to provide drugs for 230,000 current and retired state employees, the governor said. That figure is projected to grow by 17 percent next year.
The cost of prescription drugs in Canada and most other industrialized countries is regulated by the government, unlike in the United States. Last year, drug prices in this country were 67 percent higher than in Canada, a report by a Canadian health agency found. 
But Mr. Blagojevich could face legal problems if he decides to pursue Canadian sources, because the federal Food and Drug Administration bars people from importing drugs that have not been approved by the agency, and bars the resale of drugs made here, exported elsewhere, then returned here. 
In recent years, the practice has grown in popularity among private citizens, and it is currently under debate in Congress. At least one city, Springfield, Mass., has begun to buy prescription drugs from Canada for its employees, but Illinois would become the first state to do so.
"We're concerned about the dangers here," said William K. Hubbard, associate commissioner of the F.D.A.
Mr. Hubbard said there could be risks from drugs bought in Canada, including those not approved by the F.D.A. and not made in the United States, those that have expired or were improperly stored and those without labels.
Still, enforcement of the rules has been spotty. Individual consumers and even busloads of Americans are generally not arrested after returning from Canada in search of cheaper medicines.
"It's not O.K. for the individual to bring in drugs," Mr. Hubbard said, "but so much of the stuff is coming in and it's so uncompassionate to go after patients."
But if Illinois were to pursue a formal plan for seeking Canadian drugs for its workers, Food and Drug officials would "hope to have a conversation" with Mr. Blagojevich to lay out the agency's health and legal concerns, Mr. Hubbard said.
And on Tuesday, agency officials plan to meet with Mayor Michael J. Albano of Springfield to discuss that city's program.
Springfield began buying drugs in Canada this summer for those of the city's 7,000 workers and 2,000 retired workers who chose the optional plan.
Mayor Albano said he had studied the increases in prescription drug costs to the city in his eight years in office, a rise to about $18 million from about $8 million, and was searching for some way to end the constant increases.
In February, he said, he went to Canada, studied the wholesale operation where he might buy the drugs and ordered insulin supplies for his 13-year-old son. What he discovered, he said, was that taxpayers would save about $850 a year simply on his family's medical purchases and that his family would save about $250 in co-payments.
Depending on how many workers participate, the city could save at least $4 million a year, Mayor Albano said. So far, he said, some 1,000 employees have signed up.
The mayor, who said he requested the meeting on Tuesday with federal officials, also said he thought the drug plan was "within the guidelines issued by the F.D.A." and that he considered the agency's talk of health risks to be disingenuous.
"Let's think about this," he said. "How many Canadian citizens have been harmed by counterfeit medicines? Let's get real here. That's not an issue, and you know it's not an issue."
Mayor Albano said officials from other towns and cities had been contacting him since he started the drug plan to see whether they might follow suit. He said he had received queries from officials in California, Nebraska, Indiana, North Carolina, Connecticut, Michigan and elsewhere in Massachusetts.
City leaders in Pittsfield, Mass., for example, are studying the idea, as well as other ways to save money using domestic drug companies, according to the mayor there, Sara Hathaway. Though Pittsfield is unlikely to rush into such a plan, Mayor Hathaway said, it is taking the possibility seriously.
"This looks like a real way to realize some savings," she said. "I will be very interested to see how the F.D.A. responds."
Mayor Hathaway too expressed doubt about the federal regulators' motives. "I don't see Canadians dropping dead from their prescriptions," she said. "I am taking a bit of a jaundiced view of their rulings on this. They have to recognize that Americans should have the freedom to purchase the lowest cost prescription." 
In Illinois, Mr. Blagojevich has asked his staff to study the issueand report to him by December on what the cost savings might be.
Even so, he acknowledged that F.D.A. regulations could be a hurdle.
"We're not going to violate the law, we're going to urge a changing of the law," he said. "If the study shows what we think it might, that this could be a cheap and safe method, this will be powerful evidence. Hopefully, we can persuade them."

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Pull Questions From Surveys About Children 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
The board that oversees national achievement tests has moved to curtail sharply the background surveys of students, teachers and principals that accompany the examinations, alarming researchers and others who rely on the surveys as an important source of information. 
 The surveys have provided information on factors like television viewing habits and the performance of children in single-parent households. The questions are administered along with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or N.A.E.P., commonly known as "the nation's report card." 
 But the board, which took control over the questionnaires under the No Child Left Behind Act, said the surveys were becoming too intrusive and burdensome and had little to do with the primary mission of the examination, to give a snapshot of achievement, with information on demographic and other factors. 
The board also said it feared the drawing of cause-and-effect conclusions from the results, which are intended to show just correlations.
The new policy was released on Friday in final form.
The chairman of the National Assessment Governing Board, Darvin M. Winick, said collecting information to offer a context for the test results -- for example, the time spent on homework -- was a "legitimate use." But Dr. Winick said researchers were relying on the surveys as an omnibus research project at taxpayer expense.
The burden falls heaviest on teachers. In 2000, teachers had to answer almost 100 questions. Principals answered 65. Fourth graders answered about 30, with the number climbing to about 50 in the 8th and 12th grades. The Education Department has begun paring the questions, and researchers expect that the new policy will mean 25 to 40 percent fewer questions than in 2000, particularly for teachers.
"I'm very much in favor of research, but I don't see the major purpose of N.A.E.P. as being the vehicle to feed information to researchers," Dr. Winick said.
Researchers contend that the new policy will cut off an incomparably broad stream of information about classrooms. The timing is particularly disconcerting, they said, because the No Child Left Behind Act emphasizes that policy and practices have to be grounded in scientific research.
"Some of the highest quality data that the federal government puts out is through N.A.E.P., and we want to make sure it continues that way," said Kirk A. Johnson, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who is interested in connections, if any, between academic performance and religious observance.
A lobbyist for the American Educational Research Association, Gerald Sroufe, described the cutback in surveys as "a lost opportunity." The answer to items that were misinterpreted was not to discard, but to improve them, Mr. Sroufe said.
Some scholars agreed with pruning questions. David W. Grissmer of the Rand Corporation wrote a report in favor of streamlining the questionnaires. But the governing board rejected a proposal by Dr. Grissmer and others for an advisory panel of independent researchers to suggest questions. Instead, the board will rely on the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Education Department, with researchers' comments.
In a move that troubled some specialists, the center withdrew questions from the reading test in February that would have asked teachers and principals about the standardized testing and accountability.
The withdrawn questions have become particularly sensitive under No Child Left Behind, President Bush's education initiative.
Among the issues are do school boards, principals and parents exert "great pressure" on teachers to increase test scores? Do teachers have the resources they need? What effects do the emphasis on standardized examinations have on learning?
Officials at the center argued that the questions were posed in 2002. But the department has been withholding the results since it released the scores three months ago.
Researchers, educators and others say that the results were withheld for political reasons and that the responses would show disaffection for the cornerstones of No Child Left Behind.
A transcript of a meeting of the governing board from August 2002 on background questions shows lengthy discussion about asking teachers and principals about accountability in February 2003. When panel members turned to Peggy G. Carr, associate commissioner for assessments, she said she had "some good news and some bad news."
The good news was that the Education Department had withdrawn the questions. "The bad news," Dr. Carr said, was that the survey was conducted last year.
"That doesn't mean that we have to report on it," Dr. Carr added.
"It's just the beginning of what we know is going to happen in the future," Dr. Harold H. Wenglinsky, a professor at Bernard Baruch College in Manhattan, said. "They're not reporting the results of questions they've asked, and soon they're going to stop asking the questions."
The director of the Institute of Education Sciences at the Education Department, Grover J. Whitehurst, said that he was not aware that the results had been withheld until a reporter asked about it and that the department was not withholding results because they did not support the administration's position.
"In this case, at least," Mr. Whitehurst said, "that's an incorrect inference." 
He said officials at the National Center for Education Statistics doubted the legality of the accountability questions and wanted to discuss them with the governing board. He could not say, however, why that had not been done in the last year. The information, he added, would probably be released in a few months, after "the usual checks on accuracy."
He added that he believed the questions violated a new statute in No Child Left Behind that bars the N.A.E.P. from asking about "personal or family beliefs or attitudes."
Dr. Johnson of the Heritage Foundation disagreed, saying the answers were "of public policy interest."

A Man Who Came to a Y, and Took It

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
SOL ADLER'S assistant is working, uncomplainingly, out of a fourth-floor hall closet at the 92nd Street Y, and the unassuming executive director himself is stashed nearby, also uncomplainingly, in a nondescript room after an amicable eviction from his downstairs office. The culprit? An employee task force charged with a reallocation of space at the crowded Y, which coincidentally is mulling an expansion to ground zero. So the boss has been kicked upstairs with the rest of the administrators: a bold bunch, those Y employees. 
 When the task force advised Mr. Adler that his tatty ground-floor sanctum, with its beat-up desk, overflowing bookshelves (he collects signed copies of works by Y lecturers), and a timeworn conference table culled from his parents' dining room, had been requisitioned for a classroom and painting studio, he surrendered it without a peep. 
 The big sentimental stuff went into storage. The small sentimental stuff, like the celebrity menorah bought expressly for a candle-lighting photo op with Al Gore during his presidential campaign, came along with Mr. Adler. A team player, he hunkered down on yoga mats with the Y's displaced dormitory residents on blackout night. He adapts fast if given cause.
Same thing happened when his father, worried that his son's Brooklyn College sociology and economics degrees would leave him underemployed in the 1970's market, urged him to stay in school and grab an accounting degree. He complied for practicality's sake, even if the subject did not exactly excite him. He hated the debit sheet discipline. Turns out, it helped him get hired here in 1977 as director of accounting by his mentor, Reynold Levy. Their link goes back to the Shorefront Y in Brooklyn, where Dr. Levy ran the program for teen-agers and Mr. Adler was a client. Eleven years after Mr. Adler's arrival, the 92nd Street Y board named him executive director. 
"The Y saved me from the world of accounting," he said, temporarily unlacing his primly clasped fingers. "I probably would have been a little more dull if I'd stayed there -- with all due respect to accountants. The real greatness of the Y is that it's a living community."
So, a few months after the World Trade Center disaster, when officials from Community Board 1 asked if the Y might be interested in cloning itself as part of the downtown rebuilding effort, his community spirit was piqued. His board of directors reacted as he suspected: "They told me, 'Sol, patriotically, at a minimum, let's help them out. And if it turns out there's a role for the Y to play, we should explore it.' " 
MR. ADLER reveres his board. Where else would a Brooklyn boy with no discernible money-raising skills or philanthropic contacts be appointed, at 34, head of a world-renowned nonprofit group with expanding boundaries and cultural clout? First order of business was to romance a $5 million gift from Robert and Joan Tisch. It took a year, but he got it, and it ignited the desired domino effect. 
Now the Y, as part of its strategic plan, is delegating $1 million to study the feasibility of a cultural-community outpost downtown, potentially in a partnership with Hunter College and others. "Our vision is not for downtown or uptown," says Mr. Adler, whose first responsibility is to the mother ship with its $43 million budget and clientele of 300,000. "Anything we do at ground zero would have to be part of the vision for the entire institution, or it's not going to happen. And if in the end, they don't need us there, fine; we have no pride in authorship."
This is not about institutional ego. Or his. Which seems invisible.
Mr. Adler, smiling beneath a conservative mustache, has the air of a perpetual pushover; behaving like a mensch is mandatory with him, and a quality that he instilled in his three sons. The Holocaust is, he says, his managerial touchstone. "Once I understood it," he said, "it became a kind of filter for what's critical to people's lives and what's not. I feel like my instincts are good, even if they're honed by this horrific situation. It helps me cut right to what's important."
Mr. Adler's parents survived the Holocaust, but most of their family perished; his mother was at Auschwitz, his father at a labor camp in Lodz. After the war they went to Sweden, and then to Brooklyn; both worked in a garment factory. His mother treated him "like a prince." He preferred hanging around the Shorefront Y across the street from their Brighton Beach home; he took his future wife, Debbie, there on their first date, and shanghaied her into posing for his photography class. He and his wife live in Sea Gate, in a century-old house designed by Stanford White. Taking photos of beach sunsets is his bliss; so is working at the Y.
His favorite lecturer is Elie Wiesel, and not just because he interrupted his own speech and congratulated the board for picking "a Polish Jew" to lead the Y in 1988. "I'm always a little jittery when he comes around," Mr. Adler said. "I guess you want to measure up. He embodies the soul of the Y in many ways. He is so clearly a symbol of the Jewish community, but his own vision is to encompass the entire community."
Uptown and down.

HEADLINE: The Cancun Failure 

 BODY:
Cancun means "snakepit" in the local Mayan language, and it lived up to its name as the host of an important World Trade Organization meeting that began last week. Rather than tackling the problem of their high agricultural tariffs and lavish farm subsidies, which victimize farmers in poorer nations, a number of rich nations derailed the talks.
 The failure by 146 trade delegates to reach an agreement in Mexico is a serious blow to the global economy. And contrary to the mindless cheering with which the breakdown was greeted by antiglobalization protesters at Cancun, the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations will suffer most. It is a bitter irony that the chief architects of this failure were nations like Japan, Korea and European Union members, themselves ads for the prosperity afforded by increased global trade. 
 The Cancun meeting came at the midpoint of the W.T.O.'s "development round" of trade liberalization talks, one that began two years ago with an eye toward extending the benefits of freer trade and markets to poorer countries. The principal demand of these developing nations, led at Cancun by Brazil, has been an end to high tariffs and agricultural subsidies in the developed world, and rightly so. Poor nations find it hard to compete against rich nations' farmers, who get more than $300 billion in government handouts each year.
The talks appeared to break down suddenly on the issue of whether the W.T.O. should extend its rule-making jurisdiction into such new areas as foreign investment. But in truth, there was nothing abrupt about the Cancun meltdown. The Japanese and Europeans had devised this demand for an unwieldy and unnecessary expansion of the W.T.O.'s mandate as a poison pill -- to deflect any attempts to get them to turn their backs on their powerful farm lobbies. Their plan worked. 
The American role at Cancun was disappointingly muted. The Bush administration had little interest in the proposal to expand the W.T.O.'s authority, but the American farm lobby is split between those who want to profit from greater access to foreign markets and less efficient sectors that demand continued coddling from Washington. That is one reason the United States made the unfortunate decision to side with the more protectionist Europeans in Cancun, a position that left American trade representatives playing defense on subsidies rather than taking a creative stance, alongside Brazil, on lowering trade barriers.
This was an unfortunate subject on which to show some rare trans-Atlantic solidarity. The resulting "coalition of the unwilling" lent the talks an unfortunate north-versus-south cast. 
Any hope that the United States would take the moral high ground at Cancun, and reclaim its historic leadership in pressing for freer trade, was further dashed by the disgraceful manner in which the American negotiators rebuffed the rightful demands of West African nations that the United States commit itself to a clear phasing out of its harmful cotton subsidies. American business and labor groups, not to mention taxpayers, should be enraged that the administration seems more solicitous of protecting the most indefensible segment of United States protectionism rather than of protecting the national interest by promoting economic growth through trade.
For struggling cotton farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, and for millions of others in the developing world whose lives would benefit from the further lowering of trade barriers, the failure of Cancun amounts to a crushing message from the developed world -- one of callous indifference.

HEADLINE: Union and Party Backing Helped Novice Win in Bronx 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Most of the giant charts and posters had been taken down, and the Bronx storefront campaign office was calm and quiet. Just a week earlier, Annabel Palma's political headquarters had been a whirlwind of commotion, people and energy.
 A big hurdle was behind Ms. Palma, a political newcomer who rode the whirlwind to victory over a well-known Bronx politician in the Democratic primary last Tuesday. As the Democratic nominee for the City Council seat in the predominantly Democratic 18th Council District in the Bronx, she is the hands-down favorite in the November general election. 
 More than a few Democratic leaders and students of New York City politics are studying her victory for larger lessons about the city's political terrain. All agree that the combination of strong party and union support, together with an interesting new candidate, made for a most unusual race.
The campaign brought together a diverse collection of unions, led by 1199/S.E.I.U., in an unusual arena for them, a City Council district. In taking on Ms. Palma's campaign, the unions sought to send the message that even though the governor and mayor are Republicans, organized labor still has muscle in Democratic, grass-roots politics.
To underscore the point, the unions and Bronx Democratic leaders chose Ms. Palma, a 31-year-old single mother and health care union organizer who had never run for political office. Further, she faced a rival with one of the best-known names in Bronx politics: Pedro Gautier Espada, a former assemblyman and councilman whose father was the outgoing incumbent.
Ms. Palma got a stunning 65 percent of the vote to Mr. Espada's 34 percent. "It was," said Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx Borough president who is a Palma supporter, "a campaign where everything worked perfectly."
When Ms. Palma first announced her candidacy, few -- including Bronx Democratic politicians -- gave her much of a chance. The Espada name has been a staple in Bronx politics. The father, Councilman Pedro Espada Jr., had been a state senator before being elected to the Council and is one of the borough's eloquent speakers. In contrast, Ms. Palma sounded stiff and tentative in her first speeches before large crowds, like that at the Bronx Democratic County Dinner in June.
Ms. Palma was a member of 1199, the giant health care workers' union. She said that she got the idea to run for the Council after her landlord increased her rent and she had few options for housing in her price range. She said she got no response to a call to Councilman Espada.
"For me, the decision to run was based on my desire to create a movement for the people in this district," Ms. Palma said. "This campaign was designed to say: This is our community and we want to elect someone the people want, not someone who has been thrown at us."
She approached some of her friends from the union and was encouraged to go to the organization's leaders for help. "At first, they thought I was crazy," Ms. Palma said. But the contacts led to a meeting with Assemblyman Jose Rivera, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman.
In her favor was the party's long and bitter feud with the Espada family. Democratic leaders were again trying to have Councilman Espada removed from the party rolls. (Mr. Espada last year indicated that he wanted to become a Republican.) The councilman decided not to seek re-election, instead arranging for his son, Pedro Gautier, to take his spot on the ballot.
Meanwhile, union leaders and Democratic officials said, they became increasingly impressed with Ms. Palma on the campaign trail. She talked of having dropped out of high school but getting a general education degree and going to college. She spoke of having dealt with housing problems, with the difficulties of raising a child, of living on a limited income.
Labor leaders said her message resonated with voters in the district, which includes Soundview and Mott Haven, where the median income is $29,000 a year and the unemployment rate is 15 percent.
"Many in that district saw her as a success story," said Jennifer Cunningham, the executive director of the S.E.I.U. New York State Council. "She is not what people are used to in candidates, especially in relatively poor communities."
Labor, meanwhile, weighed in heavily, with volunteers from 1199, the Transport Workers Union, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union and a host of others. Also pitching in were the Working Families Party and New York Acorn, a community advocacy group that works primarily with residents of poor minority neighborhoods.
On any given day, the Palma campaign had 100 to 200 campaign volunteers blanketing the district. Up to three campaign volunteers were regularly assigned to distribute literature and knock on doors in the 350 apartment buildings in the district.
By the time the polls closed last Tuesday, Ms. Palma's campaign managers estimate, more than 4,000 volunteers had worked to elect her.
Ms. Palma also raised nearly $91,000 and received an additional $93,750 in matching public funds from the city's Campaign Finance Board. More telling, perhaps, was that she received money from 607 contributors. (Of the 106 City Council candidates registered with the board, only Councilmen Eric N. Gioia and Michael McMahon had more contributors than Ms. Palma did.)
Meanwhile, a huge number of campaign volunteers helped to bring voters to the polls. In many cases, they were people who might not have otherwise voted. Indeed, nearly 9,000 people voted in the race, compared with fewer than 4,000 people in a hotly contested primary in the adjacent 14th Council District.
Some of the city's labor unions see the Palma campaign as only the beginning. "This is a city of working men and women," said Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council. "We have an ability to make a difference with people, not money. This campaign showed that, when we work in unity, we can be as effective as anyone."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; 
Senior U.S. Official to Level Weapons Charges Against Syria

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration says that despite pledges, Syria has not stopped militants from crossing into Iraq to kill American soldiers. 
 In testimony prepared for a House hearing on Tuesday, John R. Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control, says the administration is also concerned about what it sees as Syria's continuing support for terrorist groups like Hamas, and he reiterated accusations that Syria has an ambitious program to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. 
 But Mr. Bolton's testimony says there is "no information" that Syria has transferred any unconventional weapons it may have to the terrorist groups it is said to support. He also says the administration "has been unable to confirm" reports that Iraq covertly transferred unconventional weapons it may have had to Syria "in an attempt to hide them from United Nations inspectors and coalition forces." 
Syria has denied that it has unconventional weapons. 
Mr. Bolton's assertion about the transfer of weapons, along with other parts of his testimony, renewed a prolonged debate within the administration, according to officials. The testimony -- some will be given in public, the rest in a closed briefing -- pitted officials who wanted a much tougher critique of Syria against those who wished to encourage Syria to honor its pledges.
Late last week, the testimony was cleared by the intelligence community and the White House. A copy of the public testimony, to the International Relations Subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia, was provided to The New York Times by individuals who feel that the accusations against Syria have received insufficient attention. 
Mr. Bolton's suggestion that Syria is partly responsible for the attacks on American troops and his allegations of unconventional-weapons programs and support for terrorists reflect the administration's growing frustration that Damascus has not responded to demands that it curb such activities.
His testimony says Syria has taken "a series of hostile actions." Just before and during the war this spring, Syria "allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq," it says. "Syria permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack and kill our service members during the war, and is still doing so," the prepared testimony says. 
The administration has previously accused Syria of permitting foreign fighters to pass into Iraq. But Mr. Bolton's sharp criticism reflects what other officials have said is a particular concern about the impact of the reported Syrian action. 
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters who traveled with him to Iraq last week that of more than 200 foreign fighters captured in Iraq, the largest groups were those from Syria and Lebanon. One intelligence official said 60 to 70 percent of those detained were believed to be Syrian, based on identity cards or interrogations. Many were carrying large sums of money, a Defense Department official said.
A Pentagon official said that while Syria had done some things to limit militant cross-border traffic, "they have not done nearly enough."
The administration, under political pressure as American soldiers continue to die in Iraq, is trying to do whatever possible to stop foreign militants from entering Iraq. 
But the cross-border traffic is only one irritant. "Although Damascus has increased its cooperation regarding Iraq since the fall of the Iraqi regime," Mr. Bolton's testimony says, "its behavior during Operation Iraqi Freedom underscores the importance of taking seriously reports and information on Syria's W.M.D. capabilities." 
A former intelligence officer said, "We have to find some way of getting their attention," and referred specifically to a trip in May by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and a subsequent visit by an assistant secretary of state in which President Bashar al-Assad promised to curb activities of concern to Washington, but then apparently did not do so.
Mr. Bolton declined to comment or elaborate on his planned testimony.
The testimony does not endorse a Congressional proposal that would require President Bush to impose economic sanctions on Syria. But senior officials said the administration would consider imposing such sanctions if Syria did not stop allowing "jihadis" to enter Iraq and trying to develop unconventional weapons.
In an interview, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the chairwoman of the subcommittee, said Syria's "porous borders and the hatred for Americans are very disturbing."
"Syria can play an important role for regional stability, but it's doing just the opposite," she said.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen is a co-sponsor of a bill that would require that sanctions be imposed against Syria unless it ended its reported weapons activities, its support for terrorism and its presence in Lebanon, where it has a substantial military role. She said the bill "gives the administration great leverage" against President Assad. 
Mr. Bolton's description of Syria's weapons programs is consistent with earlier Central Intelligence Agency descriptions of Syria's efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. But State Department officials said this is the first time the administration is presenting a somewhat detailed, public assessment of such activities.
Tensions between Washington and Damascus have flared in recent months. As major combat operations in Iraq wound down, administration officials, including President Bush, suggested Syria was harboring Iraqi officials who had fled (an accusation Syria denied) and was allowing remnants of Saddam Hussein's government to hide major weapons in Syria. The United States Army wounded and took into custody five Syrian border guards in June when it attacked what American officials said was an Iraqi convoy near the border.
The testimony also alleges that Syria has "a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin that can be delivered by aircraft or ballistic missiles, and has engaged in the research and development of more toxic and persistent nerve agents such as VX." Syria is not a party to the international treaty banning chemical weapons.
Syria, the statement asserts, "is continuing to develop an offensive biological weapons capability" and has not signed the treaty banning those weapons. The testimony also expresses concern about Syria's nuclear activities, noting that Russia and Syria "have approved a draft program on cooperation on civil nuclear power," expertise that could be applied to a weapons program.

HEADLINE: For Younger Music Fans, A Club Is, Well, History 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
There was a time when a guy named Ringo Starr played the drums with a band called the Beatles, who had their music pressed onto round, black discs of vinyl and stuffed into jackets known as album covers.
 That might sound so obvious as to be silly, until you meet Brian Lee. He is a 19-year-old student studying music technology at New York University. He plays the trombone, has his own band and dresses like a 19-year-old musician might, with lots of black and piercing. 
 He's never heard of Ringo Starr.
"I haven't heard about a lot of groups," Mr. Lee said. "I'm mostly into my own band."
This is not to make fun of Mr. Lee, who is a serious young musician, but to point out the problem facing the Bottom Line, a legendary music club in Greenwich Village that has showcased many of the biggest names in music over the last 30 years. Indeed, Mr. Starr himself recently played on its stage.
The Bottom Line owes its landlord, New York University, $185,000 in rent going back to 2000, and may be forced to shut down. The club has been a presence on West Fourth Street in the Village for nearly three decades, and its possible demise has alarmed many of its faithful, from longtime customers to music industry legends. They saythe club must be saved to help preserve a historic site, one that also offers a unique atmosphere to established musicians as well as up-and-coming artists.
"The sense of history alone that exists within those walls is something that the city, let alone the music community and music fans, should value and treasure," said Vin Scelsa, the longtime disc jockey who is best known for the radio show "Idiot's Delight."
But if its doors close, the death of the Bottom Line may well be more the result of changing musical tastes than a dispute in which the landlord has filed court papers seeking to take possession of the club, while the club's owners want to work out a payoff schedule.
There was a time when the Bottom Line was a must stop for up-and-coming artists, established musicians and everyone in between. Its legacy is so strong that when Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel recently announced plans to reunite and tour, they did so from the stage at the Bottom Line.
Why, then, hasn't Melanie Golder ever stepped foot inside the Bottom Line? She is 42 years old and has lived in the neighborhood for the last eight years. Or how about Julie Denison, 33, who has lived there for six years? Both women say that they are interested in music but that the Bottom Line just hasn't been on their list of places to see.
"I've walked by it a million times," said Ms. Denison. "I can't even think of anyone who has been there."
To begin to understand the Bottom Line's troubles is no more difficult than to cross the street. From there, the club's blue awning can be seen by hundreds of students milling around Tisch Hall at N.Y.U., but its legendary reputation eludes them.
"You mean the comedy club across the street?" Chase Berger, 20, a finance and marketing major from Florida, responded when asked if he had ever heard of the club. "I think the taste for live music has gone down. People are more into D.J.'s, hip-hop and electronic music."
Or here is 19-year-old Shawna Dobbins's perspective on the club. "I always felt like it was an older crowd, and it was kind of expensive. I love music, but I've never been there," she said.
If there is a sigh going out over the Bottom Line's troubles, it is probably being heard in Westchester, Long Island and New Jersey. The Bottom Line was once a place that attracted young people from around the region. Those audiences poured in to hear musicians like Bruce Springsteen, Lou Reed and Miles Davis. But those audiences have grown older, and though still interested in music, they are less likely to venture downtown for a night at a club.
"I think the audience of the Bottom Line is a loyal one that was built over the years. It is the 30-plus audience," said Rita Houston, music director of WFUV, a radio station that promotes two performance series at the club aimed at younger audiences. "I would say the majority of the audience is a suburban audience that lives outside of town and is probably married with kids at this point and still goes to the shows."
Steve Fenster, 47, a mortgage broker from Briarcliff Manor in Westchester, is that audience. He has been going to the Bottom Line since he was a teenager growing up on Long Island. He has memories of shows at the club and still gets out to see live music often. But he hasn't been to the Bottom Line in 10 months and notes that there are many other clubs open now.
"Maybe the kind of musicians somebody my age likes aren't playing there much anymore," he said.
That may be part of the problem. But it is more complex, reaching into the changing economy of the city and the changing nature of the music industry, with name acts concentrating more on making CD's than trying to draw audiences through concerts.
Allan Pepper, one of the owners and founders of the Bottom Line, is struggling to keep it open. He insists that the club remains relevant and modern. He notes, for example, that the club recently had four up-and-coming artists, aimed at attracting younger audiences, on the same day that Ringo Starr played on stage. 
That, however, didn't mean anything to Mr. Lee, the 19-year-old musician, who said he had never heard of the four other musicians, either.
"Can I tell you the name of my own band?" Mr. Lee said as he walked away carrying his trombone case. "Insult to Tradition."

HEADLINE: When Books Break the Bank; 
College Students Venture Beyond the Campus Store

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
When Jill Thompson, a junior at Barnard College, went to the bookstore recently and found that her biology text cost $120, she balked, put the book down and went to her computer to look for a cheaper alternative. 
 "With the tuition we pay, it's a lot to come up with more than $100 for a biology book," said Ms. Thompson, a psychology major from New Hampshire. Searchingdogears.net, she found a used copy of the required text for $69. 
 In the past two decades, the price of textbooks has soared. The price of educational books and supplies has risen 238 percent, while the price of consumer goods over all has increased only 51 percent, according to the Consumer Price Index. At four-year private colleges, the College Board found, students spent an average of $807 on books last year. Some students, particularly science and math majors, spent that much in one semester. 
At the same time, more books are being sold in shrink-wrapped bundles with supplements that a student may not need but must pay for, such as a study guide, dictionary or CD-ROM.
But more and more, students are fighting back, finding ways to reduce the costs. They are sharing books, using library copies or going online to find cheap used copies. Indeed, about 20 percent no longer buy all their required texts, according to the National Association of College Stores. And that percentage is growing fast enough to worry both textbook publishers and college bookstores.
"When we first looked at it five years ago, it was about 15 percent, but it's trending up about a percent a year," said Laura Nakoneczny, a spokeswoman for the association. The group ran an unsuccessful program last year in which professors worked with bookstores at a dozen colleges to try to increase the percentage of students who buy assigned texts. 
Publishers say the prices of textbooks simply reflect the high costs of producing college texts. Most are niche products, written for a relatively small audience. To stay up to date -- and, critics say, to force students to buy new books -- publishers frequently bring out new editions, further limiting sales of used books.
But some legislators are not buying the publishers' argument.
Last year, in response to complaints from students at Pasadena City College, Carol Liu, chairwoman of the California State Assembly's Higher Education Committee, held hearings on the issue, but none of the invited textbook publishers showed up. Ms. Liu's staff is exploring the possibility of using the collective buying power of California's state colleges and universities to negotiate with publishers for lower prices.
Students like Ms. Thompson, meanwhile, are finding their own ways around high book costs.
"When I was a scared freshman, I bought every single book," said Ms. Thompson, 20. "By last year, I was more relaxed. There was one religion class where I didn't buy a single book. I relied on the copies on reserve at the library, and, ironically, that was the class where I got the best grade, maybe because having to do the reading at the library forced me into better time management." 
Many freshmen seem to end up buying everything they are assigned -- even when they have serious sticker shock at the college bookstore.
"I was so surprised," said Thomas Blair, a Columbia freshman emerging from the bookstore with a heavy bag. "The calculus book cost $144. The chemistry book, with the study guide and the answer book, cost $178. I called my dad and said I was going to run out of money a lot sooner than I thought."
Part of the problem is that a growing proportion of texts, like Mr. Blair's chemistry book, now come bundled with study guides, CD-ROM's, instructions providing access to a special Web site, answer books or other supplements that drive the price up and make it less likely that students will find cheaper used versions. 
"We began seeing bundles about three years ago, and this year we're seeing a lot more," said Ken Bowers, who runs the bookstore at the University of California at Santa Barbara. "The professors decide which pieces to include, and the bundles arrive, shrink-wrapped together. It's sold on the premise that it's a value to the student. But it also makes it possible to charge more, and has the effect of making it more difficult for students to get used books." 
Each new bundle gets an International Standard Book Number, the identification number assigned to every book. Professors place their orders using that number, and bookstores buy back and resell only copies with the numbers the professors request. So when professors order a new bundle, most bookstores do not sell used versions -- and only rarely do stores sell the component pieces separately.
At the bookstore at City College of New York, the ninth edition of "Chemistry, the Central Science" comes in a $139.25 bundle with no fewer than five supplements: a "math review toolkit," a CD-ROM, a student lecture notebook and booklet of solutions to a set of exercises, and a "peer-led team learning" book. 
Chemistry texts tend to be the most pricey. For Santa Barbara's Organic Chemistry 109A course, taught by Paula Bruice, the required text -- written, not coincidentally, by Professor Bruice -- is $170, bundled with a study guide. 
"The bookstore carries the bundle because that's cheaper for students who want to buy both," Professor Bruice said, adding that she and her colleagues tried to be sensitive to students' wallets. "If students want to buy just the text, very frequently they do that online or some other way."
Another chemistry text, "Solid State Chemistry and its Applications," sells for $275 at the Santa Barbara store. 
Over all, science texts -- and those for economics, computer and engineering courses -- are the most likely to cost more than $100. 
Humanities texts are generally cheaper, and much less likely to be bundled: French literature classes, for example, may ask for only an $8 copy of "Madame Bovary" and a $9 copy of "The Stranger." 
According to the National Association of College Stores, for every dollar the student pays for a textbook, 57 cents go toward the publisher's costs, and the publisher's after-tax profit is 7 cents. Typically, the author earns about 12 cents, and the bookstore receives about 18 cents for personnel and administrative costs, and less than 5 cents in pretax profits.
"An enormous amount of thought and expertise and technology go into the production of an organic chemistry text with the extraordinary four-color drawings the professors demand," said Judith Platt, a spokeswoman for the Association of American Publishers. "It's very different from a novel with a list price of $30." 
A few schools keep book costs down by offering textbook rental services. At Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Ill., for example, students pay $7.95 per credit hour to rent basic texts, buying only the workbooks. Southeastern Louisiana University, Central Missouri State University and some University of Wisconsin campuses have similar plans. While such plans save money, they have their own downsides: students are not allowed to write in their books, and, generally, professors must commit to using the same text for three years.
At most schools, though, students fend for themselves. 
Many now go online to find used copies of their texts through Amazon, Barnes & Noble or one of a host of Web businesses -- eCampus.com, half.com, textbookx.com and VarsityBooks.com -- that have sprung up to fill the niche. But some students said that last-minute searches resulted in modest savings that were not worth the delay.
Others save by sharing. 
"Last year I shared some books with my roommate," said Hannah Raymond, a Barnard student, adding that this year, although no longer roommates, they would still share a book. 
Many students say they are resigned to buying whatever text they are assigned.
"You got to do what you got to do," said Andrew Graeve, a Columbia junior who emerged from the bookstore with a $125.70 volume on econometric models and a $118 financial accounting book. 
Still, he counted himself lucky: he found the accounting text sold separately, without the study guide and CD-ROM that came in the $130 bundle. 
"I don't use study guides or manuals, so they're just a waste of my money," he said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Small Town U.S.A. Losing Air Service

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL 

 BODY:
Planning a business trip if you live in Ottumwa, Iowa, is not easy. The town of 25,000 people lost its only commercial air service two years ago when the regional carrier United Express ended its two daily flights to Chicago.
 Ottumwa has failed to lure another airline to fill the gap, so travelers have to drive two hours to the Des Moines airport or four hours to the one in Kansas City, Mo., to catch a flight. 
 Kendig Kneen, president of Al-jon, a local heavy-equipment manufacturer, says he and his sales staff generally make the longer trek to Kansas City because the fares are cheaper. United Express's pullout has put additional burdens on his budget and his employees as well, he says. He sometimes pays to fly customers in by charter plane, for example, and he has moved several of his sales and marketing staff of 16 out of Ottumwa and closer to their respective territories, in part to save on travel costs. 
 "The air service in Ottumwa wasn't always dependable, but losing it struck a crushing blow," said Mr. Kneen, 48, who has lived in the area for 43 years. "When a customer would ask how to get to Ottumwa, it was very advantageous to say, 'United flies right in here."'
 A lot of employers and business travelers in a lot of small towns like Ottumwa are experiencing the same frustrations as Mr. Kneen these days. Airlines are cutting back or even abandoning service to small airports across the country, forcing executives who live there to spend more time on the road and putting a drag on the local economies.
 Twenty-two airports that used to average at least one departure a day have lost all commercial air service since August 2001, and 101 have experienced service declines of more than 30 percent, according to an analysis by Back Aviation Solutions, an industry consultant group in New Haven.
 The reasons are not surprising. Since the Sept. 11 terrorists attacks, many cash-strapped airlines have been eliminating unprofitable runs to smaller cities. 
 Local residents have fueled the trend by driving to larger urban airports for cheaper flights. And as activity at smaller airports has dwindled, so has federal financial assistance. The Department of Transportation's Essential Air Service Program, which provides subsidies to small communities, for example, pulled the plug on Ottumwa's airport in September 2001 because the per-passenger costs exceeded the ceiling of $200. (The program, with an annual budget of $113 million, requires a community to be more than 70 miles away from a medium or large hub airport to receive a subsidy.) 
 Richard Fraley has witnessed the trend first hand. Mr. Fraley recalls how reliable the service was at the Four Corners Regional Airport in Farmington, N.M., a city of 38,000, in the early 1990's, when he was an engineering manager there for Burlington Resources. He left in 1996 for a position at the company's Houston office, and when he returned in 2001 as a Burlington division vice president, he says, the service had deteriorated sharply. Since then, things have only gotten worse. The number of daily flights has fallen by half, to 10 from 20. 
 According to airport manager Richard Stein, the number of passengers passing through the airport has slid to 38,000 last year from 95,000 in 1995. Mr. Stein said many business travelers who once frequented Four Corners now drove the 180 miles to Albuquerque's airport.
 Farmington's mayor, Bill Standley, said, "Cutting back in air service to a small or rural community is like saying you can't have fiber optics, it's starving the community." 
 "People are taking to the roads and driving long distances," Mr Standley said. "I'm afraid of seeing an increase in accidents."
 Mr. Fraley said his frustration only increased after three recent business connections originating in Farmington went awry. 
 Each time, his Mesa Airlines flight to Houston via Albuquerque was delayed, and so he rerouted the trip through Denver or Phoenix on other carriers. All the service cutbacks and delays have turned what once would have been a commute of a few hours into a full day's ordeal, he says, and he is thinking about switching from commercial flying to driving on the state's new four-lane highway or even chartering a plane. 
 Like many other business executives, he also turns to Webcasts and videoconferencing whenever possible. 
 "We don't make travel arrangements at just the drop of a hat anymore," he said.
Craig Walling, a recently retired power plant manager from Farmington, tells a similar tale. A frequent flier on America West Express to Phoenix, he said that after the Sept. 11 attacks, the airline began cutting flights and raising prices. He started to reduce his flying time when the airline moved its 6 a.m. flight to midmorning. 
 "It messed up my whole day," Mr. Walling recalled. "Lots of times the planes wouldn't even fly. They said it was mechanical problems, but we suspected there just weren't enough passengers." Mr. Stein, the airport manager, said he was unaware of any flights that were canceled because of a lack of passengers. 
 Elsewhere the refrain is much the same. In 2001, Mesa Airlines raised the fares on nonstop flights from the Hickory Regional airport in Hickory, N.C., to Charlotte, N.C., while reducing their number to four from nine. Then, in April 2002, it ended the service altogether -- a decision that the airport's development director, Duncan Cavanaugh, described as "almost a self-fulfilling prophecy."
 Mesa's departure not only complicated travel for employees and clients of several large fiber optic companies in Hickory, like Corning Cable Systems and Commscope, it also hurt resorts in the area that relied on the conference and convention trade, said Kent Tarbutton, the resort director of Chetola Mountain Resort in Blowing Rock, N.C., about 36 miles from the Hickory airport. 
 "We can't compete anymore for that business," Mr. Tarbutton said. "It's hard to court a Ford or Chrysler without air service." 
 Even airports that hang on to commercial service often have to adjust to the ebb and flow of competition -- and thus of ticket prices. After Continental Airlines began daily flights from the San Angelo Regional Airport-Mathis Field in San Angelo, Tex., to Houston in April 2000, ending American Eagle's monopoly there, fares fell. But Continental pulled out after the Sept. 11 attacks, leaving American Eagle again as the sole player; fares then rose, said Michael Dalby, the president of the San Angelo Chamber of Commerce.
 The price increases induced many travelers in San Angelo, a city of 100,000 people with thriving health care and sheep-and-goat ranching industries, to switch from flying to driving two hours to Midland or Odessa, three hours to San Antonio or Austin, and even seven hours to Houston. However, Sky West Airlines yesterday began nonstop flights to Houston. American Eagle's round-trip fare to Dallas has fallen from $500 to below $300 since the Sky West announcement on Aug. 7.
 Dan Stultz, the chief executive of Shannon Health Systems, a San Angelo medical center with 1,400 employees, is pleased that the city is getting a second airline. But he has come to accept the frequent comings and goings of commercial carriers.
 "It's just part of doing business," Mr. Stultz said. "I'm just glad that we've had one viable airline. I'm not bitter. I'm grateful we have flights to Dallas."

HEADLINE: Administration Joins Outcry Against China Trade Policies 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration today singled out China for criticism over trade practices, adding to a groundswell of objections against China in political and business circles.
 Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, announcing plans for a task force to investigate unfair trade restrictions, accused China of backsliding on promises to ease restrictions on foreign companies, dismantle old trade barriers and clamp down on software piracy. 
 "American manufacturers can compete against any country's white collars and blue collars, but we will not submit to competing against another country's choke collars," Mr. Evans told a gathering of executives in Detroit today. 
Under the plan he outlined, the Commerce Department will form an Unfair Trade Practices Team, which will chase down allegations about restrictions and barriers that seem to violate a government's promises to open its national markets.
The Bush administration has been making overtures toward manufacturers, which have eliminated 2.7 million jobs over three years and have complained that exports from China are their biggest problem.
But the administration is on the defensive. In Congress, Republican and Democratic lawmakers from industrial states are pushing for legislation that would threaten China with higher tariffs if it refuses to let its currency, the yuan, float at market rates. Manufacturers complain that China has kept its exports artificially cheap by keeping the yuan undervalued against the dollar.
On Tuesday, moreover, the United States Chamber of Commerce plans to release a report accusing China of failing to open its markets as it promised to win acceptance in the World Trade Organization.
The report says China has yet to relax restrictions on the ability of American companies to distribute their products or expand geographically. And it repeats longstanding complaints that Chinese officials do not do enough to stop illegal copying of software and music or counterfeit versions of brand-name products.
"The record can be better, and should be better," said Myron Brilliant, the vice president in charge of Asia issues at the Chamber of Commerce. "China made commitments to the international business community and to the American business community. We want to see the fruits of their commitments."
Chinese officials have said that they do not manipulate their currency and that they have kept it at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar for almost a decade. And although American trade experts complain that China has been slow to fulfill many of its promises on opening markets, they also acknowledge that it made progress on many fronts, including the passage of laws intended to prevent software piracy.
In addition to establishing a new watchdog group on trade practices, the Commerce Department plans to set up an Office of Industry Analysis, which would examine the impact of regulations on manufactuers. And it will create a new assistant secretary responsible for promoting exports.
The new team to investigate unfair trade practices will be carrying on a function that is already a responsibility of the Commerce Department. The department's International Trade Administration has been adjudicating such issues for years. But administration officials are eager to show that they are taking a tough line, and the new team may well signal a more combative approach to other nations' trade policies.
Democratic opponents of President Bush quickly denounced Mr. Evans's tough language on China as an inadequate response to the loss of American manufacturing jobs.
"We've been hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs for the last two and a half years, and during that time George W. Bush hasn't even offered a Band-Aid," a Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said today. 
In Congress, Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans are pushing for legislation that would impose import tariffs on Chinese products that would be comparable to the amount they say China's currency is undervalued. 
"The problem facing American industry has nothing to do with the way the Commerce Department is set up," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and one of the bill's sponsors. "The problem is China and the manipulation of the yuan."

HEADLINE: TEACHERS BARTER WITH WORK RULES 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
New York City's teachers' union will propose a wide-ranging experiment to do away with the bulk of the work rules that have long enraged city officials in exchange for getting teachers a greater say in how individual schools are run, the union president, Randi Weingarten, said yesterday.
 The proposal, intended for perhaps 100 schools or more, would discard rules that govern everything from the length of classes to the amount of teacher preparation time. Principals could then negotiate pared-down work agreements with their staffs, which teachers would approve. 
 "What if you had trust, fairness and collaboration substitute for lock-step rules?" Ms. Weingarten said in an interview. "Except for things like salaries, pensions, medical, safety, due process and things covered by law, maybe virtually everything else should be negotiable." 
By discussing her proposal ahead of contract talks scheduled to start tomorrow, Ms. Weingarten appeared to be maneuvering to pre-empt demands for concessions on the work rules by Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein and to extend a peace offering after months of acrimony. 
Mr. Klein reacted positively yesterday. In fact, he quickly pushed to broaden the plan, calling for the elimination of work rules systemwide. "We believe the burden of the current contract should be lifted from all our schools," said Peter Kerr, a spokesman for Mr. Klein.
The union's proposal signaled that the coming contract talks are likely to focus more on working conditions and management structures than on salary increases, which will be hard to achieve given the weak economy and the large raises the union won last year in exchange for a 100-minute increase in the workweek.
That agreement, reached in June 2002, provided for raises of between 16 percent and 22 percent over 30 months, but it was mostly retroactive, and the contract expired on May 31.
Ms. Weingarten and many of her members are angry that Mr. Klein has not given teachers a larger role in his sweeping effort to overhaul the school system, and yesterday she described her plan to eliminate work rules as a way to get teachers the professional respect they deserve.
"We want to have real school-based professional latitude and decision-making," she said.
The talks between the city and the United Federation of Teachers are set to start at a low point in municipal labor relations. Contracts for all but 7,500 of the city's 286,000 employees have expired and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has taken a tough stance, demanding concessions to pay for any raises.
Any negotiating by the teachers' union is complicated by Ms. Weingarten's added role as chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, with obligations not only to the 80,000 teachers and 27,000 other active members of the teachers' federation, but also to other labor groups. 
Ms. Weingarten's plan reflects the thinking of national leaders of teachers' unions. In a speech in 1999, Sandra Feldman, Ms. Weingarten's predecessor at the United Federation of Teachers and now president of the American Federation of Teachers, urged local unions to move away from contracts laden with work rules in favor of streamlined or "thin" contracts tailored to individual schools in exchange for giving teachers a larger voice in the management of schools.
But large school districts have made little progress in this direction. In Boston, for example, officials largely failed in contract negotiations three years ago to curtail seniority rules that they said hindered hiring and staffing decisions.
In New York City, however, the teachers' federation has its own small example of a thin contract -- an agreement that it reached between teachers and the board at the Amber Charter School on East 106th Street in Manhattan. The entire contract is six pages, including salary steps and a no-strike clause. That compares with more than 200 pages in the general teachers' contract.
Ms. Weingarten said her proposal was modeled after a provision that already exists in the contract for "school-based option," which allows a school's union chapter and principal to modify rules on class size, teacher assignments and schedules, provided that 55 percent of the staff votes for the change. 
In these cases, the staff chooses to form school-based management teams, made up of teachers, administrators and parents, and develop policies with the principal. Ms. Weingarten said she envisioned a similar "steering committee" in any school developing its own work rules. 
Among the rules that could change is one that excuses teachers from supervising lunch and from other chores outside the classroom.
Flexibility on the rules would also allow creative scheduling of class time, perhaps making it easier to accommodate the double-blocks of English and math required by the city's new uniform curriculums.
Ms. Weingarten said that the work-rule experiment should be limited perhaps to one of the new 10 instructional regions, which contain about 75 to 150 schools. "You want to do something that could work instead of having something that's so big that it's doomed by it's size," she said, taking a not-so-subtle jab at Mr. Klein's citywide overhaul. 
Mr. Kerr, the chancellor's spokesman, called Ms. Weingarten's inclination to limit the plan "strangely and uncharacteristically timid."
Education experts said that the work rules can hinder the effective operation of schools, but that over the years had proven to be a scapegoat for officials who failed to improve the system. 
"It imposes constraints in how you can organize, schedule and operate schools," Thomas Sobol, a former New York State education commissioner, said of the contract. "And it has been an excuse for not doing anything." 
Dr. Sobol, now a professor at Columbia University's Teachers College, said he supported ending the rules. "That sounds so enlightened it puts me on my guard," he said.
Anthony P. Coles, a deputy mayor under Rudolph W. Giuliani, applauded the idea of eliminating work rules.
"The teachers' contract has some very antiquated, very restrictive rules that inhibit the education of children," Mr. Coles said. "Wouldn't it be great if parents could look at the contract and say, 'I understand why that provision is in there.' It seems to me a plain English union contract ought to be a goal."

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
Women's Soccer League Folds on World Cup's Eve

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
Five days before the start of the World Cup, the development of professional women's soccer in this country suffered a huge blow yesterday when the Women's United Soccer Association announced that it was suspending operations after three seasons.
 Some 56 players from several countries who are participating in the Women's World Cup, which is scheduled to begin Saturday, currently or formerly played in the eight-team W.U.S.A. While the league is considered the world's best for women, its revenues fell far below the level of its talent. 
 The shutdown of the league now leaves the United States with just the Women's National Basketball Association as a top-flight professional league and demonstrates the difficulties that women's sports -- particularly independent leagues -- have in attracting corporate sponsors.
The possibility of reviving the W.U.S.A. was left open if enough sponsorship could be secured in the coming months. If the league dies, the impact on future World Cups and Olympics for the American women's national team will not be immediately known. The United States won the Women's World Cup in 1991 and 1999 when there was no league, but Mia Hamm and other star players will retire soon, and it is uncertain how the next generation of players will be developed. 
In starting the W.U.S.A., investors from the cable television industry like Comcast and Time Warner made financial assumptions involving corporate sponsorship, debt, attendance and television exposure that did not meet projections.
After an initial outlay of $40 million, which had been the planned budget for five years, investors poured another $60 million into operating costs as the W.U.S.A. kept losing money -- $46 million the first season in 2001, $24 million in 2002 and an estimated $17 million to $19 million for the recently concluded third season, according to the league office.
The league had been hoping to attract eight corporate sponsors, each paying $2.5 million, but only Hyundai and Johnson & Johnson signed on at that level in a weak economy. Star players like Hamm agreed to take pay cuts from $80,000 to $60,000 this year, and rosters were trimmed from 18 to 16 players, but these belt-tightening measures could not compensate for a severe lack of revenue in the face of corporate indifference.
While the timing was awkward, the decision to shut the W.U.S.A.'s doors was made today so that the league could pay its debts and offer a sufficient severance package to its employees, John Hendricks, the league's founder and chairman, said in a conference call with reporters.
Despite the effect on morale, Julie Foudy, captain of the United States national team and a member of the WUSA's board of governors, said the players wanted the announcement to be made before the World Cup so that news would not leak during the tournament and become an even greater distraction. The United States opens play on Sunday in Washington against Sweden.
Foudy and Hamm had tears in their eyes as they discussed the shutdown of the league after a scrimmage today at the University of Virginia. However, the American players said they would use the 16-team World Cup, which runs through Oct. 12, as a kind of audition for potential sponsors who might be willing to save the women's league as much as a matter of social conscience as a return on investment.
League officials and players acknowledged that this would be difficult, given the fragile state of the economy, the difficulty of attracting sponsorship for women's sports and overall decreases in attendance and television ratings for sports in this country.
"I haven't given up," Hamm said. "I believe too much in the product and players."
Today's announcement is sure to raise more questions about whether soccer will ever gain a strong foothold in this country. On many levels, it has. Soccer is a popular youth and high school sport. A professional league, Major League Soccer, exists for men. However, the WUSA had difficulty attracting much more than 100,000 households to its televised games, and attendance dropped from 8,116 in 2001 to 6,667 this year.
"It's not that women's sports can't make it," Foudy said, adding that the problem was convincing corporations to sponsor women's sports. "It's taking a chance," she said. "It's a scary proposition."
Nineteen of the 20 players on the American national team play in the WUSA. (The other is still in college.) The league's competitiveness has been credited with raising the skill level and professionalism of players from this country and others such as Germany, Norway, Brazil, Canada and China. Several American players would never have made the World Cup team without a league to showcase their talents.
One of them is midfielder Shannon Boxx of the New York Power, who had never played with the national team until last month, but is expected to be a starter in the World Cup.
If the league is not revived, Boxx said it would be "devastating." Americans who wanted to continue professional careers would have to seek out semiprofessional leagues in Europe. "After college, there is no place to play," Boxx said. "As a young female athlete, your goal is to make the national team. How do you get there?"
Even with good intentions of starting a women's league, investors have acknowledge they made mistakes. The first was hiring Barbara Allen, a former Quaker Oats executive, to be the league's initial chief executive. She knew little about soccer, commuted from Denver to WUSA headquarters in New York the first season and proved an ineffective leader. She left after one season.
Sufficient television exposure also proved elusive. Most games last season were broadcast on the PAX network, not a traditional sports channel. And, officials conceded, the league never really decided who its target audience should be - young girls or traditional sports fans.
"I was intoxicated by what I witnessed in the 1999 World Cup and all the sponsorship surrounding that event and mistakenly assumed that would flow over to the league," Hendricks said, referring to the hugely successful women's tournament played in the United States four years ago.
An independent women's soccer league can sustain itself if sufficient corporate sponsorship is found, said Hendricks, who founded the Discovery Channel. Otherwise, he said, in order to survive, a league would likely have to align itself with another league such as MLS or even the National Football League, which could provide financial, personnel and stadium support. The WNBA exists under this model in its affiliation with the National Basketball Association.
April Heinrichs, coach of the national team, said there was "a dark cloud hanging over our camp right now" as the United States prepares to defend its world championship. However, she and several players said the suspension of the WUSA would provide motivation for the World Cup.
"We push through, and hopefully this World Cup will stimulate some potential sponsors and investors," Hamm said.

HEADLINE: Luring Customers Back to the Water 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: CANNES, France, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
What does a designer of Italian luxury motorboats do when he visits the coast of Maine? He goes home and builds a $900,000 lobster boat.
 The annual boating trade fair opened here Wednesday and closed Monday, lifting the curtain on a series of big boating fairs stretching over the next few weeks from here to Genoa, Italy, to Annapolis, Md., to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
 This year, retro is in, sort of like PT Cruisers in the boating world.
 At Ferretti, the big Italian maker of expensive motorboats for the very wealthy, one star of the show was its new lobster boat.
 Lobster traps? "There's room for that, too," said Augusto Balestra, project manager for Ferretti's 51-foot lobster boat, the Dolphin. He made several visits to Maine to refine the design. 
 Across the harbor of this French Mediterranean port, the big French Beneteau yards best known for sailboats unveiled the Swift Trawler. Designed to evoke vaguely the clunky vessels French fishermen once used to haul nets, the Trawler boasts twin 350-horsepower diesel engines, finely outfitted cabins in blond wood, and all the electronic gear for navigating, watching TV, or just tapping into the Internet that go into expensive motorboats today. Selling for about $285,000, the Trawler goes on sale in the United States next year.
 "It's functional and seaworthy, yet also beautiful," said Laurent Fabre, project manager for the Trawler. The fairs are being watched closely. In the heady years of the 1990's, prosperity attracted customers who might never have thought of themselves as yacht owners before. Boating blossomed into a $30-billion-a-year business in the United States alone. But the stock market reversal and general economic slump slowed the industry. Growth rates for retail spending on boating in the United States went from fevered in 2000 to a slight drop the following year and around 4 percent in 2002, adjusted for inflation, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association.
 So now, with quirky new models and bigger and fully equipped boats, the industry is trying to lure customers back to the water, and the signs are that they are coming.
 "This year was a tough year, but the last 60 days have shown signs perhaps of a revival," said David Branch, publisher of the trade publication Power & Motoryacht, who attended the fair.
 Boating also serves as a bellwether for the overall economy. "Most of the customers for these boats are smart businessmen," Mr. Branch said. "As soon as they smell a turnaround, they're going to get back in."
 Edward M. Mahoney, director of the Recreational Marine Research Center at Michigan State University in East Lansing, said he estimated the market could grow more than it did last year. 
 Sales thus far this year "have not met the expectations" of boating companies, said Mr. Mahoney, who regularly surveys boating business sentiment. "Yet they remain optimistic for the long term."
 America's ability to weather the storm is crucial for Europe's boating industry, which ships its vessels increasingly to the United States. Beneteau, which manufactures sailboats at a factory in Marion, S.C., will show the Swift Trawler at the Annapolis show this month.
 "The potential in the United States is enormous," said Mr. Fabre, whose Trawler is intended to lower Beneteau's reliance on sailboats, the smaller segment of the boating market. 
 In February, Beneteau's catamaran division, Lagoon, will introduce in Florida a new 44-foot model that is outfitted with an unusual flying bridge. It will come equipped with a choice of diesel or diesel-electric engines.
 But more important, a revival of the American economy would probably lap over to Europe, and a rising tide would lift all boats. Guy Puygauthier, the French importer of Hunter Yachts, a unit of the Luhrs Marine Group in Florida, said perspectives on Europe remained uncertain. Asked how many of Hunter's sleek sailboats he expected to sell this year, he replied, "If I'm pessimistic, 30; if I'm optimistic, 50."
 The Cannes show features tiny runabouts and inflatable boats alongside immense yachts that are tantamount to floating mansions. There are cute boats and in-your-face boats, some with names like Predator and Challenger, others called Winnie the Pooh.
 Ferretti's lobster boat, Mr. Balestra said, is intended for European boat owners who may want it as a second boat. "For lovers of the sea, it's kind of a fulfillment of their dreams," he said. "We look a lot at the market, and one of the niches that is growing is the lobster boat."
 European yacht builders like Beneteau have made their deepest market in the American market for sailboats, which is a small fraction of the huge market for powerboats. But yacht builders from France, Italy, Germany and elsewhere are increasingly transforming the business into a high-end branch of the luxury goods arena by specializing in yachts that are to sailing what Ferraris are to driving.
 Massimo Franchini lounged in front of his 76-foot sailboat, Romeo & Co., which is custom-built for customers for $4 million, including $1 million worth of electronic technology, like cable television and fax, telephone and Internet connections. Boats like Romeo & Co., which sleep 8 to 10, feature special glass from Murano, the island in the Venice lagoon, in cabin windows, and multiple steering systems and automatic sail-furling equipment that enable them to be handled easily by two people.
 Mr. Franchini, 50, recently opened offices in Chicago and plans a big push on the American market starting in 2005. "We have some contacts with individuals," he said, "but you must have a sales and service structure that is adequate."
 Of course, the need to pack modern technology into today's boats has set off a boom among seaborne-electronics companies, and they were out in force.
 Clive Widdowson, technical director of AGC Marine Telecom in Antibes, France, which markets the telecommunications equipment of Sea Tel of Concord, Calif., in Europe, said that while satellite television was common on expensive yachts, Internet and telephone connections were becoming equally indispensable.
 "The equipment is common on cruise ships, though yachts usually didn't have room," he said. Now, new miniaturized systems ranging in price from $9,000 to $37,000 that permit Internet, television and phone connections are fast becoming standard equipment even on small boats, he said.
 European yacht builders have traditionally been small, family-owned yards, but as the industry expands and goes global, consolidation is setting in.
 "It's incredibly fragmented," said Paolo Colonna, the president for Italy of the buyout firm Permira, who attended the fair. "There are thousands of little properties."
 In the 1990's, Permira helped Ferretti with a series of acquisitions, then took a stake in the company before Ferretti made an initial public offering in 2000. Earlier this year, Permira acquired Ferretti and began a three-year, $200 million investment program to upgrade boat yards at four sites in Italy.
 Roberto Odierna, an analyst at Citigroup Smith Barney in London, said: "The cost of capital was low and business was quite bad. It was the ideal time for a venture capital buyout."
 The American market for small powerboats was hit by the stock market slowdown, Mr. Colonna said, while sales of the big expensive yachts that Ferretti builds suffered after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. "It precipitated a crisis," he said. "No one wanted to think about that kind of having fun." Since May, he said, signs of revival in the United States, where Ferretti generates almost 20 percent of its revenue, have been multiplying.
 As visitors to the fair scrambled over the boats, Mr. Colonna said he remained bullish on big boats. "The average ticket is $2 million," he said. "We say it's a luxury toy."
 "It's the maximum of luxury," he said.

Great Sport Had Bad Bottom Line

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THEY called him St. John. He was the Daddy Warbucks of women's soccer.
 At ceremonies of the Women's United Soccer Association, the greatest female players in the world would give John S. Hendricks a standing ovation, imploring him to keep up his noble cause. 
 Imagine Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams and Jason Giambi getting up in public and begging George Steinbrenner to continue underwriting the Yankees. Stick with it, Boss. Think of the urchins who depend on us for inspiration. 
 Julie Foudy and Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain depended on the largess of one rather shy television entrepreneur. Almost from the start, they knew St. John had the printouts that would justify pulling the plug on the league.
 Yesterday, St. John announced the suspension of the league, five days before the opening game of the Women's World Cup in the United States -- brutal timing for an event that was not even supposed to be here. The World Cup, which was moved from China because of the SARS crisis, will go forward, depending on Hurricane Isabel, but 43 proud professionals who were paid by the W.U.S.A. last season and who will play in the Cup must now consider themselves unemployed. 
 St. John, the savior, the knight in shining armor, often told of becoming captivated by women's soccer after watching his daughter play in a youth league, and after watching the full stadiums and the midsummer madness of the 1999 World Cup in the United States. 
 "I was intoxicated by what I witnessed in 1999," Hendricks said yesterday, "and mistakenly assumed it would flow over." 
 St. John founded the Discovery Channel and has dealt in properties to place on the cable networks. At the cost of millions of dollars, he came to realize that there was precious little corporate money either for female athletes or for soccer.
 This is a very sad realization for female athletes. In a downsized world economy, few crumbs are left over for them. Tiger Woods and the grim empire of the National Football League command gigantic sums of money from sponsors (and a few female golfers and tennis players don't do badly), but there was no money left for charismatic, skillful soccer players.
 This sad reality hits after a quarter-century of Title IX, after the upgrading of women's sports programs in schools and after the waves of publicity for tall women shooting baskets and for nimble women kicking goals. Ratings are down for almost all sports, and now there is a real casualty.
 "There is no oughts and shoulds in sports television," said Neal Pilson, the noted sports-television consultant, who was trying to help the W.U.S.A. "It's whether you can generate revenue.
 "Soccer is not a widely viewed sport in this country, and organized, professional women's sports are relatively new to our country."
 Fair enough. Soccer still has a foreign ring for the general American public, which has so many other compelling sports to follow. And these are hard times. 
 Just the other day, Bud Selig, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, was saying, "I can't find a buyer for the Montreal team," then added, "I can't find a buyer for Minnesota, either." Several other franchises are in trouble, and pro hockey is shaky, while pro basketball and football soldier forward.
 Major League Soccer is holding its own, partly because it can plug into world soccer, marketing an emerging goalkeeper like Tim Howard, who has won four of five starts for Manchester United. M.L.S. leased some of its stadiums for the Women's World Cup, and also bought the television rights. But it could not act as a big brother to women's soccer.
 "I don't think this is a comment about soccer, because we are as bullish as ever about M.L.S.," said Don Garber, the M.L.S. commissioner. "Possibly it is a comment on women's professional sports, which, as the father of a teenage daughter who plays field hockey, I find unfortunate. These women are role models for the country." 
 The suspension of the W.U.S.A. is sad because both the athletes and their game are compelling. The women are not as fast or as powerful as the men, but they depend on teamwork and strategy. In barely more than a decade, the game has developed nasty rivalries, like United States-Norway, as well as gritty stars, now retired, like Linda Medalen, an Oslo detective who openly defied her American opponents, and Michelle Akers, a leonine predator who had to be carried out of the 1999 championship game. 
 It wasn't enough. Like St. John, I would have bet that waves of young women and their families would flock to W.U.S.A. games in places like suburban Long Island, where I live. But attendance for the New York Power was a disaster, and the league cut jobs, whittled salaries and wheedled corporate America for sponsorships that did not materialize. 
 In the next three weeks, the games of the Women's World Cup should be terrific. The skill level keeps rising because European, African, Asian and Hispanic women want to play. The W.U.S.A. beacon promised salaries, exposure, competition, fun, crowds. 
 Daddy Warbucks could not go on forever. For the W.U.S.A., the sun will not come up tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Retail Operator At Trade Center Is Pulling Out Of the Deal 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Westfield America, the mall operator that owns the lease for retail space at the World Trade Center, said yesterday that it was negotiating a cash settlement to pull out of its deal on the downtown complex.
 While the move could clear the way for significant design changes sought by rebuilding officials, it raises questions about how much money will be available for the downtown project if there are other buyouts. 
 Westfield, the operator of the underground mall that was destroyed at thetrade center, has resisted efforts to create more retailing at street level. Yesterday, the company said that it had signed a nonbinding letter of intent with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to give up its contract for $140 million.
"We are selling our interests to the Port to help simplify the overall rebuilding process and expedite the rebuilding of the World Trade Center," said Peter Lowey, the company's chief executive, in a statement. 
The Port Authority, the owner of the 16-acre site, said that it was pleased to "enter into discussions" with Westfield. It said that an agreement would "allow the best interests of the public to take precedence in the development of appropriate retail space."
Officials involved in the negotiations said that Westfield recognized that it would take 10 to 15 years to rebuild the complex, which was once one of the highest-grossing malls in the country, with hundreds of stores. Westfield, a publicly traded company based in Australia, was not confident that the current proposals for retail space would ever generate average sales of $900 a square foot, as the trade center did in 2000, according to executives who have talked with the mall operator. So the company would rather get out.
The announcement illuminates a shift in the discussions over the trade center site, from the design of the site and its memorial to more bottom-line financial concerns.
Westfield's announcement comes 12 days after GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation sued the Port Authority and the developer Larry Silverstein over the $563 million loan it provided Mr. Silverstein and his partners when they acquired the trade center lease. GMAC, which says its loan is secured only by the insurance money, has asked a judge to freeze payments to Mr. Silverstein. Over the last nine months, it has refused to release any insurance proceeds to Mr. Silverstein that would allow him to pay for architects involved in rebuilding.
The insurance companies have put $1.9 billion into an escrow account controlled by GMAC. About $600 million of that total has been spent on ground rent, loan payments and items covered by business interruption insurance.
Last Wednesday, Port Authority commissioners quietly decided to begin discussions to buy out GMAC's mortgage so that the lender would not become an impediment.
Mr. Silverstein and the Port Authority are also awaiting a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in their battle against the insurance companies that provided coverage for the trade center. Mr. Silverstein contends that he is entitled to a double payment of nearly $7 billion because two planes hit two towers in what he describes as two separate "occurrences" on Sept. 11.
The insurance companies contend that the developer is due only the policy limit, about $3.5 billion, a sum that Mr. Silverstein has said is not enough to rebuild the trade center.
Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority, said the agency was in fundamental agreement with having Mr. Silverstein pay off the GMAC loan, as long as the authority was protected against a lower-than-expected insurance payout.
The elimination of GMAC and Westfield would presumably reduce some of the squabbling over the designs. Westfield, for one, put up $127 million in July 2001 for its retail leases based on estimates of 150,000 office workers and visitors a day. The company opposed efforts to move stores from below ground to create a more energetic street life.
But buyouts could also reduce the money available for rebuilding, an especiallycritical issue if Mr. Silverstein loses his legal battle and the insurers pay out only $3.2 billion. That figure would drop to about $2.2 billion after taking into account the buyouts and money already spent. The first office building, which is in the design stage, will cost as much as $1.5 billion, and the overall rebuilding project is expected to cost more than $7 billion.
"I've long been concerned that no one is keeping an eye on the finances," said Elliott Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. "Despite the city's current fiscal crisis, they say we can do anything downtown and it'll be successful. But there's a complex set of interests at work here and only so much money."
"Somebody's got to foot the bill at the end of the day," said one executive involved in buyout negotiations. "I don't think everyone's worked out the economics yet." 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 19, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about negotiations by Westfield America to end its contract to manage the retail space at the World Trade Center site misstated the number of stores in the original underground mall. It was about 75 -- specialty stores, restaurants and service retailers -- not hundreds.

HEADLINE: Bush Defends New Environmental Rules 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: MONROE, Mich., Sept. 15 

 BODY:
President Bush toured one of the nation's largest power plants today and hailed the sprawling complex here as a symbol of how the relaxation of clean air rules would boost the economy and protect the environment.
 After donning a white hard hat and viewing the roaring turbine generators at the Detroit Edison plant here, Mr. Bush told cheering workers that cumbersome and complicated government regulations had prevented the plant from upgrading to cleaner and more efficient generators for nearly five years. 
 Last month, in one of the most far-reaching environmental decisions of his tenure, Mr. Bush eliminated those rules, allowing thousands of power plants, refineries and factories to make extensive upgrades that increase pollutants without having to install new antipollution devices. The president said other regulations, as well as the passage of his bill known as the Clear Skies initiative, would keep the air clean. 
"Regulations intended to enhance air quality made it really difficult for companies to do that which is necessary, to not only produce more energy, but to do it in a cleaner way," Mr. Bush said today. "It makes sense to change these regulations. It makes sense for the workplace environment. It makes sense for the protection of the air."
But the trip to the Detroit plant, intended as a broad defense of the Bush administration's clean air policy, quickly reignited the fierce debate between government officials and environmental groups. While Mr. Bush was greeting workers, environmentalists said the relaxation of clean air rules known as the new source review would allow this plant to increase emissions by more than 30,000 tons a year, a 56 percent increase over current levels.
The groups also noted that the government's own analysis of the effect of the Clear Skies bill found that the Monroe plant would not decrease its emissions of soot-forming sulfur dioxide.
In 2001, the plant emitted 102,700 tons of sulfur dioxide, according to the Environmental Protection Agency analysis, which was released in July. The plant, which provides electricity to 2.1 million people, is expected to continue to emit 102,700 tons of soot if the proposal becomes law. 
"The very power plant the president has chosen to spotlight today demonstrates that his policies won't work," said Conrad Schneider, the advocacy director of the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group. "We want to see real power plant cleanup legislation that will protect the health of every American." 
Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent and ranking minority member on the Environment and Public Works Committee, echoed those concerns. He described Mr. Bush's policies as "the exact opposite of what the nation needs."
"The administration's deregulatory agenda, specifically the gutting of the new source review program, will lead to more pollution and therefore more disease and premature deaths," Mr. Jeffords said. 
Government officials dismissed the concerns raised by environmental groups.
"They're wrong," said James L. Connaughton, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House advisory group. 
Officials pointed to new data, released today, showing that air quality in the United States had gotten cleaner in recent decades even as economic growth had surged. Total emissions had declined by 48 percent since 1970, Bush administration officials said, adding that the new source review had been incidental to that trend.
Eliminating the rules will allow companies to modernize more easily, leading to greater efficiency, officials said, while other regulations will continue to promote clean skies.
"The air must, as a matter of law and as a matter of the will of this administration, must get better," Mr. Connaughton said. "What we are talking about today are the sensible policies, the smart ways to achieve those results while promoting economic growth."
Government officials and company executives said Detroit Edison planned to reduce its emissions despite the conclusions of the Environmental Protection Agency analysis. 
Mr. Bush also called today for mandatory reliability standards for the country's electrical grid and for passage of the Clear Skies initiative, which seeks to cut emissions from all power plants by 70 percent by 2018, but would not impose the standard uniformly, allowing operators to trade "pollution credits" -- the right to pollute -- among themselves.
"I expect Congress to act," Mr. Bush said of the bill. "Instead of playing politics with environmental legislation, we need to come together and do what's right for American workers and American families."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: LIFE IN BAGHDAD; 
Open War Over, Iraqis Focus On Crime and a Hunt for Jobs

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
The judge sits in his chambers, waiting.
 He is waiting for the United States military to deliver the first batch of prisoners for trial in the newly refurbished criminal court in Kharkh District. 
 The judge, Nawar Mohammed Nasser, the court's chief justice, has grown accustomed to waiting. He was promised prisoners on Aug. 16. No one showed up. It happened again on Aug. 23, then on Sept. 6 and once more on Sept. 9. 
"It's not a problem with the judicial system," said the 53-year-old judge, nattily dressed in a gray suit and a deep gray tie with white polka dots. "It's a problem with the coalition forces. 
"If they cannot get prisoners to court at the right time, how can we expect them to run the entire administration, the entire state -- to establish a new order in Iraq?"
The question of whether the Americans can transform Iraq is asked with increasing frequency. 
Iraqis, in general thrilled to be freed from the long, sinister rule of Saddam Hussein, had high expectations that the arrival of the Americans would utterly transform their lives. 
As the occupation enters its sixth month, however, they are looking for something, anything, they can hold in their hands that assures them that the future will be better -- and they cannot find it.
The residents of Baghdad, more than in any other part of the country, object to living with rampant crime, terrorist bombings, constant power cuts, an ill-defined political process, sluggish reconstruction and a mostly American administration that remains largely inaccessible in its bunkered palaces. 
"We have no idea how to follow our proposals through the system," said Adel Abdel Mahdi, a senior official with the main Shiite political group, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, which sits on the Iraqi Governing Council. 
"They tell us our ideas are good, but we have no idea whether they are discussed, whether there is a decision. It's very frustrating."
The Americans tend to counsel patience and promise that things will improve. Iraqis say they could be patient if someone explained the plan to them in a coherent way. 
"When they came to Iraq, they didn't really have a plan for what happens next," said Ali Sahib al-Qamoosi, a 33-year-old businessman who celebrated his newfound freedom by opening an Internet cafe. "I say I'm optimistic, but it's only because things were so bad before, that they could never get worse."

At Baghdad Central Morgue
Dr. Faiq Amin Bakr, director of the Baghdad Central Morgue for the past 13 years, reels off the grim statistics that confirm to Iraqis that they have entered what they see as a terrifyingly lawless twilight zone: 462 people dead under suspicious circumstances or in automobile accidents in May, some 70 percent from gunshot wounds; 626 in June; 751 in July; 872 in August. By comparison, last year there were 237 deaths in July, one of the highest months, with just 21 from gunfire. 
Dozens of Iraqis mill around outside, their dead relatives a cross-section of ill-fated lives.
A police officer arrives with an ambulance bearing the body of an unidentified man, roughly 21 years old, shot dead in the street, probably the victim of a carjacking. 
One family is collecting the body of their 25-year-old cousin, killed by a bullet in the neck, probably a burst of celebratory gunfire during a wedding. 
A second family is collecting the body of a 30-year-old night watchman at a large state-owned factory, shot dead by looters. 
Several families from Abu Ghraib are there to gather some of the four victims, including an 8-year-old girl, who they said were shot dead by American soldiers in the market after a grenade was thrown at an armored personnel carrier. 
An American military spokesman in Baghdad confirmed that one soldier was wounded in a grenade attack but denied that the soldiers, from the First Armored Division, fired back. 
"The American soldiers are so panicky that if a tire bursts in the street, they start shooting," said Nabil Saleh Al-ani, a cousin of victim. 
Dr. Bakr, the morgue's director, said he had never seen street crime like this. 
"When you see your people are killed every day," he said, "you imagine the amount of crime in the country, you imagine how much insecurity there is."

At the Police Station
Lt. Hussein al-Saedi, a former army officer now assigned to Al Nasr Police Station in the sprawling slum called Thawra, harbors nostalgia for the old ways. 
"Before, we used to bring the guy, we beat him, hung him by a hook on the ceiling, and he would confess every single criminal act he committed since he was a toddler," he said. "Before, it was much better. Before, we used to solve these cases in one night." 
Cpl. Zuhair Mudthafir argues otherwise. He recently completed a three-week American course to retrain officers in work like interrogation, note-taking and human rights. "You know, the Americans have genius officers who find ways to extract confessions from defendants without beating them," he says. 
At the police academy, where the courses are taught, Capt. Jason Brandt, a reservist from San Diego, explains that it is going to take some time to train an estimated 5,500 officers, given that they can handle only about 230 at a time. 
"They have a lot of pride; they think they are perfect," said Specialist Corey Mann, a 20-year-old college student serving with the 18th Military Police Brigade. "When they first come in here, they say 'We don't have drugs, we don't have domestic violence and the Koran says we can hit our women, anyway.' "
There are frequent discussions about where to draw the line between cultural traditions and police work. The Iraqi police generally like the course. It makes them feel part of the world. Some critics say the United States is putting the cart before the horse, teaching human rights rather than training new police, just as they talk about privatizing universities at a time when most Iraqis can barely afford books.
Those who have had frequent dealings with the police appreciate the difference, though. 
"When the big dictator toppled, all the little dictators changed," said Adnan Jabar al-Saidi, a 31-year-old lawyer who helps run the Iraqi Human Rights Association. "It's as if they were taking their cue from the big dictator."
The main problem with the police, senior officials admit, is that there are just not enough and they remain ill equipped. Three weeks ago, the 60 officers at Al Nasr shared seven guns, two cars and no radios. They told a visitor to leave the area before nightfall because it was too dangerous even for them to venture out.
This week they have 44 guns -- mostly rifles -- and three radios. They can only use the radios every other day, however, because they have to take them to headquarters to recharge the batteries. 
They also lost their two cars to an emergency police unit. When they arrest someone now, they hail a cab. 
There are some 30,000 police officers throughout the country, including about 14,000 in Baghdad. 
Ayad Alawi, a member of the Iraqi Governing Council whose senior aide was appointed minister of the interior, said that he expected 40,000 officers would be deployed by the end of October, and that that should help turn the tide. In addition, the first 1,200-member brigade of the Iraqi Civil Defense Force, a kind of paramilitary unit, are due to complete their training. 
Once there are more police officers and more jobs for everyone, he believes, the number of people willing to carry out attacks will dwindle. He recalled a recent interrogation in which suspects involved in a grenade attack on American military vehicles said they did it for $200.

The Reconstruction Scene
Adnan Janabi, the part owner of a construction company, believes the solution to the rampant crime will be to distribute contracts to an array of Iraqi companies to refurbish the forest of burned government buildings in Baghdad. That would get the unemployed off the streets. 
The Baghdad City Council recently hired 11,000 men at $3 a day for a month to clean the streets. That helped spread around a little money, one councilman said, but it is seen as too limited. 
Mr. Janabi has been either unable to reach the officials involved or has hit the Iraq reconstruction "Catch-22."
He has been told that American government regulations require numerous studies before any reconstruction can get started -- and that the people needed to conduct the studies do not want to come to Iraq because of the dire security conditions. 
He points at the sidewalks bursting with electronic equipment and other consumer items; despite the frequent hijackings and thievery on the road from Amman, Jordan, the demands of the booming market are such that the traders absorb the losses. 
Private Iraqi construction firms would take similar risks, working under the danger of attack just to get the business, Mr. Janabi says. 
"They tell us there is no security, that they cannot rehabilitate the oil sector, that we cannot rehabilitate hospitals, because there is nobody to guard them," he said. "We are fed up with being told to wait because there is no security. We can make our own security."
He filled out a complicated, 10-page form in May to try to bid for some of the $215 million in subcontracts that the Bechtel Corporation says it will hand out from the $680 contract it was given. 
At that time, Bechtel had an office in the Sheraton, which they closed on Aug. 1 due to security concerns. 
Now their two offices lie behind the barbed wire and multiple barricades that the military maintains around all government offices. The mood of the American soldiers often determines who gets in and who does not. 
Mr. Janabi has tried to reach Bechtel and other major contractors via the Internet, but gets no response, and yet he can see on the Web sites that contracts are being awarded. 
"A liberal economy is an open economy, a competitive economy," he said, his remarks echoed by a banker who works with similar small- and medium-size companies. "That does not exist here; we don't even see the birth signs."
Gregory F. Huger, the Bechtel manager in charge of major reconstruction projects, said the timetable involved did not allow for open bidding. Instead, the company screened those who attended its early conferences about contracting work and asks 15 to 20 selected companies to bid on specific jobs. 
Mr. Huger also said Bechtel was not involved in the restoration of ministry buildings.
Of the 123 subcontracts given out by Sept. 7, 89 went to Iraqi companies, said Francis M. Canavan, Bechtel's public affairs manager in Iraq. He could not give a dollar value for those contracts.
If Mr. Qamoosi, the Internet cafe owner, is to be believed, the Americans share a problem with Saddam Hussein: they have promised a lot, and Iraqis are waiting for a sign they are going to get it.
"Saddam used to tell us that we would cross the river to the other bank," he recalled. 
"It was a famous saying of his. You could just refer to it as The Crossing and people knew what you meant. It's the same thing now. The Americans keep saying this will happen and this will happen and this will happen, but nothing happens."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- Mexico City; 
Old City Is Seeking Its Place In New Era

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL T. LUONGO 

 BODY:
Mexico City, with a population of more than 20 million, is slowly overcoming its reputation as an urban nightmare of poverty, crime and smog. "There is a feeling of being proud of the city," said Carlos Carrillo, the lifestyle editor for the Mexico City business magazine Expansion. "It is becoming hip."
 Carlos Slim Helu, the wealthiest man in Mexico and the city's greatest promoter, has championed initiatives to spruce up the city, like increasing police patrols in its historic center on the site of the ancient Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. 
 Oil, telecommunications, finance and legal services dominate the city's economy.

AIRPORT
 MEXICO CITY BENITO JUAREZ INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT seems like an endless hall lined with duty-free shops. Getting through immigration is fast, and tourism kiosks provide great advice but no brochures. Buy maps at any of the numerous tobacco shops.
 The 40-minute-plus taxi ride to most of the sprawling city's business districts runs $15 to $20; pay ahead at a taxi kiosk for a voucher. Or take the Metro for 20 cents.

HOTELS
 The new SHERATON CENTRO HISTORICO (5130-5300, $245 to $495) has the city's largest hotel convention center, with a capacity of nearly 5,000 people. (To call Mexico City numbers from the United States, you must first dial 011-52-55.)
 The place to be seen is the boutique hotel HABITA in the Polanco district (5282-3100, $195 to $395). The barely clad mix with the formally suited at a trendy rooftop bar, but the hotel can be noisy and its elevators clogged.
 The FOUR SEASONS (5230-1818, $270 to $2,900) has a Spanish colonial flavor that includes a fountain in the courtyard. Juan Gomez-Enciso, a Mexico City native and an auditor for Citigroup who now lives in Florida, likes to stay there because, he said, "If you call room service and they say 20 minutes, they are there in 15." The hotel organizes weekend sightseeing programs with historians as guides.
 Many of the rooms in the PRESIDENTE INTERCONTINENTAL (5327-7700, $210 to $1,800) offer stunning views of Chapultepec Park. A new all-suites tower is planned. The business center has staff on hand around the clock, and in the lobby, which with its shops and restaurants has a mall feel, there are daily jazz shows.

RESTAURANTS
 RINCON ARGENTINO (5254-8775; $130 for dinner for two, including wine and tip) in the heart of Polanco serves enormous steaks imported from the United States and is decorated in ranch style, as if gauchos might pass by at any moment.
 Luz Elena Martinez Benitez, owner of LMedia, a digital-media production company, likes MP (5280-2506; $60), a Mexican-Asian fusion restaurant in Polancothat offers dishes like tacos made with shredded duck. "It is chic, and has good appetizers with tastes from different countries," she said.
 AU PIED DE COCHON (5327-7756, $120), in the Intercontinental, is open 24 hours a day and has one of the country's largest hotel wine collections. The restaurant is popular with artists and politicians and people seeking their ear.
 FONDA EL REFUGIO (5525-5352, $50), an unassuming restaurant in Zona Rosa, enjoys a reputation for authentic Mexican food and is most famous for its dishes made with mole, a spicy chocolate sauce with Aztec origins.

ON YOUR OWN
 The beautifully landscaped PASEO DE LA REFORMA, the city's main thoroughfare, built in the mid-1800's by Emperor Maximillian, cuts from CHAPULTEPEC PARK, an Aztec forest reserve that somehow has survived into the 21st century, to the colonial CENTRO HISTORICO. It is lined with old mansions, museums, hotels and office high-rises. The ANTHROPOLOGICAL MUSEUM (5786-9002) provides an intelligent overview of Mexico's various ethnic groups and delights visitors with its huge Mayan and Aztec statuary.
 The ZOCALO, or central square, is the city's heart, lined with Spanish colonial structures built over Aztec ruins. Visit the excavations of the Aztec TEMPLO MAYOR, all that is left of this once-fabled El Dorado. Nearby, hundreds of dancers re-enact ancient rituals with incense, drums and chants.
 The METROPOLITAN CATHEDRAL, sinking and earthquake-weary, dominates the square. Across the plaza, the PALACIO DE GOBIERNO houses Diego Rivera's murals, but capitalists should prepare themselves for artistic insults. His wife Frida Kahlo's home, the CASA AZUL (5554-5999), in the tranquil Coyoacan neighborhood, is best known for her body cast and her collection of religious knickknacks.

LOCAL LORE
 If you want to know what's going on in town, get a shine and get the scoop. Cabdrivers like to stop by and gossip with the street-corner shoeshine operators about conversations they have overheard from business leaders, movie stars and other celebrities.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: China Told Not to Relax Yuan Limits 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Credit-rating agencies strongly warned today that China should not let its currency appreciate soon or relax controls on the movement of large sums of money in and out of the country, as the Bush administration has asked. The Chinese banking system was not ready, the rating agencies said.
 An increase in the currency's value in foreign exchange markets "would place additional strain on an already insolvent banking system," said Paul Coughlin, the managing director for Asian government and corporate ratings at Standard & Poor's, the world's largest credit-rating company. 
 If China allows currency appreciation and relaxes controls, the Chinese government's credit rating, "would undoubtedly be under a lot of downward pressure," Mr. Coughlin said in a conference call with reporters. 
 Wei Yen, the Chinese banking analyst at Moody's Investors Service, agreed in a separate telephone interview that currency revaluation or a reduction in capital controls could be harmful to China's credit rating. Chinese bank depositors would eagerly invest overseas if they could, he said, and this would deprive Chinese banks of the constant inflow of fresh deposits they need to continue making new loans even as many old loans are not repaid.
 "Right now, the banks are held together by liquidity, by depositors," he said.
 China's four main government-owned banks already rank among the most insolvent in the world, failing to collect timely interest and principal payments on nearly half their loans. The possibility of a Chinese banking crisis has been rising toward the top of Western experts' lists of what could cause political instability in China, and the problem has been receiving top-level attention from China's leaders.
 In the latest sign of Beijing's deepening concern, the official New China News Agency reported tonight that the China Banking Regulatory Commission had sent inspectors to visit the four big banks to review the prudence of their recent loans. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has been expressing worry that the bad debt problem may worsen and that sectors of the economy may overheat because of a recent frenzy of lending, often to speculative real estate projects.
 The news agency noted with unusual bluntness that the central bank's monetary policy department had "warned against possible high inflation" because of rapid growth in the money supply.
 China's banks lent more in the first seven months of this year than in all of last year. The central bank ordered banks on Aug. 23 to keep larger reserves on deposit with it, in a bid to slow the lending.
 But that decision is also pushing up interest rates in China's relatively small and illiquid debt markets, which makes it harder for the government to finance its large and persistent budget deficits. The finance ministry failed today to auction all of a new bond issue, with a third of the bonds left unsold after many potential buyers refused to bid the ministry's minimum price. In essence, buyers demanded a higher interest rate than the ministry was willing to pay.
 With American politicians increasingly blaming imports from China for unemployment in the United States, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow visited Beijing nearly two weeks ago to ask for a revaluation of China's currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, and some relaxation of China's controls on capital movement. Chinese officials repeated previous promises to pursue greater flexibility someday, but made no promises on any timetable. They did, however, offer a series of small adjustments to capital controls, like making it a little easier for foreigners to invest in Chinese securities and for the Chinese to invest in foreign securities.
 Finance ministers from the European Union, the United States and Japan have all been pressing for a rise in the yuan, and are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting this weekend in Dubai of the finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries plus Russia.
 Government-controlled media reported today that a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, Li Yang, had said that the government might at some point allow the yuan to trade in a somewhat wider band about 8.28 to the dollar. The central bank has been keeping the yuan very close to that level by spending hundreds of billions of yuan to buy tens of billions of dollars as they flow into the country, so as to prevent investors with dollars from bidding up the value of the yuan. Traders have already been using markets for forward currency contracts to place bets that the yuan will appreciate in the coming year despite Beijing's opposition; prices in these markets briefly touched a new record today.
 Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said early this month that his country would consider linking the yuan to a basket of currencies including the dollar.
 But Mr. Coughlin said that any move to peg the yuan to a group of currencies should be done gradually, perhaps three to five years from now, so that Chinese banks could begin learning how to manage the risks associated with currency market volatility. The shift to a basket of currencies, he contended, should also be made without changing the yuan's immediate value relative to the dollar, so as to let Chinese banks adapt to currency fluctuations without trying to cope with a revaluation at the same time.
 The weak financial controls at Chinese banks, Mr. Coughlin warned, combined with regulators' incomplete information about the banks' international dealings, mean not only that the banks are very unlikely to be hedged adequately against a sharp move in the yuan's value, but also that their losses cannot even be estimated in advance. "You wouldn't know what the damage would be until you've done it," he said.
 China's reluctance to take decisive measures quickly has fueled calls in Congress for the United States to impose tariffs or take other actions to limit imports from China. But Ping Chew, the director of Asian sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor's, pointed out that while China is running record surpluses with the United States, China's overall balance of trade is only slightly positive as China runs deficits with other countries, suggesting that the trade deficit may be caused to a considerable extent by American policies and not China's.
 Standard & Poor's currently has a BBB rating on the Chinese government's long-term foreign currency debt, with a positive outlook, while Moody's has a somewhat higher rating of A-3, also with a positive outlook.
 Mr. Zhou is scheduled to deliver a rare speech here on Thursday night at a dinner sponsored by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. His visit has sparked speculation in Hong Kong's financial sector that China might be close to authorizing limited offshore banking in Hong Kong, allowing banks here to take deposits and lend in yuan.
 But economists here with strong connections in Beijing have become increasingly skeptical that Mr. Zhou will announce such concessions. Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, withdrew on Sept. 5 his proposal for stringent internal-security legislation, a plan that Beijing had previously supported through a series of policy changes to help Hong Kong's struggling economy.
 Joan Zheng, the chief China economist at J.P. Morgan, said that even letting Hong Kong banks take yuan deposits from some mainland tourists now entering the territory could be a potential threat to China's banking system.
 Shanghai officials, who are trying to build a financial services industry despite a couple recent scandals, have also been publicly leery of letting Hong Kong, with its tighter regulatory system, lengthen its lead as China's financial center.
 Shanghai's mayor, Han Zheng, told the South China Morning Post last week that Hong Kong was decades ahead of Shanghai, saying that his city was still like a child trying to catch up with "mature and sophisticated" Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: Coming U.S. Vote Figures In Walkout at Trade Talks 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: CANCUN, Mexico, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
It may be more than a year away, but the United States presidential election is already throwing a long shadow. Here in Cancun this week, it was enough to touch off a walkout by delegates from developing nations at the World Trade Organization talks who were convinced that it was hopeless to expect any realistic negotiations with the Americans this year on farm subsidies.
 Opinions were divided about the impact of the decision by the developing nations known as the Group of 21 to reject a draft proposal in which they would have opened up their markets to foreign investment in return for cuts in agricultural subsidies. But there was widespread agreement -- outside the United States -- that they had little choice. 
 A few trade experts did question the wisdom of the developing countries. Stefan Tangermann, the agriculture expert at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said he feared that the countries had given up a rare opportunity to start cutting down the $300 billion in annual agricultural subsidies that distorts world trade and undermines the poorest farmers around the world.
"It is a very deplorable outcome," he said, shaking his head.
But several senior delegates from advanced countries with little at stake in the agricultural talks said the Group of 21 -- which is led by Brazil and includes China, India, South Africa, Egypt and Indonesia -- had little choice but to walk out given the restraints caused by the upcoming presidential campaign.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, had promised that Washington was prepared to cut its multibillion-dollar farm subsidies. But the compromise proposal essentially left that farm program intact. It also gave American cotton farmers a reprieve despite appeals from four of Africa's poorest nations.
"Bob Zoellick is a master at strategy and I think he had little room," one senior delegate said. "President Bush was not going to upset his farmers before his re-election."
Before the talks broke off, American farmer groups attending the conference here said they were pleased Mr. Zoellick was able to protect most of the farm bill passed in 2002, which raised subsidies by $40 billion.
"He did his very best," said Robert Stallman, head of the American Farm Bureau Federation. "The ambassador has done an excellent job."
The farm states voted heavily in favor of Mr. Bush in the 2000 election, and were the backbone of the states that gave him the bulk of his electoral votes. Agribusiness, which profits from the low cost of corn, soybeans and other crops subsidized by American taxpayers, has shifted its allegiance to the Republican Party. Political contributions from agribusiness jumped to $53 million in 2002 from $37 million in 1992, with the Republicans' share rising to 72 percent from 56 percent, according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Peter Gaemelke, the head of the European farmers group and the counterpart of Mr. Stallman, said Mr. Zoellick had done his job a little too well. "This should not be a meeting just to elect Mr. Bush," Mr. Gaemelke said.
Mr. Zoellick implicitly rejected such calculations on Sunday night when he said the United States was one of the "very few countries" prepared to negotiate big changes that favor developing nations.
"They missed the opportunity to cut our subsidies," he said.
The American farm provisions, while the central issue, were not the only reasons for the Group of 21's decision to quit the talks. Europe's demand that the world trading body negotiate new rules covering investment, trade facilitation and two other areas were also cited.
In the long run, whether the Group of 21 gains or loses as a result of the breakdown in negotiations may be beside the point. What counts, its members asserted, was the statement that had been made. They said they had established themselves as a power bloc to be reckoned with.
"This is a change in the nature and quality of negotiations between developing and developed nations," said Alec Irwin, South Africa's trade negotiator. "While we are disappointed, there is no doubt today we are all optimistic in the medium and the long run."

HEADLINE: At Long Last, Real Barbecue Makes a Stand In Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
THE smoky romance of the barbecue pit, with its dry rubs and wet mops, its fruit woods and burnt ends, has long been a New York fantasy. But real barbecue has proved harder to produce locally than baguettes, baba ghanouj and banh mi put together.
 Food-obsessed New Yorkers harp on the diversity of the city's kitchens and the excellence of their offerings, but most are unhappily conscious of barbecue as a magnificent native dish that is perpetually out of reach. Would-be pit masters have tried to please them but have had to contend with emission-control laws, strict fire codes and a general lack of faith that real barbecue could exist in these parts. Local fans have been reduced to mail-order ribs and the occasional binge weekend in Memphis. 
 But this fall, the stars have aligned for real New York barbecue. 
Whether it's the arrival of newly efficient smoke-scrubbing technologies, a growing outdoor-cooking industry fueling national interest in barbecue, or a local economy that makes a $10 entree almost irresistible, the number of places making pit barbecue in Manhattan -- and making it well -- has suddenly tripled, and a good, old-fashioned barbecue war may be in the offing. There will be no unhappy victims.
Daisy May's BBQ USA opened in mid-August to instant success; the pit master there, Adam Perry Lang, is already planning an expansion. The Queens barbecue legend Robert Pearson, after a decade of false starts, has entered into a partnership with the restaurateur Ken Aretsky to smoke his signature Texas-style beef briskets on the Upper East Side, in the space that formerly housed Mr. Aretsky's Butterfield 81. And at Blue Smoke, after tantalizing Manhattan with two years of up-and-down results, Danny Meyer, the owner, and his pit master, Kenny Callaghan, seem to have finally wrestled their technical problems to the mat.
Will smoke-sensitive neighbors, the ever-critical barbecue crowd and New York's famously demanding customers (who generally expect restaurants to keep regular hours, provide plates and serve vegetables, all in direct conflict with barbecue tradition) give them all a chance at success? We'd better hope so; this has been a long time coming.
The city has no shortage of so-called bar-b-que and chicken-and-ribs joints, but aficionados know: that's not real barbecue. What is? 
According to the mission statement of the Kansas City Barbeque Society, the closest thing the quarrelsome barbecue world has to a governing body, barbecue is meat cooked by indirect heat and smoke. 
But each expert interviewed last week found something to disagree with even in that bare statement. The world of American barbecue, whose members come together at thousands of team competitions each year (and on countless Internet forums each day), includes professionals, amateurs and, seemingly, every resident of Memphis, Kansas City, Texas and the Carolinas. Each of those regions is fiercely committed to its own barbecue style, with completely different ways of seasoning and spicing the meat both before and after it is cooked. 
Herewith the short list of what is universally agreed:
Grilling is not barbecue.
Smoking is not barbecue, although it is a close relative.
Barbecue sauce, while it has a place at the table, does not make barbecue barbecue.
Mr. Callaghan, who has been the pit master at Blue Smoke since it opened in 2001, offered a test: "How about this," he said. "Once you've been to your 50th or 60th barbecue joint, then you just know what barbecue is." 
In Manhattan, only Daisy May's and Blue Smoke cook their meat exclusively with wood, making them the sole local claimants to the real barbecue throne. (Pearson's Texas BBQ on the Upper East Side will join their ranks soon.)
Shortcuts practiced by the others -- including Virgil's in Times Square and Tennessee Mountain in SoHo -- include parboiling meat before cooking it over charcoal or gas, supplementing wood heat with gas and, some say, the occasional drizzle of liquid smoke. These can sometimes result in passingly good barbecue, at least by New York's former standards.
But according to Bobby Richter, a native of Rego Park, Queens, and pit master of the Queens-based barbecue team Big Island Barbecue, "Once you've had real barbecue, you can't enjoy yourself at those places any more." (In another sign of life for New York barbecue, Big Island just became the first New York City team ever to qualify for barbecue's most prestigious competition, the annual Jack Daniel's Invitational Championships, to be held in Lynchburg, Tenn., on Oct. 25.) In short, the path to barbecue greatness cannot run through a gas oven.
Mr. Pearson is the only New York pit master whose product is respected throughout the city, on the Web and even in Texas, and his second coming to Manhattan is eagerly anticipated. Mr. Pearson's previous, brief foray into Manhattan involved trucking precooked briskets from Queens to the Upper West Side; needless to say, this did not do much for the flavor of the barbecue, which should be eaten as soon as possible once it comes off the pit. 
A profoundly unlikely barbecue legend, Mr. Pearson was brought to New York from his native England by Vogue magazine as a hot London hairstylist in 1966. As an avatar of chic, he was often invited to Texas to teach new techniques to stylists there. From them, he said, he received a crash course in Texas barbecue. "Those girls would take me from cow palace to cow palace all night long," he recalled. 
From Texas, Mr. Pearson embarked on a barbecue education that included posing as a journalist at Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City, in a vain attempt to get a look at the legendary pit. (Mr. Bryant saw through the ruse immediately, Mr. Pearson recalled, but granted him a one-minute audience anyway). The style he eventually developed, and brought to Queens in 1992, is even more spare than that of Texas barbecue purists.
Mr. Pearson puts absolutely no seasoning on his whole briskets before putting them in the pit. His recipe -- if you can call it that -- calls for just the 14-pound slabs and smoke: no rub, no sauce, not even salt. The resulting meat, in addition to being outrageously flavorful and juicy, boasts a clear red smoke ring around the edges of each slice. The smoke ring is a universally recognized sign of real barbecue, though Mr. Pearson says ruefully that New Yorkers sometimes mistake it for excess barbecue sauce or underdone beef.
Mr. Pearson will soon be opening up shop on East 81st Street. In 1998, he closed his original and still-mourned Long Island City location, on 51st Street, with its back garden and prowling cats, and moved his pit to a Jackson Heights sports bar. (That location will remain open.) The Long Island City lot was taken over by Philly's Smoke House, a multilevel barbecue palace that smokes over wood.
In an attempt to forestall complaints from neighbors (the new location is in the heart of the Upper East Side, just a few blocks from Junior League headquarters), Mr. Aretsky has fitted Pearson's roof with a $36,000 electrostatic precipitator that filters out the smoke, vapors and grease that are inevitably exhaled by a barbecue pit. But he will be working the same no-frills pit, shipped from Mesquite, Tex., that he has always used.
"People ask to see the pit," he said."And then they're surprised when it's not a big hole in the ground." 
These days, a barbecue pit -- even in barbecue country -- is most likely an above-ground brick oven encased in steel, about the size of a refrigerator. According to Mr. Pearson, the art and craft of the pit master takes place not in the cabinet (where the meat revolves endlessly on racks) but in the pit's separate, tiny firebox. 
In the firebox, hickory logs burn all day, every day, giving off a controlled, intense heat and, surprisingly, almost no smoke. Mr. Pearson said the goal is actually to produce as little smoke as possible. "There will always be some smoke," he said, "and that's enough to flavor the meat. But the less smoke you can see, the better the barbecue." In an efficient pit, he continued, you can cook 700 pounds of meat for 14 hours using only seven logs.
Green, or moist, wood is the key to a fire that burns low and slow. "You can't throw a couple of dry pine two-by-fours on a fire and expect to cook barbecue," said Chris O'Neil, the executive chef at Virgil's. He said that in the winter, when fresh wood is scarce, some pit masters resort to soaking split logs in pickle juice and apple juice to moisten them. 
Mr. Lang, who came to barbecue via his Long Island childhood and the kitchens of Le Cirque and Daniel, has already learned enough about the competitive side of barbecue to keep quiet about his methods. "Part of barbecue's appeal is all the secrets and mystique," he said. Mr. Lang's pit, operated with a computer keypad, looks more like an oversize cellphone than a barbecue pit. But except for his automated humidity controls -- the absolute latest in barbecue technology -- the cooking principle is the same as Mr. Pearson's: wood smoke and heat, steadily applied to large pieces of meat. 
But Mr. Lang's end product could hardly be more different from Mr. Pearson's. Using the palate he developed in those haute kitchens, Mr. Lang slathers his meat with thick spice pastes and complex sauces. He ranges through all regional barbecue styles and heads beyond, into pineapple, ginger and any other ingredient that helps him achieve the explosive blend of spicy, sweet, tart and salty that is barbecue's flavor signature. He home-brews four completely different barbecue sauces, chops up his beef brisket and bathes it in yet another sauce, and makes a mustardy dressing to coat shreds of pulled pork, the Carolina classic. The barbecue itself is good, but it is the punch of the sauces that comes screaming at you across the metal counter, which Mr. Lang said he modeled on the one at Gray's Papaya. 
"I hate restaurants," Mr. Lang said last week, about his transition from the likes of Daniel to a no-frills, no-seats barbecue joint on a barren stretch of 11th Avenue. "Great barbecue is just as good or better than anything you eat in a restaurant," he continued. "Besides, these are exactly the same sweet potatoes they serve at Le Cirque." Mr. Lang's side dishes, as might be expected, far outpace those of Mr. Pearson, who eschews barbecue sauce and grudgingly serves coleslaw only in response to customer demand. 
Blue Smoke, having spent its early childhood trying to be all barbecue to all New Yorkers, has had time to perfect its side dishes in the meantime (the baked beans with chopped burnt ends, crusty edges of barbecued pork, are exemplary). The original flaw in the Blue Smoke pit, a 15-story chimney that sucked out all the heat, smoke and humidity, has been adjusted. And Mr. Callaghan, sounding war-weary, said he hopes the slashing criticisms leveled by localbarbecue fans when the restaurant opened are now permanently behind him. The barbecue is worthy, and occasionally even spectacular. 
Why do New Yorkers care so much about barbecue? Mr. Richter of Big Island Barbecue says that barbecue is simply addictive, no matter where you're from. Other New York aficionados cited spicy pastrami, smoked salmon and the glazed spareribs at old-fashioned Chinese restaurants as seminal barbecue experiences. For many Jewish New Yorkers, a weakness for slow-cooked brisket is already a given. 
Even as word gets out about the new pits, the nagging question of authenticity will continue to dog New York's pit masters. Will local barbecue be able to stand up to the real thing? Robb Walsh, the restaurant critic for the Houston Press and author of the definitive "Legends of Texas Barbecue Cook Book," said, "Let me put the question in New York terms: If you filtered Houston city water so it was the same as New York tap, and used the same flour, and brought in the same ovens, could you make authentic New York bagels in Texas? Yes, and no."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Fed's Decisionto Maintain Rate Moves Shares Higher

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as the Federal Reserve decided to keep benchmark interest rates at 45-year lows, which bolstered investors' confidence that economic and profit growth would accelerate.
 The Fed's decision touched off the biggest gains in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average since July 25. Microsoft and Intel led the advance. 
 "The market is saying we have a strong Fed that is going to make it work for us eventually," said Tim Leach, who helps oversee more than $130 billion at Wells Fargo Private Client Services in San Francisco. The Fed will not raise rates until inflation and hiring pick up, he said. 
The S.& P. 500 added 14.51 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,029.32, with computer-related companies accounting for more than a third of the gain. The Dow average climbed 118.53 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,567.34. The Nasdaq composite index rose 41.55 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,887.25.
Eight stocks rose for every three that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.37 billion shares were traded on the Big Board, little changed from the three-month daily average.
Fed policy makers left the overnight lending rate between banks at 1 percent. The central bank is faced with an economy that shows signs of expanding while the number of people out of work is increasing.
Core consumer prices in August recorded the smallest 12-month increase since 1966, the Labor Department said. The index of prices paid by consumers for goods and services excluding food and fuel was 1.3 percent higher in August than it was a year ago.
"They want the economy moving again before they make any indication of tightening," said Michael K. Farr, who manages $400 million for Farr, Miller & Washington in Washington. "What the stock market finds encouraging is that we have a stable platform through year end."
The S.& P. 500 has surged 29 percent from its 2003 low on March 11. The Dow has gained 27 percent and the Nasdaq has jumped 48 percent.
Fund managers are increasingly favoring stocks over bonds as optimism about the global economy and corporate earnings rises, according to Merrill Lynch's latest survey of investors.
More than half of the managers surveyed said they hold a greater percentage of assets in stocks than their benchmarks would suggest. The figure is the highest since Merrill Lynch started asking the question in 1999, the year before stocks entered a three-year bear market.
Microsoft added 54 cents, to $28.90, while Intel added 92 cents, to $28.91. They were the two biggest contributors to the S.& P. 500's advance. 
Nortel Networks added 35 cents, to $4.50, after its chief executive, Frank A. Dunn, said he expected "somewhat of a strengthening" in its wireless business this year.
United Parcel Service rose $1.35, to $63.96 after Merrill Lynch raised its rating to buy from neutral.
Titan soared $4.33, or 26 percent, to $21.29. Lockheed Martin agreed to buy Titan for $1.8 billion, including the assumption of $580 million of debt. Titan shareholders will get $22 a share in cash, stock, or both, a 30 percent premium from the closing price Monday. Lockheed shares dropped 97 cents, to $50.
Coca-Cola dropped 58 cents, to $42.92. It was the biggest drag on the Dow average. Skip Carpenter, a Thomas Weisel Partners analyst, cut his recommendation to peer perform from outperform, citing weak global volume trends.
Kroger shed 85 cents, to $17.80. It was the biggest drag on the S.& P. 500. The company said profit for the year might be as much as 5 cents below its forecast of $1.50 to $1.58 a share. The company cited increasing competition and the economy.
Treasury bond prices held near their lowest yields since late July in New York trading after the Federal Reserve left its target interest rate unchanged.
By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year note dropped 5/32, to a price of 99 25/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price rose to 4.28 percent from 4.25 percent on Monday.
And the 30-year bond lost 10/32, to 102 19/32. Its yield climbed to 5.20 percent from 5.17 percent.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Statement on Rates 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. 
 The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, although the labor market has been weakening. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted. 
The committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The committee judges that on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Robert T. Parry; and Jamie B. Stewart Jr.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; 
Iraq to Take a Seat At OPEC Meeting

 BODY:
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced yesterday that a delegation from Iraq would take part in the cartel's meeting in Vienna next week. The decision overcomes months of resistance among OPEC members to the idea that an occupied Iraq should have a seat at the table. 
 OPEC delegates and oil industry analysts said the gesture showed that Arab and Muslim countries, while worried about the American-led presence in Iraq, have reconciled themselves to the situation in part to bolster the Iraqi Governing Council's legitimacy. The OPEC move comes in the wake of a decision by the Arab League earlier this month to invite the Iraqi foreign minister to a meeting in Cairo. Iraqi representatives will also attend meetings next month of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
 The Iraqi delegation to OPEC will be led by the new oil minister, Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum, a newcomer to the government and a relative unknown to OPEC delegates. 
But Iraq's lingering problems in raising production and exports is likely to limit its role in the meeting, other delegates and industry experts said.
The country is exporting only about one million barrels a day now, far short of its prewar levels of about two million barrels a day, largely because of persistent sabotage of pipelines.

HEADLINE: What Would Teachers Do If They Had the Chance? This 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Salaries for teachers at the new primary school at Columbia University go as high as $100,000. The student-teacher ratio is five to one. And the school, which opens today, intends to develop individual learning plans for every student.
 In a bold and costly bid to attract and hold professors, Columbia has created one of the most ambitious private elementary schools in the city -- one where 20 percent of the staff members have doctorates. Formally known as the School at Columbia University, it offers a glimpse of what educators might come up with if they had the time, the money and the freedom to do whatever they wanted. 
 "It's every educator's dream to invent a new school starting with a blank sheet of paper, and with the resources of an Ivy League university behind you," Gardner P. Dunnan, whose title is head of school, said happily last week as he sat in the school's spacious cafe, which will dispense free juice, fruit and coffee all day. 
The school is unusual in other ways, too. Its original market was the children of Columbia professors. But to placate critics who argued that the university should improve local public schools rather than create another private school, Columbia agreed that half of the students would come from the neighborhood, and that it would provide the financial aid for them to attend. And to ensure that it would not skim top students from the local public schools, Columbia agreed to choose the students by lottery.
More than 1,700 neighborhood children applied for about 100 openings this year.
The school, at West 110th Street and Broadway, includes only kindergarten through the fourth grade this year, but by 2006 it will go through eighth grade and enroll 650 students. The ratio of students to instructional staff will rise to 7 to 1, which Mr. Dunnan said is typical of independent schools and top suburban schools.
All of this comes at a high cost. Columbia is paying at least half of the $22,000 tuition charge for all children of faculty members (more than half for lower-income faculty members), and an average of 80 percent of the tuition of the community students. Only 6 of the 200 students entering this week are paying full tuition, school officials said.
The total cost of the school is to be more than $12 million a year, including building costs, university officials said. School officials hope to bring in revenue through consulting, product sales and donations.
Lee C. Bollinger, Columbia's president, declined to discuss the school's finances, except to say: "There is no question this is expensive. But there are lots of things we have to do to maintain pre-eminence in higher education in the United States."
Few universities have such schools. But before drawing up their plans, Columbia officials visited two campuses that did -- the University of Chicago and the University of California at Los Angeles -- as well as public schools in the Boston area attended by children of faculty members.
Last week, construction work was still going on at the school. But there were beginning to be clear spaces, like the lime-green cafe with purple chairs, and classrooms where teachers had begun putting up posters, arranging books and laying rugs for students to sprawl on.
One of the most inviting spaces was Theresa Kubasak's first-grade classroom, which she had outfitted with sofas, rugs, tree stumps and 2,000 of her own books, collected in more than 25 years of teaching.
Over the years, she has been torn between teaching needy students at public schools in a city and the excitement of working at a laboratory school in a university. What drew her to the Columbia school, she said, was the chance to do both.
"This is a grand experiment to meld Columbia with the neighborhood," she said. "I see my role as keeping that experiment on track, combining the commitment to teach neighborhood kids with the academic freedom of an independent school, where I can really feel free to run my classroom based on best practices, without succumbing to the restraints of public schools or the political constraints like No Child Left Behind."
She and the other teachers are building their lessons around a unified curriculum designed by Marc Meyer, the school's director of research and curriculum design. Dr. Meyer, a medievalist, said he had shaped the curriculum around the questions: "What does it mean to be a human being?" and "What does it mean to be an educated person?" 
"The best wayto search for truth is to question," he said. "Gosh, Socrates told us this. There is nothing new in any of this. But the way it comes together in an educational institution -- in an integrated curriculum -- is innovative." 
For each grade, he has mapped out specific themes, like "Me and Myself" (kindergarten), "Me and My Family" (first grade), and "Me and the World" (fourth grade). Older students will explore the individual's position in society, the clash of culture and civilization and the quest for justice and liberty.
One morning last week, Talia Gonzalez, a Spanish teacher, and Katherine Henderson, a wellness teacher, were discussing ways to collaborate. One idea they discussed was staging a Mayan ball game while students were studying Mayan creation myths and Mayan art. Another was offering flamenco dancing to enrich the study of Spanish. 
Over and over again, the teachers -- 39 academic staff members were selected from about 1,700 applicants -- talked of their awe for their colleagues and how much they expect to learn. About a third of the faculty are male; 40 percent come from public schools, 40 percent from university-related schools and 20 percent from independent schools. 
Mr. Dunnan, 63, has worked at both public and private schools. He was superintendent of schools in Briarcliff Manor, in Westchester. And for 23 years he was headmaster of the Dalton School, a private school that draws the children of New York City's rich and famous. He resigned under pressure from the trustees in 1997, prompted in part, school officials said, by his affair with a married administrator, whom he later married.
Several teachers said they had always wanted to create their own schools. One was Patricia G. MacDonald, a second- grade teacher who left the Laboratory School at the University of Toronto to move to New York and was waiting for her husband and child to join her. Another was James Haywood Rolling Jr., an arts teacher who has had a one-man art exhibit at Cooper Union (his alma mater) and sings in the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir.
"I toyed with the idea of starting my own school, but I didn't really have the skills," Dr. Rolling said. "The mission of this school enthralled me. And starting a new school was a carrot, along with the idea of having ownership in designing the curriculum and not fixing up someone else's mess."
As the school opens, some community leaders who battled with Columbia over the school expressed approval. "We're thrilled," said David B. Harris, a member of the Community Board 7 task force on the school. "We think it's a win-win for the community."
But others, like Edward C. Sullivan, a former state assemblyman for the district including Columbia, are still unhappy. "They had an opportunity to do something with the public schools that could have been great, and could have been a model for other universities in the city," he said. "But they chose not to. I'm sure this school will be fine for the kids who are in it, but that's a select group."
Hannah Sachs, the 8-year-old daughter of Jeffrey Sachs, the economist who was recruited by Columbia from Harvard, will be entering third grade at the school. Since she has just moved to New York, she is pleased that she will not be the only new person in her class. But she is impatient to get started.
"All of my friends have started school, and they're like: 'How's your new school?' " she said yesterday. "And I have to tell them I haven't started yet."

HEADLINE: Many California Employers Face Health Care Mandate 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
With the ranks of the uninsured rising rapidly across the country, California -- where the problem is especially acute -- is on the verge of requiring thousands of employers to provide health benefits for their workers.
 Gov. Gray Davis is expected to pause in his struggle to survive a recall vote and sign a new health care mandate into law early next month, state officials said. After earlier action in the State Assembly, the State Senate passed the measure early on Saturday in a party line vote, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. 
 Proponents said the measure offered a model for other states and for Washington, where lawmakers have not found a formula for providing health benefits for 41 million people without insurance. Indeed, doctors and labor representatives predicted that California business interests would now join in lobbying Congress to come up with a national solution to care for the uninsured. 
The California measure, its backers say, will extend coverage to more than one million ofthe seven million uninsured in the state. Nineteen percent of Californians are uninsured, compared with 15 percent nationally, according to federal census figures. State business groups said the measure would cost their members billions of dollars, undermine jobs and economic recovery, and drive some companies out of the state. 
The new measure, coming on top of recent increases in health care premiums and workers' compensation costs, adds up to "a train wreck of circumstances that is forcing small businesses to make choices such as moving to Arizona or Nevada where these costs are comparatively low," said Martyn B. Hopper, state director for the National Federation of Independent Business. The group says it has 37,000 members in California.
The legislation requires employers with 200 or more workers to subsidize care for individuals and families, or pay into a new state fund to cover the uninsured, starting on Jan. 1, 2006. The next year, companies with 50 to 200 employees must cover workers, but not dependents. The coverage requirement would apply to those with 20 to 50 workers later, but only if the state arranged tax credits to help them. 
Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, a group of advocates for expanding health care, said 95 percent of the state's businesses are small enough to be exempt. And most large businesses already provide coverage.
The California Chamber of Commerce said the measure would cost $7.2 billion annually, with employers paying 80 percent, or $5.7 billion, and employees contributing $1.5 billion. 
The sponsors, including doctors, union spokesmen and advocates for patients, said the chamber's projections were exaggerated.
"The actual cost is $1.5 billion, not counting the slowing of premium increases for businesses that already provide coverage," said Dr. Jack Lewin, chief executive of the California Medical Association.
By one estimate, $2.1 billion in uncompensated medical costs for the uninsured are passed along to California employers now, as insurers and hospitals shift the cost of charity care. 
Dr. Lewin argues that many of the businesses that would have to start providing health benefits under the law are in no position to flee California. "People are not going to drive to Nevada or Oregon to get their car washed or buy a hamburger or get their suit dry cleaned," he said. 
Some owners of small businesses around the state are not so sanguine. 
"I understand that everybody needs health care, but they're putting it on the the backs of business guys," said Tom Lucas, owner of Performance Nursery, a supplier of plants and shrubs in Redondo Beach with 70 employees. Mr. Lucas said he was considering moving part of his business to a neighboring state.
Sunder Ramani, owner of Raad Inc., an interiors construction firm with 24 workers in Burbank, does not talk about leaving California. "In this business, we would not even consider moving," he said, adding that instead he "will look to subcontract more of the work to reduce our employee toll, or downsize." 
Wal-Mart, which vigorously opposed the legislation, "intends to grow in California," said Bob McAdam, a vice president. Wal-Mart covers about two-thirds of health costs for 53,000 employees in the state; 78 percent are full-time workers. 
Mr. McAdam noted that companies with union contracts covering health care were exempt under the law, a provision that he said put nonunion companies like Wal-Mart at an unfair disadvantage. "Not all unions provide the same level of coverage," he said.
The law requires the basic coverage typicalin most health maintenance organizations in California. 
Grocery chains like Safeway, which have unionized employees and richer health coverage, supported the law, said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Safeway's premiums are subsidizing Wal-Mart," he said. Safeway did not reply to a request for a comment.
Business groups are considering court challenges and a referendum to overturn the legislation, said Allan Zaremberg, president of the chamber of commerce. 
Opponents argue that the measure is really a new tax not meeting the state's constitutional requirement of winning a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of the Legislature. Critics also say it violates a federal law that prevents states from regulating the health insurance provided by self-insured employers.
E. Richard Brown, a health policy expert at the University of California at Los Angeles who advised the bill's sponsors, said a separate new law established a panel to recommend cost containment measures next year, before the employer mandate takes effect. He said the bill was designed to overcome a challenge under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the state's two-thirds rule for tax bills. 
Whether the new fee is a tax is likely to be decided in court.

HEADLINE: L.I. May Lose A Hospital For the Poor 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Sept. 16 

 BODY:
Nassau County's public hospital, nursing home and health centers are losing millions of dollars and could go broke by next year, saddling county government with a debt that would endanger its own financial recovery, the state and county comptrollers said today.
 They also said that while the agency running the health care system had outlined 18 steps to close its budget gap, the measures required special approvals and little had been done to win them. 
 A collapse of the system would jeopardize the thousands of patients, many of them poor, who rely on it for health care, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and the Nassau comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman, said at a joint news conference here.
The agency, the Nassau Health Care Corporation, responded by acknowledging that it faced "tremendous financial challenges" but said it was working "feverishly" to solve them. 
Troubled since its inception in 1999, the agency has lost $83 million so far. It projected an $8 million deficit this year, but after six months it was already $9 million in the red, Mr. Hevesi said.
Mr. Weitzman said his auditors had found that the agency's cash on hand was "falling at an alarming rate," dropping to $28 million on Aug. 15 from $56 million on Jan. 1.
In a "worst-case scenario," Mr. Hevesi said, the agency "could run out of cash" by late next year.
"Thisis critically important to thousands of people," he said, "and it puts at risk as well the fiscal health of Nassau County," which is recovering from its own financial crisis. If the agency defaults, the county by law must assume its $20 million annual debt payments.
Although the agency has proposed ways to cut costs and raise revenue, "the problem is that nothing they plan to do has been implemented," said Mr. Hevesi, who called the plans "wishful thinking."
Mr. Weitzman said, "We need to see action."
The proposals include new concessions from the system's labor unions and a new nursing home to qualify for higher reimbursements, but both proposals require agreements by other parties, and neither appears in the offing for now.
In a letter to Mr. Hevesi, the agency's president, Richard Turan, generally agreed with the state audit's findings and recommendations.
The agency said today: "Management recognizes that it faces tremendous financial challenges and is doing everything it can to put the corporation in firm financial standing. We are faced with severe issues of increased employee pension cost ($27 million), increased health insurance cost ($5 million) and reduced reimbursement rates. We are continuing to work feverishly at trying to deal with these issues." The agency appealed for help from federal, state and local officials.
The agency took over the county government's 631-bed medical center in East Meadow, 889-bed nursing home in Uniondale and seven clinics. It also provides some county health programs and serves jail inmates. The system has 4,000 workers and a $476 million annual budget. At 19 floors, the hospital is Long Island's tallest building. The nursing home is the biggest in the state, the agency says.
Critics called the creation of the agency a financial gimmick by the county executive at the time, Thomas S. Gulotta, to plug holes in his county budget by selling the health care system.
The county got $82 million, but it is now liable for $256 million that the agency borrowed to get started.
Mr. Weitzman said: "That transaction had nothing to do with health."
The new county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, issued an upbeat report on Nassau's finances on Monday, but he pinpointed the health care agency as a problem that needed fixing "before it drags us down."

HEADLINE: In Florida, Soaking Up Medicare? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Patients in Florida Lining Up for All That Medicare Covers" ("Re-examining Medicare" series, front page, Sept. 13): 
 You leave the impression that Medicare gives away health care "for free," to quote a doctor in your article. Actually, Medicare calls for more cost-sharing by patients than the typical employer-sponsored health insurance policy does. 
 Medicare covers only 80 percent of the cost of doctor and outpatient hospital visits and forces beneficiaries to pay $840 out of pocket per hospital episode.
If Medicare patients in Boca Raton receive their health care "for free," it must be because their former employers pick up the tab for costs not covered by Medicare, or because folks in Boca are rich enough to buy private Medigap policies for that purpose.
Over all, Medicare now covers only about 52 percent of the average total health spending caused by its beneficiaries. For the poor and near-poor elderly, out-of-pocket costs absorb an average of 30 to 35 percent of their meager incomes.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Plan to Clean Polluted Sites, Ending 10-Year Impasse 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
The Republican-controlled Senate approved landmark environmental legislation today that proponents say will result in the rehabilitation of thousands of scarred industrial wastelands across New York, many in urban areas.
 The vote ended a decade of legislative gridlock over the issue. In June, after an evening of political power plays in the Capitol, the State Assembly passed the 107-page measure, but only after the Senate recessed. 
 Many environmentalists expressed relief that a compromise to reclaim the state's most blighted areas had finally been adopted in Albany. They said it included some of the strongest public health protections in the nation and was the most important environmental legislation in the state in a decade. 
New York remained one of the few industrialized states in the nation with no law to regulate the cleanup of privately owned brownfields, abandoned industrial sites that are contaminated with chemicals, fuels or other pollutants. The issue had become linked with the state Superfund program, which provides money to the worst toxic sites. Albany's political leaders allowed money for the Superfund program to run out in March 2001, with hundreds of tainted sites awaiting cleanup.
The environmental bill, which passed the Senate 51 to 9, pumps money into the Superfund program, sets standards for brownfield rehabilitation and encourages the cleanup of soil under old gas stations, foundries and factories. It will now be sent to Gov. George E. Pataki, who signaled his support for the measure in June. An aide said he intends to sign it into law.
"This historic legislation represents a victory for all New Yorkers," Mr. Pataki said today. "By taking steps to protect our environment, this legislation will generate new opportunities for economic growth, bringing new jobs into communities around the state, while protecting the health of all New Yorkers."
While the brownfields bill was the primary reason for the Senate's special one-day session, a handful of other bills were passed and more than two dozen of the governor's nominees were confirmed, including Wayne E. Bennett as the superintendent of the State Police and Andrew S. Eristoff as taxation and finance commissioner.
The governor and legislative leaders also made a deal today to make technical corrections in the state budget. The agreement clears the way for the release of half of $200 million worth of so-called member item appropriations, a euphemism for the money legislators and the governor get to spread around the state. Mr. Pataki would also receive about $70 million for economic development programs he controls.
Included in the so-called budget cleanup bill is a requirement that the state comptroller be given monthly reports on the revenues and expenses in a series of cash pools that finance the state's health care system. The bill, at the governor's request, does not address a deal to allow for the refinancing of New York City debt left over from the 1970's fiscal crisis, a plan that saves the city $500 million this year. The governor has challenged the refinancing plan in court, where the matter is pending.
Today's special session was called by Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate's Republican majority leader. Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker, refused to reconvene his house to address the many pieces of legislation that faltered in June, saying he preferred to work out differences first in conference committees. Today, however, he said the Assembly would meet, most likely in October, to pass the budget cleanup bill, as well as a measure to help Nassau County out of its fiscal troubles, and possibly other initiatives.
Lawmakers, lobbyists and others held their breath until the brownfields bill passed, having seen deals unravel many times before. The issue became one of the most blatant examples of Albany dysfunction.
Over the next decade, it is estimated, the measure will pump $120 million a year into the state's Superfund program, from industry fees and state tax dollars, to clean up 800 abandoned industrial sites in the state, including 102 in New York City. The legislation expands what is covered under the Superfund program to include sites with hazardous substances, not just toxic waste.
Lawmakers were paralyzed for years over how to clean the Superfund sites and the less polluted brownfields, of which there are more than 10,000 in the state, by some estimates, most in cities and older suburbs. Environmentalists say failure to clean them contributes to sprawl, as developers instead turn to open fields like farmlands.
Mr. Pataki and Senate Republicans wanted less stringent cleanup standards for sites that are to be used for commercial and industrial projects, rather than residential development, to encourage development. Democratic Assembly leaders, supported by environmentalists, had pushed for rigorous and costly cleanups of all sites.
The two issues -- Superfund money and cleanup standards -- became linked over the years, and neither could be resolved without the other.
The compromise set a target for the level of pollutants like lead or cadmium that could be left in the soil; the levels should not exceed a risk of cancer in one person in a million who are exposed to the contaminants, the highest standard nationally.
"Although the bill reflects compromises, it incorporates among the strongest public health provisions of any state brownfields law," said Mark Izeman, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The brownfields portion of the bill provides for $135 million in tax credits for developers that voluntarily clean up a site for residential, industrial or commercial use, and $15 million in grants for community groups to identify and plan options for use.
"If we can energize Rochester, Troy, Syracuse, Buffalo, Albany, New York City, all of the cities with brownfields in the inner cities, and get those inner cores of these cities back working, this will be huge," said Senator Carl L. Marcellino, the chairman of the environmental committee in the Senate. 
The state Department of Environmental Conservation must still issue rules to enforce the statute.
The Business Council of New York State and other business groups, particularly in western New York, where many brownfields are located, have criticized the bill, saying it imposes onerous fees on businesses and does not mandate schedules for completing project review and approval. Many senators in the western conference voted against it.
Mr. Bruno said that he was sensitive to the concerns, but that "I am also mindful of the fact that one of the biggest economic development deterrents in this state are the brownfields."
The Senate, at the governor's request, also passed a bill today that is intended to speed up the process for reviewing and approving proposals to upgrade electric transmission facilities and to give electric generating and transmission facilities access to financing through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
But it is likely to be a one-house bill; Mr. Silver said it raised more questions than it answered at a time when public authorities under the Pataki administration are facing a "firestorm of controversy."
"Once again, the governor is repeating his previous energy policy of deregulation without public input, without legislative input, by dropping this bill in the middle of the night without anybody but a few select energy company officials having input into the concept," Mr. Silver said.
