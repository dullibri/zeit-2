AUTONOMY EXPECTS PROFIT SHORTFALL

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner 

 BODY:
 In another sign that the slowdown in the United States economy is spreading to Europe, Autonomy, a British software company, warned that first-quarter profit would fall below analyst estimates. Its shares fell 43 percent, to $:3.25, or $4.67. Autonomy now expects to earn 4 cents a share for the quarter that ended March 31 on revenue of $14 million to $15 million. Earnings will be reported on April 26. Michael Lynch, the chief executive, said the slowdown in orders for software came suddenly. "Almost without exception," he said, "we have been informed that purchasing decisions have been delayed."

CANADA'S JOBLESS RATE IS UP

BYLINE:  By Timothy Pritchard 

 BODY:
 Canada's unemployment rate rose to 7 percent in March from 6.9 percent in February. While employers added almost 30,000 jobs last month, reversing a drop in February, the unemployment rate rose because more Canadians began looking for work. Other indicators show Canada's economy is following the United States into a slowdown, and analysts predict a quarter-point cut in interest rates by the Bank of Canada at its meeting on April 17.

RUSSIA: TV TALKS BREAK DOWN
Talks between Russia's independent NTV television network and the state-dominated company Gazprom broke down, leaving both sides locked in conflict after Gazprom's hostile takeover of the network on Tuesday. NTV journalists met with Gazprom officials for less than an hour and asked the company to join them in an appeal to President Vladimir V. Putin. Gazprom said journalists walked out of talks after it refused their request. Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)

GERMANY: DISPUTE ON HOLOCAUST PAYMENTS
A meeting between Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek of Poland ended with sharp disagreement over German compensation to Polish laborers forced to work by the Nazis. Poland wants immediate payments to former forced laborers, who are dying at the rate of one every 11 minutes according to Mr. Buzek. But Mr. Schroder insisted that legal disputes in New York over an overall compensation agreement must be cleared up before payments begin.

 BODY:
One California Utility Files For Bankruptcy Protection
Pacific Gas and Electric, California's largest utility, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, saying that politicians and regulators had not moved quickly enough to resolve an energy crisis that has caused periodic rolling blackouts and cost the state billions of dollars.
 The filing shifts the decision making about key aspects of the state's energy problem to a federal bankruptcy court in San Francisco, where Pacific Gas has its headquarters. The utility hopes to win relief from $9 billion in wholesale energy debt it says it has incurred since prices began soaring last May. Pacific Gas and Southern California Edison, the No. 2 utility, had complained they were running out of cash and had demanded that energy rates be increased to cover their costs. Page A1. 

March Jobless Rate Climbs to 4.3%
The unemployment rate rose in March to 4.3 percent from 4.2 percent in February and 3.9 percent in October, as the Labor Department's job figures reflected layoffs and hiring freezes since last fall. Employers shed 86,000 jobs in March, the largest loss for a single month in more than nine years and an indication to many economists that the United States may be on the verge of a recession. A1.

Europe Examines Intel's Practices
The European Commission confirmed that it is investigating Intel over accusations that it abused its dominant position in the European computer chip market. Activities under investigation include Intel's licensing agreements with personal computer makers and retailers and the rebates it grants these other companies in return for their loyalty. C2.

Smaller Tax Cut in Senate Budget
With the support of Republicans and votes from nearly a third of the Democrats, the Senate approved a budget measure that would allow a $1.2 trillion tax reduction over the next 10 years and an $85 billion tax cut this year. The tax cut was only three-quarters of the amount President Bush had said was essential, but the White House and its Republican allies in Congress proclaimed victory. A1.

Motorola Denies It Is Short of Cash
Motorola denied a report that it was facing serious liquidity problems after its shares fell to their lowest level in eight years. Its shares fell $3.45, or 23 percent, to close at $11.50. Robert L. Growney, Motorola's president and chief operating officer, said the company was financially sound. C3.

Greenspan Calls for More Education
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in a speech that more must be done to help Americans understand the changing financial world. "Just as we have recognized how critical it is to demystify technology and to increase workers' comfort and familiarity with the new tools required for their success," he said, "so should we work to educate consumers on evaluating the broad array of products offered by financial service providers and to empower them to make the choices that contribute to their overall well-being." C14.

Earnings Warning From RadioShack
RadioShack warned that poor margins on mobile phones, satellite television and computers will cause its first-quarter earnings to fall below those a year earlier and miss forecasts. Shares of RadioShack fell $10.20, or 26.5 percent, to $28.30. The company expects to earn 31 to 33 cents a share in the first quarter, down from 34 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 38 cents a share. C3.

South Korea Holds Call Rate Steady
South Korea's central bank held interest rates steady as accelerating inflation, stoked by a weakening currency, prevented a rate cut. The Bank of Korea left the benchmark call rate, the interest it charges on overnight loans to commercial banks, at 5 percent at its monthly policy meeting. C2.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Japan's Emergency Relief Plan Is Brought Out to a Cool Reception

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 6 

 BODY:
Two days later than planned, the Japanese government produced its eagerly awaited emergency overhaul package, aimed at relieving longstanding problems in the banking industry and kick-starting the moribund economy. It was met with groans of disappointment from every quarter.
 Both Japanese and foreign economists faulted the plan for lacking cohesion, detail and, most important, political commitment. "There is no clear, comprehensive vision in this package," said Takuro Morinaga, senior analyst at the Sanwa Research Institute. "It is simply a patchwork plan, aimed at appealing to the United States." 
 Using broad language, the package promises to sweep the worst of the banks' soured loans from their balance sheets and to buffer the banks from the gyrations of Japan's wildly volatile stock market by taking some of their cross-holdings of corporate stock off their hands. 
For the debt-ridden corporate sector, the plan promises various tax and financing incentives to curb the alarming rise in bankruptcies.
The package also includes projects to spruce up urban areas, which the government hopes will stop the decade-long slide in land prices, and it includes a pledge to increase unemployment benefits, especially for older workers and those laid off in bankruptcies.
The most concrete plank of the package is a reiteration of a promise Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori made to President Bush that major banks would write off the very worst of their nonperforming loans within two years.
Faced with economic travails of its own, the Bush administration has been trying to cast Japan's long-festering economic and financial malaise as a major global problem and has pressed Japanese officials to act. Still, the package offers no hint of how the government can compel the banks to meet the deadline. 
What little of substance there is in the package is cast into further doubt by the imminent change of leadership in Japan. After stalling for weeks, Mr. Mori said on Thursday that he would heed calls to resign. On April 24, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will choose a new leader to replace him. In the ensuing cabinet reshuffle, it is unlikely that Hakuo Yanagisawa, the plainly frustrated chief advocate of far-reaching economic overhaul, will remain as financial services minister.
The package is drafted with such broad strokes that it effectively leaves a blank slate for the new cabinet to fill in. That cabinet's paramount concern will be limiting the damage in elections for the upper house of Parliament in July, when analysts predict a drubbing for the ruling party. 
Speaking to foreign journalists, Mr. Yanagisawa said his presence in the cabinet was not critical, and that Japan could not avoid keeping Mr. Mori's promise to President Bush about loan write-offs. But a 1997 promise to the United States by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that Japan's telecommunications market would be opened up to competition remains a long way from being fulfilled.
"I think Mr. Mori and Mr. Yanagisawa know that their time as ministers is short," said Takashi Kiuchi, economic adviser to Shinsei Bank. "So how the specifics of this plan will be worked out by the next team is another anxiety for the markets, I'm afraid."
Mr. Yanagisawa himself acknowledged repeatedly that today's package lacked specifics, ticking off each of the many questions analysts and investors have raised about the entity the government plans to establish to buy stocks from the banks. "We do not have any details finalized at this point," he said.
Finalizing those details now is politically impossible, he said. As an example, he noted that politicians and government officials could not agree on forcing shareholders to bear some responsibility for cleaning up corporate Japan, which would require a change in the commercial code. "If we had to include that, we felt we would not get it through at this time," he said.
The biggest sticking point, though, was the proposed fund to buy banks' share portfolios, a legacy of a once-cozy system in which the banks and customers owned stock in one another. Starting in September, the banks' books will have to carry the stocks at their current market value, raising the threat of a deep dent in the banks' capital if the stocks are not sold. The existence of the shareholdings also tends to inhibit the kind of thorough restructuring that Mr. Yanigasawa and others favor.
But the government cannot simply order the banks to sell the stock on the open market, because prices would plummet. The banks' portfolios are immense, valued now at perhaps 40 trillion yen ($332 billion), and include many obscure, illiquid shares in small companies.
The government said that the fund would eventually resell the stocks to pension and mutual funds, but few analysts expect them to be eager takers. "The largest question in my mind is: What's the exit strategy?" said Paul Frost-Smith, head of equity markets in the Asia-Pacific region at J. P. Morgan.
Mr. Yanagisawa acknowledged that there were likely to be losses on the stocks, given Japan's economic straits. "There is a certain price level at which the banks will sell these stocks, and it will be difficult for other investors to buy at that level," he said.
Ultimately, most economists and investors have concluded, public money will be used to cover losses on the stocks and shore up the banks' capital as they write off bad loans.
The government is also known to be considering requiring banks to trim their stock portfolios but not eliminate them. Some economists worry that such a half-measure will shelter the banks from the rigors of the open market without eradicating the cozy relationships between them and their borrowers.
"We have to some extent been outwitted by this plan," said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo. "They've done just enough to make sure the stock market can't force them to do something they don't want to do. The last lever on the government to act has been neutralized."
Mr. Yanagisawa made plain that he had concerns about the stock purchase plan, one of the most divisive issues the ruling party has faced in years. He and like-minded colleagues are loath to use any more public money to shore up the banks without guarantees that fundamental changes will be made. The fact that top echelons of the party are taking positions on the plan and arguing them forcefully offers perhaps the one real glimmer of hope in today's package.
Departing strikingly from accepted protocol, Mr. Yanagisawa confirmed that he had clashed with Shizuka Kamei, the party's policy chief. Identifying Mr. Kamei by name, Mr. Yanagisawa said that nemawashi, the time-honored practice of painstaking consensus building that so often congeals politics in Japan, had broken down. "There was direct confrontation on some of these issues," he said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Urges Better Money Sense 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
More must be done to help Americans understand the changing financial world, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today.
 Just as job training helps workers adapt to the spread of computers and technology throughout the economy, so does financial literacy help improve standards of living for consumers, Mr. Greenspan said in an address to a Fed community affairs research conference. 
 Mr. Greenspan did not discuss the state of the United States economy or interest rate policy.
Advances in computer technology have led to the creation of a wide range of financial products, Mr. Greenspan said, while at the same time lowering the cost and broadening the scope of financial services.
As a result, however, Americans "need to accumulate the appropriate knowledge on how to use new technologies and on how to make financial decisions in an informed manner," he said.
"Just as we have recognized how critical it is to demystify technology and to increase workers' comfort and familiarity with the new tools required for their success, so should we work to educate consumers on evaluating the broad array of products offered by financial service providers and to empower them to make the choices that contribute to their overall well-being," Mr. Greenspan said.
He suggested that the education process start as early as possible. "Improving basic financial education at the elementary and secondary school level is essential" to help young people avoid poor financial decisions "that can take years to overcome," Mr. Greenspan said.
Poor financial education has kept some lower-income people and minorities from fully benefiting from the record economic expansion, he said.
From 1995 to 1998, the median real net worth for all families increased 17.5 percent, according to the Fed's most recent survey of consumer finances.
But in contrast, median net worth declined for families with incomes below $25,000, while the median income for nonwhites and Hispanics was little changed. "This performance leaves much to be desired," Mr. Greenspan said.
Job training also remains critical, he said. "Significant segments of our population have exhibited fears that their skills will not be adequate to deal with a rapidly changing work environment," he said. "The day when a high school or college education would serve a graduate for a lifetime is gone."
Helping individuals overcome their fear of technology "can be a means of increasing economic opportunity," Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: An Instructive Vote 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
On tax cuts, President Bush has had a single, relentless message for months: It is my way or the highway, and my way is $1.6 trillion in reductions over the next decade, not a penny more or less.
 By that standard, Mr. Bush lost today. 
 In voting to adopt a budget blueprint calling for $1.2 trillion in tax cuts, the Senate resisted intense pressure from the White House and the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill to stick with Mr. Bush's figure. And in paring the president's plan, Democrats in the evenly divided Senate showed they can be an effective check on Mr. Bush and his agenda. 
Yet as much as today's vote was a blow to Mr. Bush that could have lasting effects on his political authority, it arguably left him better positioned than ever to enact the biggest tax cut in two decades.
By sticking doggedly to his $1.6 trillion package, the president forced Democrats to move much closer to his position, and he put a floor under the size of the tax cut that was well above anything that Democrats would have gone along with even a few weeks ago. 
At the start of the presidential campaign last year, Democrats were backing a $250 billion tax cut. By election day they were at $500 billion. Earlier this year, with projections of the federal budget surplus increasing, Congressional Democrats said they would support $750 billion. 
This week, when a bipartisan group of moderates pushed for a compromise of around $1.2 trillion, Democratic leaders withheld their support but left open the possibility that they could ultimately accept a tax cut of that level.
On the final vote today, 15 Democrats supported the $1.2 trillion figure, enough for the White House to claim true bipartisan support for the largest tax reduction since 1981. The House, where Republicans have a slim but solid majority, has already approved a budget blueprint calling for a $1.6 trillion tax cut.
"Getting substantial Democratic support for $1.3 trillion in tax relief is a remarkable accomplishment, and shows how effective the president's been in moving the debate," said Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania.
But even as Republicans looked on the bright side, they acknowledged that Mr. Bush had come up short on his first big legislative test. Despite an aggressive effort to rally public opinion to his side, including campaign-style trips to 22 states in the last two months, the president was unable to persuade or threaten 51 senators to stand by him on his signature issue. 
Even considerable arm twisting in the last 24 hours by Vice President Dick Cheney, among other administration officials, could not put Mr. Bush over the top. "Frankly, the administration tried to secure additional votes for a higher figure," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader. "We didn't have the votes."
Democrats in the Senate now know they can buck the president, and will no doubt be emboldened to do so regularly, whether in search of true compromise or political advantage.
"Neither end of Pennsylvania Avenue is going to dictate the result," said Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee.
After losing the White House and failing to win back either the House or the Senate, Democrats had spent the first few months of this year struggling to hold back what at times seemed to be unstoppable momentum behind Mr. Bush's tax cut.
The federal budget surplus forecast was revised upward, making it harder for Democrats to argue that Mr. Bush's plan was unaffordable. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, endorsed the idea of a substantial tax cut. The threat of a recession gave new urgency to providing the economy with a dose of fiscal stimulus through tax cuts.
In the end, only one Democrat in the Senate, Zell Miller of Georgia, came out squarely for Mr. Bush's plan, and several moderate Republicans, notably Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, edged away from it.
Rather than compromising on his own terms, Mr. Bush elected to fight for his plan to the end. And although the measure voted on today was largely the work of centrists from both parties -- and was opposed by Democratic leaders -- it was far enough removed from Mr. Bush's wishes to allow Democrats to claim victory.
"It's like a quarterback beginning the game by announcing his own point spread," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey. "If he doesn't achieve it, he's a failure."
From now on, Democrats said, Mr. Bush will have to come to the negotiating table, on taxes and on all issues dividing the parties, if he wants progress.
"We have said from the beginning, if he'd work with us, we could reach bipartisan compromise," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. "He chose not to do that and he got beat. I don't think that's something that I would expect him to do in the future."
Republicans still have a chance to enlarge the tax cut somewhat when the House and Senate meet to work out differences between their budget resolutions. But the real focus will shift to the Finance Committee, which will draw up legislation next month apportioning whatever figure is available for tax cuts among a host of competing provisions.
The measure adopted by the Senate today called for up to $85 billion in immediate tax cuts that would take effect this year, perhaps retroactive to Jan. 1. But there is no consensus on how to do it.
The measure then provides about $1.18 trillion over the next decade that will have to be divided among components backed by the president and others supported by either or both parties in Congress. 
That is not enough money to do everything, at least not to do it the way Mr. Bush has proposed. The resulting fight is all but sure to force the president to make difficult compromises about central elements of his tax agenda, including his call to repeal the federal estate tax and to reduce all income tax rates.

HEADLINE: Autonomous Television in Russia 

 BODY:
It is not easy to keep track of the cast of characters wrestling to gain financial control of NTV, Russia's only independent television network. But the outcome of the struggle is important to sustaining democracy in Russia. If NTV falls under government control, which remains a distinct possibility, Russians will lose an invaluable source of information about their country and the world outside. 
 Earlier this week the government-dominated natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, used its control of a majority of NTV's shares to install a new management team under Boris Jordan, a Russian-American investor. But many of NTV's leading journalists continue to resist the takeover, and its former owner, Vladimir Gusinsky, has been trying to interest the American media entrepreneur Ted Turner in buying a large minority interest to discourage Kremlin bullying. 
 The importance of NTV's independent broadcasting has grown in direct relation to President Vladimir Putin's effort to gather power into his own hands and silence critics of his government. Russian democracy depends in part on maintaining widely accessible sources of public information that the Kremlin cannot easily manipulate or silence. 
Mr. Gusinsky is neither an altruist nor a political innocent. He became a multimillionaire in the gold-rush culture of Russia's transition to a market economy. At one point he was a loyal ally of Boris Yeltsin's Kremlin. But along the way his holding company, Media-MOST, became a vital redoubt of news professionalism and press freedom. In recent years, NTV has fearlessly chronicled Russia's brutal military campaign in Chechnya and has exposed incompetence and criminal conduct by government officials in Moscow. 
NTV's new boss, Mr. Jordan, comes from the same kind of business background as Mr. Gusinsky. If he prevails in the current management struggle, he must not do Mr. Putin's bidding. Encouragingly, he has publicly pledged to maintain NTV's political independence. Mr. Jordan, or anyone else who ends up managing NTV, should retain its talented staff and insist on unfettered coverage of Russia and its leaders.

HEADLINE: SENATE PASSES BUDGET PLAN WITH A $1.2 TRILLION TAX CUT 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
With the solid support of Republicans and votes from nearly a third of the Democrats, the Senate approved a budget measure today that would allow a $1.2 trillion tax reduction over the next 10 years and an $85 billion tax cut this year.
 The 10-year tax cut was only three-quarters of the amount President Bush had said was essential, but the White House and its Republican allies in Congress proclaimed victory. 
 "It's a good number, fairly close to what the president wanted," said Vice President Dick Cheney, who spent the week in the Capitol twisting arms, cutting deals and, in his position as president of the Senate, breaking three tie votes.
No president ever gets everything he wants, Mr. Cheney said, adding: "It's a give-and-take process. That's what I've been doing this week." 
At the White House, Mr. Bush told guests at a ceremony in the East Room that $1.2 trillion was "meaningful tax relief for the American people" and that it would be "good for the economy."
But Democratic leaders, all of whom voted against the measure, said they had succeeded in sharply paring the size of the tax plan, even though it is far higher than the $500 billion they were seeking as recently as Election Day. And they challenged the notion of a presidential victory. 
"If this is a victory for them," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, "then we want more victories just like it."
The measure, approved 65 to 35, now goes to a conference with the House of Representatives, which approved a budget plan last month that would allow $1.6 trillion for tax cuts. Roll call, Page A11. 
The final figure will probably be between what the House and Senate passed -- and thus closer to what Mr. Bush had wanted from the start. 
The catalyst for the compromise tax cut was Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, who has tried throughout his career, usually unsuccessfully, to assemble coalitions of moderate Democrats and Republicans. 
Today, after a week of partisan squabbling and votes that broke almost entirely along party lines, Mr. Breaux brought into the fold two Republicans who had defected from their party's position and 14 other Democrats who favored a larger tax cut than their party's leaders were supporting but thought the president's proposal was too high.
His success showed that "it is in fact possible to change the political culture in Washington," Mr. Breaux said after the vote. "While the numbers will change" as debate over taxes continues over the next few months, he added, "the coalition will not." 
Republican leaders, despite claims of victory, acknowledged that they would have preferred a larger tax cut. "We didn't have the votes to pass 1.6," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader. 
They did not have the votes because only one Democratic senator, Zell Miller of Georgia, voted for the president's plan, while two Republicans, James M. Jeffords of Vermont and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, broke ranks. With the Senate divided 50-50 between the parties, that was enough to thwart the Republicans.
Mr. Jeffords, a maverick throughout his career who insisted on more spending for special education than the Bush administration was willing to accept, called the outcome a "great victory for the young kids of America."
Mr. Chafee was appointed to the Senate in 1999 after the death of his father, Senator John H. Chafee, who was a committed moderate in his long career in the Senate and often an ally of Mr. Breaux. Lincoln Chafee was elected to a full term last year.
"It is a long path we have trod to get here -- centrists working together," Mr. Chafee said after today's vote.
Democratic leaders said they had voted against the budget measure because the tax cuts were still too high, the debt reduction insufficient and the protection of Social Security and Medicare inadequate.
"I don't think it still strikes the right balance," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee.
The measure that was adopted today is called a budget resolution. It is a planning device for Congress, often called a blueprint, that establishes the broad outlines that tax and spending bills are supposed to follow. In addition to the tax cuts, the measure would allow about $2 trillion in government spending in the 2002 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
Often, the guidelines established in budget resolutions are ignored. So the action today was not decisive. But the budget resolution this year was more important than usual for two reasons.
First, it established that President Bush did not have enough support in the Senate to win passage of his full $1.6 trillion tax plan.
"That issue is dead," Senator Daschle said. "I don't think it will be revived."
Second, it was the first test of how the evenly divided Senate would operate on a highly partisan matter. The answer, as Mr. Jeffords showed, seems to be that every senator is potentially the king and, as Mr. Breaux proved, that winning margins can depend on a small coalition of senators willing to cross party lines.
After the vote, the Senate broke for a two-week recess. When the lawmakers return, two critical decisions will face them. 
The first is the tax cut for this year, which is to be taken from the budget surplus for the current fiscal year and is designed to stimulate the economy. The Senate's figure, $85 billion, is significantly above the $60 billion that has been discussed but not acted on in the House.
Democrats want part of the money to be returned to taxpayers in rebate checks and part to result from lowering the income tax rate to 10 percent from 15 percent on the first $6,000 of each individual's income. Republicans favor some kind of a reduction in all the tax brackets.
The other decision will be the nature of the tax cuts covering the 2002 fiscal year through the 2011 fiscal year. 
The House has approved three bills along the lines President Bush proposed. One would lower income tax rates across the board. Another would lower taxes on married couples and increase the tax credit for families with children. The third would slowly reduce the estate tax rate and repeal the tax entirely in 2011.
The Senate Finance Committee plans to draft tax legislation next month, and a battle royal every bit as intense as the one this week is likely when that bill reaches the Senate floor.
On Tuesday night, President Bush and the Republicans in the Senate seemed likely to prevail on the full $1.6 trillion tax reduction. Democrats lost what seemed to be a test vote on a proposal to reduce the tax cut by $158 billion and use the money to provide prescription drug coverage under Medicare.
Only Senator Chafee and Senator Miller crossed party lines. The result was a 50-to-50 tie. And Mr. Cheney cast his first tie-breaking vote against the proposal.
But on Wednesday night, Senator Jeffords defected. That led to approval of a Democratic proposal to reduce the tax cut by about $450 billion and apply the money to education programs. At the time, Republican leaders thought they would be able to reverse the vote as the week wore on, but they were never able to do so.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 9, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about Senate passage of a budget resolution misstated the measure's allocation of a saving of some $450 billion. The sum, obtained by reducing President Bush's proposed 10-year, $1.6 trillion tax cut, would be divided between spending on education and reductions in the national debt. It would not all be spent on education.

HEADLINE: Well Off but Still Pressed, Doctor Could Use Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., April 4 

 BODY:
Dr. Robert Cline lives in a graceful four-bedroom house with a pool in a tree-shrouded neighborhood considered one of the more desirable in town. His income approached $300,000 last year, ranking him among the wealthiest 2 percent of all Americans.
 And yet Dr. Cline, 39, a surgeon, says he does not feel rich. He worries about his retirement. He worries about paying for college for his six young children, not to mention weddings for his five daughters. And he worries that his earning power is fairly stagnant in a medical profession squeezed by insurance companies and tightening Medicare reimbursement rates. 
 So in February, when Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, rolled out a shiny Lexus sedan to dramatize his argument that President Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut plan favors the rich, Dr. Cline was not amused. He understands that his income will not win him outpourings of sympathy, but he resents the argument that people in higher tax brackets are less deserving of a tax cut. 
"The perception is that someone like me doesn't have any concerns other than getting a new car," said Dr. Cline, who drives a 10-year-old Acura.
"I'm not looking for a tax cut to buy a Lexus," he said. "I've got kids to put through school and a retirement to plan. Certainly, I could use the tax money for my family." 
In the hierarchy of wealth in America, a scale that ballooned drastically upward during the booming 1990's, Dr. Cline is at the low end of the high end. His annual income far surpasses what most Americans will ever earn, yet it is dwarfed by the fortunes of the super-rich who have built limestone mansions on the western hills of this city.
When Dr. Cline and his wife, Tasha, offered a visitor a ride-around tour, they drove through a mansion-filled compound called Stratford Hills. The message was clear: They are rich, not us.
For Dr. Cline, a Republican who voted for Mr. Bush, the philosophical basis for a tax cut echoes the president's own points that everyone, regardless of income, should get a tax cut and that since the wealthy pay more, their tax savings should be larger. Dr. Cline said he did not mind that the people in the mansions would get bigger tax savings than he would. He just wants what he considers his fair share and does not believe that only people in lower brackets should get help.
"You know, I think I pay too much in taxes," he said. "I'm sure everybody feels the same way, but I do, too. Should you pay more than a third of what you make to the government? I don't think so."
Practicality, though, as much as philosophy explains why Dr. Cline wants a tax cut. 
Because of the economics of medicine, which saw insurers and Medicare tighten reimbursement rates, Dr. Cline's gross income fell to $289,678 last year from $293,505 in 1999, even though he worked more hours. He said his elite education -- four years of college, four years of medical school, seven years of medical residency and training in his specialty of colo-rectal surgery -- has put him in a profession that is "isolated from capitalism, particularly in the managed care environment." 
"People don't go into medicine for the money, and that's pretty obvious in this economy," he said. "But I'd also like to have some control over what I make. And since I don't, a tax cut is the next best thing."
In fact, Dr. Cline stands to see a significant tax cut under the plans moving through Congress. If Mr. Bush ultimately succeeds in achieving the $1.6 trillion cut, the family could save nearly $12,000 a year, according to an analysis by the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm. 
In 1995, the Clines moved to Austin, where Robert had spent his teenage years as his father worked as business manager for The Austin American-Statesman newspaper. In those days -- the mid-1970's -- the city was a mellow state capital best known for its live music scene. "All most people wanted was a Frisbee and a good dog to catch it," he said a bit wistfully. 
But the Austin that greeted the Clines in 1995 was a high-tech boomtown where public offerings and stock options dominated the cocktail chatter of a new millionaire class.
"It was a little frustrating," Dr. Cline said. "Here I was building a practice and already starting to see there is a top end on what I can provide. And everybody is quitting their jobs and going into dot-com.
"It was insanity. You would see all these young guys driving around in Porsches. I was going, 'Wow, I should have been a computer nerd.' "
When he began his practice, Dr. Cline took out a $100,000 loan to start his business and feed his family. Slowly, his practice grew. 
His family grew much faster. When they moved to Austin, they had just one child; by 1998 they had three children under the age of 4. 
When he and Tasha decided to have a fourth and final child, they instead had twin girls, Monroe and Eva, now both nearly 3. There were complications, and Eva has required extensive medical attention; her annual medical expenses -- the amount paid out of pocket to meet the insurance deductible -- exceed $10,000. 
In 1998, the family moved into their current four-bedroom house in the fashionable Tarrytown neighborhood. The house cost $667,000 -- a stretch for them -- but it was only five minutes from Dr. Cline's office and the overheated real estate market offered few bargains.
But when Mrs. Cline unexpectedly became pregnant with their sixth child and only son, Saylor, now 9 months old, they found they had already outgrown a house they could barely afford. Saylor sleeps in a walk-in closet converted to a nursery.
Mrs. Cline, 35, a former actress, said she does not want to be perceived "as the whining rich." Her days are spent chasing children and ferrying them to schools, doctors and soccer games. With six children under the age of 7, the family spends about $26,000 annually for a 40-hour-a-week nanny, though her hours will be cut in half when the three oldest girls enroll in school this fall. 
Mrs. Cline said she shops at the cheaper grocery stores -- her mother-in-law clips coupons for her -- and that new clothes for the children are a rarity. She said that the family rake their own leaves, paint their own bedrooms, clean their own pool. 
"We don't have the luxuries that you would think in this tax bracket," she said. "Of course, I'm sure that having six kids doesn't help."
Dr. Cline added: "I can only imagine what someone who makes $40,000 or $50,000 a year needs with a family my size." 
Last year, Dr. Cline became concerned enough about his family finances that he asked his office manager to look for ways to save money. The manager had Mrs. Cline document her weekly medical and household expenses, down to coffee at Starbucks. Now, the family budget runs through the office manager, who doles out an allowance to Mrs. Cline every other week. 
When Texas public schools closed for spring break last month, Mrs. Cline said, "everybody I know went to Colorado and Utah. We drove to San Antonio for the day and took the baby to the zoo."
"We have a good life," she added. "And yet we still have the same struggles as other people. I feel like a lot of the time we're treading water. America should be a place where you can get ahead, not get dragged down."
For Dr. Cline, money is not a consuming issue, not something he covets. Yet, he said, "with what I do, I guess my expectation was that I was not going to worry about money. And here I am worrying about money." 
His job often allows him to spend weekends with his wife and children and even make early evening soccer games of his second-oldest daughter, Tess. But he worries about paying for his children's college education the way his father did for him.
His in-state tuition at the University of Texas had been roughly $250 a semester back in the mid-1980s, and medical school at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas cost around $650 a semester. His own children's educations, he realizes, will likely cost tens of thousands of dollars each.
"Even if they stay in town and go to U.T., it's not going to be cheap," he said.
Once again, the family is house-hunting. The real estate boom has tacked another $200,000 in appraised value onto their house. But they are having a hard time finding a five-bedroom house in a neighborhood they like for less than $1 million. One option would be to move further out to the suburbs, where houses are cheaper but the commute is longer. Dr. Cline said he was a city guy and hated the thought of moving.
"I don't think I'm unique, especially in the medical community," he said. "We know other families that are moving into smaller houses for the same reasons."
From the tone of the debate in Washington, Dr. Cline said, it was obvious that a tax cut is coming, but not yet clear for whom and how much.
"My point to you is that I need one, too," he said.

Judging the Tax Cut
This is the third article in a series about how taxpayers at varying income levels would be affected by the Bush tax cut proposal. The final installment will focus on a carpenter in Maine.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE PREP; 
La Dolce Semester

BYLINE:  By Glenn C. Altschuler; Glenn C. Altschuler is dean of the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions and the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies at Cornell University.

 BODY:
Even before attending freshman orientation, many students have already decided to study abroad. The programs, featured prominently in college admissions literature, have become nothing less than an expectation among upper-middle-class teenagers, like braces and a car. Students may not know where they want to go, or what they want to study, but they know they don't want to miss "the experience of a lifetime."
 Especially during the 1990's, amid dire predictions for anyone not trained for the new global economy, enrollments in study-abroad programs soared, from about 70,000 to almost 130,000 at the end of the decade, according to the Institute of International Education. Since students also have to pay for travel and can't get work-study jobs overseas, most participants come from elite, expensive private institutions. Between a quarter and a third of undergraduates at Brown, Cornell, Duke, Notre Dame, Brigham Young and Yeshiva University get credit for academic work in another country. At small colleges, including Bates, Colby, Middlebury and Wesleyan, the percentages are even higher. 
 Still, the numbers are small compared with the total undergraduate population. Study abroad missionaries, who point out that 99 percent of students remain home, are pressing to pick up the pace. If students are adequately prepared, "I don't think there are any cons to study abroad," Jon Ramsey, dean of studies at Skidmore College, said in a refrain repeated by administrators at a dozen institutions. 
Even Bill Clinton, who as president signed legislation that appropriated $150 million for study-abroad scholarships, endorsed an increase in the number and diversity of students who participate. Last year, Richard W. Riley, as secretary of education, set a 10-year goal of doubling the study-abroad population. President Bush and Secretary of Education Rod Paige have yet to weigh in on the subject. 
When it builds on language study or work in an academic major, studying overseas can be a stimulating, even transformative intellectual experience. For Jill Schondebare, who is majoring in animal science, researching wildlife management in Kenya was "my best semester at Cornell." So was reading classics at Queens College at Oxford for Justin Schwab.
More often than the enthusiasts would like to admit, however, the good reasons for study abroad are not always the reasons motivating undergraduates. Another Cornell undergraduate, Alejandro Varela, acknowledges that he was attracted to Seville, Spain, because of the lower drinking age and "vacation aspect."
"No matter how I did in school, it would not be calculated into my G.P.A.," he said. He and his buddies "relaxed five or six days a week -- and that was when we were not traveling." They spent time with other Americans, rarely socializing or studying with Spaniards. The five months in Seville, Alejandro maintains, "was my favorite college semester."
It is difficult to know whether Alejandro's experience is more typical than Jill's or Justin's. In a recent doctoral dissertation, Lisa Chieffo, the study-abroad coordinator at the University of Delaware, wrote that studies measuring the benefits of an academic sojourn yielded mixed, inconclusive and sometimes surprising results. Because study abroad "seems intuitively to be a good thing to do," she wrote, "it is tempting for administrators to assume that such an experience must have positive benefits." 
But alongside favorable documentation, she cites studies -- published in academic journals over the last 20 years -- that are less sanguine. Advanced language learners, for example, do not necessarily become more fluent abroad than those who stay at home. Dr. Chieffo speculates that the students put a greater premium on communicating quickly than on grammatical accuracy, while the reverse is true in language classes in the United States.
In one study, undergraduates with fair or poor language ability, who had little interaction and tended to be ethnocentric, often returned home with their attitudes reinforced rather than challenged or changed. Finally, because experiences in an unfamiliar country -- navigating the buses of Rome or negotiating access to the refrigerator or bathroom with a host family -- can lead to frustration and failure, some students' self-esteem suffered. 
It seems clear, then, that preparation should involve more than just saying "I want to go." And benefits should be weighed against lost opportunities. Are advanced courses in your major available in the study-abroad curriculum? (American studies majors may not, for example, find much in a German university.) Are classes as rigorous as those offered on campus? Will you have difficulty getting started on an honors thesis if you're away your junior year? Will a summer job or internship be harder to get if you're overseas during spring semester? How much does it matter that you will not participate in intercollegiate sports, the school newspaper or the student assembly while away? And are you headed for England or Australia, the destination of more than 27 percent of all study-abroad students, out of genuine interest or because you want to be a tourist and don't have the foreign language proficiency to go elsewhere?
Colleges offer a number of options. Some programs are held over a winter or a summer session, or even spring break -- the shorter the program, of course, the more ephemeral the impact. Some institutions, however, will grant academic credit only for programs taken over a full semester or year. Policies on transferring credits completed while abroad also vary from institution to institution. Credit is not automatically granted, nor are courses always applied to requirements in a major. (In case a question arises, save all syllabuses, exams and research papers.)
In one popular option, called an island program, Americans live together and take courses in English, often taught by professors from the home university, instead of mixing with the local culture residentially and academically. If an institution requires attendance at an island program in, say, Britain, France, Spain, Italy or Australia, think twice about enrolling.
Sometimes, however, only an island program is feasible. Because few colleges and universities offer advance courses in Arabic, Thai, Danish or Russian, students may be unable to survive in courses taught in those languages. In Japan, where the academic year begins in April, study-abroad advisers consider the best option to be the island program at the Kyoto Center for Japanese Studies, which operates on the Western calendar.
Advisers also recommend that students begin preparing freshman year. At Cornell, students are not permitted to study in another country until they've completed pertinent courses in language, history, politics and culture. If nothing is available -- there are no courses on Australia, for instance -- they must arrange a reading tutorial with a faculty member. Participating in a "language table" at the dormitory dining hall or living in a language house is just as valuable in the semester before studying abroad as it is on return.
This may all seem like so many hoops to jump through to get a go-ahead from parents and administrators, but students who reflect on the role of international study in their academic, personal and professional development are likely to have more than just their favorite semester in college. They may have the experience of a lifetime.

HEADLINE: Great Expectations 

BYLINE:  By Catherine Hausman and Victoria Goldman; Catherine Hausman and Victoria Goldman are co-authors of "The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools." Ms. Goldman is a board member of the Albert G. Oliver Program.

 BODY:
Growing up in Brooklyn, Randolph J. Sealey Jr. never felt like anything other than a typical American kid with an immigrant's background. His grandmother cooked with curry, and he loved baseball and school. "I was either going to play for the New York Yankees or be a doctor," said Mr. Sealey, who arrived in the United States from Panama at age 8.
 He went the latter career route. On a scholarship at Lawrenceville, a prestigious boarding school in southern New Jersey, he emerged as a leader in the classroom, on the playing fields and in student life. He worked his way through Duke University and then medical school at the State University of New York. 
 Few would guess that Mr. Sealey, with all his accomplishments and prep school manners, has lived in the United States unlawfully for most of his 27 years. Like others in his situation -- remarkable students running, often unwittingly, under the radar of the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- he has had to wage a quiet crusade to finish his education. 
To be young, talented and illegal, even with a fistful of acceptances to top universities, means a college dream is at best uncertain. Only American citizens and legal permanent residents -- green card holders -- qualify for federal and state grants and loans. And just a few private colleges and universities award financial aid to international students -- the highly competitive category in which illegal immigrants are placed. Even attending city universities, which have long catered to the immigrant population, can be a financial hardship for poor students who, without a green card, work off the books in low-paying jobs.
About 25,000 illegal immigrants are enrolled in American public universities and community colleges, with only 200 at private institutions, according to Michael A. Olivas, director of the Institute for Higher Education Law and Governance at the University of Houston Law Center. "There are probably another 50,000 to 75,000 undocumented students who are qualified and desirous of a college education," he said, but they are discouraged from applying because of fear of the I.N.S. and soaring tuitions. 
Each year the nonprofit program Prep for Prep prepares and places in private high schools some 150 talented minority students, two to three of whom are illegal, says Charles Guerrero, director of college guidance for the program. "Many struggle just to scrape together funds for their local community college," Mr. Guerrero said. "Some lose the opportunity to go to a really first-rate school. While many will go to state schools and do very well, if you do well at a school like Georgetown, Northwestern or Stanford, there's a difference in how that work is perceived and how it is valued. There are opportunities for research, for jobs, leadership and social connections." 
A 1982 Supreme Court ruling guarantees that all illegal immigrants have access to free public education through high school, but not beyond that. National sentiment, especially during economic downturns, rests squarely on the side of limiting education, according to Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the immigration service. "When things get bad," he said, "the immigrants historically have been blamed." 
The mood became particularly negative during the recession of the early 90's, leading to the passage of major legislation in 1996 restricting social benefits to noncitizens. One divisive provision that was dropped from the bill would have allowed states to bar illegal immigrants from public schools. Pete Wilson, then governor of California, and Bob Dole, then running for president, vociferously supported the provision, arguing that the government should not have to bear the cost of educating the children of nontaxpayers, that illegal students were crowding out those legally entitled to the places and that the students would not get legal jobs on graduation anyway. 
Now, a bill pending in the California Legislature would help such students. If passed, illegal immigrants graduating from a California high school would be eligible for state financial aid. The bill, on its second round, was vetoed last session by Gov. Gray Davis. Another bill is being prepared by a United States Representative from California, Howard L. Berman, to grant conditional permanent residency to "Americanized" undocumented students "so they can receive a quality education that will permit them to become productive, self-supporting U.S. citizens," according to Gene Smith, his chief of staff. On its prospects, she added, "Immigration reform has not been real popular in the last several years in Congress." 
Haseena Enu, an immigration lawyer who works with Prep for Prep, believes educating illegal immigrants is an investment, particularly given the fact that many will make their lives here. "For children who have been living here from a very young age with their families, and have achieved huge success, just like other kids they think the sky's the limit," she said. "What a shock it is to them, and a loss to the country, that they don't get the benefit of the best education."
Randy Sealey was born in Mexico City in 1974, the son of a blond, blue-eyed German dancer and a nightclub singer of Caribbean descent. After a bitter divorce, the father took his son to a small town in Panama, where he literally dropped him into the laps of his own parents. Mr. Sealey remembers little of his early years in Panama but will never forget his grandmother telling him: "You'll be learning English from this point on in this house." 
He moved to the United States with his grandmother and grandfather, who had become a naturalized citizen through his work as a land surveyor on the Panama Canal. "Like many Caribbean immigrants, he accepted a lower level job, as a courier," Mr. Sealey said. "The most important thing was to bring money home and put food on the table." 
The boy arrived on a visitor's visa. When it expired, he became illegal. 
He distinguished himself early, graduating second in his class from the David A. Boody Junior High School in Bensonhurst, a magnet public school for bright students. As salutatorian at graduation he spoke prescient words about making decisions, making an impact and going forward.
A guidance counselor referred him to the Albert G. Oliver Program, a New York City nonprofit organization that places talented black and Hispanic students in private secondary schools. He would attend the Lawrenceville School on a full scholarship.
Many prep schools are now taking stricter measures to determine a potential student's status. Phillips Academy at Andover, Mass., recently added a line for an alien registration number to its application. If there is no Social Security number or registration number, the school will investigate. "To admit a student we knew was an illegal would be to put that student in a bad situation three to four years from now when they apply to college" and cannot get enough aid, said Sharon Britton, the academy's director of communications. When Mr. Sealey entered Lawrenceville in 1989, nobody asked. The school, which lacks the resources to deal with immigration entanglements, has since adopted the same policy as Phillips Academy.
Mr. Sealey was awed by the 191-year-old Lawrenceville School and its aristocratic pretensions. "I didn't know places like this existed," he said. "They have their own golf course and a hockey rink. The buildings were just dripping with history. I really felt that I saw white Americans -- this was not your Jewish friend or your Italian friend -- it was, 'My grandfather's father's father went here and my name is on that building.' "
For a boy from multicultural Brooklyn "in the world of J. Crew and L.L. Bean, it's easy to lose your identity," he added. "One of the biggest things that helped me fit in was the fact that I was good at sports." 
The school paid for Mr. Sealey to join the baseball team on its annual preseason trip to Florida. His coach, Champneys Atlee, remembers the dedicated young man who "night after night, sometimes in the rain, hit in the batting cages until 10 or 11 o'clock." By all accounts, Randy Sealey had a bright future. 
But during his senior year, a year of great expectations for college prospects, the floor fell out from under him. Mr. Sealey had been accepted at Duke, Georgetown and several Division III schools -- so he could play ball -- including Hamilton, Amherst and Franklin & Marshall College. "They sent me great financial aid packages," Mr. Sealey said. "F.&M. even gave me a full ride for all four years."
There was a problem; on all the applications, he had left the question "Are you an American citizen?" blank. His grandfather had begun adoption proceedings so that he could sponsor his grandson, but he had died before they were completed. His grandmother "just didn't have the wherewithal," Mr. Sealey said. They needed both parents' signatures, and his mother could not be located. 
Minors can be sponsored by an immediate family member -- sisters or brothers over 21 who are United States citizens, or parents who are citizens or have green cards. The process can take so long -- from 2 to 20 years, depending on category and nationality -- that some children "age out" at 21 and have to start over in a new category, which could take another two years, according to Mr. Strassberger of the I.N.S. Applicants do not have the right to "wait it out" here during the process, and can be deported if they come to the attention of the immigration service. District officers have discretion in not deporting minors whose caretakers are in the United States.
Mr. Sealey had already been to three or four lawyers to resolve his illegal status. "Nothing was working out," he said. 
When he revealed his situation to the colleges, all the loans and scholarships were rescinded because they were tied to state and federal funds. 
"I was still welcome to attend," he said, "assuming I could pay the tuition." 
Typically, a financial aid officer determines what a student can pay, then puts together a package of government grants and loans to bridge the gap. If a private institution wants a student badly enough, it will throw in its own money to meet the college's sticker price. At least that's how it works for Americans.
College applications ask noncitizens for an alien registration number or visa number, which illegal immigrants lack. How an institution reacts to that information varies. Usually the immigrant is considered with the pool of students from abroad, where competition is stiff for both admission and aid. 
"It's virtually impossible for undocumented students to get funding at the private colleges and universities," said Kalman A. Chany, an educational financial consultant and author of "Paying for College Without Going Broke." "The funds are limited, the awards are so small, and given to the most exceptional student." 
Most colleges can't afford to give aid to foreign students or give very little, in the conviction that Americans are their priority. Some refuse to accept applications from illegal immigrants at all. And only a handful of the richest universities -- Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale and Princeton -- have extended need-blind admissions to international students, which frees up admissions offices to make decisions without regard to financial circumstance. The institutions then divine ways to meet the students' financial need, usually through a mix of grants, loans and campus jobs. 
Since foreigners have traditionally had to pay their own way, applicants have come from more developed countries. The aim of the elite universities is to diversify their campuses with the top students from poorer countries as well as present a more global image. 
But it's rarely a full ride, perhaps in 10 percent of cases, says Caesar Storlazzi, associate director of undergraduate financial aid services at Yale. 
Even when an institution can offer a generous grant, the price tag can be so high as to be beyond reach. Syracuse University, whose tuition, fees, room and board comes to about $31,000 for next fall, offers some $21 million in merit-based institutional scholarships. Awards range up to $24,000. But without federal loans or grants, most illegal immigrants would be hard pressed to make up the shortfall.
Would an illegal immigrant have a shot at these opportunities anyway? 
To pick up most of the cost for four years is a huge financial commitment for a university. Financial aid officers must also weigh whether a student, without a green card, can pay back a loan upon graduation.
"Most financial aid officers would not want to spend scarce financial aid dollars on an illegal immigrant," said Larry Zaglanizzy, a spokesman for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Officers.
Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day, a public high school for students ages 17 to 22 who are living with adult responsibilities, is a far cry from the golf greens of Lawrenceville. 
"These students don't have three meals a day unless they work for it," said Gregory P. Cohen, executive director of Comprehensive Development, a nonprofit organization that provides social services to students at the school. 
Originally built for Jewish immigrant girls in 1904, the school now teaches 800 students from 52 countries. "Whoever arrives at Kennedy on Sunday shows up on Monday," said Mr. Cohen, who estimates that of 480 students in the program for English as a second language, a third are illegal. "We have kids from Afghanistan, Kosovo, China and everywhere in between." 
Comprehensive Development, headquartered in the basement of the school, is staffed with 140 volunteer tutors, three social workers and two college counselors. It's here, in a buzz of activity, that students come to navigate the college maze. 
"Documented or not, everybody in this school expects to go to college," said Candace Reyes-Dandrea, a college adviser at the Door, an immigrant advocacy group that works with the school. 
One such student is Oscar. One of seven children in Mexico, he was brought to the United States at age 17 with an older brother. He spoke no English, had only a primary school education and no immigration status. 
"I was trying to go to school and find time to work," said Oscar, who declined to give his last name for fear of the I.N.S. He started at Manhattan Comprehensive at night as a student in English as a second language, working during the day. In his five years there, he received excellent grades and learned English along the way. He graduated in 1996 at age 22 with the Principal's Award, given to the student who overcomes significant barriers to earn a diploma, a real honor in a school where nearly every student's story is a profile in adversity. "I'd never won anything," Oscar said, "especially anything like that. I was proud." 
Oscar is now studying computer science at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, City University of New York. He recently bought a second-hand computer, which he upgraded himself. But it broke down and he now uses one at school for his studies. "I have to save my money," he said. 
Early every morning Oscar leaves the house in Ridgewood, Queens, where he lives with his sister and travels more than 40 minutes to his job at a coffee shop. He takes orders and works the cash register for $8 an hour. From 4 to 9 p.m. he goes to college, then it's back home to do homework and sleep. 
Most of Manhattan Comprehensive's students can barely scrape up tuition to pay for a public university. Oscar was able to prove he had been a city resident for more than a year and a half to get the CUNY in-state tuition for a two-year college of $2,500 a year, as opposed to about $3,500. He spends perhaps $1,000 on books. 
Out-of-state tuition is a real challenge for poor students: roughly $6,800 at a CUNY four-year institution, $8,300 at a SUNY school.
In Texas, illegal immigrants are required to pay "international rates" to its public university system -- $254 a semester hour, as opposed to $40 in-state. A bill pending in the state Legislature would allow illegal immigrants who have graduated from Texas high schools to pay in-state rates. The immigration bill pending in the California Legislature includes a similar provision. 
Ambition and a willingness to work hard do not always translate into a green card. Oscar's immigration status remains unresolved. "I was hoping that if maybe I started university that could help me to get status here," he said. "But I don't think that's the case. I know that if I finish university with a diploma or some sort of skill I might not be able to work here and I'll have to go back to Mexico." 
Because he has taken time off to earn tuition money, it is taking Oscar four years to get through the two-year college. 
"The difference between being middle class and being poor is you can't follow the sequence from high school to college," Mr. Cohen said. "Students who defer college now will find a way to get what they need. But we'd rather see it happen when they have the freedom of a 23-year-old rather than when they're 35, married with children."
Artee Ramkhelawan lost her momentum somewhere between high school and now. She won a full scholarship to Taft, a boarding school in Watertown, Conn., through the Wight Foundation in Newark. She excelled at languages and was interested in international business and medicine, sparked by a community service job at a local hospital. Her father had been a pediatric surgeon before the family emigrated from Trinidad in 1991 to join her paternal grandmother, already an American citizen. 
Ms. Ramkhelawan began to understand the ramifications of her situation in her junior year, after applying to study abroad in Barcelona. "When they asked for my documents, that's when it really hit me that I could not do something like this. I kept calling my parents and they kept calling lawyers who said, 'Oh, well, all you need to do is submit another form, and another form.' That's when I got nervous about college because I realized I would not be eligible for financial aid."
With a combined SAT of 1260 and a 3.4 average, she was accepted at Syracuse University, Barnard College and New York University, but she could not afford the tuition or secure a private loan. 
The family had submitted papers upon arrival in the United States, four years before Ms. Ramkhelawan applied to college. But her green card did not arrive until 1997, a year after she graduated from Taft. By then, she was taking pre-med courses at Rutgers at night and helping support her family. Her father had failed the physicians' licensing exam and refused to go back to school. He worked for an insurance company for a time but then fell into depression and spends most of his days in their small Newark apartment, while Ms. Ramkhelawan's mother works as an employee trainer at an insurance company.
"I kept losing papers, I was in debt, and I was overwhelmed," Ms. Ramkhelawan said. "When you get home from work and school you're just so tired and bills were piling up. I fell asleep on my books. I knew I could do so much better academically, but I was not motivated anymore. One by one I kept withdrawing from my classes." 
Her grade point average dropped to "barely a 3.0." 
After taking a year off to work full time, Ms. Ramkhelawan, now 22, is applying to Syracuse, the University of Massachusetts, the University of Connecticut and Boston University.
"Some immigrants resign themselves to a regular job and that can be thoroughly depressing because you can't pursue your dreams," said Peter Wilson, a college counselor at Manhattan Comprehensive. "It's devastating not to be able to move out of working-class constraints. Some will be really driven. The prospect of college can be life-altering."
What should have been a time of celebration for Randy Sealey became instead a time of apprehension. "In the spring of my senior year, you'd walk down the dorm halls and everybody's saying, 'I'm going to Harvard,' 'I'm going to Yale or Princeton.' 'Randy, where are you going?' It was very scary because I didn't know where this was going to lead. I figured one night someone was going to come to my dorm and deport me."
This might have been the end of the story. "His whole future suddenly seemed to turn on a dime," recalled Dave Cantlay, an English teacher at Lawrenceville and Mr. Sealey's housemaster, "with no money at all for college or perhaps being shipped out of the country to a home that wasn't home." But abandoning him was out of the question. "My God, we've taken a kid on and educated him here and given him these prospects," Mr. Cantlay said. "How do you cut him adrift?" 
It became a crusade. 
A lawyer, Marcia Needleman, was found through an old-boy connection -- a partner at a law firm specializing in immigration who was a Lawrenceville trustee. Ms. Needleman said there was a way to help Mr. Sealey, but it was risky. Although she had never done it before, she suggested a legal strategy known as suspension of deportation. "Normally you try to do everything to avoid that," she said, "because once you bring him to the attention of the service you can never be sure which way it's going to go." To qualify for consideration for suspension of deportation an illegal immigrant must demonstrate good moral character and extreme hardship to himself or an immediate relative if he is sent back "home." An affirmative deportation proceeding was begun, Mr. Sealey got a temporary visa and Lawrenceville took care of the fees.
But Mr. Sealey still could not afford tuition at Duke. The cause was taken up by Josiah Bunting 3d, then headmaster of Lawrenceville and now superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute. "The hell with bureaucracy!" General Bunting said, describing his reaction to the tangle of red tape. "This is a great kid. Let's do what we have to do, period." 
The headmaster appealed to the school's alumni, and one -- a "businessman and champion of the school" -- agreed to foot the bill for Mr. Sealey's first year of Duke, anonymously. In 1992, Mr. Sealey went off to college in Durham, N.C. The tuition bills went directly to Lawrenceville, and the school didn't scrimp. "I had the best meal plan," Mr. Sealey said.
With a 3.6 grade point average under his belt for his first semester, Mr. Sealey made an appointment to see James A. Belvin Jr., director of financial aid. "That was tough; he was a 6-foot-5 Southerner with a deep accent sitting behind his desk," said Mr. Sealey, who is about 5 feet 8. "He told me, 'Weeeell, son, there's not much we can do for you."' Mr. Sealey was still not eligible for federal loans or grants. Mr. Belvin remembers how he explained the challenge of trying to balance the interests of needy families with a restricted financial aid pool. All Randy Sealey heard was "no." 
Mr. Sealey was referred to Janet Dickerson, then the vice president of student affairs, who took up his fight and assured him he would be able to return in the fall. She contacted Mr. Belvin on his behalf several times, spoke to his lawyer in New York to clarify the facts and appealed to the associate provost.
Mr. Belvin relented, awarding Mr. Sealey two substantial grants as well as a loan at 8 percent interest, the same rate as the Stafford, the workhorse student federal loan. One of the grants Mr. Sealey received, the Susan J. Dannenberg Scholarship, is given to students who do not qualify for traditional forms of financial aid. The scholarship was established by the family of Ms. Dannenberg, whose college roommate, a young woman from India, was given in marriage by her father during her senior year. When she refused, she was cut off financially. The Dannenberg gift enabled her to finish her schooling. It would now enable Mr. Sealey to finish his. 
But his case would be reviewed on a semester-by-semester basis and contingent upon his keeping his grade point average above a 3.0. "I had a huge chip on my shoulder," he said. "Friends would come and tell me they were having a hard time. I had a hard time listening to people and what they were going through" because of "this other load I was carrying besides studying for organic chemistry." 
The summer after Mr. Sealey's freshman year he worked from 9 to 5 on a research internship at the Hospital for Joint Diseases, which led to an interest in orthopedics. From 6 to 10 p.m. he sold clothes at the Gap, often closing the store. 
The deportation hearing was scheduled for Dec. 2, 1994, two weeks before finals. 
"On the day of the hearing, the floor was buzzing. Who is this kid? We've got to meet this kid," Ms. Needleman recalled. "The application package we submitted for him was very impressive. They saw all of his achievements. He had done community work, sports and had an excellent academic record." The case drew a sympathetic judge, whose first words to Mr. Sealey were, "Why aren't you in class right now?" The lawyer representing the immigration service did not contest the documentation. Mr. Sealey was granted a green card.
"It's easy to see if you have a brilliant scientist coming in from Eastern Europe; it's not so easy to see if you have a little boy from Mexico," Ms. Needleman said. "But someone saw potential in him and look where he is today. No matter what he does he will devote some portion of his life to giving back to the community."
Today, immigration laws are more restrictive. "If we were doing it now," she said, "Randy would not even qualify for this strategy." But he might find it easier to meet Duke's $26,768 in tuition and fees; in February, the university announced that it would offer, for the first time, need-based aid to a limited number of foreign students.
Mr. Sealey graduated from Duke in 1996, and deferred medical school for a year to teach science at the George School outside Philadelphia through the Independent Teaching Project, an organization that places minority teachers. He went on to the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, where he was named the first Medical Scholar of the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health -- a $20,000 award. He now awaits a match for a residency in orthopedic surgery.
Mr. Sealey was finally able to return to Mexico in 1999 to "piece my life together." He had not seen his mother since he was 4. His father has visited him once or twice a year, at Christmas and graduations.
The person who kept his dream alive was his grandfather. "I saw him work right up until the day he died," Mr. Sealey said. "He got up every day, got dressed and got on the subways, even in his upper 70's and 80's, keeping things together. I thought, 'If he could do it, then there's no reason I couldn't."' 
Last week, Mr. Sealey was sworn in as an American citizen. "It's kind of ironic," he said with characteristic understatement. "Really, the hardest years are coming up. As of July 1, somebody's going to be calling me Doctor."

Yearbooks That Speak Volumes

BYLINE:  By DANIELLE SVETCOV

 BODY:
Laura Prichard's senior portrait speaks when provoked. To her friends it says, "Thanks for the cheeseballs and the late-night talks." To her parents it says, "I need money, just a little though." 
 Ms. Prichard's yearbook is actually a CD-ROM chronicling her life at Northwest Missouri State University, in Maryville. In addition to wisecracking senior portraits, it contains a video of the championship football team charging down the field, audio critiques of the year's "Brigadoon" production and recordings from the homecoming variety show. 
 In 1996, the university's production staff guessed correctly that a flashy CD could lift sales. Like other CD yearbooks, it is a supplement to the print version. The university sold 2,700 yearbooks in 1995 and 3,250 in 2000 with the additional CD. It also won the Associated Collegiate Press's first award in the CD category, which was added two years ago in response to the format's growing popularity.
While administrators are cutting pages or eliminating yearbooks because of production costs upward of $50,000, CD-ROM's offer adventurous and economical possibilities. A master costs about $500 to produce, with each duplicate less than a dollar.
Yearbook staffs can produce their own CD-ROM's using software like Director and Premiere, but CD's are labor intensive, which may explain why they are more common in high school, where "yearbook" earns academic credit. Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, Calif., will produce its fourth supplement this year. Julio Cruz, 17, an editor, says special effects provide an experience that print yearbooks can't: a senior baby-picture matching game or hip-hop music streaming in over photographs of club activities.
Will CD-ROM's eclipse print yearbooks? "That would be dangerous," says Laura Widmer, director of student publications at Northwest Missouri. "CD technology will be obsolete in a few years, and students would have to switch to a new medium."
Herff Jones, a major pro- ducer of college and high school memorabilia, has made CD yearbooks for 15 schools. Ron J. Boram, its marketing director, does not think CD's will overtake print. "After all these years, students still love to flip through the pages," he says, "and you can't sign a CD!" DANIELLE SVETCOV

In Diplomacy School, Foreign Faces

BYLINE:  By NINA SIEGAL

 BODY:
The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, a graduate program at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., has long prided itself on a nonisolationist approach to world affairs. Perhaps that's why 51 percent of this year's entering students come from other countries, a 10 percent increase since 1993. 
 Although Fletcher claims to be the first to cross the halfway point, other international affairs schools are nearing the mark: Columbia, with 45 percent; Johns Hopkins, 43 percent; and Harvard, 41 percent. 
The proportion of foreign students has increased significantly in recent years, according to Marcus J. Grundahl, director of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs, which represents 37 American universities. "The post-cold-war context has changed the curriculum so that schools are more open to discussing or educating students in new areas," he said.
Forty-three countries are represented among freshmen at Fletcher, which added an Armenian program after the fall of the Soviet Union and now educates students from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The school has also seen an influx of applicants from Mexico since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
And what of the future of American diplomacy?
Gerard F. Sheehan, Fletcher's executive dean, admits the school has received fewer American applicants, which he attributes to the thriving economy. With the boom over, more Americans may turn to graduate school instead of jobs. NINA SIEGAL

HEADLINE: HOW TO; 
Invent a Brand Name

BYLINE:  By Josh Rottenberg; Josh Rottenberg is a freelance writer living in New York.

 BODY:
As of December, Bill Nguyen had nearly everything he needed to start a successful business. He had a grand vision for the post-PC world: the current technobabble of cell phones, PDA's, pagers and other wireless gadgets could be woven into a unified global data-information network by a single company offering the right software. He had a proven record; at age 29, he had already been a key player in five start-ups, three of which had gone public. He had $34 million in venture capital and 60 eager employees. What he still didn't have, with his company's March inaugural date just two months away, was a name.
 With the Nasdaq's swoons causing widespread intestinal flutter, Nguyen knew a lot would hang on the first impression his company made. He wanted a name that would radiate strength and credibility, something with a dawn-of-an-era feel. He didn't even know where to start. 

1. Seek professional help. The 90's economic boom transformed the business of naming -- formerly a casual sideline for advertising agencies -- into a feverishly competitive industry, with rival firms touting systematic "naming modules." Their techniques include analysis of such linguistic properties as "speechstream visibility" (will a consumer read the name properly?), "phonetic transparency" (is it spelled as it sounds?) and "multilingual functionality" (is it as intelligible in Dubai as in Dubuque?), as well as focus-group testing to rate how potential names convey qualities like "caring toward customers."
Seeking a more personal, offbeat approach, Kate O'Sullivan, Nguyen's vice president for corporate communications, selected A Hundred Monkeys, a two-man operation in Sausalito, Calif., that charges $75,000 (a typical naming fee) and spurns what it terms "pseudoscience" in favor of gut instinct. "Now that we've done this a million times, it's intuitive," says A Hundred Monkeys' Danny Altman, who along with his partner, Steve Manning, is continually on the hunt for evocative names -- in old reference books and volumes of poetry, on television, on street signs. 

2. Whatever your competitors are doing, don't do that. "If you went to a company trying to name their airline and gave them a choice between Trans-AtlanticAir and Virgin, they'd take Trans-AtlanticAir, because it sounds like something people would take seriously," Manning says. "The problem is, with that name they become one of the trees in the forest." Nguyen grasped this principle immediately: "There are literally 30 or 40 wireless companies called Mobile-something -- Mobileum, Mobilocity, MobileOne. We had a rule we'd never pick a name with 'mobile' in it."

3. Test your tolerance for going 'out of the box.' In its first presentation, A Hundred Monkeys tossed out 50-odd names, including Ironbit, Snafu, Gargoyle, Alpharay, Carbon8 and Blowfire. "Everyone says they want something unusual," Altman says. "The classic line is, 'We want a name like Yahoo.' But when it comes down to it, the obstacle is always fear. We help them see that their fears aren't based on what happens to brands out in the world. It's like Banana Republic. People don't see the name and think, 'Whoa, an ugly racial slur -- I'm not going to shop there.' It's all contextual."

4. But don't get carried away. "There's a reason a name like Blue Kangaroo wouldn't work," Manning says. "It doesn't mean anything. It has no depth. Our philosophy is, a name should connect with something already in the collective subconscious. You're trying to make an emotional connection."

5. Don't involve too many people. According to Manning, it is the effort to appease too many different viewpoints that leads large corporations to choose bland, made-up names, as Andersen Consulting and Bell Atlantic recently demonstrated in rebranding themselves as Accenture and Verizon. "The best way to get 100 people to sign off on a name is to come up with something that has no meaning and offends no one," he says. While vast advertising expenditures can eventually wear down a consumer's resistance to an awkward name, smaller ventures can't afford such a luxury.

6. Don't panic -- in the end, it's just a name. With the opening just weeks away, Nguyen's team began to worry. Blowfire and Ironbit were leading contenders within the company, while A Hundred Monkeys was pushing for Gargoyle. ("I just couldn't imagine saying, 'Hi, I'm Kate from Gargoyle,"' O'Sullivan says.) Finally, a dark horse emerged from the field: Seven. On its face, the name didn't exactly say "wireless infrastructure," but then again, does Apple inherently suggest computers? Indeed, Seven's abstract, slightly mystical quality, Nguyen reasoned, was the essence of its appeal. "It has so many different connotations," he says. "Seven Wonders of the World, seven days of the week, on the seventh day God rested. It's the number of perfection, the good-luck number. There's also a data language in the telecom industry called SS7, which the companies we deal with will appreciate." When Nguyen announced the choice to his employees, it was met with enthusiastic applause. Of course, it's still too early to tell whether Nguyen's $75,000 word can keep his company afloat. "If we wind up dying, my last act will be to change the name to Mobile-Seven," he says. "Might as well go down in flames."

HEADLINE: HOW TO; 
Run A Successful Silicon Valley Business

BYLINE:  By Jeff Goodell; Jeff Goodell, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone, is the author of "Sunnyvale: The Rise and Fall of a Silicon Valley Family."

 BODY:
After putting in a half day at the high-tech company in Silicon Valley where she works, Mandy heads up the freeway toward San Francisco in her sports car. Billboards for deceased dot-coms flash by like relics from a lost world. At about 1 p.m., she pulls into an upscale hotel near the San Francisco airport, where she has a room reserved. Dashing across the parking lot with her large black shoulder bag, she looks as if she could be on her way to a marketing seminar. She's a bright-eyed, upbeat woman dressed in a silky blue top, black pants and black boots, her blond hair pulled back in a girlish ponytail. She checks into a room on the top floor, with a view of the surrounding foggy hills, and takes out the tools of her trade -- candles, magazines, bubble bath, fragrant oil from the Body Shop and condoms. Then she goes into the bathroom to prepare for her first guest. Over the next four hours, she will have sex with three men, and she will earn about $1,200. 
 At a time when pink slips are flying in Silicon Valley, business is holding steady for entrepreneurs like Mandy. She is an "escort," and she sells her time for about $300 an hour, plus tips. Despite the high-tech downturn, Mandy gets about 200 calls a week -- about the same as she got during the glory days of the Internet boom. "I'm working a fairly recession-proof segment of the market," Mandy explains. (Some last names were not used as a condition of being interviewed.) 
 The new economy is changing the world's oldest profession just as surely as it's changing the book business. The two key forces of the Internet revolution -- the erosion of geographic barriers and the democratization of information -- are also at work in the escort industry. Successful prostitutes in the new world are as fond of their Charles Schwab accounts as they are of their black lace lingerie. Even euphemisms for their work have evolved. A person who sells sexual services is a "provider." Working part time, a good provider can earn $100,000 a year. Aggressive full-timers can make twice that much. This is how they do it.

1. Harness the power of technology. Gone are the days when providers simply advertised in phone books and local newspapers; today, for about $60 a month, a person can put a couple of sexy photos and a phone number on a Web site that catalogs escort listings and potentially reach millions of eager shoppers anywhere in the world. "Now a guy sitting at his desk in New York City, planning a trip to Silicon Valley, he can shop for girls like he's shopping for a new CD," says Sgt. Danny Acosta of the San Jose Police Department's vice squad. "It brings in a whole new class of customers." Veronica Monet, who has worked as an escort in the Bay Area for more than 10 years, estimates that 70 percent of her clients live elsewhere. "The more mobile the world becomes, the more lonely men there are out there," says Veronica. "When they're out of town, they feel safe. They don't have to worry about running into friends or relatives at a restaurant."

2.Understand your customers' needs. The Internet also increases competition, so you have to market yourself shrewdly. "You gotta know exactly who your audience is," says Mandy, who, under a different name, advertises herself as "an upscale, blonde, sexy Southern sorority girl." (In fact, she was born on the East Coast.) Mandy's ideal clients are married men over 35, because they tend to be discreet, stable and financially secure. Faye, one of the most popular providers in the Bay Area, specializes in light bondage and men who see sex as a spiritual adventure. In the gay-escort biz, Jonathan pitches his Web ad to men who are interested in slender, boyish men.
This being Silicon Valley, the sexually inexperienced geek is also a big target market for both straight and gay providers. Sophie, an experienced escort who works out of her home in the East Bay, offers a primer on her Web site that advises first-time customers to ask themselves the same questions they would ask when contacting any professional: "Is this person courteous and helpful, prompt to reply, easy to talk to, discreet? Does this person show self-respect? (A very important quality in this business!) Does this person seem to like what they are doing?"
Good looks, of course, are important for providers -- especially now that advertising has moved to the Web, where there's plenty of room for visuals. But the most successful providers are usually not the most striking. With the rise of the Internet, the relative affluence and sophistication of people willing to pay for sex has changed significantly, and so have their expectations. The most sought after providers understand that what they are selling is not just sex but what is known on the heterosexual message boards as a G.F.E.: Girl Friend Experience. An encounter, in other words, that is a lot like a dream date: wit, attention, good sex and, above all, the fantasy that this is not about money. And sometimes -- rarely -- sex is not part of the deal. One escort I talked to has a client who pays her $800 for a two-hour session every week. But he never touches her. They sit in his big house in the hills and play Yahtzee.
Another change in the business is the rise of the educated consumer. In the days of pimps and brothels, it was hard for customers to share information about their experience; today Bay Area Web sites have popular message boards where clients judge providers not only on the quality of their sexual skills but also on the dollar value of their services. Talk on these sites is crude and frank, but it brings a bizarre kind of capitalist integrity to a business long immune to such pressures. "In addition to her great body, fun attitude and general sexiness/willingness, she was a cute/sexy dresser, smelled great and was a good, but not overbearing, conversationalist," wrote one client about a popular escort. "Add to that the fact that she's a sports fan, and I'll be back!" Escorts who offer substandard service or, worse, rip off their clients, are loudly dissed: "I advise men who want a class act to go elsewhere," wrote one dissatisfied customer.
Most escorts publish their hourly rates on their Web sites; many offer discounts for multiple-hour or overnight sessions. No explicit connection between sex and money is ever discussed, of course. Payment is for time spent together, and anything that happens during that time is considered to be a private act between consenting adults. Method of payment varies: some escorts take credit cards, often billing for "consulting services." Some of them use PayPal, a popular Web site that allows the electronic transfer of funds from credit cards or online accounts. Most prefer cash in a white envelope discreetly left beside the bed. On the rare occasions when someone doesn't pay up, some providers are not afraid to have their lawyers call a client at work and suggest that if he wants to keep his sexual hobbies secret, he should send cash immediately. 

3. Protect your assets. This is a dangerous business. Most high-end providers are extremely selective about their clients. Of the 200 calls, Mandy ends up seeing maybe three men. (The others she sees each week are usually regulars.) The screening process begins with the first phone call. "I listen for anything unusual in a man's voice," says Veronica. "If I have any doubts at all, I just get off the phone." Before she agrees to meet a man, she asks for his name, his employer and his business phone number, which she often calls to make sure it's legit. Mandy says she gets so many calls from men at the name-brand Silicon Valley companies that she instantly recognizes their phone prefixes. Beyond that, providers depend on intuition. "The other day, I was talking to a guy, and I noticed he had a TV on in the background," says Mandy. "It was 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I asked him what he was watching. 'Cartoons,' he said. I hung up immediately." Because of the San Jose Police Department's aggressive vice unit, many Bay Area escorts insist on seeing their clients in San Francisco, where there is a decidedly more tolerant attitude toward high-end prostitution. Even so, when one escort I talked to approaches a hotel-room door, she often listens for a radio in one of the adjoining rooms. (Most police stings operate out of two rooms side by side, communicating by walkie-talkie.) But the best technique Veronica has developed for checking out a client is simply to give him a big hug as soon as she walks in. "You'd be amazed what you can tell about a man by a simple hug," she says. "Cops and psychos don't hug well."
The best providers draw sharp boundaries between what they will and will not do with a client. Most won't do drugs or drink alcohol. Most forbid kissing. Penetration without protection is unthinkable. 
"I'm actually not that concerned about sexually transmitted diseases," says Mark Raymond, 31, a gay escort in San Francisco. "I'd be sexually active anyway, and the men I see -- a lot of them are married or in monogamous relationships -- are in a lower risk group than most gay men."

4. Avoid emotional attachments in the workplace. The greatest fear of most providers is not sexually transmitted diseases or getting busted: it's getting emotionally involved. Or, equally bad, having a client get emotionally involved. "I get really hot and heavy offers every day," Faye says. "I'm never tempted. I like and respect the men I see, but no way am I going to run off with one." Some providers flatly refuse to engage in intimate conversation. "If they start talking about their wife or their troubles at work, I just change the subject," says Mandy. Veronica, on the other hand, views psychotherapy as part of her job. "This is an intimate business," she says. "It's natural that men will want to talk about things they can't speak about to other people." Still, it can be difficult to draw the line. Veronica refused to see one client again until he went to A.A. And a few months ago, Mandy unexpectedly fell in love with one of her clients. "It only lasted about three weeks, but it was a disaster," she says.

5. Have a plan for what to do when your market share dwindles. The best providers always have an exit strategy. This is a short-term business, one that rewards the young and the wily. The smartest understand this and plot their escapes before their plastic-surgery bills start rising faster than their client fees. Some of the more aggressive hustler types manage to wrangle houses, cars or platinum credit cards out of grateful (or naive) clients. But most plan for a more deliberate future. Veronica makes money speaking about the sex industry on college campuses and selling films, books and sex toys on her Web site. Mark Raymond has recently enrolled in a class to get a certificate to allow him to work as a counselor at a local health clinic.
At the end of her workday, her lipstick smeared, her mascara blotted, Mandy looks, well, exhausted. As she picks through her sea bass dinner in the hotel restaurant, she talks about her plans to quit the business as soon as she can afford a house. She does not see herself as a feminist. She does not marvel at the fact that technology is taking prostitution public in a way that not even the most ardent pro-sex reformer could have imagined a generation ago. To her, this is just a business, no different from selling software. She likes the adventure of it. She has a curious mind and likes meeting new people and learning about their lives. When she graduated from college, she wanted to work abroad. Instead, she became a part-time call girl. But she imagines it's a similarly broadening experience. "When I retire from this business," she says, "I think I'll look back and say that having done this made me a better person."

Houston and Galveston Vie for Cruise Lines

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
THIS city's effort to establish itself as a destination in the lucrative cruise business seemed dead earlier this year when Norwegian Cruise Lines relocated its Norwegian Sea to Miami in January. But less than three months later, the Port of Houston found itself back in the cruise business, with the Olympic Voyager scheduled to set sail yesterday on a seven-day cruise to Honduras and Mexico.
 Meanwhile, less than an hour down I-45 in Galveston, the Port of Galveston is also attracting cruises. In September, Carnival Cruises began offering four- and five-day cruises on its Celebration from Galveston to Mexico. Encouraged by Carnival's success, Royal Caribbean's Rhapsody of the Seas has scheduled nine seven-day cruises from Galveston to the Caribbean, beginning in October. 
 The competition between the two ports may soon end, since they are planning to merge, pending approval this year from voters in Galveston. But the merger would mostly affect the cargo business, and assuming the plan is completed, the two ports are not expected to consolidate their cruise operations. Galveston would most likely continue to serve its current tenants, while Houston plans to build a passenger terminal in hopes of luring more tenants.
If all the activity seems confusing, cruise industry observers say that what has happened in Houston and Galveston is fairly ordinary for any new market. 
With roughly 5,000 ships and 40,000 barges coming and going to the Gulf of Mexico, Houston ranks as the seventh largest cargo port in the world. But until five years ago, it had no cruise ships. Then Port of Houston officials began actively courting the cruise industry in hopes of establishing the city as a medium-size cruise port and reaping the economic benefits of a new tourism attraction. Officials pointed to statistics showing that 31 million people live within a 500-mile radius of Houston. There are also two airports. Port officials spent $3 million on a temporary passenger terminal.
Two companies took the bait: In 1997, Norwegian Cruise Lines arrived, offering seven-day voyages to destinations including Mexico on the 1,534-passenger Norwegian Sea. In both 1999 and 2000, according to port statistics, the Norwegian Sea carried more than 80,000 passengers, sailing at full capacity. Meanwhile, Premier Cruise Lines began sailing from Houston in May 2000 on the 1,146-passenger Big Red Boat III. 
Even though both ships attracted customers, they are both gone. Norwegian Cruise Lines was bought by Star Cruises, which moved the Norwegian Sea to Miami, and the Big Red Boat III lasted four months before creditors seized all of Premier's ships. The chairman of the Port of Houston, James Edmonds, attributed the departure of the two boats to outside circumstances and said the performance of the Norwegian Sea demonstrated Houston's potential. 
"We've proven to the industry that this is a viable market," Mr. Edmonds said. 
Mike Driscoll, editor of Cruise Week, a trade magazine, said it was not unusual for smaller operators like Premier and Norwegian Cruise Lines to leave a medium-size market once industry leaders like Carnival and Royal Caribbean arrive. He said the Norwegian Sea would have had difficulty competing with the two larger boats at Galveston. "It was sort of well known that they were there for a year or two until the big guys arrived," Mr. Driscoll said. 
Nor, perhaps, is it surprising that the larger ships chose Galveston over Houston. Port of Houston officials had built their temporary terminal at Barber's Cut, situated inland on the ship channel. Since Houston is actually 50 miles up the channel, it took the ships nearly four hours to reach the Gulf of Mexico. This means that cruise ships can only run seven-day cruises from Houston because of the trip each way to and from the Gulf. The Galveston passenger docks are 35 minutes from the Gulf, allowing shorter four-day trips to be offered.
Port of Houston officials hope to remedy this disparity with the construction of the proposed Bayport cargo facility, which would include a passenger terminal capable of docking five cruise ships, 30 minutes from the Gulf. Rosie Perri, a marketing official with Royal Olympic Cruises, said the company changed its itinerary to offer the cruise set for yesterday from Houston on its new 850-passenger Olympic Voyager. Though the trip is a one-time offering, Ms. Perri said the cruise line would soon announce a schedule for winter trips from Houston. "We probably will be doing more in the next season," Ms. Perri said. 
Katherine O'Neal, port director in Galveston, said that Carnival's cruises attract families with prices of less than $400 a person for a four-day cruise. She said Carnival offers 70 cruises a year from Galveston. 
Beginning Oct. 23, Royal Caribbean will start offering its nine test cruises on the Rhapsody of the Seas through Dec. 23. The company also plans to move the ship to New Orleans for nine cruises and then to Tampa before deciding where to dock it permanently, according to Ms. O'Neal.
"Our cruise market in the Gulf of Mexico is just beginning to be discovered and developed," she said. "We have a lot of places we can get to in just an overnight or just one night at sea."

HEADLINE: An Archipelago Called Russian 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES; FRANCIS X. CLINES is a national correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IF a guy wants to be able to talk in bed with his new Russian wife, this guy needs one vocabulary; but if he wants to deal in the Moscow oil business, the guy needs another," explains Boris Shekhtman, a merry-eyed despot of a language teacher who is ready for either American urge these days.
 Mr. Shekhtman is known simply and affectionately as Boris by the 150 or so private clients who have been variously enlightened, exhausted, psychically tattooed and certainly inspired in his one-on-one tutoring sessions across the last 18 years. A little noticed resource within the Washington Beltway, Boris is valued for taking a creative personal trainer's approach to his students, poking their softness and whipping some muscular Russian onto their bones. 
 When graduates of Boris's tutorials meet -- and there's currently a dozen or so alumni in Moscow's diplomacy, journalism and business circles -- they invariably glory in the words and music not so much of the Russian language as of Boris and his methodology. 
"You will destroy them!" they recall Boris cackling in delight in class when he finally hears a once struggling student masterly deliver one of the series of language "islands" he forces one and all to compose and not merely memorize: no, Boris requires these conversational drills -- cunning small-talk masterpieces chockablock with vital grammar devices, revealing grace notes and reassuring curiosity about things Russian -- to be relentlessly repeated over and over until they become atomized and assimilated somewhere between a student's Pavlovian brainpan and his evolving Russian soul.
When this moment is reached, Boris becomes beady-eyed with delight, bounding like Picasso in his studio at the way he has deranged nature. Then he demands you traverse the island, repeating your soliloquy again. 
Rooted in confidence building, the island technique is Boris's way of equipping students with a basic set of grammatical and vocabulary tools that become second nature and eminently reusable in attempting more ambitious conversation. They are tight monologues -- perhaps some autobiography, an honest opinion about a favorite author, a piece on one's hobby -- that are constructed to be open to question-and-answer tangents that can give a newcomer a sense of actually speaking the language. Across his tutoring, Boris tries to rattle his students with unexpected conversational twists and turns that might be eased by resorting to island tracts.
"Boris is a formidable character, his personality is overwhelming," attests Lucian Pugliaresi, president of LCI Consulting and a National Security Council official in the Reagan Administration. He says he was shocked to finally learn Russian from Boris after bumbling through mute years of commuting to Moscow as a petroleum specialist.
"People I know in Moscow can't believe I can finally talk with them," Mr. Pugliaresi says. "It's all because Boris is very good at figuring out how you absorb information, then deciding how serious you are and what kind of a program you need." 
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Shekhtman's Specialized Language Training Center has evolved from a basement-classroom operation for a few Washington neophytes each year to a multicity business, with a small staff of professional teachers from Russia. It serves various clients, from American parents who need some bedtime banter for their adopted Russian children, to a New York psychiatrist needing Russian to get at the superegos of his patients in Brighton Beach.
Lessons -- mostly one on one but also groups up to seven -- now include a 30-hour tourist course in which, for $40 an hour, a traveler will, by all the promise and demand of Boris, prove to be "primitive but creative" in navigating basic tourist situations while still packing a simple island or two as traveler's aid to "destroy" that cabdriver. 
Destroy, as in surprise native Russians with an island's texture and range, a signature device of Boris and his faculty. Destroy, as in the rugged arm wrestle that he imagines even the simplest colloquy to be. Who is triumphing in the "psychology of language?" Boris asks with the tone of Clausewitz on total war.
Islands, of course, are separated by the briny depths. But Boris convinces most students that language management rooted in their memorized verbal islands will produce "the appearance of fluency" at first, then progress swimmingly as life unfolds in Russia.
With outlets in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Moscow besides the main office in the Rockville, Md., the center not only teaches Russian to Americans, but also now finds Boris tutoring language instructors in his own techniques. These are not so much about passive grammar memorization as about building confidence so that the student takes the initiative. 
In recent years of heavy Russian immigration, Boris has also begun teaching Russian newcomers Americanized English, replete with those "guys" and other reassuringly noir-ish touches that Boris, who is 61, first savored as a young student of English in Kiev and Baku. 
For each of his students, when all else fails, there remains a Boris island to crawl onto, firm as a riff of Melville. ("Menya zavut Frenk" -- They call me Frank -- always seemed an island opener worthy of Ishmael.) Islands can be about whatever interests the student, providing Boris rates them as engaging to the casual Russian and open to crucial devices of idiom and grammar that he finely machines into the developing spiels.
Bill Keller, managing editor of The Times, recalls the islands starting "with a small shoal," two of his being: "I come from New York," and "I work for The New York Times." They then grew into more elaborate soliloquies on subjects certain to come up in conversations: the population, climate, economy and cultural importance of New York. 
When I studied with Boris 12 years ago, the lesson vocabulary was thick with the cliches of Cold War saber rattling. These have yielded some to the jargon of capitalism, although the words of cronyism still seem relevant. Through it all, a student can rest assured that Boris's sarcastic glossing of the Kremlin's Orwellian doublespeak remains a virtuoso lesson.
A graduate always retains scraps of Boris's eclectic classes -- a stunning phrase of Pushkin, perhaps, or certainly a couplet from the tiresome nursery rhymes that students must daily sing as Boris stands there like a leering, formidable Big Bird. A line from the song "Ochi Chorniye" ("Dark Eyes") best summarizes a student's view of both Boris and his bittersweet language: "How I love you; how I fear you." 
In class, Boris has a charming way of suddenly swiveling from the role of absolute language tyrant to literary romantic melting to the poetry of Anna Akhmatova. After Boris's classes of a decade ago, the glasnostian speaking touches of Mikhail Gorbachev (he used a kind of reflexive papal pomposity in pronouncing what he thought) became a treasured leitmotif for an American's ears during the endless wintry nights of Moscow. The mother tongue proved as gritty as the bread.
As if in advance compensation, Boris has introduced a certain sense of luxury into his tutoring methods. "It became a usual procedure for our newspaper correspondents to take us to their summer homes when they were studying through these hot days," notes the taskmaster, who somehow accepted the proletarian cocktail hour after a hard day at the six declensions. 
This was never some expense-account junket for learning the always useful Russian words for fresh lobster and melted butter, Mr. Keller insists. He recalls his summer teach-in at a Delaware beach resort as "an extraordinary amount of drills, homework, lessons and practice" with "a rotating cast of Russian immigrants -- members of the Boris entourage of smitten babushkas, former Kiev taxi drivers and literary divas who accepted a free week at the beach" in exchange for tolerating sandy hubris and bad Russian. 
"To my mind, Boris's technique depends on the principle that if you can convince Russians that you speak Russian, you'll trick yourself in the process," Bill decided.
Boris could not agree more, as he customizes his lessons. "We will work wherever our clients want us to work," he altruistically vows, so long as the rate remains $40 an hour. In Rockville, just outside Washington, he maintains a separate apartment for live-in students who sign up for months of intensive lessons.
"The first time I met Boris he didn't talk at all about language," Mr. Pugliaresi recalls. "He talked about power relationships and fascinated me instantly. He said when you don't speak the language over there, you have no power."
Mr. Pugliaresi soon was crawling about his first Boris island, then standing upright, looking to destroy them.
The Specialized Language Training Center, 4 Monroe Street, Rockville, Md. 20850; (800) 839-7987; e-mail, sbsltc@aol.com. Individual lessons cost $40 an hour. For groups, rates drop progressively, so that the maximum group, seven, would pay $100 an hour total.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER; 
Kansas City: Culture in Many Forms

BYLINE:  By NEAL KARLEN; NEAL KARLEN, who lives in Minneapolis, writes about the Midwest.

 BODY:
I STOPPED making baseball trips in March five years ago, soon after spring training in Florida and Arizona became so commercialized that I felt warmer vibes back home in the midst of the fifth month of Minnesota's brutal winter. Yet the itch always remained for some kind of spring baseball pilgrimage, which is why this March I ended up in Kansas City, home of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.
 This time, instead of spying on today's spoiled diamond stars, I would pay homage to the likes of the late Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and Cool Papa Bell. All were African-Americans forced to play segregated baseball in circuits like the Negro National League, which was founded only a few blocks from the museum in 1920. 
 There would be much else to see during the four days and three nights I'd allotted for the town with a steak named after it, where Chalie Parker did his best work and Harry Truman his most effective elbow-twisting. Culture, I knew, came in all forms in a city about which Roger Miller wrote his best song ("Kansas City Star") and Robert Altman directed perhaps his worst movie ("Kansas City."). 
Lori, my long-distance girlfriend, agreed to go, leaving me only to worry she would look at a national weather map and see that rain and temperatures in the 40's were predicted for our whole stay. (I needn't have fretted: daytime temperatures were in the sunny mid-60's for every one of the three and a half days of our trip.)
Northwest Airlines (from Minneapolis) and cheaptickets.com (for a Southwest Airlines ticket from San Jose) offered deals that didn't require Saturday-night stay overs, so we were able to meet in Kansas City on a Sunday afternoon without taking a financial hit. I picked up a Honda Civic at Ace Rent a Car at the airport for $24.50 a day with unlimited mileage and headed toward the city. Unsurprisingly, cow-town prices were not to be found in this metropolitan region of 1.7 million people.
The most romantic-sounding of the budget choices seemed to b the 22-room Hotel Savoy, a bed-and-breakfast on the northern edge of downtown. There was an endearingly wacky charm to the place: once I saw a front desk attendant turning circles in the lobby on a bicycle. And a reservations agent told us upon check-in that in honor of her two-month anniversary without a cigarette, she was upgrading us from an $89 regular suite to a $120 "Deluxe Victorian Suite."
We were rewarded with a four-poster bed, a lace-curtained living room the size of a small touch-football field, and two bathrooms featuring porcelain fixtures. The suite's flowery wallpaper gave a Southern feel to the hotel, which was built in 1888 as elegant testimony to Kansas City's prospering cattle and grain economy. Today, enormous breakfasts included in the room rate are one of the Savoy's best-known perks; every morning one could have a choice of 32 items ranging from lamb chops to oysters Rockefeller.
Long ago the Savoy was the major gathering place in town for visiting celebrities such as Teddy Roosevelt, W. C. Fields, and Harry Houdini, who is said to have been unable to extricate himself from the lobby phone booth in which a prankster had locked him. The Savoy earned a listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, but soon devolved into an unglamorous residential hotel.
In 1985, renovations were begun by a local businessman who kept only one wing open, stuffing suites with period antiques and brass fixtures from the original. Ever since, refurbishing has stopped and restarted several times amidst rumors of a chain takeover. Today, that never-quite-done feeling gives the Savoy a funky if slightly tired atmosphere that keeps it both affordable and comfortable.
Adjacent to the hotel is the Savoy Grill, arguably Kansas City's most famous steak and seafood house. The oldest continually operating restaurant in the city, it bears the original high-beamed ceilings, oak bar and stained-glass windows that graced its 1903 opening. The Grill was a favorite dining spot of the 33rd President, who always ate at Booth 4 -- a fact noted by a small tableside plaque put up by the Harry Truman High School History Club.
We got the Truman booth on Sunday night by phoning ahead by a few hours. Knowing we'd be feasting free in the hotel every morning, we decided to make one of our few splurges at the Grill. We went for seafood rather than steak; I ordered a fresh lobster Newburg for $24.50, while Lori had the tasty broiled salmon for $19.75.
The next morning we embarked on our only history road trip. We'd both already grown a little tired of the omnipresent specter of Mr. Truman, and decided to pass up visiting the Kansas City suburb of Independence, Mo., site of his presidential museum and library. Instead we headed off to the Jesse James Farm and Museum, about half an hour north up Interstate 35 in Kearney, Mo.
I have always been fascinated by the bank robber who, Carl Sandburg wrote, "is to this country what Robin Hood is to England." The Waterloo of the James-Younger Gang was the bungled robbery in 1876 of a bank in Northfield, Minn., a few dozen miles from where I live. Though Jesse and his brother Frank were the only bandits to escape, it had always been a source of statewide pride that locals had killed or incarcerated most of Jesse's fellow marauders.
Yet there was a Missouri side to the story. "There has never been definitive proof that the James boys were even in Minnesota," I was told before the trip by the Rev. James Nelson, a Southern Baptist minister whose father coached football for William Jewell College, which Jesse James's father, a preacher, helped found in Liberty, Mo.
"In Missouri," Mr. Nelson told me, "a lot of people still look at Jesse not as a murdering bandit, but as a symbol of a man fighting government oppression."
That theme would be amplified at the James farm (general admission $6). There, in a fair-size museum that has the square footage, a guide guessed, equivalent to "three trailer trucks," are a half-dozen rooms sporting memorabilia ranging from the James family Bible to the boots Jesse wore when he was killed in 1882 by a member of his own gang shooting for bounty.
Down the path at the Jameses' cabin, a new guide offered a different take on the clan as she led us through the four-room home and past the bed where Jesse was born. "You won't hear about this much, but the James family was rich, and they had seven slaves," she said.
THERE would be fewer contradictory legends to contend with the next day, starting at the 18th and Vine Historic District, epicenter of the city's African-American community, and home to the sparkling Negro Leagues museum and the adjacent American Jazz Museum. That night, after skipping lunch, we decided we had to visit Arthur Bryant's Barbecue, a few blocks from the museums.
With the bellicose loyalty of the Hatfields and McCoys, Kansas City barbecue aficionados can be divided into those who think Arthur Bryant's is the best in town, and those who swear by Gates Bar-B-Q. Bill Clinton visited Gates; I became an Arthur Bryant's loyalist. For $7.10 I had a barbecued beef sandwich sent from another dimension; ribs, fries, baked beans, a soda and a bottle of locally brewed Boulevard Pale Ale brought the bill for two to less than $20.
On the ride back, we drove past the nearby Charlie Parker Memorial. A monumental 17-foot bronze statue of one of Kansas City's greatest local heroes, the sculpture by Robert Graham was erected in 1999 on land Parker used to walk during his musical apprenticeship.
The next morning we were back at 18th and Vine for what turned into a half-day excursion through the jazz and Negro Leagues museums (combination $8 tickets allowed us into both). Kansas City had been the capital of the segregated Negro ball leagues, and because of a tragic story my father used to tell me, the museum was the No. 1 attraction I wanted to see while in town.
My father's tale was about Ray (Dandy) Dandridge, an African-American third-baseman and one of the top few players in the history of the blacks-only leagues before Jackie Robinson broke major league baseball's Jim Crow line in 1947. Like the lead character in August Wilson's "Fences," Dandridge was considered too old to play in the newly integrated major leagues, and he spent the last years of his career hidden away with the Minneapolis Millers, a minor league team owned by the old New York Giants.
The baseball museum both honored the greatest of the Negro league stars, and offered thoughtful interactive commentary on the conditions behind diamond apartheid. Dandridge could be seen in a life-size bronze sculpture and in a locker bearing a replica of his old Negro league Newark Eagles uniform. Tucked behind it was an 8-by-10 picture of an aging though still agile athlete swinging a bat in the uniform of the Millers.
The jazz museum held happier vibes. Ella Fitzgerald's pink performance gown, Louis Armstrong's trumpet and Parker's famous plastic saxophone were beautifully displayed, and interactive exhibits showcasing the history of jazz made ancient music come to life.
We found a different kind of American culture at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. The featured exhibit, "Winslow Homer and the Critics: Forging a National Art in the 1870's," running through May 6, is a fascinating take on the relationship between an artist and the contemporary critics who savaged his work. Afterward, the elegant Rozzelle Court Restaurant allows patrons to rest their feet and order, cafeteria-style, all without losing a sense of the museum's grandeur.
We still had not sampled Kansas City's true indigenous art, the blues. Not sure where to go, we decided to gamble on the Grand Emporium on Main Street, long considered one of the best blues clubs in the country. Next door is Antonio's Pizza, where a locally famous slice ($2.05) makes a perfect preconcert snack. We would top off the night with a generous $2.99 helping of biscuits and gravy at Sidney's Diner, a 24-hour restaurant near the Westport bar-and-club neighborhood with a Fonzie decor and a jukebox that plays rappers like Lil' Kim and Sir Mix-a-Lot.
As for our luck at the Grand Emporium? With a coupon from the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Kansas City, we got in for only $2.50 instead of $5.50; what we heard was not the blues but a singer-songwriter named Rex Hobart fronting a pretty good "alternative country" band while belting out tunes like "I'm Not Drunk Enough to Say I Love You."
Those were not the kind of sentiments being celebrated at the Hallmark Visitors Center, which we toured the next day. The pristine headquarters of the greeting card behemoth, started in 1910 by J. C. Hall, offers a history of the company, its wares and a film narrated by Martin Sheen on how Hallmark's artists, photographers and writers come up with their sentiments.
Though some cynics might assume that a few holidays were invented inside the corporation's walls, there was a surprising, undeniable romance to the place. If Norman Rockwell, Grandma Moses and Saul Steinberg had no problem creating beautiful images for the company, who was I to carp? Theirs, and so many of the other cards on display were genuinely moving.
But for a real emotional wallop, nothing tops the postcards I bought in the gift shop at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.

How to E-Mail Like a C.E.O.

BYLINE:  By Bruce Headlam; Bruce Headlam is an editor for the Circuits section of The Times.

 BODY:
Microsoft may be broken up, Nasdaq may never get off the mat, but one artifact of the digital revolution is healthier than ever: e-mail remains the most popular online application, with more than 6.1 billion messages sent daily. Not only has e-mail opened up a whole new medium for personal correspondence, it has also launched the modern corporation into the Internet age with the promise to free workers from the tyranny of too much paper and too little time. It succeeded so spectacularly, however, that what was once blissfully asynchronous is now woefully chronic. For even moderately busy e-mailers, a hundred new messages a day is nothing out of the ordinary. Just as the answering machine gave us a reason to avoid the phone, e-mail has given us a new incentive to delay work in the morning: in-box dread. 
 The e-mail glut doesn't affect only individuals. AOL, Computer Associates, Intel -- a murderers' row of Internet companies -- have all tried various methods of restricting the volume of e-mail within their companies. Perversely, the few workable solutions to the surfeit of e-mail seem to involve even more e-mail. Multiple addresses, which many time-management experts recommend, make for fewer messages in each account but more accounts, and more time spent checking them all. Wireless e-mail lessens the scramble to wrap up correspondence before heading home for the night, but thereby leaves leisure hours vulnerable to e-mail's taint. If New York's subway authority makes good on its promise to provide wireless access in the tunnels, not even the morning commute will be safe. 
 Perhaps the only good thing about e-mail overload is the comforting thought that it is status-blind, that it strikes the highest executive and the lowliest supply clerk alike. After all, that was the promise from the very beginning: e-mail was going to be the great democratizing agent of corporate America, allowing an instant exchange of ideas unimpeded by gatekeepers and protocols. You were either in or you were out in the new corporation and, thanks to e-mail, you could be in anywhere -- all distances, whether geographic or hierarchical, would vanish into electronic ether.
Sadly, it hasn't worked out that way. Consider the research of David Owens, an associate professor of management at Vanderbilt University. Owens spent a year at a research firm in California, attending meetings and interviewing employees. The company (which he can't name as a condition of his research) was a model of New Economy egalitarianism. Aside from a small management team, everyone had the same job title; projects were voluntary, teams were self-forming and a good deal of internal communication took place electronically. Owens's initial interest was how people who work in a "flat" organizational structure distinguish themselves by using behavioral strategies, what sociologists like to call status signifiers. High-status employees, for example, sat near the head of the table during meetings. Those in the midstatus rung spoke the most. Low-status workers told jokes and made coffee. 
Owens then looked at a sample of some 30,000 e-mail messages sent within the company over four years. What he found was that the messages had status signifiers that divided the senders into the same categories he observed in face-to-face meetings. "You can't interrupt someone in an e-mail or use body language," Owens said in an interview. "But people are finding other ways of getting social distinctions in there."
High-status employees, for example, tended to send short, curt messages, in part to minimize contact with lower-status workers but also to convey comfort with their own authority. (A typical example from Owens's study: "Agenda items: Update on people, equipment, collab space, etc.") Midstatus employees, by contrast, tend to produce long, argumentative messages laden with jargon or overexplicated answers to simple questions. ("I vote for the March date, since it seems to me that a smaller, earlier, more focused meeting is better at this preliminary stage.") Surprisingly, senior managers -- who take the longest to reply to e-mail messages -- are the least likely to use the carbon-copy function ("cc") because, Owens suggested, they want to appear to be managing other people individually. Perhaps less surprisingly, bosses tend to have the poorest spelling and worst grammar, conveying the sense that they have better things to do with their time. 
Owens's findings are so striking, and so consistent, that they could serve as an unintended primer for those who want to be a boss, or at least want to be mistaken for one. If your e-mail messages are late, unevenly capitalized and sloppy, you could be C.E.O. material. If your e-mail messages are earnest and combative, or if you run them through spell-check before hitting send, then you may be destined for middle management. And if you ever use e-mail to forward jokes, send greeting cards or use happy-face "emoticons" -- well, you're giving yourself away. These are all strategies used to build social relationships within a company, to provide a kind of social lubrication. ("Gee, what a neat tie!") Owens acknowledges that those who do so play "an important role that tends to be greatly underestimated." But they are almost always low-status workers.
What Owens's findings suggest is that, while communication may move at close to the speed of light, the mechanics of office politics grind on at their own predigital pace. The transmission of e-mail was so captivating that we neglected to look at what those transmissions were saying. Senior executives appeared to be immediately accessible, but beneath their artfully casual missives was a case study straight out of "Up the Organization." (Owens also found that, within the company's message boards, high-status employees had their own secure mailing lists, the electronic equivalent of the key to the executive washroom.)
In some respects, the presence of e-mail has cheapened the very idea of access. Forty years ago, William Hewlett routinely walked through the offices of Hewlett-Packard, often sitting down with his own engineers to work on a problem. Today, all a C.E.O. has to do is make his e-mail account available to his employees, and he's considered cutting edge. This is not to say that e-mail hasn't succeeded in other areas where the questions of social status remain central -- which is why it's the perfect medium for flirting. But it failed to move the corner office any closer to the water cooler. Meet the new boss; sme az the olde boss. :( 

GRAPHIC: Photo (Stone) Chart: "E-mail etiquette the view from below"Get out the dictionary and use that spell checker! Sloppy spelling in a purely written forum sends out the same silent messages that soiled clothing would when addressing an audience. . . .Communicating by e-mail is no different from writing on your company letterhead.A business communication is business, period. As a result, a certain degree of formality is required. Just because e-mail tends to be more immediate and personable, it can't be casual. Business e-mail must be businesslike. You'll be judged by the quality of your writing, so spelling and grammar do count. All forms of business communication you send reflect on you, affecting your chances for advancement. Sending e-mail riddled with misspellings is the same as wearing a shirt spattered with catsup. Sloppy e-mail gets tongues wagging about the writer's literal failings. -- from "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Office Politics"

HEADLINE: HOW TO; 
A User's Manual for Modern Living

BYLINE:  By Charles McGrath; Charles McGrath is the editor of The New York Time Book Review

 BODY:
The only thing you really have to know how to do these days is turn on your computer, and strictly speaking, even that is not essential. You could always call the tech guy and get him to do it. One of the wonders of the service economy is that so many of the things we used to do for ourselves are now done by others. We turn gratefully to the experts and the professionals because it is easier and because so many of life's essential tasks -- automobile maintenance, for example, and income-tax preparation -- are now bewilderingly complicated, far beyond the ken of ordinary mortals. The tax code is incomprehensible even to those who wrote it, and you couldn't tune you own car engine if you tried -- not unless you hacked into the on-board electronic ignition system. Even such formerly simple-seeming activities as exercising and eating have turned out to be far too risky to be undertaken by the novice, which is why we now have personal trainers and nutritionists. 
 The abundance of expertise and the ready availability of services ought to have made us happier and freer, but the evidence suggests the opposite. We are a people desperate to learn how to do something -- almost anything, it scarcely matters what. Look at the prospectus for your local community school or at those glossy catalogs for the evening and weekend adult-learning mills that periodically fall out of The Village Voice and The New York Observer. Almost any night you like, you can take a class in calligraphy, in flower arrangement, in tae kwon do, in macram 1/8, in taxidermy, in ballroom dancing or in becoming a Wiccan. In conflict resolution and in assertiveness, in self-help and in counseling others, in learning how to learn and in learning how to forget (or at least to forgive), in discovering the inner child and in finding the new maturity. No doubt there are classes in how to wean yourself from going to classes and in empowering you to go in the first place if you're shy and insecure. 
 A Darwinist would say that the urge to acquire practical knowledge -- to learn how to do things -- is what defines us as human and is what enabled us to prevail over our simian relatives. You could also make a case that a reverence for know-how is a peculiarly American trait. For the American male, in fact, it may be the defining trait. Most men of a certain age measure themselves, in whole or in part, by their mastery of the essential manly skills: by knowing (or pretending to know) how to throw a curveball, blow a smoke ring, fudge an expense account, jump-start a dead battery and navigate so well that they can drive anywhere without asking for directions. American women are a little less anxious in this regard, but they are nevertheless relentless amassers of information. Amazingly, there are significant numbers of 30-something women now who want to learn how to box -- something that most sensible American men gave up years ago.
How we got to be this way is not hard to explain. Our country was founded by people who had to do for themselves. They had to know how to build, to farm, to fish and hunt, and eventually they had to figure out how to write a constitution and organize a government. Our heroes in the early days were men like Washington and Jefferson, who were admired because their statesmanship and political genius were just part of a whole range of skills and attainments. Not the least of their appeal was that they came off the farm, literally, and then went back to it. Our other heroes, a little later on, were not the scientists and the scholars but those other all-around guys, the tinkerers, the people who invented stuff out in the garage: Edison, Ford, the Wright brothers.
We still admire this practical, enterprising trait, which is why we admire, or used to, people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Many of us now also greatly admire craftspeople: furniture makers and glass blowers and wooden-boat builders -- people who are good with their hands. That's because most of the rest of us are not good at anything anymore, and with minor variations, we all do the same thing. We go to the office, we talk on the phone, we answer e-mail. We could be replaced in an instant. Our need for know-how is partly nostalgic -- a wish to get back in touch with the hands-on skills of our forefathers -- and partly it is a yearning for self-definition. If you're a faceless paper pusher, you feel a lot better about yourself if you're a paper pusher who also knows how to do the merengue and smoke your own meat. 
We also tend to worry, idly and guiltily, about how we would measure up in a crisis. What if we had to deliver a baby? Land a plane? Such anxieties must be what's behind the unlikely success of "The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook," by Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht, a little yellow-bound paperback that in a series of easy, step-by-step lessons teaches you how to jump from a moving car, what to do if your parachute fails to open and the best way to win a sword fight. Chances are you would never have to do any of this stuff -- and if you did, you probably would have forgotten it anyway -- but all the same, tips like this are extremely satisfying to file away in your brain. 
This issue of The Times Magazine is a handbook of another sort. It actually contains some information you can use, along with some that may seem irrelevant but is pleasing and comforting to have on hand just the same. You never know. . . . There is also an important meta-lesson embedded here: namely, that the key to a lot of skills (like being popular or getting into college) is simply to fake them, and that the illusion of knowledge is often more important (and certainly easier to acquire) than knowledge itself. If you really believe you can do something, chances are you can. As some of the following articles suggest, it is not the not knowing that so often holds us back; it is knowing too much. If you're going up to bat against Pedro Martinez, don't worry about it -- dig in, take your rips and light him up! Are you really sure you want to try a motorcycle backflip -- well, then, strap on your helmet, rev the engine and pop the clutch. Go for it! Learning is all well and good, but the secret of success, it turns out, is not to fill your head but to empty it.

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
Russians Ask the World, 'Shall We Dance?'

BYLINE:  By JOEL LOBENTHAL; Joel Lobenthal writes frequently for Ballet Review and is the author of a biography of Tallulah Bankhead to be published next year by ReganBooks.

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia 

 BODY:
THE depths of a Russian winter may not seem the most congenial time to inaugurate an annual international dance festival. But when the Maryinsky Theater here held its first International Ballet Festival in February, the damp and cold were the perfect foil for the heat and light of ballet at its best.
 During the eight-day, nine-performance festival, guest stars from Europe and the United States danced with stars of the Maryinsky Ballet (which tours abroad as the Kirov Ballet, its former name). The festival also presented the premiere of a new production of "The Nutcracker," conducted by the Maryinsky's artistic and general director, Valery Gergiev, with sets and costumes by the emigre artist Mikhail Shemyakin. 
 Under Communism, the Kirov toured little in the United States, in part because of the fear of defections. Since perestroika, however, cutbacks in government support have forced the Maryinsky to remake itself. European appearances are frequent, and American ones will increase in the future, supplying needed hard currency; policy and programming have been jolted out of complacency. 
"To only play safe is not what we ever intend to do," Mr. Gergiev said in a recent interview. Balletomanes have sometimes accused him of favoring the opera, but this festival might serve to counter those claims. Mr. Gergiev intends it to be an annual event at the close of the Maryinsky's winter season, a companion to the White Nights Festival of opera and ballet, which he reinvigorated in 1993.
The guest performers at the festival were almost entirely male, reflecting the prevailing belief that while the Maryinsky is surfeited with talented young ballerinas, its men are less commanding. Carlos Acosta, from the Royal Ballet and the Houston Ballet, partnered the Maryinsky ballerina Irma Nioradze in "Don Quixote." From the Bolshoi, the Maryinsky's longtime rival in Moscow, came Nikolai Tsiskaridze, who danced Act II of Yuri Grigorovich's "Legend of Love" opposite the Maryinsky's Maya Dumchenko and Yuliya Makhalina. 
But the Maryinsky also showcased some of its own men, among them the internationally popular Igor Zelensky, as well as Andrei Batalov, Andrian Fadeyev, Anton Korsakov, Ilya Kuznetsov, Vyacheslav Samodurov and Vasily Sherbakov. Indeed, some nights the casts were entirely Maryinsky. Yet the festival's raison d'etre was new casting combinations. "It allows us to look at roles danced in our theater from another point of view," said Makhar Vaziyev, the Maryinsky Ballet's director. "When two dancers from another company are dancing here, it's one thing. But when one is Maryinsky and her partner is not, it brings a completely different unpredictability."
The guests seized the chance to express themselves on one of the world's most hallowed stages. "I didn't go to give them a Kirovified presentation of 'Apollo,' " said the American Ballet Theater principal Ethan Stiefel, who danced the lead in that Balanchine ballet. "I wanted to show them something new." In "Giselle," Diana Vishneva of the Maryinsky was paired with the Ballet Theater star Vladimir Malakhov, who was trained at the Bolshoi Ballet School. Ms. Vishneva told Mr. Malakhov that she would be happy to make changes to accommodate his slightly different interpretation. They received 10 curtain calls.
On toe, the Maryinsky's ballerinas proved generally taller than their new cavaliers, yet their pas de deux went without a flub. The Maryinsky's Svetlana Zakharova said that Ballet Theater's Jose Manuel Carreno, who danced opposite her in "La Bayadere," was a "wonderful dancer and a very caring partner." Mr. Vaziyev insisted that the guests spend several days rehearsing the full-length ballets in the festival. "I don't like it when a dancer, no matter how brilliant, arrives the night before," he said. "It's always apparent onstage whether they've rehearsed enough or not." 
Mr. Vaziyev also told the dancers that they would not be granted the sometime prerogative of guest artists to bring their own costumes. "Usually a production is designed in one style," he said. "I don't like when a production suddenly turns very eclectic." 
Two years ago, the Maryinsky made headlines by attempting a restoration of "Sleeping Beauty" as it might have looked shortly after its premiere on the Maryinsky stage in 1890. By contrast, this year's "Nutcracker" offered a radical revision of the 1934 version by Vasily Vainonen, a company chestnut. Mr. Gergiev's passion for Tchaikovsky's score was the catalyst. He said that earlier productions of the ballet could be forgotten, for the moment.
" 'Nutcracker' is one of the best balletic musical achievements," he said. "Then you can talk about maybe 10 or 20 or even 100 choreographers doing their own versions." 
In this, his first balletic work, Mr. Shemyakin not only designed sets and costumes but also reshaped the concept and narrative. The new production is a fantasia on E. T .A. Hoffmann's themes, and it turns on its ear the cozy bourgeois world seen in most other "Nutcrackers." The Christmas feast becomes a parody of conspicuous consumption. For the dance of the snowflakes, Mr. Shemyakin supplies a desolate landscape worthy of a witches' Sabbath. 
AT the premiere of "The Nutcracker," Mr. Shemyakin was given an ovation when he entered the czar's box wearing a Rococo-style jacket that made him resemble Hoffmann himself. Mr. Gergiev conducted the orchestra at an infernally fast pace to which the dancers miraculously conformed. While this "Nutcracker" was clearly Mr. Gergiev and Mr. Shemyakin's show, new choreography was provided by the young Maryinsky dancer Kirill Simonov. During the second act's Waltz of the Flowers and Grand pas de deux, the tempo calmed and the scenic effects retreated, allowing Mr. Simonov more room for choreographic invention. 
Despite Russia's severely straitened economy, a small government stipend continues for the ballet, and a support infrastructure remains. For example, the Maryinsky commands its own warehouse of scenery and costumes. Union minimums are unknown, and the Maryinsky, one of Russia's most prestigious institutions, pays its performers and staff a pittance. Yet many dancers consider themselves privileged. Mr. Stiefel said he was impressed by "how much they pride themselves on what they do" and surprised to see dancers still rehearsing a half hour before the performance.
Mr. Gergiev has attracted support from corporations and private patrons, the most generous of whom is the Cuban-American billionaire arts benefactor Alberto Vilar. Over the last year Mr. Vilar has given the Maryinsky Theater $14 million toward new productions of opera and ballet as well as $15 million for annual seasons at the Kennedy Center in Washington, to begin next February. The ballet will also return to the Metropolitan Opera next year in the summer.
The festival demonstrated just how loyal a tribe of admirers and donors the Maryinsky has attracted. The demand for tickets was so frenzied that on some nights extra chairs were placed in the aisles, while scalpers on the street commanded up to $100 a ticket. With prices no longer regulated by the government, a Maryinsky ticket is not nearly as accessible for many Russians as it was during the old regime. Yet no matter how many Westerners were present, it was still a Russian audience with its own tastes.
The climax of the festival was an international gala on Feb. 17, which opened with "Apollo." Memorably danced by Mr. Stiefel and his Russian partners, the performance was praised in the press and by Maryinsky dancers, but the audience response was muted. Though Balanchine himself was reared in this theater, his comparatively cool ballets have yet to ignite the acclaim granted to more pyrotechnic items on the five-hour gala program. 
"Naturally it was an enormous amount of work," Mr. Vaziyev said after the festival's closing performance, "Swan Lake," danced by the Maryinsky's Sofiya Gumerova and Daniil Korsuntsev. But plans for the future are still more ambitious. Mr. Gergiev says, "I want to see 10 leading choreographers of our time come here to demonstrate what they have achieved." Ballet Theater's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, attended two nights of festival performances, and he and Mr. Vaziyev discussed the possibility of cooperation between the two companies.
"We go to the world," Mr. Gergiev has said of the Maryinsky's relentless touring over the last decade. Now he believes it is time to bring the world to St. Petersburg, to make the city one of the world's artistic hubs.
"We have this feeling that there's a lack of communication, not only from our side," he said. "Now maybe Petersburg will become one of the most important destinations."

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Imagine Pitching This In Hollywood

BYLINE:  By ELMORE LEONARD

 BODY:
The novelist Elmore Leonard, who has seen 17 of his books turned into movies, thought he'd seen it all until he came across "Chopper," an Australian crime film based on a book by the real-life criminal Mark Read, which opens on Wednesday at Film Forum in Manhattan. What follows are his thoughts on how such a movie might be sold to Hollywood.
 THERE was an Australian picture shown at the Telluride Film Festival last year that I thought was great, not like anything I'd ever seen before. 
 The central character is a vicious criminal, a man whose acts of violence are shocking, so unexpected you can't believe your eyes. Still, without slipping out of character, he can appear to be a reasonable man with a sense of humor. 
I've wondered how "Chopper" would do in the United States, and imagined what it would be like to pitch the story idea to a Hollywood studio executive in charge of distribution.
If given enough time -- say, an afternoon -- I could probably pitch an idea, though not one of mine. I'm never that sure what my books are about. I wait for Scott Frank, an A-list Hollywood screenwriter, to tell me what the themes of my books are. He tells me and I say, "No kidding, really?"
In "Get Shorty" there's a pitch made by a producer that goes: "It's about life, about universal feelings of sorrow and hope. It's about redemption and retribution . . ." But it didn't find its way into Scott Frank's screenplay.
Think of the pitches made in the opening sequence of "The Player," directed by Robert Altman, written by Michael Tolkin from his novel:
"A TV star" -- it's made clear that a movie star plays the part -- "goes to Africa and gets worshiped. It's 'Out of Africa' meets 'Pretty Woman.' "
Another: "It's a psychic political thriller with a heart, and it's funny. 'Ghost' meets 'The Manchurian Candidate.' "
I can't think of what two pictures meeting would come even close to describing "Chopper." It might bring to mind Tarantino's work, or possibly Guy Ritchie's; but I don't want to mislead you. "Chopper" is genuinely original.
This makes pitching the story difficult, because normally you have to get in and get out fast. The studio exec has 150 phone calls to take or make in a day. He would prefer the story idea presented in 25 words or less. Exceed that number, his intercom could be fixed to begin buzzing, or you risk having reached the end of his attention span.
But let's say the exec, noticing that I'm old enough to be his grandfather, graciously allows me 10 minutes.
He goes: " 'Chopper.' But you say it's not about a helicopter."
"No, it focuses on episodes in the life of an extremely violent criminal, and it's funny. Critics in Australia called it hilarious."
"It's a comedy."
"Not really. But when we hear 'Don't Fence Me In' played over grim prison exteriors as the titles roll, we get an idea of the picture's attitude."
"Cynical."
"Well----"
"Crime with a light touch."
"Except that we've already caught glimpses of Chopper describing himself as 'just a bloody normal bloke who likes a bit of torture.' He says it lightly, but he isn't kidding."
"It's a prison movie."
"Part of it."
"What's he in for?"
"Kidnapping a judge. But that's not important."
"What's his motivation?"
"He's a criminal."
"But why? He was poor? Got a bad rap? What's the backstory?"
The temptation is to quote David Mamet on backstory, which he calls "a very useful idea because it allows a lot of unemployable people to earn their living saying things to writers." But that would not serve here: to tell the exec there are no obligatory scenes, in the usual scheme of filmmaking, weighing the picture down. I'll assure him that what you get is on the screen, and it's all that's needed to bring a ferocious character to life.
"You know it's based on a real person. Mark 'Chopper' Read, a living legend, considered part of Australia's criminal folklore, right up there with Ned Kelly."
The exec looks off, squinting. "Ned Kelly . . ."
"And Squizzy Taylor. The real Mark Read has even written nine best-sellers about his life in crime, puff pieces that defend his acts of murder and mayhem on the grounds that the victims are drug dealers and deserve what they got. Chopper, in the movie, tells us that 'drugs have completely ruined the criminal world.' "
"Wait a minute. He's portrayed as a good guy?"
"No. He's vicious, he's a brute."
"Then what's funny about him?"
"The way he rationalizes his actions, blames his victims for what he does to them. In prison he attacks a fellow inmate, punches him in the face with a pair of pliers. Immediately then he's full of remorse, offers the guy a cigarette and says, 'You don't like me much, do you?' "
The exec isn't laughing.
"Another time, he punches out his prostitute girlfriend, Tanya, head-butts her mother as she tries to interfere, and says to Tanya: 'Now look what you've gone and done. Your mum's upset.' "
The exec isn't even smiling and this scene works.
"You have to see the way Eric Bana, a stand-up comic, plays the part."
"He does his shtick?"
"He's funny without meaning to be, the character is. The movie guy at The Sun Herald called Bana's performance 'the most stunning film lead debut witnessed by this critic in 14 years of reviewing.' The critics in Australia went nuts over the picture. Used all the words. Brilliant. Extraordinary. Remarkable. Hilarious, I already mentioned. Superb. Frightening and Funny. Spellbinding. 'Some of the most devastating black humour you're likely to witness.' "
"Who made it?"
"Michele Bennett produced, Andrew Dominik wrote and directed."
"What's Michele look like?"
"Cute as a bug. And knows what she's doing."
"Yeah . . .?"
"It's Dominik's first feature and it's an original all the way. His dialogue isspare and gritty. His visuals hit you in the eye: from the immaculate white walls of prison interiors to the harsh colors of Chopper's old haunts outside. It's Dominik's movie."
"How did it open?"
The exec has been waiting to ask that one.
"Big. Did terrific business all over Australia."
"Will our audience understand it?"
"It's in English."
"Yeah, but with that weird accent."
"You pick up on it or it doesn't matter. Chopper calls a guy a 'bloody sook.' What does it mean? Who cares? It has a ring to it, it's a good word. A witness to a shooting is asked if the victim had threatened Chopper. She says no, 'He was copping it sweet.' It's the kind of line that could catch on."
The exec is nodding, his expression thoughtful, then asks, "Why is he called Chopper?"
"It's not in the movie."
"But how did he get it?"
"From snipping off the toes of guys Chopper claimed owed him money."
"Oh."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON; 
This Marriage Takes A Bit of Explication

BYLINE:  By LYNNE WEIL 

DATELINE: PRINCETON 

 BODY:
A RENOWNED scholar and an accomplished poet, married for 36 years, have just gone through hell together -- line by line. They are in the midst of purgatory at the moment, and will soon start on paradise.
 The journey has not always been a pleasure cruise, as both can attest. 
 Robert Hollander, a professor of literature at Princeton University who is a specialist on the medieval Italian authors Giovanni Boccaccio and Dante Alighieri, is collaborating with his wife, Jean, who teaches poetry and literature at the College of New Jersey, to translate the three books of Dante's "Commedia," or "The Divine Comedy," the epic poem about the afterlife.
Rendering a nearly 700-year-old text into the vernacular of another tongue is time-consuming, painstaking and fascinating, Mr. and Mrs. Hollander said. As Mr. Hollander wrote in their new edition of the "Inferno" (Doubleday, $35), Dante "can be as simple and straightforward as one's country neighbor, or as convoluted as the most arcane professor." 
Now they are pressing ahead with an edition of "Purgatorio," which they hope to have published next year. A new "Paradiso" is planned for 2003.
Mr. Hollander -- who has taught Dante at Princeton for nearly 40 years -- said that over the course of his work he had been delighted to discover aspects of the masterpiece that experts have long overlooked.
"I'm getting really excited about scenes that people pay hardly any attention to, that seem to pass by with small attention and little payoff," he said. "And I'm finding some of them absolutely remarkable."
Mr. Hollander had tried to translate "The Divine Comedy" once before, but he and his collaborator gave up because "it was just driving everybody crazy."
Then one day in February 1997, Jean Hollander looked over her husband's shoulder as he worked with the comparatively unwieldy text of a 1939 translation by John Sinclair, one of the most authoritative Dante scholars. "It was awful," she said with a grimace, "not poetic . . . and it really read very badly. So my husband challenged me. He said, 'Well, can you do better?' And I said, 'Well, let me see.' "
When she returned with a free-verse, contemporary version of the text, the couple recalled, Robert Hollander said, "Hey, that's not bad." And so they began. 
The couple said the project's intricacies highlighted a natural tension between his scholarly instincts and her poet's ear.
Jean Hollander noted that they had disagreed "plenty" over distinctions as fine to the untrained eye as whether sinners are hurled "down" or "below."
To preserve their sanity -- and the peace -- the couple agreed that whoever lived longest would be free to revise the books. Mr. Hollander, 67, joked that the accord gave them both "tremendous incentive to stay alive."
The couple met as graduate students at Columbia University, and married on April 23, 1964 -- the fourth centennial of Shakespeare's birth ("so that we'd never forget our anniversary," Mrs. Hollander explained). He was born and raised in New York; she was born in Vienna, but came to New York in 1940.
Hundreds of her poems have appeared in anthologies and magazines, including the Quarterly Review of Literature and The American Scholar. She has published two prize-winning collections of poetry, "Crushed into Honey" and "Moondog." Since 1982 Mrs. Hollander has directed a writers' conference at the College of New Jersey; this year's gathering, on April 18, will feature the filmmaker Spike Lee.
The Hollanders, who have lived in Hopewell Township since 1965, have two children: Cornelia Vanness Hollander, 33, an environmental reporter in Idaho, and Robert B. Hollander III, 31, who attends medical school at the University of North Carolina.
Gregarious and articulate, Robert Hollander tends to digress; rather than interrupt, his children have developed a helicopterlike hand signal to let him know when he wanders too far off track. 
But readers will appreciate his extensive remarks on the margins of Dante's work, which offer a deeper understanding of the "Inferno" than the translation alone might provide. Page after page of notes in this new edition illuminate complexities of meaning and context. For instance, Mr. Hollander quotes more than 60 authors, ranging from early-14th-century Dante scholars to students in his seminars at Princeton.
Such august figures as Henry W. Longfellow, John Ruskin and the country's ninth poet laureate, Robert Pinsky, have translated parts of "The Divine Comedy" into English. And some, like Mr. Hollander, have added commentary. But reviewers say no one has combined helpful comments and a sensitive, modern translation -- until now.
Publishers Weekly said the Hollanders' "Inferno" "will satisfy both the poetry lover and scholar," and called it "accessible and possessed of the seeming transparence that often characterizes great translations."
Even the rather staid British weekly The Economist wrote, "Although there have been more exciting versions that give us something of Dante's music and magic, there has rarely been such a useful one."
As Mr. Hollander put it, "We wouldn't have done it if we didn't think we could do better than what there was."
Mrs. Hollander has devoted much of her energy in the last four years to "The Divine Comedy" -- though she said that she occasionally needed to "take a holiday from translation" to let herself write.
For his part, at one time Mr. Hollander had no patience for Dante. While teaching at Columbia, he was compelled to include some of "The Divine Comedy" in the curriculum. "I didn't like it very much," he remembered. "I kept saying, 'This is the greatest work of the Middle Ages?' "
Then one day, while reading an article on Dante, he said he was stunned by a revelation. "I came to myself several hours later, holding the periodical in my hand." he said. "I can remember that my first thought was, 'So that's how it works.' And I walked out of the library having decided that I was going to be a Dante scholar."
In the opinion of Mr. Hollander's former students, his efforts have paid off.
Charlene Cosman, who graduated from Princeton in 1976 with a degree in medieval studies, said Mr. Hollander "loves unravelling the mysteries of that author and sharing it with lowly peons such as us."
Ms. Cosman added that "one of his strengths is that he manages to maintain contacts with his former students. He's interested in them as people."
Last year, Mr. Hollander arranged a weeklong reunion in an 11th-century castle in the Tuscan countryside south of Florence. Every morning, the 35 people who took part would recite the first 27 lines of "The Inferno" in Italian, then he would teach for about two hours. Each afternoon, six or seven students led seminars, some of them at the poolside.
Susan Saltrick, a 1978 Princeton graduate in comparative literature, said she felt "a little hesitant" about taking part in the gathering.
"I remember thinking, all I will want to do is eat good food, drink wine and soak up the Tuscan sun," she later said. "But as we got into the material, it was so intellectually stimulating, we all found it a wonderful and worthwhile experience."
Ms. Saltrick called the Hollanders "the dream translation team."
"Bob brings the scholarly, rigorous approach to the text," she said. "Jean brings the music of the lines."

After $51 Million Loss, Twinlab Secures Credit
 After reporting a $51 million loss for the prior fiscal year, the chairman of the Twinlab Corporation (Nasdaq: TWLB) in Hauppauge said Tuesday that the company had secured a $60 million revolving line of credit based on a $15 million guarantee from senior management. 
 Ross Blechman, Twinlab's chairman, president and chief executive, said, "Fiscal 2000 was very difficult for Twinlab as it was for many others in our industry." He promised an "aggressive review" to "streamline operations" to improve the company's "structure, process and systems" and increase customer satisfaction. 
The company, which manufactures vitamins and nutritional supplements, also announced that sales for the fourth quarter of 2000 were $65.4 million, down 26 percent from the $88 million reported in the fourth quarter of 1999. Total sales for 2000 were $280.4 million, down from $315.6 million for the prior year.
Scott Van Winkle, a research analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston, said the company was still "an industry leader" and was likely to regain its profitability.

HEADLINE: Island's Hospitals: Corporate vs. Community 

BYLINE:  By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH more and more community hospitals are joining large networks like the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System and the Long Island Health Network, they insist they are not sacrificing their community roots. But some of the doctors who work for competing local hospitals say that's not the case. 
 One administrator who takes the positive view is J. Ronald Gaud reault, the president and chief executive of Huntington Hospital. "The core of what we do is still what you would normally think of as a community hospital -- providing for most of the health-care needs of the people in our service area," he said. 
 Five years ago, his hospital joined the North Shore Health System, the predecessor of North Shore-L.I.J. Unlike other community hospitals bought by the system, Huntington became a sponsored hospital, allowing it to keep its own board and its own budget. And Mr. Gaudreault said the system had made the hospital "stronger as a result of the resources available." 
"We're now able to provide a level of sophisticated services like a neo natologist 24 hours a day that makes us stronger and does not diminish our legal authority and community accountability," he explained. North Shore also represents the hospital in reimbursement negotiations with insurers and in purchasing large stocks of supplies and equipment. 
The need to negotiate the best rates with insurers has been a prime motivation for community hospitals to join health-care systems, said Daniel Sisto, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents 500 nonprofit hospitals and health-care agencies.
"As government reduced Medicare and Medicaid funding, and as managed care reduced payments, hospitals that were in business to make a profit soon found that that goal was not achievable in New York," Mr. Sisto said. "Community hospitals then banded together to create systems for greater efficiencies, for sharing of services and negotiating with managed-care plans."
The challenge for community hospitals now, Mr. Sisto said, is being able to participate in health-care systems and at the same time to "maintain their identity with the local community and not the needs of a distant system's headquarters."
"They are saying they want to save money by doing administrative things together and buying together, but if they do not appear responsive to the local community, they're dead," he added. "And how formal you make the system requirements for affiliation will vary as each group of hospitals struggles with this tension -- centralization versus local responsiveness."
But in too many instances that effort has failed, said Dr. Amar Jit Singh, the director of clinical services at Brunswick Hospital Center in Amityville.
"Physicians are very unhappy about big corporations taking over the hospitals," said Dr. Singh, who is in the process of buying Brunswick with Harry Fruhman, the hospital's chief financial manager. With 428 beds, it will be the largest hospital owned by individuals in the state.
"We believe that communities must be served the same way as in olden times," Dr. Singh said. "The physicians feel much happier this way because they are dealing with an administration that makes the decisions and not one in which decisions are made by remote control somewhere else. What does the central board know about what is happening in the small communities?"
In February, a group of seven doctors, including the presidents of the medical staffs of five of North Shore-L.I.J.'s hospitals, sent a letter to North Shore-L.I.J. trustees expressing concern about their individual hospitals' ability to provide quality care. In particular, they cited a five-year contract North Shore-L.I.J. Health System negotiated in 1998 with Oxford Medicare that has ended up costing the system money.
"The physician community is concerned that the projected losses from this agreement will impinge on each hospital's ability to dedicate scarce resources to the care of patients," the doctors wrote.
Richard Klarberg, North Shore-L.I.J.'s senior vice president for external affairs, said the system lost $8 million from that contract in 1999 and that the contract was expected to lose even more in 2000. He said that although the contract runs through September 2003, the health system is now negotiating with Oxford in an effort to minimize its future losses. He said 26,000 people are enrolled in Oxford Medicare in Nassau and Queens.
Despite the financial squeeze, Mr. Klarberg said the health system was "committed to maintaining the same quality of care for all patients and to ensuring that all necessary and proper medical charges are paid."
Harry Kassel, the chairman of the South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, said the drive for consolidation stemmed in part from the fact that "hospitals found themselves in terrible financial condition." Although South Nassau did not have financial problems, he said, it decided four years ago to join a health system because "it seemed that to negotiate, you needed critical mass."
So together with Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, it formed the Winthrop South Nassau Health System. Subsequently, that system joined Catholic Health Services, an Island-wide network of four hospitals; Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in Patchogue; and the John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson to form the 11-hospital Long Island Health Network.
"They were brought together for negotiating purposes and to create clinical resource management -- a body of doctors and specialists who set high standards for all of the hospitals," Mr. Kassel said. 
The rush for community hospitals to join health-care systems is so frenetic that "you need a scorecard to keep up," said Peter M. Sullivan, the chief executive of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, an organization of nonprofit hospitals. 
"Everybody has some kind of affiliation," he said.
Some of the ties are no more than a clinical relationship, he explained. "For instance, Long Beach Hospital has a clinical affiliation with Mount Sinai so that if they need backup for a clinical problem, they have a relationship," he said. Everybody has some kind of affiliation."
Dr. Richard Falivena, the chairman of surgical services at the Brunswick Hospital Center, said "the stampede of community hospitals rushing to join" health-care alliances has forced some patients to drive to distant hospitals for care.
"They are being told that their insurance company has a better rate at North Shore and that they will have to go there, even if it means driving past two or three other hospitals to get there," he said. "And if the doctor doesn't have privileges at North Shore, the patient may have to find a new doctor. That is destructive to the relationship that people develop with their physician. Patients should have the choice of selecting their own doctor and going to their community hospital." 
Dr. Harvey F. Wachsman, a neurosurgeon who now practices law in Great Neck, said he was opposed to consolidation. "I think it's terrible," he said. "They're doing it out of desperation, out of fear of not being able to survive. The H.M.O.'s have forced many hospitals in the country to consolidate and be on a stringent diet of little money."
As a result, Dr. Wachsman said, "hospitals don't have enough nurses or enough medical programs and have reduced their number of laboratory people and residents because they can no longer afford to pay them."
And he added that "medical research in this country has really become a disaster because hospitals don't have the money to devote to it."
Dr. Wachsman is also a trustee of the State University of New York and chairman of its health and hospital committee that oversees three state medical centers, including the Stony Brook Medical Center. Several years ago, he said, when some administrators at Stony Brook pushed to become part of the North Shore Health System, he expressed his opposition. 
"I think it should remain separate because it promotes competition, and people work harder and are more creative," he said. 
But Joseph Quagliata, the president of South Nassau Communities Hospital, insisted that despite his institution's affiliation with the Winthrop South Nassau Health System, it retains its "community hospital" ambience. To remain competitive, and to make more specialized services available, the hospital has opened 10 outpatient clinics, among them a wound-care center and a center for physical rehabilitation and sports medicine. A comprehensive cancer-care center is to open later this year.
"We have significant expansion now," Mr. Quagliata said. "We borrowed about $40 million, and we're looking for another $15 million in coming months."
Another type of health-system arrangement was created by Southampton Hospital in Hampton Bays. In April 1995, Southampton and two other East End hospitals, Central Suffolk in Riverhead and Eastern Long Island in Greenport, created the Peconic Health Corporation to negotiate with insurers and to pool resources for a central laboratory and a central warehouse. 
Even with these economies of scale, in 1997 Southampton Hospital found itself $50 million in debt because of what its current president, W. Peter Daniels, described as overspending. The hospital borrowed $40 million in 1999 and after receiving substantial community support, he said, it "did better than break even" last year.
One of the principal roles of a community hospital, Mr. Daniels said, is to "provide access for the physician and patient to make an appropriate assessment at the local level and if required, to tap into specialized care."
He said his hospital was also involved in an outreach project with the East Hampton Healthcare Foundation to meet the demand for services, particularly in the crowded summer months. The foundation is erecting a satellite hospital just east of the Village of East Hampton that is expected to open in July or August. It will offer emergency triage services, along with a pharmacy and X-ray equipment. 
Paul Connor, the chief executive at Eastern Long Island, said that Peconic had negotiated better reimbursement rates for him. But he said Peconic could not provide better patient care, so last year the three hospitals decided to become affiliates of North Shore-L.I.J. 
But unlike the full-fledged members of North Shore-L.I.J., the three East End hospitals cannot ask the health system to conduct reimbursement rate negotiations for them -- those are still handled by Peconic.
"We have the best of both worlds," Mr. Daniels said. "We have the ability to be locally responsive to our communities and to participate in programs at North Shore-Long Island Jewish that I cannot do on my own."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Web-Based Products; 
For Realty Concerns, Internet Is a Disappointment

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
ANDREW FARKAS insists that he is still the "mean, wicked geek" he proclaimed himself to be about a year ago as he prepared to inaugurate the Edi ficeRex Internet residential service portal and other Internet-based products.
 But with EdificeRex continuing to lose money and with other initiatives folded or fading, he said his company, Insignia Financial Services, was focusing less on the possibilities offered by technology and more on real estate. The Internet term B2B, he said, now stands for "back to business." 
 The computer savvy Mr. Farkus, chairman of the company that owns the Douglas Elliman and Insignia/ESG retail and commercial brokerages in New York, said he is now painfully aware that people do not change as quickly as technology. 
The Internet ventures have cost the company about $35 million over the last 18 months, Mr. Farkas says, and produced a change in corporate attitude. "We will look skeptically upon any new technology-related investment opportunities," the company said in its year-end earnings statement.
Insignia is not the only New York area real estate company to have stubbed its toe in the New Economy last year. Companies associated with Vornado Realty Trust and the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, two of the largest owners of commercial property in the area, backed Internet start-ups that either failed outright or never came close to meeting expectations. Although the companies that actually backed the start-ups are legally separate from the two real estate investment trusts, both are closely linked to their former parents.
In all three instances, the financial losses were not large enough to endanger the health of the overall companies. But they appear to indicate how important it seemed, even for seasoned executives, to hop on to the Internet bandwagon and its promise of limitless growth.
Through a spokesman, Vornado executives declined to comment on their Internet activities. But a search of public statements and documents on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission found that Vornado Operating Company, its Internet unit, lost a bit less than $5 million last year attempting establish something called Transportal Network.
According to an S.E.C. document, the Transportal Network was intended to "provide routing and load management services and facilitate related purchases over the Internet to independent truckers, shippers and receivers to enable them to increase efficiency."
Although improving the efficiency of trucking operations seems well removed from the real estate business, the effort was tied to the operation of AmeriCold Logistics, a chain of 104 refrigerated warehouses that is 60 percent owned by Vornado and 40 percent by Crescent Real Estate Equities, another publicly traded real estate investment trust.
The Vornado and Crescent subsidiaries decided to invest in the same ratio in developing Transportal "to pursue a business-to-business Internet opportunity relating to the temperature controlled logistics business," according to an S.E.C. filing.
A Transportal executive interviewed last year in the industry trade journal Trucking Technology said that the objective of the network was to help individual shipping companies, many of them small operations, offset the growing power of industry purchasing groups, which had been reinforced by the Internet. One aim was to cut costs by reducing the number of return trips trucks were forced to make with empty trucks.
Vornado warned in its S.E.C. filings that Transportal would actively seek additional capital from "third parties, including venture capital firms." But by the middle of last year, the venture capitalists were running away from Internet start-ups as fast as they once ran toward them.
In October, Vornado announced it was folding Transportal because of its inability to persuade outside investors to put up additional cash. For the year, Vornado Operating reported a net loss of almost $17.7 million.
Reckson formed Frontline Capital Group for much the same reason that Vornado formed Vornado Operating: to engage in businesses outside the narrow range permitted tax-exempt REIT's. Scott H. Rechler, the president and co-chief executive of Reckson, is also president and chief executive of Frontline.
Frontline invested in a number of Internet or communications companies, including OnSite Access, which was formed to wire office buildings for high speed telecommunications, and RealtyIQ, a real estate transactions reporting company, and 11 others, many of them dot-coms.
Mr. Rechler said many of those companies had expansion plans that in retrospect at least were overly ambitious. "Instead of staying small and proving their business plans and then growing by steps, they wanted to get there in a leap," he said.
But when the capital markets developed dot-com phobia last year, he said, "there was no floor under them." As the value of these companies fell, so did the value of Frontline's investments in them. Although the company stopped investing about midyear, the damage had been done.
BUT the company did have a big winner in HQ Global Workplaces, a provider of temporary office space, which has grown from 44 office centers in 1998 to 462 by the end of last year. So Frontline's managers divided the company into two units, one for HQ and one for the others, which were written off to the point that they were less than 1 percent of the company's assets by year-end.
Frontline reported that the non-HQ part of the company posted a loss of $204.3 million for 2000, compared with a loss of $37.1 million the year earlier. Including HQ, Frontline had a loss of $234.9 million for 2000, compared with $39.8 million in 1999.
Meanwhile, Frontline's stock, which traded as high as $45 a share as recently as last May, is currently trading about $10 a share.
Mr. Rechler said Frontline was spun off to Reckson shareholders as a separate company to avoid any dilution of the value of the REIT's shares because of speculative investments in start-up companies.
But Reckson did provide Frontline with a credit line of $100 million, of which $92 million has been drawn down. Analysts have speculated that Frontline may try to take the HQ business public or sell it to get the cash to repay Reckson.
Mr. Rechler said the shareholders in Frontline have done well despite the collapse of the high technology sector. He said the company was spun off in 1998 at $1 a share. Even at today's stock price, the shareholders have enjoyed a tenfold increase in the value of their holdings over two years, he said.
Mr. Farkas, whose company invested in 17 Web companies in addition to Insignia's internal Internet developments, said the most important lesson he had learned over the last 18 months is that "the willingness of people to change their behavior over a short time is extremely limited."
He said despite the efficiencies that are a least theoretically possible in buying and selling over the Internet, even business people were not willing to break with existing procedures. "The world was not quite ready," he said. "People want to do business with other people; they are reluctant to do business with a box."
Even where consumers have shown themselves willing to make modest purchases, like books or CD's, online, the companies involved have not been able to post profits. "If they can't make a profit, they will go away," he said.
Another problem, he said, is the notion that has taken hold in many quarters that information delivered over the Internet is free. And advertising is not likely to be able to support Web sites with the services provided by EdificeRex, which include restaurant reviews, commuting tips and commentary on the social scene. RexOffice, a separate building management and purchasing site, was merged into a larger group last year. 
"Advertising pays for about 50 percent of the burn rate," or cost, of the site, he said, adding that the costs of the site had been scaled back to less than $1 million a year.
"It would only take a couple of dollars a month per user to make it prosper," he said. "Twenty-five dollars a year and it would pay its own way. But people do not want to pay for a service that had been free."
One solution, he said, might be to turn off the site for a year or two and reintroduce it with a modest fee attached. He did not say if the company actually planned to take that action.
In the meantime, he said, the company is seeking to bring in partners who can add to the mix of information available at the site. In particular, he said he is looking for content that can be sold.

Long-Delayed Offices Are Rising in Elmwood Park

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AFTER a decade of delays and false starts, the third building in an office complex is rising on the east side of River Drive in Elmwood Park, and new plans are advancing to continue the development on the west side of the road with three more office structures and a hotel.
 The 86,000-square-foot structure is being built on speculation, an anomaly in Bergen County. When finished in July, it will complete the 12-acre River Drive Center, containing 240,000 square feet in three four-story buildings. 
 The plan for the west side, a proposed $100 million project that still must be approved by the borough's zoning board, calls for a seven-story 168-room hotel and 500,000 square feet of offices in buildings of 4, 6 and 12 stories as well as retail space. That five-year project would be built in phases on 20 acres overlooking the Passaic River. The first phase would consist of the hotel, a 98,000-square-foot office building and the retail space -- a bank branch and a restaurant, said Joseph P. Langan. He is president of the River Drive Construction Company of Elmwood Park, the managing partner for the investment groups developing the parcels. 
An investor in both groups is Mr. Langan's father, Bernard, who also runs an engineering firm bearing his name. The firms of both father and son occupy space in one of the existing buildings at River Drive Center. 
The projects are a departure from the norm in Elmwood Park, a mostly residential borough of 20,000. The western site is among the last sizable tracts open to development in the 2.5 square mile community. For that parcel, the developers are seeking a height variance from the borough's four-story limit for offices and six-story limit for hotels.
Ralph Alvarez, chairman of the borough's zoning board, said there are concerns about the proposed tall buildings and their demands on the borough's water and sewer systems. For residents who live near the site, the greatest worry is the increased traffic on River Drive, which is already heavily traveled, he said. 
Elmwood Park's mayor, Richard A. Mola, noted, "It is a choice parcel; something will be developed there." So the question is how to improve the borough's economic base without congesting the area, he said.
Joseph Langan said that despite setbacks the partners never gave up on developing the sites because they "had invested several millions of dollars into them" and wanted to capitalize on an attractive location. The parcels are near Exit 61 of Interstate 80, Exits 156 and 157 of the Garden State Parkway and Route 46.
Mr. Langan said the partners were proceeding now despite the uncertainties over the national economy because, among other reasons, highway access was enhanced with the completion in December of the final 1.8 miles of Route 21.
With the road completed, there is now a direct link from Newark to Route 46 in Clifton and to Route 20 in Paterson, Fair Lawn and Elmwood Park, and, in turn, the commute from the River Drive site to Newark has been cut in half to 15 minutes.
He said the end of the road work had also enabled him to buy eight state-owned acres on the west side of River Drive, which in an earlier plan had been set aside for the last leg of Route 21. When the route was changed, however, the land became surplus. 
The eight acres, which Mr. Langan said he bought in January, were added to the 10 acres the partners already owned. They are also under contract to buy two more acres, he said.
The partners have been on a bumpy ride in the last decade in their drive to develop their property on River Drive. After the second building on the east side was built in 1991, the recession caused plans for the third to be put on hold. Also postponed was the project across the street, which then included a 14-story hotel and a 12-story office building on a 10 acres.
By the mid-90's the developers dropped those plans and proposed a retail-entertainment complex on the west-side parcel. But that project, too, was abandoned because of objections, mainly over traffic, from nearby residents.
Meanwhile, the partners spent years debating or negotiating with the state about the fate of its eight-acre road-project site. Once the land was declared surplus, it was proposed as, among other things, the site for a salt dome, used for storing road salt. 
Last year the partners acquired the eight acres for $2.3 million at a state-run auction. Since then they have been advancing their current plan for the west-side parcel and started constructing the final building at River Drive Center. 
AS of the first quarter of this year the vacancy rate for Class A buildings in Bergen County had risen to 11.5 percent, from 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000 and from 9 percent in the first quarter last year, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national real estate firm. Among the reasons for the increase is the return of blocks of space to the market, mainly through subleases, because of corporate consolidations and mergers. At the same time the average annual asking rent for prime space was $29.94 a square foot, up from $29.41 in the fourth quarter of 2000 and from $28.22 in the first quarter of 2000. 
Compared with the pace of price increases in recent years, "there has been some easing on pricing, and more space is available," said William C. Hansen, president of NAI/James E. Hansen, a commercial brokerage company in Hackensack. But, he added, Bergen County "is still strong and that there is little room for new development will keep the market in check." 
James D. Hersh, a vice president at the Paramus office of CB Richard Ellis, which is handling the leasing for the latest River Drive building, added, "Leases are expiring and companies continue to grow and shrink." 
One of the few other new developments in the area is the renovation of a 100,000-square-foot building at 395 West Passaic Street in Rochelle Park. The M. Alfieri Company, a development company based in Metro Park that owns the building, stripped it to its steel skeleton after its sole tenant, Toys "R" Us, moved out two years ago and invested $5 million to refurbish it. 
Since the renovation was completed last June, 90 percent of the space has been leased at annual rents of $27 a square foot, Michael Alfieri, president of the development company, said.
As for the River Drive building, Mr. Hersh said, "There are still few large blocks of new space for tenants to choose from, and with asking rents of $27 a square foot we are still below other Class A buildings in the area." 
Mr. Hersh said he expected to draw tenants from older buildings elsewhere in the county that are looking for new space with functional layouts and amenities, as well as those relocating from Manhattan to cut costs. 
Mr. Hansen said that though the county could absorb some additional space, he is unsure if it could accommodate the 500,000 square feet of space proposed on the west side of River Drive. 
Mr. Langan said the scale of the current proposal is necessary "to compete" and make the economics work, and he is confident of his ability to market it. As part of the approval process for the final building at River Drive Center, the developers will widen the last section of River Drive from two to four lanes as they had done to earlier sections. They will also install a traffic light at Slater Drive, which leads into the east and west components of the project.
Mr. Langan said the partners know additional road improvements are needed to support the entire project and will explore with the state's Department of Transportation the possibility of rebuilding the ramps at Interchange 61 of I-80. He said he was optimistic that work on the project's first phase could begin by this summer. 
The borough is cautious. "We've been down this road before," said Mr. Alvarez, the zoning board official. "But assuming everything can be worked out, the project would be a benefit to everyone concerned -- and that is the bottom line"

HEADLINE: Holding Back a Human Tide 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
IT is springtime in Southampton, when diehard farmers plow, city people sign summer leases and builders churn out new McMansions row upon row in what were once farms and open spaces.
 In the building-crazed town, all the studies, comprehensive plans and building moratoriums undertaken by local officials in recent years seem barely to have slowed the spread of these large-lot, jarringly expensive second homes of mock-heroic proportions, now as much a visual mainstay as the open land they overran. 
 But in Southampton and the neighboring towns of East Hampton, Riverhead and Southold, powerful forces and public money are at work, perhaps in a more coordinated way than ever before, to finally and forever save the less than 36,000 acres of surviving farmland and permanently preserve thousands more acres of open space and watersheds on the North and South Forks, the most rural and agricultural areas remaining on Long Island.
Experts and public officials familiar with land-use patterns on the East End say the next four years will see the final set-to between preservation and development in the only part of Long Island yet to succumb to an eastward-spreading suburbanization on a 50-year winning streak. 
Spending for preservation has hit historic highs since 1998, when the four towns' voters approved 2 percent real estate transfer taxes to finance preservation and Suffolk voters -- with large pluralities on the East End -- approved a $60 million parks, farms and open space program. During the three-year period, governments have spent more than $100 million and committed tens of millions more.
With climbing land prices and East End development pressure so far hardly pausing as the economy cools, some local officials -- and all of the region's influential conservation groups -- say that even more must be done, and soon. 
"We have risen to a crescendo of land purchasing activity," said Stuart Lowrie, the director of government relations for the Nature Conservancy on Long Island, a group that preserves plant and wildlife habitat. "I wish I could say with confidence that we have been able to keep up."
But many farmers, developers and workers in the building trades are skeptical of the process, and land owners worry about preservation they say will be at their expense.
In all four towns the wheels are rolling, but on different paths.
In conservative Southold, in a bolt from the blue, the town board has devised a zoning change in agricultural areas that would allow just one house on every five acres. The town supervisor, Jean W. Cochran, said development in neighboring Riverhead spurred the town to action.
"We've spent $13 million in grants and we buy farm development rights, do clustering and it goes on and on and on," Mrs. Cochran said. "But when you look at what's happening in Riverhead and other places, it's not enough."
Mrs. Cochran grew up in Riverhead when it was still very rural, but now looks at commercial and residential development in her old hometown with regret. "It does make me sad what's happened," she said. "It's headed our way, but we are going to fight it like hell." 
Mrs. Cochran said the five-acre zoning, the most restrictive ever proposed on Long Island for an entire agricultural area, was "the quickest way to assure Southold preserves as much of its farmland as possible."
The proposal appears to have the support of a majority of the Southold town board, which is scheduled to vote on it as early as June.
In Riverhead, where nearly 40 percent of the remaining East End farmland is located, Supervisor Robert Kozakiewicz, a lawyer and farm boy who heads a town board often criticized for accommodating developers, was also feeling some pangs about development.
"It seems to be reaching a critical mass," Mr. Kozakiewicz said. "Southold has moved to a five-acre push, Southampton has their master plan and Riverhead is kind of squeezed between them and we've done nothing."
But that may change. Riverhead, one of the last places in New York to adopt zoning, is considering updating its master plan with a consultant's recommendation that future development in the town's more than 17,000 acres of farmland be clustered on 15 percent of farm parcels.
Such a requirement, which the town is still weeks if not months from deciding upon, would preserve 85 percent of the farmland with no direct public expense. But some critics said it could result in unattractive, highly concentrated housing on the remaining portion.
Other criticism was more sweeping. The Riverhead-based Long Island Farm Bureau said the Riverhead proposal was "unrealistic, unworkable and overly restrictive" and would reduce farm owners' equity. 
The bureau's executive director, Joseph Gergela, also sent an angry letter to Southold protesting that it had not been consulted about that town's agricultural rezoning proposal, which it opposes.
Joseph F. Gazza, a lawyer and developer from Quogue, voiced the misgivings of many developers when he said, "Whenever I see some kind of plan that talks about preserving something without buying it all, I always have skepticism." 
Warning signals have also come from the Long Island Association, the regional chambr of commerce, which has identified the islandwide shortage of affordable housing as the leading threat to its economy. Upzoning or generous set-aside provisions could make it more difficult to turn farmland into anything but the most expensive homes.
"The need for affordable housing is at least as acute on the East End of Long Island as it is elsewhere, and any land use plan out there should take that into account," said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association. 
East Hampton has made affordable housing a top priority because of evidence that local residents continue to be forced away by high prices. A comprehensive plan update, for which the town hired the Long Island Regional Planning Board executive director, Lee E. Koppelman, may lead to new steps for affordable units as well as for preservation.
With so much at stake, the struggle over land has increasingly become ammunition for East End politics. An environmental political action group, the New York League of Conservation Voters, has announced that it was planning a first-ever effort to recruit environmental candidates for East End town offices.
"This is a real critical time on the East End, and a lot of these decisions will be made on a local level," said Marcia Bystryn, the league's executive director. "Voters have said over and over that they want preservation, so now it's time to do it."
Another group, the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, said it would begin a lobbying campaign later this month to increase and expedite town and county spending for preservation programs approved by voters.
Richard Amper, the group's executive director, said the governments were moving too slowly. "It's like a roach motel," he said. "The money goes in but it doesn't come out. Now we have to make sure the politicians spend our money as we have directed."
Mr. Amper's group and others want the county to borrow against future sales tax revenues designated for land and water preservation in order to maximize purchasing now. But key officials remain opposed to the borrowing. Paul Sabatino, the counsel to the Legislature, has said that too much borrowing now would increase debt service.
A bill pending in the state Legislature assures the county that it has authority to borrow against the revenues and encourages it to do so, but the effect of passage on the county officials remained unclear. The county executive, Robert J. Gaffney, who increased his support of farm and land preservation beginning in 1997, said he supported the bill.
Much attention now centers on Riverhead, which appears to be eclipsing Southampton as the East End development hot spot.
Among environmental groups, the town is viewed as an easy target for developers because of accommodating zoning and what many see as a lack of commitment to preservation or even a pro-development bias among some officials.
The county's director of real estate, Allan D. Grecco, said the town had been helpful in advancing Suffolk's now 25-year-old farmland preservation program, which involves the purchase of farm development rights. More purchases have occurred in Riverhead than in any other town. But the county-financed program has protected less than 4,000 farm acres to date.
Riverhead's land-use consultant, Land Ethics Inc., said its proposal to limit building to 15 percent of farm parcels was designed to make conversion of farmland into residential developments "less appealing for landowners and developers."
In recent years, several farm owners in Riverhead have converted fields and in least one case surrounding woods into golf courses. The Riverhead consultant urged that golf courses and so-called golf communities be prohibited in agricultural areas and no longer counted as open space. 
Mr. Kozakiewicz, like Mrs. Cochran a Republican, said it was too soon to comment on the proposals. He said he opposed a rezoning plan such as the one proposed in Southold or a building moratorium and preferred to await the revised comprehensive plan.
"Something has to be done," he said. "The question is what. We can't sit back and simply ignore."
In Southampton, the town, on its own and in partnership with the county and the state, has set a record pace for land protection over the past five years yet still seems in the throes of a land-to-houses transformation that is locally abhorred and blamed for worsening traffic. The $28 million spent by the town to acquire 800 acres since 1996 has not satisfied environmental groups and other critics who say the town studies too much and acts too little.
When the town supervisor, Vincent J. Cannuscio, announced early this month that he would not run for a fourth term, he listed among his accomplishments that no other administration had done more to preserve farms and open space.
But his critics said they would remember Mr. Cannuscio, a builder, as the obstructionist at the helm during a time when the town seemed to drag its heels on preservation despite overwhelming local support for a more active town role.
Typical of the slow action, they said, was the town's failure to put in place new laws to limit development in agricultural areas during a 10-month moratorium on large subdivisions in farm areas that expired in early February.
"The problem in Southampton is that after all the comprehensive planning there still isn't that much coming over the hill," said Robert DeLuca, president of the Group for the South Fork in Bridgehampton. He described the town planning board as "the building approval arm of the development industry."
Mr. DeLuca's group sued the planning board after it approved a 28-lot subdivision on a 102-acre property at West Neck Hills, saying it shortcut required environmental reviews the land's primeval woods, swamps and wetlands required. But in a twist, the town board heartily agreed on the importance of the preserving the West Neck Hills land. Last week, despite the planning board approval, it was in negotiations with the owner to set a purchase price. 
The town's failure to produce regulations also frustrated builders prevented from commencing major projects during the moratorium and still without a resolution to questions of what would and would not be permitted.
The town board is now considering a new 60-day moratorium on residential subdivisions on farmlands to allow mre time for approval of new regulations recommended in the town's updated comprehensive plan. Those regulations may include clustering, increases in open space set-asides and financial incentives for farmers and farm owners not to sell their land to developers for set periods of time to allow for future public purchase.
On April 24, the Southampton board will hold a public hearings on 10 proposed town laws to preserve farmland to accomplish these goals and others.
East Hampton has the smallest acreage of farmland of the four larger East End towns (Shelter Island has no farmland at all) but a longer tradition for preservation, dating to building moratoriums in the 1980's. Many key parcels have since been preserved.
The East Hampton supervisor, Jay Schneiderman, said that within the past two years 24 properties on 800 acres were preserved at a cost of $41 million, of which the town provided more than $20 million. The remainder came from the state, Suffolk County and private groups including the Nature Conservancy.
Mr. Schneiderman, a Republican, said the town was in contract to buy a 40-acre ocean parcel in Napeague for $8.4 million. In February, the town and Suffolk County split the $9 million cost to buy the 165-acre Jacob's Farm in Springs as a nature preserve. Last year, in a purchase that ended years of failed attempts, the town, county and state and the Nature Conservancy joined in a $17.7 million purchase of the nearly 100-acre oceanfront Shadmoor property in Montauk. It is now a state park.
The town has identified some 5,300 acres of watershed and open space that would cost an estimated $145 million to preserve. Mr. Schneiderman said such a cost could never be borne by the town alone and would require assistance from other governments.
To speed the pace of purchases, East Hampton borrowed against future revenues from the 2 percent real estate transfer tax, an approach also used in Southampton but rejected in Riverhead and Southold, where the transfer tax has resulted in far lower revenues.
Mr. Schneiderman said that East Hampton was now "pretty well tapped out" and was finding it difficult to wrest more money from the county. He said county legislators from western Suffolk towns wanted preservation money spent in their districts. "It's becoming harder and harder to get the funds," he said.
Mr. Grecco, the county real estate director, said Suffolk spent a record $47 million last year for open land and watershed purchase and protection, a portion of it on the East End, and would spend a similar amount this year.
Though hundreds of farm acres continue to disappear each year, Suffolk remains the biggest agricultural county in New York based on produce value. That is because agriculture on the East Ed has morphed into an intensive greenhouse, vineyard, farm stand and agro-tourism industry far different from the potato realm that ruled until the 1970's.
A recent farm equipment auction at the Cichanowicz farm on Sound Avenue in Riverhead underscored the changes. The Entenmann family of bakery fame, operators of the adjacent Martha Clara Vineyards, is buying the 68-acre farm and will plant 25 acres in vines this spring. The Cichanowicz farm stand will become a wine tasting room.
Though neither buyer nor seller would confirm it, the word in the tight-knit agricultural community was that the Entenmanns paid up to $50,000 an acre for the farm, or roughly twice what farmland had typically sold for in the area.
Charles Cichanowicz Sr., who bought the farm in the 1940's and grew potatoes and other field crops there, took a dim view of government steps to preserve farmland. "They took the land from the Indians," he said. "Is that what they are trying to do now to the farmers?"

A Rye Brook Project Invokes New Urbanism's Ideas

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
TWO years after the first homes at BelleFair at Rye Brook went on the market, a meeting house and country-style store have opened at the development, fulfilling what its developer, Mitchell C. Hochberg, describes as his long-held dream of introducing concepts of New Urbanism to Westchester.
 "I wanted to tie a lifestyle to a way of life -- to build a neighborhood, not just houses," said Mr. Hochberg, president of Spectrum Skanska, the home-building and development division of Skanska A.B., based in Stockholm, the fifth-largest construction company in the world. 
 The meeting house, the village green, houses with front porches and the sidewalks where children can ride their bikes remind Mr. Hochberg of a more neighborly way of life. "When I was growing up, everyone was out on the streets," he said. "You met people at the local candy store. I want to bring that feeling back with my projects." 
Watching the children at BelleFair debark from a school bus one recent afternoon and make a dash for the candy section of the Corner Stone Market, a nostalgic Mr. Hochberg said, "This all hits a nerve in me."
But sentimentality aside, eschewing the cookie-cutter model of suburban tract housing has also been good for business. Among other things, the New Urbanism concept with its features of the old-fashioned hometown is a stong selling device.
"Yes, we're in this to make money -- not just out of the graciousness of our hearts," the builder said, explaining that many of the life-style extras at BelleFair -- like the 20,000-square-foot meeting house and the store stocked with licorice and "sweet and sours" -- also help offset the harsh reality of the development's noisy next-door neighbor: the Westchester County Airiport.
Without the extras that allow BelleFair to stand out among other developments, buyers leery of planes flying low over their homes may have passed it up, he conceded.
His strategy appears to have worked. Almost all 261 units at the former site of High Point Psychiatric Hospital on King Street have been sold, and the few resales that have come on the market are being snapped up fast, said Peter Raider, an associate broker for Houlihan/Lawrence in Rye.
On BelleFair's oval-shaped village green, about the size of a football field, the 20,000-square-foot meeting house -- complete with a New England-style clock tower -- was designed to foster interaction among residents. It offers three floors of recreational options in a structure built into a hillside.
Leila Namin, the mother of two small children, said the concept has clearly worked for her. "I've met more people and made more friends in the last two weeks since the pool opened than in the first nine months after I moved here," she said.
The main level of the meeting house, actually the third floor, features a lounge with a fireplace, a 60-inch television, a study, pool table, kitchen, children's playroom and library with computer stations. The lounge overlooks a gymnasium and basketball court, which is next to a large fitness area. On the lowest level, residents can use either a heated indoor pool and a whirlpool spa during the colder months, or an outdoor pool. This level also leads out to a plaza with an old-fashioned bandstand for special events.
Wendy Bosalavage, president of American Leisure, a recreation and real estate management firm in New City, N.Y., that is overseeing the operation of the meeting house, said the concepts at BelleFair reflect a larger sociological trend: the need in a technology-driven world "to touch and feel each other again."
American Leisure is under contract to the homeowners association, which pays it out of the members' monthly maintenance fees.
Next door to the meeting house, the Corner Stone Market has become another place where BelleFair residents congregate. It features a bakery, a deli and a small coffee "bistro." The market also sells basic groceries as well as precooked meals and pizza to take out, and it provides catering service. 
BelleFair is Westchester's first New Urbanism-type development, which is "the coming thing for land use, the cutting edge," said Brit Perkins, a local architect who is a principal of EDI Architecture P.C., which designs housing developments and has offices in Manhattan, San Francisco and Houston. "Lots of their ideas are finally making their way into the mainstream."
NEW URBANISM, a 10-year-old architectural and planning movement features self-contained communities that are somewhat independent of automobiles and offer links to mass transit. BelleFair, for example, operates a daily shuttle bus service to the nearby Metro-North train station in Port Chester. Also, instead of single-family homes on large lots, the development clusters the housing to leave tracts of open land.
In contrast with the backyard-oriented developments built during the 1970's, New Urbanism houses often feature porches that face the street to foster more interaction between neighbors. 
The movement also espouses a mix of housing types to draw all age groups and family types. BelleFair includes detached homes from 2,000 to 3,300 square feet and attached houses from 1,640 to 2,200 square feet. The homes now sell for about $550,000 for attached units to as much as about $900,000. Twelve attached town houses have been set aside for sale to buyers with moderate incomes. Priority will be given to Rye Brook village employees and local teachers, police auxiliary members, firefighters and volunteer ambulance corps workers.
The demographic mix is one factor that led John and Louise Viaggio, who are both in their mid-70's, to purchase a home at BelleFair two years ago. Mr. Viaggio, a retired lawyer, said the couple was not ready "to be living in a community of old people."
"Not only that," he said, "but this place also has an ethnic mix -- blacks, whites, Jewish, Christian. We prefer that."
Twenty percent of the adults at BelleFair are 55 or older. Another 16 percent are 45 to 54. Thirty-one percent are 35 to 44, and 31 percent are 25 to 34. Two percent of the residents did not give their age. BelleFair does not keep data on the ethnic or religious mix in the development. 
Construction is about to begin on a 166-unit senior rental housing community built by Forest City Daly of New York City. Scheduled to open in about 18 months, it will the first independent-living building for the elderly in the area to be constructed as part of a larger residential community. The units will be studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms with kitchens in a three- or four- story building with a clapboard exterior.
For its younger residents, Spectrum Skanska recently broke ground on a new 5,000-square-foot, stand-alone child day-care center to be next to the meeting house and the Corner Stone Market.
One question that has yet to be answered is just how self-sustaining economically some of the enterprises at New Urbanism communities can be. "It's the chicken and egg thing," Mr. Perkins, the architect, said. "Which comes first? Often such developments are not large enough to support a retail establishment, for example."
The country store at BelleFair, managed by Corner Stone Caterers of Rye, will try to draw from a wider audience than just the residents of BelleFair, said Gary Stone, who runs the business with his wife, Liz. "We going to have to draw from surrounding communities as well," he said.
In addition to BelleFair, Spectrum Skanska's other active residential neighborhoods include Legend Yacht and Beach Club in Glen Cove on Long Island, Valimar in White Plains and the Legends at Purchase. Spectrum Skanska, which has its headquarters in Valhalla, is the construction and development manager for Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor. 
Later this year, Spectrum Skanska is planning to open sales for two new residential communities: Mansion Ridge in Monroe in Orange County and the Legends at Half Hollow in Dix Hills on Long Island.

HEADLINE: Condos in Washington: $1,000 a Square Foot and Up 

BYLINE:  By JAMES R. HARDCASTLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A NEW YORK CITY developer is demonstrating that people will pay Manhattan prices for condominium apartments in Washington if they get the right blend of prestige, convenience and luxury.
 Millennium Partners has sold two-thirds of the 161 units in the two 11-story Residences at Ritz-Carlton apartment buildings that it opened last fall, said Christopher M. Jeffries, one of the concern's founding partners. 
Prices range from $765,000 to $5.6 million for the units, which vary in size from 1,100-square-foot one-bedroom-plus-den apartments to 5,600-square-foot penthouse suites with rooftop terraces. The prices have increased five times since preopening sales began in April 1999.
Owners of the condominiums have access to such Ritz-Carlton amenities as room, maid and valet service as well as their own concierge desk. The condominiums, a 300-room Ritz-Carlton hotel and a vast 100,000-square-foot sports and fitness center are all part of a $260 million mixed-use project developed by Millennium. It takes up an entire block seven blocks northwest of the White House in the city's West End area. 
The site, bounded by 22nd and 23rd Streets Northwest between L and M Streets, is among the largest vacant properties developed in downtown Washington in recent years. It is convenient to both the exclusive Georgetown neighborhood and Washington's principal office districts.
Mr. Jeffries said the average price for the condominiums it sells at the Residences at Ritz-Carlton was about $750 a square foot. This is well over twice the most expensive new units built in the Washington metropolitan area in the last decade, said Anthony Lanier, president of Eastbanc Inc., Millennium's local development partner.
A Millennium spokesman, Matthew Hall, said his company was selling condos atop a Ritz-Carlton Hotel on the southernmost tip of Manhattan for $654,000 to $6.25 million. The price works out to about $900 per square foot, he said. 
The prices for Millennium's Battery Park City apartments will soon be challenged by a second Residences at Ritz-Carlton development in Washington, which the company has under way in Georgetown eight blocks west of its recently opened project. 
Next to an elevated freeway that separates Georgetown from the Potomac River, the company is constructing five buildings that will contain another Ritz-Carlton hotel, apartments and movie theaters. As its central lobby, the complex will use a turn-of-the-last-century brick structure that once served as a municipal incinerator.
A 13-screen, 2,800-seat movie theater will be on the lowest level of the 500,000-square-foot complex, less than half the area of the first project. A 93-room Ritz-Carlton hotel will sit on the floors immediately above the theater. 
On the uppermost five levels of the six-story complex, Millennium will build 25 to 30 large condominium apartments 3,000 to 6,000 square feet in size, each with a view of the Potomac, Mr. Lanier said. The units are expected to sell for between $3 million and $7 million, he said, an average of $1,000 to $1,200 a square foot. Projected completion date is the last quarter of this year.
Millennium is building similar luxury condominiums on Central Park South in New York and on Boston Common, as well as in San Francisco's South of Market area. 
Its strategy, pioneered in its buildings in the Lincoln Center area of Manhattan, is to acquire large sites -- offering dramatic views if possible -- at signature locations in major cities and then to develop mixed-use projects, often anchored by a Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons hotel.
Millennium's projects typically incorporate vast multiscreen stadium-style theaters and sports clubs to generate energy and excitement, Mr. Jeffries said. 
As part of its strategy, Millennium develops and sells luxury condominiums to recover development costs for the overall project. The company retains an ownership interest in the hotels, retail properties and sports and entertainment centers it develops, Mr. Jeffries said. 
Demand generated by the for-sale apartments improves the economies of operations for the hotels and the sports and entertainment facilities.
MILLENNIUM'S equity partners for current and future projects include five German financial firms; Goldman Sachs & Company's Whitehall Street real estate limited partnerships; the billionaire George Soros and the Quantum Realty Fund, which Mr. Soros's firm manages; and Citicorp Real Estate. The total capital commitment for the projects recently completed or under construction is $3 billion. Partners' equity in the ventures totals about $1 billion. 
The 11-story West End project was the first to open because it is not a high-rise project and could therefore be designed and built more quickly. High-rise projects cannot be built in Washington because of federal limitations on building height.
One reason Millennium is moving so fast to get Residences at Ritz-Carlton projects up in major cities across the country is that it has no corner on the condominium-premium hotel concept, Mr. Jeffries said. And at least two fellow developers are well along with plans for competing projects.
Across the Potomac River from Millennium's Georgetown project, where height regulations are far less restrictive, the developers JBG of Washington and TrizecHahn of Toronto have secured land-use approval in Arlington County, Va., for Waterview, a mixed-use project that includes a 28-story tower containing a 220-room hotel with 65 condominium units on its top 11 floors. The building will be twice as high as the tallest building in Washington.
The site offers unobstructed views of the Potomac River, Georgetown and Washington's major monuments. The architectural firm of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners is designing the office building and the exterior of the hotel. 
A JBG partner, Brian Coulter, said the JBG-TrizecHahn venture would soon select one of two premium hotel operators to manage the hotel and provide service to the condominium units. Construction is expected to begin this fall. Prices for the units have not been set, but 2,500-square-foot apartments there will probably begin at $1.5 million to $1.75 million.
Mr. Jeffries of Millennium said nearly all the buyers moving into the West End project are married couples between 40 and 60 years old.
"There is plenty of wealth in the Washington, D.C., area," he said. "There are a lot of single family houses selling for $3 million, $4 million or $5 million." Now that their children aren't home, Mr. Jeffries said, buyers "are trading cutting the grass for wonderful apartments selling for a couple of million dollars."
Barbara McLeod and her husband, Bruce, were among the first owners to move into Millennium's West End condominiums last November. And they fit the buyer's profile spelled out by Millennium's Mr. Jeffries well.
Ms. McLeod, 55, said she and her husband wanted to live in the city when they first moved to the area from Florida in 1986, but "we didn't feel it was that safe." Instead, they moved to a series of homes in suburban Virginia and Maryland.
Although she must drive to her public relations job at Cable and Wireless in Tysons Corner, Va., she said she rarely drives after returning from work. Her husband walks two blocks and takes the subway two stops to commute to his job in software sales in the Ronald Reagan Building on Pennsylvania Avenue.
She said morning workouts at the Sports Club/L.A. gym have become part of her daily routine. Because the club is only an elevator ride away, she said, she now has time to try new activities like boxing, basketball and jumping rope that she probably would not have time to attempt if she had to drive to a gym.
She said two of her favorite services at the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton were valet parking and the availability of bellmen upon returning from shopping trips.

HEADLINE: Another University, Another Turnaround 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

 BODY:
EVAN S. DOBELLE does not surf. He is not leaving the helm of Trinity College, on this city's south side, for the University of Hawaii because of the weather, but, as he will tell anyone who asks, to help another struggling university save itself.
 "That's what I do best," Mr. Dobelle said. "Turn things around." 
 Mr. Dobelle, 55, surprised many of his East Coast peers and his own board of trustees by announcing that he would leave Trinity's wrought-iron confines in June for Honolulu, where, he said, he expected to face the greatest challenge of his career. The University of Hawaii, which comprises 10 campuses on 6 islands, is beset by administrative and financial problems.
Ronald Thomas, Mr. Dobelle's chief of staff, was appointed by the board to act as interim president for up to one year. A national search for Mr. Dobelle's successor will begin later this year. 
Since his arrival in 1995, Mr. Dobelle has been widely credited with turning things around at Trinity, where annual tuition is more than $32,000. Average SAT scores of incoming freshmen are up 31 points, to 1271; more than half of Trinity's alumni now donate money to the school, an usually high percentage, and instead of fencing itself off from Frog Hollow, the black and Hispanic neighborhood surrounding its 100-acre campus, the college has built a bridge to it. 
Mr. Dobelle recruited Janice Perlman, the founder of the nonprofit Mega-Cities Project, an effort to share innovative public policies among cities around the globe, to teach an innovative urban studies class. He hired 20 faculty members and arranged to build another dormitory, which opened in September, and a new admissions building set to open in May.
But Mr. Dobelle's signal achievement, state and city officials said, was the Learning Corridor, a $175 million urban renewal and education project to connect the private college's students with the hardscrabble neighborhood that surrounds the campus. Over five years, the project razed and rebuilt several downtrodden city blocks into a modern campus for a Montessori elementary school, a public middle school, and two arts and sciences academies for local public school students. Trinity donated $6 million toward the project, which took five years to build and opened in September.
"He kind of filled a vacuum," said Harry J. Hartley, who was the president of the University of Connecticut from 1990 to 1996. "He decided to take the lead with this Learning Corridor in a very imaginative and creative way."
Reflecting on Mr. Dobelle's departure, Mr. Hartley said, "I view it as a huge loss for the state of Connecticut."
Thomas S. Johnson, the chairman of the college's trustees and of the Greenpoint Financial Corporation in New York City, called Mr. Dobelle "almost unique in American education, in being effective at linking the interests of Trinity to the interests of the community around Trinity."
The college's board, he added, was at first surprised to hear their president was leaving for, of all places, Hawaii. But the more they learned of the university's problems, he said, the more it made sense. 
Starting July 1, Mr. Dobelle will succeed Kenneth P. Mortimer, who is retiring after eight years as president, and begin a seven-year contract that will pay him $442,000 a year, compared with the $275,000 plus deferred compensation he earned at Trinity, he said.
There will be no honeymoon. Hawaii's 3,000-member faculty, without a contract since 1998, is scheduled to begin a strike for higher wages on April 5. Persistent student protests outside Mr. Dobelle's future offices have started a public debate over a plan to increase tuition. Cuts to the university's $700 million budget have prompted some faculty defections and held up plans to build a new branch..
"They've got complicated times," Mr. Dobelle said in a telephone interview from Honolulu. "To me that's a real opportunity. I don't know how many universities are about to go on strike."

HEADLINE: Where Westchester Goes to College 

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
WITH its storied wealth and excellent schools, it's no surprise that Westchester County sends dozens of high school graduates to prestigious and expensive universities like Columbia and Wesleyan.
 But by a startling margin, the No. 1 destination of the county's public school graduates is Westchester Community College, where the tuition is a mere $2,350 a year. 
 A survey of 27 high schools by the Westchester section found that last year, 610 seniors went to Westchester Community College, almost five times the number who went to the second most popular choice, the State University of New York in Albany, which drew 129.
Next on the list was Pace University, with 113; Iona College, with 92; and SUNY Oneonta, with 72. In fact, of the top 19 colleges on the list, only one -- Boston University -- is not in New York State. 
Among Ivy League schools, Cornell was by far the most popular, with 55, followed by the University of Pennsylvania, with 33.
At first glance, these figures might seem unexpected, given the county's reputation for affluence and the ambitions of its high-achieving parents. But to those who advise high school students on the college application process, the results were predictable.
"Not everybody here goes far away and spends oodles of money," said Susan Dickson, assistant director of guidance at Rye High School. "Within Westchester, there is a huge diversity factor. You've got families in million-dollar homes, and people who are renting, so you're going to have a wide disparity in colleges."
Even at Horace Greeley High School in affluent Chappaqua, which sent 26 seniors to Ivy League colleges -- more than any other school that participated in the survey -- cost is important.
"We forget how expensive education is, and if you're earning $60,000 a year, you don't have $35,000 to spend on college," said Penny Oberg, chairwoman of the counseling department at Horace Greeley. "The SUNY's and W.C.C. are the best value. We will frequently meet parents who say, 'I'll pay for Harvard, not Hamilton.' So it's not surprising that the SUNY's are popular."
To get a picture of where Westchester students go to college, the Westchester section asked the guidance departments at all 43 public high schools in the county to provide data about the class of 2000. Most schools responded. Some, like Scarsdale and Dobbs Ferry, declined to participate. Others, like Pleasantville, Ossining and Mount Vernon, sent lists describing where their students were accepted, but not where they actually enrolled.
The survey did provide some surprises.
For example, six students from the county went to Palm Beach Community College in Florida, the same number that went to Rockland Community College and Hudson Valley Community College, much closer to home; to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and to McGill, the prestigious university in Montreal. Guidance counselors said Palm Beach attracts students who want a sunny climate and who have relatives in Florida.
As Scott MacLachlan, dean of enrollment management for Palm Beach Community College, explained: "We find that most students from the North have relatives in Palm Beach County -- typically, grandparents or the noncustodial parent of a divorce. Some students are intrigued by the thought of going to college in sunny south Florida." He said the college also has student housing.
By and large, however, the survey found that Westchester students like to stay close to home.
"Juniors will say, 'I'm going to go to California,' " Ms. Oberg said, "and seniors will say, 'I'd like to be on the East Coast.' " 
Added Carol Gill, president of Carol Gill Associates, an educational consulting firm with offices in Dobbs Ferry and Boston: "It's true that kids are staying in the mid-Atlantic region. I have more and more parents and students telling me that they want to be within a three- to four-hour drive."
In keeping with national trends that indicate that more students are seeking urban schools, Boston University, New York University and Syracuse University were popular with Westchester students, as was George Washington University. 
Some students also ventured farther afield, to places like the University of Colorado, the University of Miami and Arizona State University. 
Highly selective colleges like Duke, Brandeis and Georgetown each enrolled more than a dozen students from the county.
In total, Ivy League universities enrolled 165 Westchester students, including 25 at Columbia, 14 at Harvard, 13 at Brown, 10 at Dartmouth, 10 at Yale and 5 at Princeton.
Few guidance counselor were surprised that among the Ivies, Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania attract so many Westchester graduates. Cornell has 14,000 undergraduates in its various divisions, compared with Yale's 5,200. And Penn's freshman class of 2,385 means that there are potentially many more slots than at some of the smaller universities.
In addition, Cornell has significant cost advantages for New York State residents because it is a "land grant" institution and some of its units, like the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, receive state financing. In those schools. annual tuition and fees for a state resident is $12,062 (excluding room and board), compared with $26,062 at other schools, like the College of Arts and Sciences.
"Cornell offers a bargain," said Anne Keary, a guidance counselor at Irvington High School. "It's an Ivy League education, but depending on the school at Cornell, families can be paying substantially less."
Other factors contribute to these schools' appeal. 
"Cornell and Penn have always been popular Ivy schools in this area," Ms. Gill said. "Cornell is fairly close and offers a great deal. It's a multi-university, where you can buy a small school within a large university. 
"And Penn has become hot. It seems to have the essential ingredients. It's located in a city, and there's a lively campus life, with excellent academics and social opportunities outside."
Cornell representatives regularly attend college fairs and parent information sessions sponsored by local high schools, and Cornell even runs a bus trip to the campus in Ithaca for prospective students.
Lloyd Hall, an associate director of admissions at Cornell, added that Cornell's large alumni presence in Westchester helps maintain the university's strong relationship with county high schools.
Similarly, the University of Pennsylvania has long enjoyed a positive relationship with many of the county's high schools.
"We treasure our relationship with the county," said Dr. Lee Stetson, the dean of admissions. "There are excellent schools, the students are well-prepared, they look competitive during the application process, and they thrive when they come to Penn. 
"We've always had many students from Chappaqua, Scarsdale, Ardsley, Rye and Mamaroneck -- now we're seeing increasing numbers from Byram Hills, Yorktown and Dobbs Ferry. There's also a very strong alumni base in the county. And now that students consider a city environment to be the environment of choice, and Philadelphia is perceived as a manageable city, it helps makes the university more attractive."
As for which high schools are most successful at sending students to the Ivy League, the top two among those that responded to the survey -- Horace Greeley in Chappaqua, and Mamaroneck High School -- are also no surprise, given the schools' academic reputations and the communities' economic profile. 
What was less predictable, however, was the record of one of the county's smaller high schools, Ardsley, which sent 13 studebts to the Ivies, and one of the county's more diverse schools, New Rochelle, which sent 14. 
"New Rochelle has always been extremely competitive for the Ivy League and highly selective colleges," said Dr. Diane Massimo, district coordinator of guidance counseling for the New Rochelle School District.
Other high schools that provided data only on where students were accepted, rather than where they enrolled, also did well.
Students from Mount Vernon High School, for example, were accepted at Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard and Yale, as well as universities like Brandeis and Georgetown.
Pleasantville students were accepted at Colby, the College of William and Mary, Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Cornell, among others, while Edgemont students were accepted at Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth, Duke, Georgetown, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Yale.
Cost is not the only reason for the popularity of Westchester Community College, guidance counselors say.
"It serves a lot of purposes," said Dr. Massimo of New Rochelle. "A lot of our students are seeking a two-year career degree. It's also a steppingstone for many students that opens a lot of doors. It's very positive, in giving students the maximum opportunities. We even have a registration process for W.C.C. here on campus."
For Stephanie Annunziata, who graduated from Westlake High School last year, W.C.C. was just what she was looking for. 
"My guidance counselor recommended it," she said. "I looked into it, heard it had great academics and gave students many opportunities. I live at home -- my parents wanted me at home -- and I love it." Ms. Annunziata intends to earn an associate's degree in communications and then transfer to a four-year college.
Teresita Wisell, director of admissions for Westchester Community College, said there were several reasons for its popularity. 
"We've been working to dispel the myth that community college is less than other institutions, especially in Westchester," she said. "There's also the myth that it's only for students who can't go elsewhere. We are a SUNY school, and students who start here can end up at Dartmouth, Harvard and Columbia, as well as N.Y.U., Manhattanville, Iona and the four-year state colleges."
For certain students, W.C.C. can be a choice, not a fallback. 
"Some recognize that they're not ready, emotionally or academically, to go away," Ms. Wisell said. "And for some, it's a second chance to build up their grades so they'll be more attractive to a selective college."
Ms. Dickson of Rye High School said: "Students know that if they attend a community college and do well, they're automatically accepted at a four-year New York State college. Kids who have to pay for their own college find that appealing."
But SUNY showed enormous appeal to incoming freshmen as well. Taken together, the various units of the State University of New York (excluding Westchester Community College, which is affiliated with the SUNY system) drew 647 students.
"SUNY schools are really coming into their own and getting national recognition," Ms. Gill said, "especially Binghamton, which is one of the best in the country."
Dr. Lois Guberman, director of guidance at Pelham Memorial High School, said she was not surprised by the popularity of SUNY Albany. "A lot of kids stay close to home, and SUNY is a great education," she said, adding, "Albany is one of the four university centers in the system, and it's in a city."
While Albany was No. 1, it was followed closely by Oneonta, with 72; New Paltz, with 66; Purchase, with 58, and Binghamton, with 48. SUNY Buffalo drew 41 students.
For an in-state undergraduate, tuition at SUNY Albany is $3,400 a year.
State universities elsewhere also showed strong appeal in Westchester. Confirming Ms. Gill's comments about the lure of the Middle Atlantic states, the University of Delaware drew 37 students, while the University of Maryland drew 32.
"One of the reasons we like your students is that we know they're well prepared," said Ronne Patrick, associate director of undergraduate admissions at the University of Maryland, which has about 24,000 undergraduates, and accepts about 4,000 students for its freshman class. "Maryland is a public research university that offers a real campus life and wonderful programs. I think students are attracted to the opportunities we have as a large campus. We've also got a Metro stop here that goes to Washington, D.C., and we're 45 minutes from Baltimore."
In New England, the University of Massachusetts attracted 32 students, while the University of Rhode Island drew 25.
Even farther afield, the University of Michigan attracted 34 students, while the University of California campuses drew 7.
Closer to home, Pace University, with campuses in White Plains, Pleasantville-Briarcliff Manor and New York City, has made a concerted effort to attract students from Westchester, and draws 30 percent of its freshman class from the county.
"We consider ourselves the university of Westchester County," said Desiree Cilmi, executive director of enrollment services for Pace. "We are the only comprehensive university in the county, with undergraduate, graduate and professional schools. Our name recognition in the county is extremely high."
Regine Bruny, a 2000 graduate of New Rochelle High School, chose Pace over SUNY Binghamton and SUNY Farmingdale, where she was also accepted.
"My guidance counselor told me that Pace University was on top for nursing, and that's what I want to do," Ms. Bruny said. "I think it's important for a freshman to be close to home. Pace was close, but not too close, so I can feel independent. My mom wanted me to stay close. And I'm happy with Pace."
Ms. Cilmi said Pace made a special effort to reach students like Ms. Bruny.
"We do a lot of outreach to the community, like running workshops on how to complete the college application and how to complete the financial aid application," she said. "We also have an aggressive academic scholarship program, with a minimum of $5,000 up to full tuition, which is about $16,000 a year." 
Ms. Keary, the Irvington guidance counselor, confirmed Pace's aggressive use of scholarships. "Pace has been offering nice financial packages to students in the middle of the class," she said, "and attracting good students."
Pace also offers full scholarships each year to the top two graduates of Westchester Community College. 
Whatever the choice, guidance counselors said, the college selection process generally ends well. As Ms. Oberg put it, "Most kids, no matter where they go, make peace with it and are happy."

How the Survey Was Done
OVER the last few months, the Westchester section asked the county's public high schools to provide lists of where students from the class of 2000 enrolled in college. Parochial and independent schools were not part of the survey. 
Some schools, like Scarsdale and Dobbs Ferry, declined to participate. Others, like Pleasantville, Ossining and Mount Vernon, sent lists describing where students were accepted, but not where they enrolled. And some schools, like Bronxville, provided lists of the colleges their students were attending, but without specifying how many students were enrolled at each college.
As a result, the survey is incomplete and is based on the cooperating high schools' self-reported data. It is likely that, in some cases, students might have changed their minds between the time they told the guidance office where they intended to enroll and when they actually enrolled in September.
Experts warn that the survey should not be seen as a report card for the county's high schools. The college admissions process, they point out, is capricious; high school classes differ from year to year even within a community (one year, for example, a school can send four students to Harvard, and the next year there can be none), and students themselves can be fickle about which colleges appeal to them. There are years when Duke and Brown look most alluring, and others when Yale and Stanford are most attractive. At best, these results reflect a snapshot of specific classes for a given year; the classes of 1999 or 2001 might yield different results. 
As Dr. Lois Guberman, director of guidance at Pelham Memorial High School, said, "I consider that Pelham has had a good year if they're all going someplace that's right for them and they're happy."

City Bills Back Fees On Units

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
AN effort by the New York City Department of Finance to collect unpaid annual registration fees due on rent-stabilized apartments -- along with compounded interest on past due amounts -- has generated anger among representatives of property owners and concern and confusion among co-op boards, lawyers and managing agents.
 The fees, which have been added to the property-tax bills for thousands of buildings in the city, are the result of a state law that since 1984 has required owners of rent-stabilized apartments to pay an annual $10 registration fee for each apartment. And while the registration fees themselves generally do not amount to a significant amount, the charges being added to the tax bills can amount to tens of thousands of dollars when compound interest is added to the unpaid amounts. 
 "This is insanity," said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a Manhattan organization that represents owners of multifamily buildings. "Some owners are getting hit with bills that are four times the amount of the original registration fees. And if that isn't bad enough, some owners are saying they're getting billed for fees they've already paid." 
Mr. Strasburg explained that while property owners do not dispute the legality of the $10 annual registration fee, many of them are infuriated because the city is only now trying to collect fees dating as far back as 1984. "At this point in time it's the city's position that the money is due and owing and the burden is on the property owner to prove that they have paid the required amount," he said. "Some owners don't even have records going back to 1984."
Paul Korngold, a Manhattan tax lawyer, said that the charges are being added to the property-tax bills of residential buildings for which city records indicate that charges have not been paid. The problem with that, however, is that among those buildings receiving bills are co-ops in which the registration fees are typically the responsibility of the original sponsor or the investors who subsequently bought rent-stabilized apartments. 
And while Mr. Korngold said that city officials have indicated to him that they do not intend to hold property owners -- including co-op corporations -- responsible for fees that should have been paid by others, the officials have not yet indicated how or when charges will be removed from the tax bills. Curt Ritter, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said that Mr. Korngold is correct. Mr. Ritter added that the Department of Finance has a customer service department that will assist anyone who has concerns regarding the charges. The number to call is (718) 935-9500.
Gregory Carlson, executive director of the Federation of New York Housing Cooperatives, said that even though co-ops will not be held responsible for fees that should have been paid by sponsors or investors, the inclusion of the amounts due on the building's property tax bill can result in a number of problems.
"My greatest fear is that some escrow agent out in Ohio gets a tax bill from the city and just goes ahead and pays it," Mr. Carlson said, explaining that in many cases, lenders who hold underlying mortgages on co-op buildings often require that the lender itself or its agent pay the taxes, rather than allowing the co-op board to pay directly. In such a case, he said, if the escrow agent pays the amount demanded by the city before the co-op has an opportunity to contest it, the co-op would be faced with the daunting challenge of getting a refund from the city or chasing the responsible party -- in many cases, a sponsor long gone from the building -- for the money that was paid.
"Unless it's a large amount of money, it could easily cost the co-op more in legal expenses to sue the responsible party than the amount that's in dispute," Mr. Carlson said. "That means that even if the co-op wins, it loses."
In some cases, however, the amount being added to a building's tax bill is large. "One 275-unit co-op I know of in Bayside, Queens, just got hit with a bill for more than $35,000," Mr. Carlson said. "Another building in Woodside got a bill for about $25,000, only about $9,000 of which was for the actual fees and about $16,000 being for interest."
Mitch Unger, the controller for John B. Lovett & Associates, a managing agent in College Point, Queens, said that he represents several buildings that have been billed for substantial amounts by the city, including the first one referred to by Mr. Carlson.
"It's fine and dandy for the city to say that co-ops won't have to pay for charges that were the responsibility of sponsors and investors," Mr. Unger said. "But when you're dealing with the city, you usually have to prove you don't owe something rather than the other way around."
To complicate matters even further, there is always the possibility that the co-op corporation may legitimately owe some or even all of the amounts assessed by the city. Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that could happen in situations where the co-op owns rent-stabilized apartments -- usually as a result of a sponsor default -- and has failed to pay the required registration fees.
"In that case, the co-op would have to pay what it owes," Mr. Brett said, adding that shareholders selling their apartments could encounter problems if any unpaid charges are reflected on the building's tax records -- regardless of who is ultimately responsible for them.
"If the lender for the buyer sees an amount due for the building's real estate taxes, he's going to want to know who's responsible for paying it," he said. "And I don't know how many lawyers or managing agents will be willing to guarantee that the city will eventually remove the charge."
He said that co-ops that receive bills for unpaid registration fees that are not their responsibility should immediately contact the Department of Finance, contest the charges and ask that they be removed. 
And since some less-efficient managing agents might simply pay the charges when they receive a bill from the city without determining whether the charges are appropriate, he said, co-op boards should advise their agents not to pay the charges without getting explicit board approval.
Mr. Brett said boards or their agents should contact the building's mortgage holder and advise the lender not to pay any charges that are not part of the building's normal tax bill.
Finally, Mr. Brett said, boards should resist the temptation to pay the charges and then hope to get reimbursed by the sponsor or investor ultimately responsible for them.
"The last thing a board should do," he said, "is end up being a collection agency for the city."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; 
InMoney Funds, Awaiting Dawn

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
NERVOUS mutual fund investors are not quite charging for the exits, but many of them have been heading for the sidelines, waiting for the volatile stock market to hit bottom. As they wait, they are piling up cash in money market funds, long a haven in troubled times.
 An unprecedented $2 trillion sat in money funds at the end of the quarter, up from $1.7 trillion a year ago and double the amount of just four years ago. In fact, the new total is about half of what is currently in stocks. Much of the newer money has come from institutional investors who include managers of pensions, 401(k) plans or mutual funds, as well as corporations and foundations. But individual investors, concerned about the impact of a slowing economy are also a big factor, as many rethink their investments with more emphasis on cash. 
 Ronald and Judy Peace of Jacksonville, Fla., are among the wary. They are in the process of reallocating their $4.5 million investment portfolio. The plan, they say, is to put 10 percent of their assets in tax-free money funds and 15 percent in bond funds, instead of having nearly all of it in stocks and stock funds.
"We haven't changed our strategy in the last year," said Mr. Peace, 57, a retired mortgage financier. But now, he added, "the stock market is making us a little nervous."
Fund companies say the cash pileup began in earnest at the start of the year, as stock losses began to accelerate, with the broad market averages joining in the slide that Nasdaq began a year ago.
Money funds today account for 29 percent of all mutual fund assets, a six-year high, data from the Investment Company Institute show. In January alone, a record $116 billion poured into them, almost double the previous monthly record inflow of $62.4 billion, reached in November 2000, according to iMoneyNet Inc., which collects money fund data.
"The numbers are quite impressive," said Peter Crane, a vice president of iMoneyNet and the publisher of its Money Fund monthly newsletter. "There is normally a huge buildup in money market funds at the first part of the year, primarily due to year-end bonuses, but there's a lot more cash than usual."
Steve Traum, who manages the retail money market funds at T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F., the giant university-oriented investment group, said assets had risen by more than $100 million since the start of the year, to nearly $720 million. However, he added, "we have not seen any drastic movement out of our equity funds." 
There was no mass exodus from stock funds reported at Janus, either. "We have done a good job of educating our investors that there are going to be ups and downs," said Sharon Pichler, the portfolio manager for Janus money market funds, which have grown to $13.96 billion from $10.87 billion at the start of the year. 
MONEY funds, which invest in short-term debt like commercial paper, Treasury bills and certificates of deposit, are considered safe and liquid. Even though they are not federally insured, no individual investor has ever lost a dime in them, Mr. Crane said, and money can be withdrawn immediately -- if, say, the stock market is suddenly attractive again. Yields, averaging 4.8 percent for a taxable fund, are generally higher than those offered on similar accounts available from banks, around 3.8 percent, and on six-month C.D.'s, around 4.7 percent.
"I think many investors will come to conclude right now that 5 percent 'sure' is a lot better than 25 percent 'maybe,' " said Jonathan Pond, president of Financial Planning Information in Boston, referring to sharp stock gains in the late 1990's. 
Mr. Pond said he recently modified his suggested asset allocation mix for the majority of his clients to 60 percent stocks, 25 percent bonds and 15 percent money market funds. That reflects a 10-point increase in cash exposure at stocks' expense. 
"The lasting lesson from this debacle in the market is the value of diversification," he added, "because a year ago there were people out there saying diversification is dead."
But investors seeking to stay liquid should know that not all money funds are equal. Some 1,591 taxable and tax-exempt funds, with varying yields and fees, are offered by fund companies or brokerage firms. 
When choosing a fund, you should first consider how you plan to use it. If you intend to hold chunks of cash for significant periods while deciding, say, what to do with a year-end bonus or monthly commissions that are piling up, yield should be a priority, Mr. Crane said. If you expect to use the fund more as a checking account, withdrawing and replenishing cash from time to time, then yield would be secondary to other features like unlimited check-writing, he said. 
(Many firms, like Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments, offer unlimited check-writing for their larger customers, typically with minimum investments starting at $50,000.)
Fees are another consideration. The average money-market fund costs half a percentage point annually, according to iMoneyNet. Among the low-cost leaders are the T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. Money fund, which charges 0.29 percent, and Vanguard Prime Retail, 0.33 percent.
Investors also need to weigh risk. Although many money funds hold similar debt instruments, some funds may be considered a bit riskier because they invest in some less-conservative securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that 95 percent of a money fund's assets be in so-called Tier 1 investments, which have the highest credit ratings, and many organizations like T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. and Janus invest exclusively in them. But up to 5 percent of a fund's assets can go into lower-grade, though higher-yielding, Tier 2 investments; some funds do include them in their mix. 
Debt instruments can default. In 1994, for example, several money market funds had to be bailed out by their sponsors because of bad investments in money market derivatives, and parent companies also had to buy impaired securities from fund portfolios after Orange County, Calif., declared bankruptcy.
Mr. Crane suggests reading a fund's prospectus to learn about its investment philosophy. If you are looking for the safest fund, you may want to consider one that invests only in United States government obligations, like Treasury bills, or those with some kind of government backing. Of course, yields will be comparatively lower, and short-term rates in general may move down more as the Federal Reserve moves to revive the sluggish economy.
"Still, in relationship to inflation, which remains pretty low, the yields on all money market funds remain attractive," said Hank Madden, a Jacksonville money manager who is working with the Peace household and many other clients to rebalance their investment portfolios. 
"Any new money that comes in right now we're putting into cash until I can get a better feel for the market," he said. "But when the money starts moving back into the market, watch out."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; 
Taking On the Saint of Indexing

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
JOHN C. BOGLE'S critics like to call him a St. Paul (though he prefers St. Jack) who preaches his vision of the true path, a pontificator with the zeal of the righteous. 
 Mr. Bogle, the founder and former chief executive of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds, has cast himself as the conscience of the industry. In speeches, articles and books, he rails against what he sees as its sins: excessive portfolio turnover, wasteful marketing, neglect of the shareholder in favor of enriching managers and, most apparent to the consumer, needlessly high costs. 
 His terrain, of course, is the market-mimicking index fund, which he pioneered at Vanguard. That gives Mr. Bogle a point of view, which he does not hide. "Mutual funds can make no claim to superiority over the market averages," he writes in his latest book, "John Bogle on Investing: The First 50 Years" (McGraw-Hill). Most active managers cannot beat the indexes, he argues. 
Mr. Bogle is careful to stress that not all funds are guilty. But in the vast arena out there, he finds nary a worthy opponent.
"I've yet to hear a single serious rebuttal to my criticisms of the fund industry," he writes. "So I conclude that, because their veracity is self-evident, my words are accepted as truths."
Why not give the other guys a chance? Here are the edited comments of four mutual fund executives on St. Jack. Though not singled out by Mr. Bogle, they all preside over families of funds that include equity funds with more than $100 million in assets and with expense ratios of more than 2 percent, well above the average of 1.19 percent for the category and far beyond the 0.18 percent expense ratio of the Vanguard 500 Index Trust.

MATTHEW KELMON -- President and portfolio manager of Kelmoore Strategy Funds of Palo Alto, Calif., which has just over $500 million in managed assets:
Our funds are sold only through brokers. The adviser fee is 1 percent; the 12b-1 fee is 1 percent. That's all expenses to market the fund. We probably have the most actively managed fund out of any fund on the Street. We have a very complex strategy. We write covered options against a portfolio of 40 to 45 blue-chip equities, on a monthly basis, and pay out a monthly dividend. People who invest in our fund are cash-flow oriented.
How have the indexers done over the last nine months? They have done what the index has done, which has gone straight down. An index fund is just praying it comes back. I'm using the equity as a vehicle to create a cash flow, a monthly cash flow for our investors. We've paid out about 4 1/2 percent on earned profits in 2001, and that's a hard return. I've already made up the expense ratio for the entire year in the first three months.
If the market does not come screaming back, we will earn it multiple times over in 2001. 
I don't see why anyone would pay for an index. If you're in active management and it works, it's worth a fee. Some of the funds with lower expense ratios have absolutely no management and run on cruise control -- I don't see why anybody would pay for those.

SAMUEL S. STEWART JR. -- Chairman of Wasatch Advisors Inc. of Salt Lake City, which has $2 billion under management:
Our basic approach is to say, "You get what you pay for." We're more than happy to compare our Micro Cap fund net of fees against whatever index you deem appropriate. In my mind you can pay Jack's fee of two-tenths of a percent and get a net return of 10, and pay the Micro Cap fee of 2.4 and get a net return of 15 percent.
I would never make an across-the-board argument against index funds. In general, Jack is right, but in particular cases he can be wrong. What you want to do if you're going to get into the higher-fee world is make sure the firm has the talent. For the casual person that just wants to take advantage of the stock market and the higher rates of return over the long course of time, then index funds are the best vehicle.

ROBERT H. GRAHAM -- President and chief executive of the AIM Management Group of Houston, which manages 60 retail funds and $170 billion in assets:
First of all, Jack Bogle comes from the position that people don't need a financial adviser. Well, we come from a different philosophy. We think a financial adviser is extremely important to help the individual. We don't think individuals have the time or the expertise to make their financial decisions. Now, that financial adviser obviously wants to be paid.
If you just look at operating expenses and take all that out, I'm sure we do run higher expense ratios than Vanguard and probably most funds, too, but like anything else, our product costs a little more to produce, and we think it's a better product. We're not sure the lowest-cost product is the best product. 
A lot of his ideas are competitive issues for Vanguard. He promotes ideas that make Vanguard look good. It has to be taken with a grain of salt, his ideas. If I came out with a bunch of propositions that made AIM look great, you might want to question whether I'm really sincere, or trying to make us look good.
Part of the problem I have with indexing is, it's O.K. if perhaps a small amount of money goes into indexing. But we would be in a bad state if all of our money was passively managed. There would be no system for weeding out the bad companies and rewarding the good companies. I think it would be dangerous for our economy if we got to the point where the majority of our money was passively invested.
We certainly have a strong marketing group. Part of our business, we feel, is to bring new money into the funds. AIM as a firm is in the business to make a profit, and see our assets grow and our revenues grow. We're not ashamed to say that's our business, but we don't think that's inconsistent with the interests of the shareholder.

RICHARD E. STIERWALT -- Chief executive of the Orbitex Financial Services Group, with $2 billion under management:
We have very specialized sector funds, and we hire experts in the field who really understand, for example, what the development of new drugs in biotech is. These people are very, very expensive. As a result, we are able to create a better performance.
If you want to be in an index-type product, then you have to expect an index-type return. And if you are in a product that has specialized management, then for the most part you should outperform the market. If you look at Orbitex Information Communications, which rose 150 percent in 1999 and 2000, and compare that to a technology fund that was less expensive and tied more to an index, the client would be better served in Information Communications .
These are brand-new funds. As the assets grow, the expense ratio goes down. That's inconsequential to the return pattern. If you give me $3 and I give you $150 back, how many times would you like to do that?

HEADLINE: Across the City, A Strong Market 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
THE deal on the 3,000-square-foot Brooklyn Heights penthouse apartment -- with its stately dining room, state-of-the-art kitchen, solarium, wraparound terrace and grand views of Manhattan and the harbor -- closed last May at just over $2 million.
 "It was the highest price ever paid for a co-op in the Heights," said Christopher Thomas, vice president for Brooklyn at the William B. May Company, which brokered the deal. 
 Within weeks, a comparable penthouse half a block away was listed for $900,000 more. "We found a buyer at that higher asking price, which would have established a new record," Mr. Thomas said, "except the seller then decided to increase the price an additional $200,000." 
Nearly a year later, that second penthouse remains on the market, despite the seller's retreat to the initial asking price.
That tale of two apartments might serve as a parable for the state of New York City's residential real estate market -- stark reality setting in at dizzying heights after a disputed presidential election, stock market gyrations, dot-com layoffs, faltering earnings for big-name national firms.
But nothing in New York is formulaic. For, as if joining in a five-borough Bronx cheer, the city market defied economic insecurities and enjoyed -- particularly the sellers -- another profitable year. And while sales volume slipped in 2000, the buzz of rising prices is still being heard so far this year -- muted, perhaps, to a hum as some buyers assume a wait-and-see posture.
All five boroughs -- with Manhattan again stretching the imaginings of profitability -- saw prices increase in 2000, according to realtors' figures. By 13.9 percent in South Brooklyn, for example, where the average price for all one- to four-family homes climbed from $252,880 in 1999 to $288,030 last year. By 12.3 percent on Staten Island, where the average cost of a single-family house rose from $202,422 to $227,396.
In Queens, where 1999's median price of $190,000 increased 5.2 percent in 2000, to $200,000. And in the rejuvenating Bronx, where last year's $236,000 average price was 4.9 percent higher than the average of $225,000 in 1999, according to one broker's calculations.
By another market gauge, the repeat-sale survey conducted by Case Shiller Weiss, the home-price research company, last year, for the second straight year, every ZIP code area in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island (the survey does not cover Manhattan) experienced price appreciation: 12 areas by up to 4 percent, 20 by 4 to 8 percent, 49 by 8 to 12 percent and another 49 -- including swaths in each of those boroughs -- by at least 12 percent.
And then there's Manhattan. According to the Douglas Elliman Report, one of the most comprehensive surveys of the borough, the median price for all apartments sold below West 116th Street and East 96th Street last year was $480,000, a 50 percent ski jump higher than 1999's median price of $320,000 -- largely because sales volume for smaller apartments slipped while the number of high-end deals climbed.
It is not by some inherent hubris that New York City, even in a time of national uncertainty, defies laws of economic gravity. It is more a function of specific local factors maintaining upward pressure on prices.
The city and the metropolitan region are, to a degree and for a time, at least, insulated from a national economic downturn, largely because they are less dependent on manufacturing. At the same time, the city is virtually landlocked, one reason that despite a healthy spike in housing construction last year, supply remains limited.
Add into the mix a population that broke the near-mythic eight million mark, according to the 2000 census, including a rainbow-stream of recent immigrants; near-record low mortgage interest rates, citywide job growth, rising per capita income levels and record year-end bonus payouts in the financial markets, and the Big Apple's real estate market continues to be squeezed -- with sellers savoring the sauce.
"This year looks to me like it's going to shape up as a pretty good year for housing," said Rae Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "The market is no longer roiling; it's settled down to a simmer."
Ms. Rosen cited, among others, these favorable indicators: "New York City's retail sales tax collections in January were up 5.5 percent, compared to January of last year. City tax collections on personal income were up 13 percent this January, again compared to last January."
The city received $6 billion in venture capital investment in 2000, Ms. Rosen said, referring to "people investing in private companies that are still fairly young and may be a year or two away from an initial public offering."
All indicative of a healthy job market. John L. Weiting, the regional commissioner of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the city's job growth remained strong in 2000, "even compared to most years in the present job upturn."
The city added 83,000 private-sector jobs in 2000, raising private employment from 3,161,400 to 3,244,600. "The 2000 job figures were down from a record 102,000 increase in 1999," Mr. Weiting said, "but still substantially topped the yearly average growth rate of 64,000 during the expansion of the past eight years."
Ms. Rosen said, "These figures indicate a fairly strong economy to me." 
And they point to people's ability to make down payments -- especially when mortgage rates are low.
Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage statistics company in Butler, N.J., said interest on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 7.20 percent this past week, "within shouting distance" of the 33-year low of 6.68 percent seen in October 1998.
Icing on the city's current housing cake, particularly the high-rise luxury slice, was another record year for Wall Street bonuses. Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, said $12.2 billion in bonuses were distributed in the securities industry last year, breaking the 1999 record of $11.8 billion. "And when the banking, advertising, legal and real estate sectors are included, $22.2 billion in bonuses was paid out last year," Mr. Gordon said.
Lots of money, but not much to buy.
"The run-up in prices in New York City throughout the 1990's was largely caused by inadequate supply," said Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law.
The city's population hit 8,008,278 a year ago, according to the 2000 census, growing by 685,000 over the last 10 years. "And while roughly half that increase is attributable to efforts of the city Planning Department to find households that were always there but not counted," Professor Schill pointed out, "that still means the city grew by about 300,000 people, or about 122,000 households, over the decade."
But over the same period, only 82,000 new housing units were completed. "So not even counting buildings that were demolished," Professor Schill said, "new demand outstripped supply by 40,000 units."
"Unless we promote construction to meet this demand, housing prices in New York are likely to keep rising," he added. 
And so for now, at least, despite the nation's economic jitters and recent evidence of local buyer hesitation, there has been little easing of the price squeeze from one neighborhood to the next in the five boroughs.
That long-unsold penthouse in Brooklyn Heights, Mr. Thomas of the William B. May Company said, "is not the entire story of what took place in 2000." The rapid rise of prices in Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope during late 1999 and 2000 drove many buyers into adjoining neighborhoods, Mr. Thomas said. "And that influx into Fort Greene, Boerum Hill, Prospect-Lefferts, Windsor Terrace, created the same supply-demand imbalance that drove prices up in Brooklyn Heights," he continued.
Recalling one couple's shift from intending to buy in the Heights to paying the full asking price of $950,000 for "a brownstone that needed work on a prime Fort Greene block," Mr. Thomas said that, soon after, another house one block away came on the market, also at $950,000.
"But this property ultimately sold in competitive bidding at $1.2 million," Mr. Thomas said. "The point is that prior to this in Fort Greene, properties were priced based on previous sales. But at this point, because of the influx of qualified buyers, the competition drove the price up 15 to 20 percent in a matter of a few months."
There seems to be little hesitation to fork over top dollar at the rarefied heights of the Manhattan market. Kirk Henckels, director of Stribling Private Brokerage, said that his company sold 18 co-ops and 10 town houses for $10 million or more each in 2000, compared with 7 co-ops and 7 town houses in that category in 1999.
Sales volume did slow, somewhat, after the Nasdaq stock index started its long swoon last year, Mr. Henckels said, "and we lost what I refer to as the slam-dunk buyer -- the one who waltzes in and impulsively makes a pre-emptive offer of 5 to 10 percent more than everybody else just to secure the deal."
After Thanksgiving, even the top of the market "went into a sort of depression due to the elections and economic worries," Mr. Henckels said. "But after the New Year we entered a very active market, much healthier and more balanced than the same time in the prior year, because there were more sellers who did not want to miss the peak of the market."
Price pressures were certainly reflected in the Elliman Report, which examined 8,799 co-op and condominium transactions.
Divining real estate trends by the numbers is, at best, a murky exercise. To begin with, co-op sales are not officially recorded because, technically, they are securities transactions involving the selling of shares, not transfers of title. Condominium sales, however, are officially recorded. As a result, studies of co-op data compiled by brokerage houses and appraisal concerns do not claim to include all transactions in the market, and can vary in their findings. At the same time, some market surveys report average prices, while others use a median -- meaning half the prices are above that figure and half below. Still, the numbers, along with anecdotal impressions, can serve as barometers of market patterns.
Asked about the Elliman Report's finding that the median price for Manhattan apartments jumped 50 percent last year, from $320,000 to $480,000, Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares the report, said: "There was this euphoria that correlated to the financial markets through the first half of the year, and people were afraid to be left behind; they were frantically trying to buy. So there were a lot of larger apartments sold during this period, which drove up the overall price."
While the Elliman Report showed that 595 fewer studio and one-bedroom apartments were sold last year, down from 5,126 in 1999, sales of higher-priced apartments with two, three and four or more bedrooms increased by 149, to 4,268 -- significantly raising the overall median.
The median price in 2000 for studios, Mr. Miller said, was $175,000, a 28.7 percent increase over $136,000 in 1999. For one-bedroom apartments, last year's median was $335,000, 28.8 percent higher than $260,000 in 1999.
For two-bedroom units, the median was $595,000 in 1999 and $775,000 in 2000, a hefty 30.3 percent jump. For three-bedrooms, the percentage rise was even higher, 31.7 percent, from $1,595,000 in 1999 to $2,100,000 last year. Only in the four-bedroom-or-more category was there some slippage, from $3,400,000 to $3,300,000. 
"So far this year," said Mr. Miller, "there's been a modest rise, a subtle uptick." The median Manhattan price in the first quarter of 2001, he said, was $497,500 -- 1.5 percent higher since December and 4.7 percent higher than during the same period last year.
"People have been second-guessing what's to come," said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran Group, one of Manhattan's largest brokerage firms. "The difference between last year and now is not that apartments are cheaper, but that buyers are disappointed because they thought they would see prices come down by now."
Ms. Corcoran cited a two-bedroom apartment -- "low floor, no views on Park Avenue in the 70's" -- that her company listed in October for $2 million. "October came and went; November, December, January, no bidders, no interest," she said. "Mid-February hit and we had three bidders, all single guys -- two Wall Streeters and one entertainment agent. They got into a bidding war over two days and the winner bought it for $2,250,000."
"There was no rhyme or reason to the quietness or the sudden interest," Ms. Corcoran said.

Manhattan
Prices Are Leaping All Over the Borough
The Real Estate Board of New York offered a site-specific assessment of the Manhattan market. Deborah Beck, the board's executive vice president, said that the median price for a prewar co-op or condominium on the East Side was $627,000 in 1999 and rose to $850,500 in 2000 -- a bounding 35.6 percent leap.
In the postwar market on the East Side, the median in 1999 was $375,000, and in 2000 it was $460,000, up 22.6 percent.
"On the West Side, the increases are also remarkable," Ms. Beck said. The median price for a prewar West Side apartment in 1999 was $345,000, "and it rose to $470,000 for 2000, or 36.2 percent," she said. "Postwar, it was $390,000 in '99, rising 26.6 percent to $494,000 in 2000."
Downtown, from 42nd Street to the Battery, she said, where the prewar condo-co-op median price was $485,500 in 1999, it rose by 18.4 percent last year to $575,000. The postwar price downtown was $288,000 in '99, rising to $320,000 in 2000, up 11.1 percent.
And in northern Manhattan, above 110th Street on the West Side and 96th Street on the East side, the real estate board recorded a median prewar price of $150,000 in '99, while last year that number rose to $225,000 -- 50 percent. The only exception to increasing values in northern Manhattan was the postwar category, where the 1999 median of $96,000 slipped 6.2 percent to $90,000 last year.
R. Kenyatta Punter, president of the Greater Harlem Board of Realtors, welcomes some price moderation. "Sort of like the higher you go, the harder you fall," he said. "We don't want prices to go like dot-coms and decline by 40 percent."
Citing an 1898 Victorian brownstone -- "five bedrooms, three full baths, original woodwork, six gas fireplaces on 20-by-55 lot" -- in Harlem's Hamilton Heights Historic District, Mr. Punter said it had listed in November for $1.1 million and is currently under contract at $775,000.
"I think it marks a shift in the marketplace," he said. "Things are starting to calm down. And I think it's healthy for the community, because values should not rise indiscriminately. Harlem is a community that is revitalizing, and in order for any community to flourish you need a proper economic and demographic mix."

Brooklyn
Beyond Brownstones, 'Realty Homes' Rise
There are three Brooklyn realtor groups that specialize in house-price data beyond that northwestern section commonly called "brownstone Brooklyn." And, as their names imply, they are fairly geographically specific: the South Shore, Mid-Island and Bay Ridge-Bensonhurst Multiple Listing Services.
With cooperation from his counterparts, the chairman of the South Shore listing service, Gerard Longo, gathered statistics from all three services. In his area, which he said covers the communities running west along the shore from Canarsie to Gravesend, Mr. Longo said the average price for one- to four-family homes sold in 2000 was $288,030, a 13.9 percent increase over the 1999 average of $252,880.
According to the Bay Ridge-Bensonhurst service, the average price for one- to four-family homes in those communities was $360,454 last year, a 12.3 percent jump from $320,976 in 1999.
And in the Mid-County area -- a band across the middle of the borough that includes, among other communities, Borough Park, Flatbush and East New York -- the average in 2000 was $238,388, up 10 percent from the 1999 average of $216,776. 
The pattern of price appreciation was also evident in the Case Shiller Weiss survey. The survey is based on an index showing the average price for all single-family homes sold, ZIP code by ZIP code in areas for which it has sufficient information, year by year. To determine price fluctuations in 2000, the survey took the purchase price of each home sold in each ZIP code area during the year, compared it with the price the house brought the last time it sold, and then, using the annual index, adjusted the earlier price to what it probably would have been had it sold in 1999. The 2000 prices for homes within each area were then compared with the estimated 1999 prices to compute the change.
Of the 36 ZIP codes in Brooklyn, 2 saw prices rise by 4 to 8 percent last year, 8 by 8 to 12 percent, and 26 by 12 percent or more.
Mr. Longo, who is also president of the Madison Estates brokerage firm in Marine Park, said Brooklyn "experienced a bit of flatlining during December and part of January, but that dramatically changed when we saw the drop in mortgage rates" -- after two half-point cuts in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in January, and not counting another half-point cut 17 days ago. Sales-volume data for the three Brooklyn listing services does show a 7.4 percent slippage, from 8,813 transactions in 1999 to 8,162 last year.
Mr. Longo didn't seem concerned. "In Marine Park," he said, "we have what we call realty homes; they carry the name of the development or the developer from 60-plus years ago." They are, generally, semidetached, two- or three-bedroom, 14-foot-wide, 34-foot-long houses on 20-by-100 lots.
"Over the years, people have completely updated them," Mr. Longo said. "We find them going in the neighborhood of $230,000, $240,000. It's amazing because these same homes only three years ago were going for $150,000 to $170,000."

Queens
Buyers Shrug Off Stock Gyrations
Of the 57 ZIP code areas in Queens, according to the Case Shiller survey, 12 saw prices appreciate by up to 4 percent last year, 18 by 4 to 8 percent, 23 by 8 to 12 percent and 4 by 12 percent or more.
"We still have low inventory, so prices haven't softened," said Barbara Frechter, president of Glenjay Realty in Forest Hills and a former president of the Long Island Board of Realtors, which includes Queens.
"The stock market thing does not affect the co-op people here, or the people buying a house at $300,000 to $350,000, the way it does the heavy rollers in Manhattan," she said.
The median price for all of Queens in 2000 was $200,000, up 5.2 percent from $190,000 in 1999, Ms. Frechter said. But in her community, Forest Hills, the 2000 median was up 24.5 percent, from $296,000 to $368,500.
"There are houses in Forest Hills Gardens that are a million and better," she said. "But for a one-bedroom co-op on Queens Boulevard, I'd say anywhere from $75,000 to $125,000. And, of course, we have luxury condos -- $300,000 for a two-bedroom."
The median price in Astoria, with its mix of single- and multifamily homes, rose 9.9 percent last year, from $299,450 to $329,000. And in Jamaica -- "where there are lots of one-family detached frame and attached brick homes," Ms. Frechter said -- the median rose 8.7 percent, from $149,999 to $163,000.

The Bronx
Manhattan Migrants Find Prices Attractive
The Bronx Board of Realtors does not compile complete statistics. But the Case Shiller survey indicated that of the borough's 25 ZIP codes, 11 saw prices appreciate by 8 to 12 percent and 14 by 12 percent or more.
And one broker, Haniff Baksh of ERA Besmatch, conducted his own survey, based on city records. During the first 11 months of 2000, there were 2,204 one- to four-family homes sold in the Bronx, and 2,487 in all of 1999. "So, pro-rated, there were 2,280 sales during the first 11 months of 1999," Mr. Baksh said, "virtually unchanged."
The average price for single-family homes in the borough was $236,000 last year, up 4.9 percent from $225,000. And for two-family homes, there was a 12.6 percent jump, from $198,000 to $223,000.
Using his own company's sales, sprinkled about the borough, Mr. Baksh waxed more site-specific. In the northeast Bronx, the average was $175,000 in 1999, and $192,000 in 2000, a 9.7 percent rise. And in more western environs, including Riverdale, the average for single-family homes jumped 19.6 percent, from $321,000 to $384,000.
Susan Goldy, president of the Riverdale brokerage firm that bears her name, said, "We're still getting people from Manhattan who can't afford there, and know they can qualitatively buy into much more here." 
For example, Ms. Goldy said: "There's a gracious stucco 1920 Mediterranean; archways, thick walls; four bedrooms, balconies, listed at $1,350,000. We're not getting bids above asking, but there's a lot of interest." Two-bedroom co-ops in the community "are basically running from $140,000 -- that would really be on the low side -- to maybe $335,000."

Staten Island
Despite Concerns, A Need for Housing
On Staten Island, according to Sandy Krueger, executive vice president of the borough's Board of Realtors, the average price for existing single-family homes in 2000 was $227,396, a 12.3 percent increase over $202,422 in 1999.
In West Brighton, a community of older colonial homes on the north shore, Mr. Krueger said, the average for a single-family home increased 17.6 percent, to $172,882 from $146,929.
And in Huguenot, an almost rural area on the south shore with old gabled homes graced by wraparound porches, there was a 10.4 percent increase, from $200,998 to $222,035.
For two-family homes across the island, the 2000 average was $278,875, a 9.3 percent rise from $255,044. And co-op prices took a bounding leap -- 30.1 percent -- from $47,211 to $61,458.
Of Staten Island's 12 ZIP code areas, according to the Case Shiller survey of single-family homes, 7 saw prices increase by 8 to 12 percent and 5 jumped by at least 12 percent.
Sophia Gibaldi, president of Abiding Real Estate in Dongan Hills and the new president of the Staten Island Board of Realtors, seemed well tuned to the tenor of, not just her island's, but the entire city's real estate market. "People are concerned," she said, "but there's still that need for housing."

HEADLINE: Crafts Center at Water Gap Hopes to Shave Growing Debt 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA KUEHL 

DATELINE: LAYTON 

 BODY:
FACED with turnover at the top and more than $200,000 in debt, Peters Valley Craftsmen in Sussex County is struggling to stay afloat.
 The crisis is a surprising reversal for the craft education center, which last year received a $126,000 grant from the State Council on the Arts along with praise for its "national reputation" and "strong staff." 
 "This is a very well-run organization," the council's grant review panel said -- one that has "turned around" the center's finances and reduced its deficit "significantly."
But in the past six months, two executive directors and the president of the Peters Valley board have resigned, while the non-profit center's debt has ballooned. 
Artists, utility companies and local businesses are among those awaiting payment, said the new executive director, Ken Pierson, who started last month.
"We are attempting to reach out to them and assure them that we are not going bankrupt," Mr. Pierson said. "We will pay."
In the meantime, he said, the center's summer workshops -- which draw participants and teachers from around the country to practice ceramics, fiber, woodworking and other arts and crafts -- will go forward despite the financial difficulties.
Money problems are nothing new to Peters Valley, founded in 1970 on National Park Service land in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.
"It's very natural for organizations, especially nonprofit ones, to struggle," said Kenneth Jones, who resigned as executive director in October.
Jim Whitman, the second vice president, said he joined the board in 1982, when Peters Valley was "in the dumpers."
"We got a crew together and got it out," Mr. Whitman said, "and then it's been up and down. It has never been smooth."
Joe Salsberry, the interim president, said he joined in "the last financial crisis" in 1996. "We sorted that out, got ourselves a new director," he said. "We were perking along there. For two years, anyway."
Mr. Jones said the current debt should be viewed alongside the successes of his tenure. He inherited a $110,000 deficit, he said, which he reduced to $23,000, if only briefly. He more than doubled the center's gross income, from about $425,000 in fiscal 1996 to about $875,000 last year. Enrollment, tuition income and foundation support all increased, he said.
"It was really an incredibly exciting and dynamic time," Mr. Jones said.
Board members said they were caught unawares by the size of the deficit. "Up until August of last year, we thought we were doing reasonably well," Mr. Salsberry said. But bad weather on the weekend of Sept. 23 and 24 jinxed the annual crafts fair. The fair usually makes about $25,000; instead, it lost about $5,000, said PieterJan Spijkerman, the board secretary. 
In addition, after Mr. Jones left, unpaid bills began to surface, board members said, and the deficit, which in the fall had been pegged at $180,000, grew to about $220,000.
Mr. Jones said he kept the board informed of all financial activity.
"Certainly, based on the information that has come to light, I would question that," Mr. Salsberry said.
Pat Nufrio, who resigned as board president in January, declined to comment on anything relating to Peters Valley. John Frisenda, who served briefly as the executive director after Mr. Jones, could not be reached for comment.
When the extent of the deficit became evident, board members said, the search for money began. Peters Valley received $10,000 from a foundation in New York, and an anonymous donor offered $20,000 as a match to other contributions. Mr. Pierson said he voluntarily waived a salary; each board member has agreed to give at least $1,000, Mr. Salsberry said.
But the highest hopes hang on emergency appeals to the arts council and to the center's other major supporter, the Dodge Foundation, which already granted Peters Valley $50,000 this fiscal year. Board members have asked for about $30,000 more from each, Mr. Spijkerman said.
Neither agency has announced a decision.
"We all feel very strongly that this place is capable of surviving," Mr. Spijkerman said. But without that extra help, he said, remaining afloat will be "very difficult proposition, in my opinion."
The National Park Service also is watching Peters Valley closely, and officials will meet with board members this week.
The craft center pays $12,600 a year into an escrow account that it draws upon to help maintain the 14 historic buildings within its boundaries. If it closed, the park service would be saddled with that upkeep, said Bill Halainen, the management assistant for the recreation area.
Board members said that, in retrospect, the organization grew too fast and became top-heavy with staff. "We were in a real growth spurt, but the income didn't keep up," Mr. Whitman said. The center has already cut staff, he said, and henceforth, "We're going to run lean and mean."

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for NICHOLAS R. LARDY; 
Will Business Suffer in a China Stalemate?

BYLINE:  By RICK GLADSTONE 

 BODY:
AS China's outrage escalated last week over the midair collision of a Chinese military jet and a United States Navy surveillance plane, fear of the repercussions grew, too, spilling over into the business world.
 The standoff unnerved some financial markets in Asia and complicated China's longstanding application to join the World Trade Organization. Thirty members of Congress, angered over China's detention of the spy plane and its crew, introduced legislation to revoke China's favored-nation trading status with the United States. And General Motors, one of the most heavily invested American companies in China, warned expatriate employees to take precautions to avoid any possible anti-American protests. 
 A downgrade in United States-China economic relations could be onerous for American corporations. Many have entered the Chinese market, enticed by its 1.2 billion consumers and growing prosperity. Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert who is interim director of the Brookings Institution's foreign policy studies program and the author of "China's Unfinished Economic Revolution" (Brookings Institution Press, 1998), said he was cautiously optimistic that the spy-plane affair would be resolved without longer-term damage, but he did not rule it out. He talked last Thursday about what could be next. RICK GLADSTONE

Q. How do you expect the United States-China standoff to end?

A. It's difficult to say. This is unique. If you look at what happened when we bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war, it was extremely tense. We were clearly at fault. It engendered a much harsher reaction. But it didn't have a significant effect on the commercial relationship, which seemed to move ahead on fairly even keel. This incident poses many difficulties, but they are not as difficult as Belgrade.
The worst-case scenario would be our failure to renew most-favored-nation status, which they now call normal trade relations. But I think the probability of that is very low.

Q. What is at stake in China for American business?

A. Almost unnoticed, China has become one of our largest export markets, one of the top 10. In the decade of the 1990's, exports by U.S. firms to China more than tripled. The only other country like that is Mexico. Compared with Japan, which of course has been declining, China is large and growing.
On the investment side, a number of firms have done extremely well. Coca-Cola has a share of the soft-drink market 15 times bigger than its nearest domestic competitor. Kodak has captured more than half the market for film and photographic paper. Kentucky Fried Chicken dominates fast food. 

Q. Are American companies making money on their investments in China?

A.Coca-Cola's operations in China have been profitable for more than a decade. Many foreign firms in China are making very large profits. Procter & Gamble, Volkswagen, the majority of foreign joint ventures in China are profitable. Quite frankly, there's a myth all too frequently circulated that all foreign firms in China aren't making money. It's simply not true.

Q. How do you rate the Bush administration's handling of this incident so far?

A. The administration has been very patient. It has given the Chinese government plenty of time to handle the crisis. No deadlines. That's all quite favorable, and takes into account the fact that decision-making in China is more cumbersome than you might expect.
But the incident also points out flaws this administration brought to office. It had announced repeatedly it was going to downgrade relations with China. We know one reason Bush hasn't called President Jiang Zemin of China is that the two have never met. Jiang is well aware that Bush called 25 other heads of state after he took office before he called him. The Chinese took that as a deliberate snub. Now we're finding that a personal phone call might have gone a long way to resolve this problem.

Q. The trade deficit with China is a sensitive issue here at home. Is it a problem?

A. Our exports grew more rapidly to China in the 1990's than to any other market. U.S. firms have enjoyed considerable success. The deficit has arisen because China has displaced other countries as a principal source of supply of labor-intensive commodities. In the 1980's, 60 percent of U.S. shoe imports were from Taiwan and South Korea, and 2 percent were from China. By the end of the 1990's, 60 percent were from China and 10 percent were from South Korea and Taiwan. So the rapid growth of the deficit with China is because imports have grown much more rapidly, but the adjustment has been in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. There has been very little displacement of U.S. workers.
We benefit enormously, quite frankly, from this deficit, because the cost to consumers here is much lower than if goods from China were still produced in other countries.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: STAPLETON; 
In Home Port Plan, a Park and Housing With Harbor Vu

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
A coal port. A film studio. A Formula One racetrack. A recreational complex that included a minor league hockey rink. A pier for gambling ships.
 Those are some of the proposals that the city's Economic Development Corporation has considered in the seven years it has been trying to find a developer for the 36-acre Navy Home Port, which is just south of the ferry terminal in Staten Island. 
 Some plans for the closed port, like the racetrack and gambling ships, sank because they angered nearby residents. The corporation turned down others because the developers, in its view, lacked the needed money or experience.
Now the corporation is making a proposal of its own: a 10-acre waterfront park and esplanade coupled with a long row of midsize apartment buildings and low-rise town houses.
The plan, which the corporation presented at a recent public meeting in St. George, has met with mixed reviews. "I could see it becoming a gated community," said Stephen Kaye, the president of the St. George Civic Association. "I prefer the idea of a film studio. They could use the buildings that are there, instead of tearing them down."
The report recommends demolishing the warehouse-sized structures the Navy left on the site. It calls for a restaurant, stores and recreational attractions, like a bandstand and a children's museum, on the base's long pier. The report says the project would probably take 7 to 10 years. The city would invest $13.6 million to improve the area's infrastructure. Private developers would spend about $131 million to build 535 units of new housing and a small hotel.
Cheryl Adolph, a local resident and president of the Mud Lane Society for the Renaissance of Stapleton, gave the plan her qualified support. "I'm not crazy about the town houses," she said. "But 500 families could be the economic infusion Stapleton needs."
Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, said the plan "is not cast in stone." She said the agency would consider the residents' views before drafting a final plan. She did not know when bids would be sought from developers. JIM O'GRADY

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
After theDownsizing, a Downward Spiral

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
FOR the generation of Americans who entered the work force after World War II, giant corporations like AT&T were the place to be, much like Microsoft has been the place to be in the last decade. In the quarter-century after the war, Ma Bell, General Motors and other staid blue chips represented the pinnacle of what capitalism had to offer workers because of the extraordinary job security and the cornucopia of benefits that these companies provided. 
 College graduates tripped over one another in the hope of securing lifetime careers with these corporate Rocks of Gibraltar. The security they offered meant a comfortable house, a generously financed retirement package and, more often than not, a 9-to-5 job that allowed that era's organization man to balance work and family. 
 It was a time when job security was a bedrock corporate principle. In 1962, Earl S. Willis, the manager of employee benefits at General Electric, wrote, "Maximizing employment security is a prime company goal." Later, he wrote, "The employee who can plan his economic future with reasonable certainty is an employer's most productive asset." 
"White-Collar Sweatshop: The Deterioration of Work and Its Rewards in Corporate America," (W. W. Norton, $26.95) gives a blow-by-blow account of how that era of beneficent employers and lifetime job security ended unceremoniously. With painful detail and depressing anecdote, the author, Jill Andresky Fraser, traces how corporate America's philosophy toward its white-collar workers has grown harsher and how the theories of G.E.'s Mr. Willis have given way to those of G.E.'s much-lionized John F. Welch Jr., who was once known as Neutron Jack for shedding 100,000 jobs at the company.
Put another way, Ms. Fraser's book describes the downside of downsizings and the underside of the 1990's economic boom.
At many companies, job security has gone the way of the mastodon. Swept up in what appears to be the latest managerial fad, the author says, many chief executives lay off thousands of workers, hoping that such moves will delight securities analysts and investors and nudge their stocks up 5 percent. Corporate managers, she writes, slash away at employee benefits as if the executives who ran the companies before them were wastrels who lavished too much on employees. Many companies have systematically increased health insurance premiums for their workers, reduced the range of health benefits and phased out defined-benefit retirement plans in favor of far less expensive 401(k)'s.
Ms. Fraser, the finance editor of Inc. magazine and a general editor of Bloomberg Personal Finance, has written an unrelentingly downbeat book that sees the economy's glass as three-quarters empty. She glosses over the record economic expansion, the stock market boom and the benefits that these developments have bestowed on millions of Americans. Instead, she focuses on what has happened to white-collar workers, and the picture she paints is grim. They are working harder, with less job security, less satisfaction and often less reward. 
Ms. Fraser sheds fresh and penetrating light on an important area that is often overlooked: the tribulations of white-collar workers. Much has been written about downsizing, but she broadens the literature in examining pervasive insecurity on the job, shrinking benefit packages, the rise of the temporary worker and the pitting of worker against worker in the downsizing game of musical chairs.
THE best parts of the book are her lengthy interviews with workers at respected companies, including AT&T, I.B.M. and Intel. Many of these white-collar workers were true believers in their companies, exemplary employees who for years enthusiastically worked 12 and 14 hours a day, six and seven days a week to make the deal, develop the software, whatever it took to ensure that their corporations were winners.
Despite their dedication, despite all the children's birthdays and bedtimes they missed, many were laid off in mergers, re-engineerings, right-sizings, downsizings and redeployments. Now many bitterly regret having been so dedicated, only to end up losing their jobs.
One downsized Procter & Gamble manager told the author: "Employees feel less loyal to a company, companies feel less loyal to an employee. Attitudes have changed. I don't know anyone who feels anymore, 'I love this place. I'm always going to be here.' Before, it used to be, 'I'm a Procter & Gamble person.' Now, it's 'I'm a Paul person,' or whatever your name is."
At first glance, the book's title seems unjustified. Aren't American white-collar workers some of the best-off, most cosseted workers? But Ms. Fraser makes a strong case that millions of white-collar workers -- bank managers, high-technology executives, retailing middle managers -- often work 90-hour and 100-hour weeks in pressure-cooker conditions. Many arrive at the office at 7 a.m. and leave at 9 p.m., passing many days without seeing their children. And when they get home, they often spend an hour or two answering e-mail messages. With their beepers, cell phones and hand-held computers, many of these workers seem happy to be tethered to work 24/7. 
The author describes one Intel senior manager who worked 16 hours a day and who noted ruefully that his wife started sleeping in a different bedroom for fear of waking him during the few hours he slept.
Ms. Fraser's central thesis is that something has gone wildly awry. In an era in which economic prosperity could have supported a better quality of life, she writes, many people instead lost the ability to relax, concentrate on their families and pursue leisure interests safe from workplace intrusions.
Too often, the book stumbles into overgeneralization. The author says patterns of overwork have become the norm. But most white-collar workers are not working 60-, 70- or 80-hour weeks. She suggests that the stock market's recent woes may be tied to the declining loyalty that many workers feel toward their companies. That may be, but she offers little proof. Her book would have been more balanced if it had fully examined how the workplaces she calls white-collar sweatshops have helped increase productivity and profits and made companies more competitive globally. 
IN A few passages, Ms. Fraser bites the hand that feeds her, criticizing the publishing industry for its many mergers and downsizings. Those editors who remain standing, she writes, are forced to rush out books without enough editing or supervision. Her book unintentionally underlines that point with some sentences that are ungrammatical or contain simple typographical errors: "It's hard to dispute the personal impact of the long (and seemingly endless) string of mergers, layoffs, and other human resources cutbacks that has occured among the nation's banks."
In searching for solutions, Ms. Fraser calls on employers to be kinder and gentler to their white-collar workers. She says workers might be more productive, not less, if given more job security and coddling. But if she is going to persuade companies, she has to make a more compelling case. She provides a sprinkling of anecdotes and studies, but not a mass of solid empirical data, in arguing that kinder and gentler policies can lead to greater productivity and profits. In this era of globalization and sliding stock markets, corporate managers will need more than high-minded nudging to change their ways.

HEADLINE: The Diamond Game, Shedding Its Mystery 

BYLINE:  By LAUREN WEBER 

 BODY:
ON a chilly February afternoon, about 45 diamond merchants and manufacturers gathered in the nondescript cafe at the Diamond Dealers Club, on the 10th floor of a building at 47th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Down the hall, at tables along the windows, dealers from around the world squinted into loupes and negotiated for stones. Wall clocks displayed the time in Mumbai, Tel Aviv, Antwerp, Johannesburg and Tokyo, all major diamond centers.
 The meeting had been called to discuss changes threatening the century-old structure of the diamond industry. The discussion, said Joseph Schlussel, a diamond dealer, always came back to the same questions: "How will I fit in in this new order? Where will I stand? Will I be left out?" 
 These are questions that everyone is asking, even the undisputed king of the industry, De Beers Consolidated Mines. With the weakening of De Beers's monopoly on uncut diamonds, rising competition and a new focus on marketing, the industry is undergoing a stark transformation. This famously secretive business is trying to shed that reputation and emerge, like a diamond from a cluster of carbon, as a modern, efficient luxury goods industry. 
And, in one risky move, intended to raise demand and escape from low profit margins, many in the industry are introducing branded diamonds.
In part, the new emphasis on marketing and branding comes from necessity. For the last few years, diamonds everywhere have been largely indistinguishable from the "blood diamonds" used by African rulers and rebels to finance their civil wars. Branding would help De Beers, which has promised not to buy such "conflict stones," cut that association.
As for branding, "customers don't know about this yet, but they will," said Victor Blechman, a retailer on 47th Street, sitting in a cramped booth filled with the tools of his trade -- the loupe eyepiece for judging diamond quality, tweezers for picking up stones, a phone for making deals and a box of loose gems.
Over the last year, several companies have rolled out designer diamonds that they hope will set them apart. Some have patented their designs, which usually involve an unusual number of facets or a new shape. But it is unclear whether diamond manufacturers have the means and the will to put large-scale marketing campaigns into place. Less clear still is whether consumers will pay a 10 percent to 15 percent premium for a diamond with a brand name attached.
No changes will be easy. The industry's very structure may prove to be its greatest obstacle. Dominated by small family companies, the diamond district in Manhattan, for example, has remained largely insulated from the Wall Street-driven trends of global capitalism. Spanning just a single block -- 47th Street from Fifth Avenue to the Avenue of the Americas -- the district is home to more than 2,600 businesses. It was, and in many ways still is, an anachronism, a 17th-century industry smack in the middle of a 21st-century city.
"It's an industry steeped in tradition," said Andrew Wagstaff, president of MVI Marketing, a diamond and jewelry consulting firm. "It is not sophisticated in a business and marketing sense."
Indeed, to hear the two principals of the William Goldberg Diamond Corporation argue over the future of the business is to witness two very different perspectives.
"I don't see that much change in our industry," said the chairman, William Goldberg, 75, who speaks of diamonds with the wonder normally reserved for one's children.
The president, his son Saul, is 45 and has another view. "There's a whole new way of thinking in our business," he said. "It's not the old-fashioned 'just sell diamonds.' " Now, he and others say, "diamantaires" -- as those in the industry are known -- must take their cues from consumers and find ways to differentiate themselves from rivals.
De Beers has reached the same conclusion. Over the last two decades, its control of the unpolished-diamond market has dropped from 80 percent to 65 percent as new mines owned by other companies in Australia and Canada increased world supply. In November, De Beers lost out to its rival Rio Tinto in its bid to buy 40 percent of Argyle, the world's largest mine, in the Kimberley region of western Australia.
In July, De Beers announced a sweeping reorganization. After an internal review by consultants from Bain & Company, De Beers said it would abandon its 112-year-old "supply management" model. Better known as "monopoly pricing" to United States antitrust officials, who indicted De Beers in a 1994 case that has yet to be resolved, this refers to De Beers's use of its dominance in rough diamonds to manipulate the global supply and keep prices high.
De Beers says it will no longer stockpile diamonds to create false scarcity. Instead, it now hopes to maintain stable (read: high) prices by raising overall demand through aggressive marketing.
Marketing is nothing new to the company that turned "a diamond is forever" into one of the world's most recognized advertising slogans and convinced eager suitors to spend two months' salary on an engagement ring.
What is new is the pressure that De Beers is exerting on its customers -- an elite group of 125 diamond-cutters and wholesalers known as sightholders -- to put their own resources into marketing. De Beers has asked -- some say ordered -- diamond companies to match the 10 percent ad-to-sales ratio common in luxury goods. Diamantaires now spend roughly 1 percent of revenue on advertising.
"Now, when I go to London and have a meeting with De Beers, we don't talk as much about diamonds anymore," Saul Goldberg said. "We talk about marketing and advertising and promotion. There's a whole new twist."
De Beers's generic ad campaigns, which benefited everyone in the industry, are no longer enough. It has told sightholders that it expects them collectively to match the $180 million that it will spend on marketing this year. Gary Ralfe, managing director of De Beers, said in an interview, "We are looking at clear and objective criteria for remaining a sightholder" -- financial strength and, for the first time, marketing skills. (Also for the first time, De Beers will require written contracts with sightholders rather than the traditional oral agreements.)
De Beers made clear that companies that fall short would be dropped, and thus denied access to its best stones. The official shakeout begins on July 12. To ease the process, sightholders -- most based in Antwerp, Belgium; Mumbai, India; Tel Aviv; and New York, which has 12 -- were asked to fill out surveys about marketing expenditures and plans. Sightholders "haven't told me they're frightened," Mr. Ralfe said, "but if you were to ask around in the marketplace, you'd probably find that they are."
THE July 12 deadline set off a scramble among sightholders to hire outside marketers, develop partnerships and create new ways to add value to what is, essentially, a commodity. It also added fire to the debate about branding. In an often-cited example of the creative marketing now demanded by De Beers, the Belgian sightholder Pluczenik Group teamed up with the fashion house Escada to create the Escada diamond, which made its debut late last year. The 12-sided Escada has 97 facets, far more than the usual 58. Since 1999, Tiffany has sold its Lucida diamond, Asprey & Garrard its Eternal diamond, and William Goldberg its Ashoka diamond.
In November, Leo Schachter Diamonds of New York unveiled its Leo diamond, a patented cut with 66 facets. A diamond is "a very generic product," said Elliot Tannenbaum, the principal at Schachter, who wanted to make his diamonds stand out. The decision to brand his stones came, he said, when "I looked into the future of my own company and I said, 'What gives us the right to exist?' "
The company began a print, radio and Internet ad campaign created by Lieber Levett Koenig Farese Babcock in New York, an agency specializing in direct marketing and relationship marketing. Schachter, one of the few diamond houses with revenue in the hundreds of millions of dollars, expects to spend $3 million to $5 million this year on marketing. "Just a few years ago," Mr. Tannenbaum said, "we were simply a loose-diamond company," buying rough stones from De Beers and polishing them for sale to jewelry manufacturers. But the Leo "will give us a competitive edge," he said.
Others are not as confident about the wisdom of branding, which puts enormous pressure on companies to invest heavily to develop and market a name. "This is completely new and unprecedented," said Debora Spar, a Harvard Business School professor who has written with grudging admiration about De Beers. "It's not clear it will work."
The status of a brand-name diamond may not be enough to encourage buyers to pay a premium, some in the industry say, because the new cuts, even the patented ones, are barely discernible from the basic 58-facet diamonds commonly offered by most everyone from Cartier to Wal-Mart. "You don't get the status value the way you do with a handbag or a scarf," Professor Spar said.
Ben Janowski, an industry consultant, said: "What's perfectly possible is that diamond firms will go and spend X amount of millions of dollars and impair their capital and not get very far. De Beers, in the end, may end up with customers that are somewhat weaker than they were two or three years before."
CONSUMERS may have the most to lose. Mr. Schlussel, the diamond dealer, dissents from the popular view that diamantaires should find creative ways to add value. "I think it's really reduction of value," he said. "The consumer will not get more diamond. He will get less diamond for his money, but he will get a nice package."
Mr. Tannenbaum and others respond that for most consumers, buying a diamond is fraught with anxiety and uncertainty. Brands add "another layer of confidence to a product where everybody feels so unsure," he said.
"It's just what consumers are asking for," he added.
The stakes moved up a notch earlier this year, when De Beers sent another seismic shock through the industry. In January, it announced a partnership with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods company, to sell diamond jewelry directly to consumers under the De Beers brand -- the first time a diamond miner will market directly to the public. "They did a triple bypass," Mr. Schlussel said. "They're going from the mine to the consumer and skipping the middlemen."
For a century, the industry has operated through a division of labor from mine to market known as the diamond pipeline. American producers and retailers are separated by layers of intermediaries -- mainly dealers and brokers who ply the back rooms and upstairs offices of 47th Street with pouches full of paper-wrapped diamonds. Millions of dollars in merchandise are turned over daily in a web of transactions. In one day, a diamond can move from one end of the street to the other, doubling in value after passing through seven or eight hands.
The De Beers-LVMH deal is the latest sign that distinctions along the pipeline are disappearing. "The whole structure seems to be totally collapsing," said Rob Bates, editor of New York Diamonds, a trade magazine. Another indication is that in 1999, Tiffany & Company invested $72 million in the Aber Diamond Corporation, a mining concern that owns 40 percent of Canada's Diavik diamond mine. It was the first time a retailer bought a stake in a mine.
Now sightholders and other large manufacturers are pursuing similar deals, acquiring cutting and distribution companies rather than farming out the work. Just in the last few years, Leo Schachter bought an Italian distribution company and a Belgian polishing company with a factory in Thailand.
Industry experts say the restructuring stems from increasing competitiveness, which is forcing companies to cut costs, raise efficiency and shore up profit margins. Those margins remain healthy at the mining and retail ends -- De Beers's net earnings rose 84 percent in 2000, to $1.29 billion, and Tiffany's rose 31 percent, to $190.6 million -- but manufacturers and other intermediaries complain of sinking margins.
It is difficult to know how seriously to take such complaints in an industry known for hyperbole and lament. Mr. Bates, whose grandfather was a diamantaire, joked that for diamond merchants, "there are two kinds of business -- terrible and worse than terrible."
But he acknowledged that recent times have been tough for the denizens of 47th Street, even as the diamond jewelry market soared to record heights during the decade-long economic boom in the United States. Domestic sales added up to almost $26 billion in 2000, nearly half the worldwide total. Despite the strong demand, prices have been pushed down by a variety of factors.
BECAUSE diamonds remain a commodity, like coal or corn, "they are very price-competitive within the industry," said Mr. Tannenbaum of Leo Schachter Diamonds. "That is what keeps margins relatively thin."
Manufacturers and retailers have also been hurt by the aggressive sales of lower-quality stones by chains and discounters like Wal-Mart, which recently announced plans to expand its diamond jewelry line. Internet retailers -- though less of a threat than many had feared -- do sell diamonds at 15 to 25 percent above wholesale, undercutting traditional retailers' higher markups, often 30 percent or more.
And, significantly, consumers have become more educated, especially about the "four C's" -- carat, cut, clarity and color -- which let them comparison-shop. That also puts pressure on retailers, and on manufacturers in turn, to lower prices.
Diamantaires keep their numbers to themselves, but Mr. Bates said margins of some reputable manufacturers went as low as 2 to 3 percent in the late 1990's. "You can keep money in the bank for more than that," he added.
Even for companies trying to adapt, through branding and vertical integration, the future is far from certain. The new strategies may prove a challenge in fundamental and unpredictable ways. Famously insular and secretive, the industry has been built for centuries on an ethos of family loyalty and unbreakable trust. Now, diamond companies are being compelled to allow outsiders into inner management.
"What we have in this industry is a system of kinship capitalism," said Dr. Martin Hochbaum, managing director of the Diamond Dealers Club. "Each company has its own unique culture."
But as companies metamorphose into modern corporations, they are working closely with marketers and ad agencies and entering alliances to bolster prospects for survival.
Over the last two years, William Goldberg Diamond has hired a branding specialist and a public relations firm. Goldberg and others in the industry say professional marketers are difficult to work with because they do not understand the specifics -- some would say eccentricities -- of the diamond world.
Companies that have chosen not to hire outside marketers are looking elsewhere for those skills. The Pluczenik-Escada deal is one example.
Or consider Hearts On Fire, a Boston company that was a pioneer in diamond branding. Its chief executive, Glenn Rothman, started marketing the Hearts On Fire cut in 1996 and has built it into a $40 million business. He is now in the final stages of a deal with one of the industry's largest sightholders that will give him access, he said, to "an enormous amount of raw material and production capacity." After De Beers's announcement of the July shakeout, he said, he "had offers from six other sightholders," each looking for instant brand equity.
WHILE most industry experts agree that diamantaires will never experience the mergers and acquisitions that have transformed other industries, the new partnerships will create challenges for companies that are used to making decisions based on what is best for the family in the long term. "It doesn't automatically follow that two firms will be twice as good together as they are separately," said Dr. Hochbaum of the dealers' club.
Dr. Hochbaum says that there are very pragmatic reasons for the industry to put aside its traditional suspicion of strangers. The industry has never developed "enough of a nucleus to do the work that's required in Washington, with the city government and with the media, in terms of reaching out." Few industries have so resisted government intervention, or even assistance, a legacy of the trade's segregation in the shtetls of Europe.
But that secrecy, and the lack of a cohesive and visible voice, now haunt the trade. In the last two years, just as De Beers and the world's diamantaires have tried to raise the public profile of their beguiling jewels, diamond-fueled African civil wars have appeared in headlines. The industry has been linked to images of toddlers whose limbs have been hacked off, and camps full of men and women who were terrorized and displaced by rebel armies.
Diamond dealers, cognizant of the hazing that the fur industry received several years ago, fear a consumer boycott. The trade has moved to contain the threat, by issuing statements and lobbying governments for swift action to end the violence. Even the nongovernmental organizations that are raising public awareness are impressed with the response. "They've been taking this extremely seriously," said Alex Yearsley, a spokesman for Global Witness, a London-based human rights group.
As new forces propel diamantaires into the public eye and into business relationships that require more transparency and accountability, a further question is raised: Will diamond companies eventually head into the equity markets in search of more capital, visibility and prestige? 
The experience of Lazare Kaplan may serve as a warning that trading on a stock exchange may be a bad move for companies that think in terms of generations, not the next earnings statement. Lazare Kaplan International, founded in 1903, went public in 1972. When the diamond market crashed in the early 1980's after a period of reckless speculation, the company spiraled toward bankruptcy. It was saved by the financier Maurice Tempelsman and his son, Leon. Today, three generations of the Kaplan family work at the company, but decision-making rests with the Tempelsmans.
In the ultimate warning sign, De Beers announced in February that it was being bought by its sister company Anglo-American; the Oppenheimer family, which has led De Beers since 1926; and Debswana, a mining company owned jointly by De Beers and the government of Botswana. In essence, the complex deal will put De Beers in private hands and end its century-long run as a public company. "Shareholders have immediate needs," said Andrew Lamont, De Beers's London spokesman. "But this is a business that lends itself to people who have a generational perspective."
AS the race heats up among diamond companies, many people in the industry see the next few years as a time of experimentation, but with high stakes. One man who took a gamble is Mayer Herz, treasurer of the Diamond Dealers Club. He left his family's diamond business in 1999 to become the vice president for diamond acquisition at Mondera.com, one of the few surviving Web sites selling diamonds. The other day, Mr. Herz, who straddles the old and new worlds with his Hasidic dress and his cell phone, his family legacy and his dot-com credentials, summed up the prospects of the diamond dealers.
"In one part of our lives, we do things the way they were done 2,000 years ago," he said. "We kind of have a tendency in the business world to do the same thing." The people who know how to divide that, he said, are the ones who will survive. "And it's not how big you are; it's how fast you are," he added. "If you're big and slow, you'll have problems. If you're small and fast, or big and fast, you'll find a niche."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
The BlindingPower of Data

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT 

 BODY:
THROW away the performance tables in this week's quarterly mutual funds report!
 I realize that this advice is unlikely to ingratiate me with people who calculate such data. Yet psychological research suggests that these performance tables are dangerous to your wealth. There is a good possibility that you will react to them in self-destructive ways. 
 The problem is not that the data are inaccurate. The danger derives from a combination of two other features. For a start, the tables report short-term performance -- periods as short as the last 90 days. Second, given the recent stock market decline, the majority of these short-term performances are losses.
That is a pernicious combination because, if you are a typical investor, your response to seeing that data will be to reduce your equity exposure. And that will affect your investment results not only for the next quarter or two but also over your lifetime. And that might well prove very expensive.
I am so confident predicting your likely reaction because this aspect of human behavior has been studied extensively in recent years. Two leading experts on this pattern are Shlomo Benartzi, an accounting professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, and Richard Thaler, a behavioral economist at the University of Chicago. They have called the behavior "myopic risk aversion."
This aversion is actually a combination of two behaviors. The first is a greater sensitivity to losses than to gains -- a sensitivity that, believe it or not, exists even when the stock market is at its most speculative. Put another way, the typical investor is more afraid of losses than excited about profits.
The second behavior is the tendency of investors to continually re-evaluate their performance. A related tendency is to focus on investment holdings individually instead of treating one's portfolio as an integrated whole.
These myopic behaviors greatly multiply the frequency with which investors experience loss, at least on paper.
To gauge whether you suffer from myopic risk aversion, consider whether you would be willing to play a game in which you win $200 if a coin flip comes up heads and lose $100 if it comes up tails. If you are like most everyone else, you would decline because you would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. (The author of this famous example is Paul Samuelson, the 1970 Nobel laureate in economics.)
But imagine that you are given 100 chances to play the game. Now you are probably willing, because the odds are excellent that you will come out a winner after so many flips. The key to being willing to play is focusing on all the flips as one game rather than as 100 individual games.
The coin-flip game is not unlike investing in stocks. Though stocks promise a superior long-term return, their short-term volatility is high. It is the rare portfolio that never holds stocks at a paper loss. The key to stock investing is to focus on your entire portfolio over the long term. If you focus on your individual holdings too often, you will not want to play the game.
That is the theory. To test whether it is an accurate description of investor behavior, Professor Thaler teamed up with three psychologists -- Amos Tversky of Stanford (who died in 1996), Daniel Kahneman of Princeton and Alan Schwartz of the University of Illinois at Chicago. They constructed an elaborate simulation of the decisions that one must make over a lifetime about one's relative allocation to stocks and cash. One set of subjects in their simulation could check how they were doing every month. Another group did so every year, and a third group only once every five years.
Just as the theory predicted, investors who looked at their performance most often had the lowest average equity exposure. Particularly noteworthy was the fact that these frequent checkers not only reduced their stock exposure immediately after a loss, but also had lower average equity exposures during all subsequent months, Professor Thaler and his colleagues found.
Unfortunately, because of the Internet, myopic risk aversion is likely to become even more common. The Internet lets investors check on their holdings effortlessly, as often as they want -- and investors are availing themselves of the opportunity. A survey conducted in January by Intuit/ Quicken.com found that 91 percent of online investors checked their portfolios' worth more than once a month. In fact, 13 percent checked it more than once a day.
What an odd situation. By making the process as easy as clicking a mouse, the Internet was supposed to make the stock market accessible to the masses. But to the extent that investors have myopic risk aversion, the Internet will reduce their exposure to equities.
How can you immunize yourself from myopic risk aversion? Keeping your eyes off the data is not very realistic. I can tell my daughter to sit in a corner and not think about pink elephants, but that is exactly what she will think about. The fact that investors can check their performance daily leads, almost inevitably, to their doing so.
 I RECOMMEND to clients a technique from Harry Browne, who used to write an investment newsletter called Harry Browne's Special Reports and who was the Libertarian Party candidate for president last fall. His advice is to divide your portfolio in two. The first part, containing the bulk of your assets, would be a so-called permanent portfolio whose composition would not change very often. The second would be a lesser portfolio in which you could speculate and trade to your heart's -- and psyche's -- content.
This approach has several virtues. Assuming that you allocate a relatively high portion of your permanent portfolio to equities and other risky assets, you will be largely protected from the effects of myopic risk aversion in your smaller, more actively traded portfolio. And it is psychologically realistic, because it recognizes that you want to check your results constantly, and to make frequent changes.
Finally, here is another helpful psychological trick: View the two parts of your portfolio as a competition. Your challenge is to do better over many years in your repeatedly checked and changeable portfolio than in your permanent one.
Good luck. The odds are against you.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE; 
It Takes a Village a Year To Unearth Local History

BYLINE:  By ANDREW FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
It started with an e-mail over the building list-serve: Does anybody know the history of Park West Village? Winifred Armstrong, a resident of 30 years, knew some of it, and wrote back, and then gave a lecture on the subject. That was how, a year ago, some Park West Village residents turned into amateur historians, pursuing the story of the black neighborhood that existed there until their complex was built in the 50's.
 The old community, dating from at least the early 20th century, was centered on 99th Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, now a parking lot and a playground. That stretch of street was literally buried under Park West by one of Robert Moses' slum-clearance projects. The removal of the residents provides one of the most harrowing sections in "The Power Broker," Robert A. Caro's biography of Moses. 
 The residents say their research shows the community was no slum at all. Early on, they met Jim Torain, who grew up on 99th Street and now lives in the Bronx. "It was an active, thriving, prideful, intelligent place," he said. "We were all interconnected."
He showed the new residents photographs of the old tenement stoops running down to the Ninth Avenue el, and told them about Coma's, the Greek grocer that gave out friendly credit, the spring dances, the Condor and Python athletic clubs, the Reliable bar, Castle's candy shop, and St. Jude's, the Episcopal chapel. 
Mr. Torain said that Billie Holiday's mother had run a restaurant on 99th Street, and that the doo-wop singer Earl Lewis, the actress Butterfly McQueen, who played Scarlett O'Hara's maid in "Gone With the Wind," and James Earl Jones's father had all lived there. Some former residents still hold yearly reunions, he said. 
Many others have come forward, offering their stories. So the residents of the housing complex that swept away a bustling neighborhood pursue the history of that buried community. As tenants faci g gentrification and escalating rents, they see connecting with the past as a tool for present battles.
"We create our own history," said Ms. Armstrong, who works as an ecological economist at the Regional Plan Association. "The neighborhood has been vibrant and it is vibrant." ANDREW FRIEDMAN

HEADLINE: Health Coverage For All Americans 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It is shocking that President Bush's budget would gut the financing for health care access for the uninsured, specifically community access programs, especially after he campaigned in favor of expanding community and migrant health centers (front page, April 4). 
 Nearly 43 million Americans have no coverage at all. 
Some 30 million Americans are underinsured; when serious illness strikes, gaps in their coverage leave them with devastating out-of-pocket expenses. Employers are shifting more costs to employees as health costs spiral. With the economy softening, some employers may drop coverage, and many millions of newly unemployed people will be unable to afford to keep their coverage. 
Congress should address the critical issue of providing all consumers with affordable, quality health coverage.

HEADLINE: Budget Impasse in Albany 

 BODY:
Another New York State budget deadline flew by on April 1 in Albany, with Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature locked in a familiar impasse. As usual, Mr. Pataki wants to spend less and the Democratic-controlled Assembly wants to spend more, particularly for schools in New York City and other poor districts. This year, however, two new factors are in play. First is the urgent need to aid city schools to satisfy a court order calling for drastic increases in education spending. A second, trickier factor is a new sense of gloom shadowing the economy, raising worries about whether the extra money will be available for schools or any other programs. 
 The governor's original budget would rise to $83.6 billion for the new fiscal year, an increase of 3.6 percent in the part of the budget financed with state taxes. Led by Speaker Sheldon Silver, the Assembly wants to increase the budget to $86 billion, an additional 2.7 percent. Assembly budget aides say there is no sign yet of sharp decreases in the growth of state revenues, which may be true. The Assembly may be correct to want more spending, but prudence suggests that it might want to moderate its requests. 
 Mr. Silver is right, however, to insist that education aid be increased as much as possible, and that it be targeted more precisely to help New York City and other districts with poor schools. His ambitious plan would lock in $1.7 billion in school spending growth in each of the next two years, concentrating 70 percent of it on districts with the greatest need. His proposal is a constructive response to the order last January for more state aid from Justice Leland DeGrasse. It would commit the state to greater financing for early childhood programs, reduction of class size, teacher training and repair and maintenance of schools. These are worthy goals that should be at the center of any budget negotiation.
Mr. Pataki and Senator Joseph Bruno, leader of the Republican-controlled State Senate, charge that Mr. Silver is underestimating the amount of spending his programs would entail. They also do not want him to enact multiyear spending commitments, even though school boards all around the state want greater reliability in spending. The governor has an added incentive for wanting more flexibility down the road. Since he plans to run for re-election next year, he wants to make sure there is enough money salted away in reserves in case state receipts plummet in the wake of a bad economy. But school aid is not the only cause of potential budget problems. The governor should also rethink the next scheduled increase in the state's aid program that is designed to lower taxes in the suburbs.
There is no early sign of resolving the Albany impasse. But all Albany leaders need to recognize that there is no greater need this year than New York City's troubled schools.

HEADLINE: The World: Flying Blind; 
The Cold War Left No Maps for This Face-Off

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
AS tempers rose over the spy plane standoff last week, Pentagon officials made a tactical decision. They put off an announcement that they were going ahead with plans to buy from China more than half a million new black berets for the Army.
 It was a telling if minor moment in the unfamiliar world of 21st-century international relations. The new century's most important and confusing big-power dance will, arguably, be between the United States and China. And as events have proved time and again, it is unlikely to be dominated either by friendship or enmity, making it unlike the foreign relationships that Americans were accustomed to for virtually all the 20th century. Can anyone imagine the Pentagon of 1970 buying army supplies from the Soviet Union? 
 "Americans only know one international pattern, cold war or friendship," said Robert S. Ross, a foreign policy specialist at Boston College who happened to be in Beijing last week during the standoff. But neither path, many experts argue, is inevitable or perhaps even likely with China -- or, indeed, with other nations, as complex and ambivalent ties become the norm in a world with a globalized economy and one true superpower. 
"Everyone needs to start realizing that this is IT," said Mr. Ross, referring to the mix of tensions, small breakthroughs and crises that has characterized Chinese-American relations since the Soviet empire fell.
Nasty encounters like the one on the Chinese island of Hainan have fed talk about the possibility of a new cold war, this time pitting the United States, guarding its global position, against an increasingly wealthy and well-armed China, seeking respect and influence. Indeed, the mid-air mishap and its aftermath brought to mind the Soviet Union's downing of a U-2 spy plane in 1960 and the jailing of its pilot, Francis Gary Powers.
But the differences between then and now are vastly greater than the similarities. They have been apparent in the calibrated postures of the American and Chinese governments as each sought to resolve the Hainan incident without losing face, but also without jeopardizing their huge and growing economic ties -- precisely the kind of glue that did not bind the United States and the Soviet Union.
Their legal theories and early public statements aside, chagrined American officials resigned themselves to the loss of the aircraft and any technological secrets that remained on board: China's military was not about to pass up the unexpected manna from above, nor did anyone really expect it to.
Yet, even as American leaders hinted early in the week at dark consequences if the crew were not quickly released -- trade relations, weapons sales to Taiwan and China's heartfelt bid to host the Olympics are all still up in the air -- and even as the Chinese made angry demands for a national apology, both sides also stressed a desire for friendly relations and a negotiated outcome.
For more than a decade, American-Chinese relations have normally been characterized as in transition toward some ultimate state of good or bad. For a brief time, around President Clinton's back-slapping China visit in 1998, the wishful thinking was of a "strategic partnership." When the Taiwan issue heats up, or an unforeseen event like the bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade occurs, latent hostilities and fears pop up on both sides and the talk turns to inevitable military and economic competition, of "containment" and cold war.
But cases like the spy plane incident may be less an indication of relations going awry than a characteristic event of the era, containing all the contradictions of a relationship fraught with good reasons for partnership and good reasons for rivalry. Those opposing forces can never be fully reconciled, but must be lived with.
Wrong assumptions about U.S.-China relations are costly. Expecting warm ties yields disappointment and betrayal; expecting inevitable conflict courts a self-fulfilling enmity.
Many experts think that the vision to be nurtured these days is of a more ambiguous, less satisfying but still fruitful relationship. It is one that may come more easily to Europeans, who have long survived with uncertain neighbors and contradictory goals, than to either Americans or Chinese. American perceptions of global involvement were framed in the friend-or-foe context of two world wars and the cold war; the Chinese remain obsessed with a history of colonial humiliation that still shapes all encounters with the West.
"The United States and China have the defining great-power relationship of the first half of the 21st century," Mr. Ross said. "We'll never really be friends. But we can work to optimize exchanges and trade, and to avoid big crises and war."
Taiwan is the great exception and the great danger. Human rights, trade practices, even downed aircraft can be argued over and endured. But the Taiwan issue has real potential to embroil Washington and Beijing in years of destructive tensions or even a hot war.
With deft policies on all sides, the Taiwan issue too can limp along indefinitely, never resolved but never exploding, many Western and Chinese experts say. The Chinese government's periodic outbursts of belligerence have never laid down an absolute reunification deadline. Instead, from Beijing's viewpoint, they have deterred the worst outcome -- a declaration of independence followed by war.
Chu Shulong, a specialist in Chinese-United States relations at the government-run Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations, says: "I don't believe there will e a cold war because the United States and China do not have any major, fundamental conflicts of national interest, except for Taiwan. And even in that case, there appears to be enough common ground to avoid hostilities."
"The Soviet Union tried to compete with the United States strategically, geographically, and ideologically over the whole world," Mr. Chu said. "China has no intention of competing with the U.S. globally." Even in Asia, he said, diplomatic cooperation has recently been common in places like the Koreas and East Timor.
"We can't deny the possibility of more conflict if hard-liners in the United States or China -- those who see the other mainly as a threat -- become the mainstream," Mr. Chu said. "But that doesn't appear likely."
Mr. Chu, like many Chinese experts, may be underestimating the extent to which China's own rising power will automatically widen Beijing's notions of its rights and interests, frighten its Asian neighbors and stoke fears in Washington. Certainly in the case of Taiwan, China's increase in threatening missiles and other offensive weapons will trigger more American transfers of advanced weapons.
Mr. Chu, though, notes that China cannot possibly catch up with the United States economically, technologically or militarily for many decades. This contrasts with American perceptions, at the height of the cold war, of great Soviet strength, and it insures a different dynamic in relations. Moreover, Mr. Chu believes, the coming generation of Chinese intellectuals and political leaders is firmly wedded to globalization, interdependence and the primacy of China's economic advancement.
As for the bumpy road of United States-China relations, well, there is no reason to think it will be easy. The two powers, one riding high around the globe and proud of its muscle, the other seeking a new status in Asia and the world but aware of its relative weakness, would have frictions in any case. Clashes like that over the spy plane are intensified by what the Chinese see as American arrogance, and by what Americans see as China's hyper-sensitivity. 
The Chinese have already heard Mr. Bush, in his campaign, bash them as a "strategic competitor," threaten to sell the most advanced defensive systems to Taiwan and pledge to build national missile defenses that could negate China's small nuclear forces, noted Andrew Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University. "So in the current crisis, for Chinese leaders to act like a doormat would be to send the wrong message," he said. "They don't want a major crisis, but they do want to use the occasion presented by this accident to remind the Bush administration that 'We're here, we're a major power, we are not to be treated like a second-rate country.' "
Potentially dangerous confrontations are, of course, best avoided, but they do provide a kind of practice for the frustrations ahead.
The Chinese, emerging from a self-imposed shell, are still learning the game and the United States seems to learn diplomatic lessons over and over again. Mr. Bush was elected with the strong support of conservatives and neo-cold warriors who are suspicious of China inclined to "get tough." So, Mr. Ross, says, "Bush is repeating the pattern of new administrations with China -- you go to the extremes and get knocked back to the center.
"It would be nice," he said, "if we could overcome that."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
A Hue, and a Cry, In the Heartland

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS

 BODY:
THE last of the state population figures from the 2000 census have been made public, creating a new picture of the nation. Details are still fuzzy, but the broad outlines are clear: Hispanic and Asian immigrants -- and more important, their children and grandchildren -- are remaking small towns and big cities across the American heartland.
 This means explosive issues like public services for illegal immigrants and bilingual education, which detonated over the past decade in California and a handful of other states, now affect communities in Iowa and Nevada. The exploitation of immigrant workers, once associated with New York City sweatshops or West Coast agribusiness, is on the agenda of towns in West Virginia and Georgia. And the question of how to integrate people from diverse backgrounds and colors into the American mainstream is debated everywhere, because immigrant families have settled just about everywhere. 
 In many states, there are already signs of public unease over the role of immigration in crowding schools, burdening hospitals and depressing wages. It may not take much to turn those worries into a nativist backlash. Paroxysms of anti-immigrant fervor, after all, usually accompany recession. Historically it starts with calls for a crackdown on illegal immigrants and sometimes, indeed as recently as 1996, the backlash produces laws that take services away not only from illegal but also from legal noncitizens.
The 2000 census figures have put illegal immigrants in the public policy spotlight.
Larger-than-expected census figures for the number of Hispanics in the country have led some anlysts to conclude that the number of illegal immigrants had also been underestimated. The accepted view prior to the census was that about 6.5 million people, or one-quarter of the foreign-born population, were in the country illegally. Experts now say the illegal population may range from 7.1 to 9 million people.
"At some level, the politicians and public will become intolerant of the presence of so many undocumented immigrants," said Jeffrey S. Passel, an analyst at the Urban Institute who recently revised upwards his estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the nation. With the number much higher than previously thought, Mr. Passel added, intolerance could emerge far sooner.
Only a few years ago, resentment of illegal immigrants in California led to a backlash that crystallized into support for Proposition 187, which barred the children of illegal immigrants from public service and sought other restrictions. Congress also took a crack at immigrants, passing laws in 1996 that eliminated benefits even for legal immigrants who had not become citizens.
California demonstrated that a backlash can become whiplash for politicians who ride an anti-immigrant wave. Take the case of California Governor Pete Wilson, who saw his support for Proposition 187 turn into a liability when Latinos ultimately mobilized against him and other Republicans. George W. Bush, who did relatively well with Latino voters in many states, had a disappointing showing among California Latinos in the 2000 race.
While an anti-immigrant stand proved a liability for politicians in heavily-immigrant states, immigration is becoming a tempting target again.
IN Texas, with its history of absorbing newcomers from Mexico and Latin America, the lieutenant governor recently complained that illegal immigrants are "clogging" schools and hospitals. He was roundly criticized by Latino activists. But his demand that the federal government help pay the costs of illegal immigration is a harbinger of how the anti-immigrant debate is likely to unfold.
So if officials in Texas raise questions about the burdens of immigrants, what can be expected of politicians in places just getting used to immigrants? The answer, so far, is ambivalence.
When the governor of Iowa started talking recently about creating incentives to attract immigrants to fill factory jobs, the state legislature began considering an English-only law that is seen by some as an attack on immigrants. A number of governors have trekked to Mexico to find ways to bring in Mexican workers. At the same time, however, officials in those same states are demanding that the Immigration and Naturalization Service come and check all immigrants to make sure they are legal.
A similar dynamic is at work in the labor market. Nationally, organized labor has acknowledged its ranks must be replenished by immigrants and has embraced immigrant causes. But, in individual cities and towns, unions can be fickle allies. Bowing to union pressure, for example, West Virginia's governor barred any company using illegal workers from getting state contracts.
It may not be that more people are entering the country illegally, but that more are staying once they arrive. Stepped-up controls on the borders, stiff new penalties for those who try to reenter the country after an illegal stay and other restrictive laws may now have slowed the traditional shuttle between home countries and the United States.
"There are clearly a lot more people staying and a lot less back and forth as time goes by," said Frank D. Bean, the director of the Center for Research on Immigration, Population Dynamics and Public Policy at the University of California at Irvine. 
But punishing immigrants -- legal or illegal -- does not bring clear-cut results. 
Consider the composition of immigrant families. More than half of the American households headed by noncitizens -- that is, legal and illegal immigrants -- contain children, according to a 1999 study by the Urban Institute. Significantly, three-quarters of those children are American citizens.
AN intertwining of immigrants and citizens can be found as much in the economy as in society, said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "They're becoming imbedded in every labor market sector, in a mutual dependence so deep that you cannot extricate yourself from it," he said.
And this is no longer a problem for just a few regions but for the entire nation. "The dispersion of immigrants," said Dr. Papademetriou, "will be a transforming event for the way we understand, study and talk politically about immigration for years to come."

HEADLINE: The World; 
Japan Learns the Sun May Not Come Out Tomorrow

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
LITTLE more than a decade ago, Japan still had the gleaming look of one of history's greatest economic success stories.
 Its economy, fully recovered from World War II, was propelling Asia so strongly that Japanese confidently described the region as a flock of geese following in its wake. For many people here, the question wasn't whether Japan would overtake the United States as the world's largest economy, but when. 
 Rarely have the assumptions about a major nation's trajectory changed so drastically. Now, after 11 years of unrelenting decline, the desire by Japan's neighbors to follow its model have been replaced by dismay over its decay. 
Most tellingly, instead of talking about overtaking the United States, the Japanese now look over their shoulders in growing horror, wondering not if, but when their country will be eclipsed by China.
It is worth recalling amid all of the gloom here that conventional wisdom about Japan has often been dead wrong. In the late 1950's, no less an authority than Edwin O. Reischauer, America's pre-eminent postwar expert on Japan, is said to have worried that the country would never manage to export enough to develop its economy. 
Even now, many of Japan's economic assets remain surprisingly strong. Not the least of them are manufacturing skills that still lead the world in old industries, like cars, and in newer ones, from industrial robots to esoteric lasers. Then there is the country's sheer financial wealth. Japan alone accounts for about one-third of the world's savings, according to some estimates.
"When we remember that Japan runs a large surplus in almost every tradable manufactured product, Japanese manufacturers pay some of the highest wages in the world, and nations with lower wage costs like the United States are rapidly increasing their trade deficits with Japan in high-tech goods, it is surely obvious that the Japanese economy is one of the strongest in the world, particularly judged by the yardsticks that matter to Japanese policy makers," wrote Eamonn Fingleton in a recent book about the global economy, "In Praise of Hard Industries"(Houghton Mifflin, 1999). "Japan's very different economy should be judged by Japanese objectives, and not Western ones."
Nowadays, though, such arguments run into serious objections from the Japanese themselves. Writing about this century in an essay in the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Yukichi Amano, a prominent commentator, recently said, "For good or ill, it will be a century in which what we built up with great pains in the 20th century will crumble away."
"The best measure of wealth is money and time," he added. "Measured this way, today's Japanese are rich but too busy to have good time. But the 21st century will make them a poor people with plenty of free time."
If it seems rash to write Japan off altogether as a global economic leader, the trends that underpin such deep pessimism are unmistakably stark. For one, the most basic raw ingredient in economic power -- people themselves -- is probably Japan's biggest vulnerability.
Its population is both aging and shrinking. The average household size in Tokyo is about to sink below two people, according to a recent report by the municipal government. The number of Japanese of working age peaked at 87 million in 1995, and is, according to official projections, set to decline to 55 million by 2050 -- a 37 percent drop.
Add to that the strong rise of new and revived competitors almost everywhere the Japanese look, and it becomes easy to understand why many Japanese feel gloomy. The landscape runs from Asia's so-called tigers to India and especially China next door, and on to the United States, whose companies are making huge inroads in Japan's franchise in consumer electronics.
JAPAN runs growing trade deficits with China, and now imports more from Asia than it does from North America and Europe combined. What is worse, other Asians are increasingly producing -- more cheaply and sometimes more quickly -- the kinds of sophisticated goods that made Japan rich. While those countries eat away at Japanese manufacturing from below, this country, at least since the advent of the personal computer, has had difficulty moving up the industrial food chain through the invention or perfection of new products. More often than not nowadays, it finds America's high-tech companies blocking its way.
"Japan is already not a considered source for manufacturing when it comes to new product development for the New Economy," said Zachary Pessin, an associate with CTR Ventures, an investment firm that focuses on start-up companies here. "It may be a producer of systems which can be used to service the New Economy, but wholesaling machinery is one step lower on the value chain than doing the actual production of new revolutionary products which create new markets and enjoy large margins."
As Japan prepares to choose its eighth prime minister since 1990, many people are concluding that the country's economic problems are at heart more political than the traditional hand-wringing over slow growth and low productivity suggest.
A study of global trends released by the Central Intelligence Agency in December described Japan as a virtually rudderless nation tht "will have difficulty maintaining its current position" in the world. 
In fact, many experts in Japanese affairs are increasingly invoking a lack of democratic debate and alternatives as the country's principal source of weakness. The situation is best captured by the fact that the Liberal Democratic Party has been in power almost without interruption since 1955.
"EVEN now, with a prime minister whose popularity rating is at a historic low, and with the Liberal Democrats attracting only about 20 percent voter support, few Japanese are clamoring for change and strong rivals for the Liberal Democrats have yet to emerge.
Japan is a virtual one-party state, and it is the only industrialized economy that you can say that about," said Richard Katz, an economist and author of "Japan, the System that Soured"(M. E. Sharpe, 1998). "People are always expecting the very people who wrecked the economy to fix it. Rather than the fluid change that comes with alternation, problems build up for a long time until there is a wholesale change. It works, but it works differently."

Putting a Price Tag On the Priceless

BYLINE:  By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
RADON in our houses. Salmonella in our food. Diesel exhaust in the air. Everywhere, there's a toxic threat, and periodically a new one erupts into the headlines. 
 This time, it's arsenic in drinking water. The Clinton administration had set a new standard of 10 parts per billion -- down from 50 parts per billion. But a few weeks ago, Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced she intended to withdraw the change, pending further study. 
 Her decision set off an uproar. But the setting of environmental standards is as much art as science, one that entails innumerable assumptions about risks, costs and benefits. And they all come down to the ultimate in value judgments: How much is the possibility of saving one life worth? 
In 1996, the E.P.A. asked the National Academy of Sciences to advise it on safe levels of arsenic, which occurs naturally in soil, rocks, water, plants and animals and also is an industrial byproduct. High levels of it in water are found in Western states, the Midwest and New England. 
"The interesting thing about arsenic is that it's so ubiquitous in the environment," said Dr. Michael Gallo, a professor of environmental and community medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, N.J. "God put it there in her wisdom." Dr. Gallo said.
To determine what levels are dangerous, said Dr. Robert Goyer, an emeritus professor of pathology who led the National Academy committee, "you have to find a population that is stable and that consumes water with a known amount of arsenic." And that, he said, "is hard to do." 
With most toxic substances, scientists rely on extrapolations from what happens when laboratory animals are given immense doses of toxic substances to what might happen when humans are exposed to low levels. Arsenic was a rare instance in which there was some human data, especially for assessing bladder cancer rates.
The best information came from Taiwan, Dr. Goyer said. There, 80,000 people consumed 400 to 1000 parts per billion of arsenic in their water -- a level 8 to 20 times higher than acceptable in this country. The Taiwanese and smaller groups in the Andes with similarly high levels in their water, had increased bladder, lung and kidney cancers. The committee noted that arsenic's effects might vary with genetic makeup, diet and general health. Still the data were far better than usual for risk assessors.
THE next step was statistical modeling to estimate risks at lower levels of arsenic. The committee concluded that the standard of 50 parts per billion was too high and could cause cancer. The National Academy committee, however, did not advise the E.P.A. on what would be a safe level. "We weren't asked to set a level," Dr. Goyer said. "Just what is an acceptable level for public health is a matter of public policy." 
Dr. David Eaton, the incoming president of the Society of Toxicology and the associate dean for research in the University of Washington's School of Public Health explained: "You want a level that protects the public health adequately. Of course, that's a value judgment right there." The problem, he says, is that the lower the level, the more water supplies will be out of compliance and the more money must be spent. 
In setting a standard of 10 parts per billion, the E.P.A. and its former administrator, Carol M. Browner, estimated the average annual cost per household with water that needed treatment would be $32. This would prevent an estimated 37 to 56 cases of bladder and lung cancer annually and 21 to 30 deaths.
Dr. Bruce J. Kelman, a toxicologist at GlobalTox, a consulting firm, said: "An extra $32 a year to eliminate an absolutely minuscule number of cancers and deaths? On top of which, those numbers, when they're that tiny, have a lot of uncertainty in them. I'll put a dollar on the table, and I'm not a betting man, that they're not statistically different from zero."
Most European countries have set their maximum arsenic levels at 20 parts per billion in water, Dr. Goyer said. (The World Health Organization recommends a level in water of 10.) At 20 parts per billion, the E.P.A. estimated, 19 to 20 bladder and lung cancer cases and 10 to 11 deaths a year would be prevented. But the cost would be less than half of the cost of reaching 10 parts per billion. If the level was 5 parts per billion, 51 to 100 bladder and lung cancer cases and 29 to 54 deaths would be prevented. But the cost would soar to more than double the cost of 10 parts per billion.
"As you go to lower and lower levels, the cost go up more than proportionately," said Dr. John Evans, an expert in risk assessment at the Harvard School of Public Health who was a member of the science board that advised the E.P.A. on arsenic during the Clinton administration. "Someone has to make a call on when it's too expensive."
The question for policy makers is: How much is it worth to individuals to reach any particular level? 
Dr. Kelman said the dilemmas were made clear to him years ago at a meeting on lead standards with officials from the E.P.A. and the National Institutes of Health.
"They were talking about eliminating lead in faucets and they're down to very low levels," he said. "The economic impact came up at this meeting and it was very large. From my standpoint as a scientist, I realized that well nourished kids absorb less lead. So, being pretty naive, I said, 'Why not take the money that the E.P.A. is talking about for lowering lead in drinking water and putting it into nourishing inner city kids?"'
The E.P.A. said it didn't feed children; the N.I.H. said it didn't have the money. "It was a classic federal impasse," Dr. Kelman said. "At which point I figured I'd better sit down and shut up."

Familiar Feeling as Second Quarter Starts

BYLINE:  By JACK LYNCH 

 BODY:
The stock market experienced the same turmoil in the opening week of the second quarter as it did throughout the first quarter.
 Prices plunged the first two days on a relentless wave of corporate profit warnings. 
Then the market staged a remarkably strong rally on Thursday. But Friday, the bear market resumed. Investors were unnerved by more disappointing earnings forecasts as well as by an unexpectedly dismal March employment report, showing the biggest loss of jobs in nearly a decade. Adding to their worries was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas and Electric. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 9,791.09, down 87.69 points or 0.9 percent for the week and down 9.2 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite finished at 1,720.36, down 119.9 points or 6.5 percent for the week and down 30.4 percent for the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended at 1,128.43, down 31.9 points or 2.7 percent for the week and down 14.5 percent for the year. 
 Treasury securities improved, reflecting economic data that showed the economy was weakening. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.88 percent from 4.91 percent a week ago. JACK LYNCH

Gain for Entrepreneurial Women

 BODY:
The 1990's were good to women with an entrepreneurial spirit. 
 From 1992 to 1997 alone, the number of businesses with women as the majority owners increased 16 percent, to 5.4 million, according to a Census Bureau report released last week. Revenue generated from those businesses rose 33 percent during that period, to $818.7 billion, the report said. 
 The numbers were based on a survey separate from the 2000 census.
The American Business Women's Association in Kansas City, Mo., said the report offered a promising glimpse into the state of businesses owned by women. It attributed the increase in women-owned businesses to a strong economy and gains in education among women over the last decade.

To the Editor:
 Re "How Did They Value Stocks? Count the Absurd Ways," (March 18), which discussed how analysts threw away traditional valuation measures on new-economy stocks: 
 An important characteristic of the new economy is the rapidly growing base of intangible forms of production capital like proprietary technologies and customer and supplier relationships. 
Conventional financial reporting treats investment in these internally generated, intangible sources of income as current expense, excluding them from balance sheets. A result is a continuing deterioration in the quality and relevance of information available for financial analysis and management decisions. 
Unfortunately, rather than developing rigorous analytical techniques, many analysts and corporate executives have taken advantage of this information vacuum to seduce a gullible public into investing in hot air. While the new economy calls for new approaches to valuing stocks and to corporate decision-making, serious responses have been irresponsibly scarce.

 After reading about the strange valuation methods for dot-com stocks, I think we need a similar, but before-the-fact explanation of the "absurd ways" that the Bush administration's tax cut is being presented. I'm afraid that the arguments for the tax cut will have much the same flavor, after the fact.

HEADLINE: Broken Path Along Hudson Is Connected For Bicyclists 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
The idea of bicycling along the Hudson River in Manhattan has always been alluring. But until now, the ride has generally proved to be frustrating. 
 A cyclist who started just north of Battery Park could ride several miles but then had to dismount and steer into Riverside Drive for three-quarters of a mile. From there on, a pattern emerged: Ride, dismount, detour. Ride, dismount, detour. 
 But on Tuesday, a final piece of the Hudson River greenway will open, including a temporary path for cyclists and pedestrians between 59th and 72nd Streets, which had been the main disruption in the route.
"This is by far the biggest car-free bicycle and pedestrian path New York has ever seen," said John Kaehny, director of Transportation Alternatives, a cycling advocacy organization. "It connects the densest residential section on the Upper West Side with the densest business and entertainment district in Midtown."
Some of the bike route between Battery Park and the Little Red Lighthouse just beneath the George Washington Bridge has been cobbled together and includes parts of the esplanade in Riverside Park. Still, on a day without dense crowds, it is possible to ride the entire length -- 11 1/2 miles -- without dismounting. 
The city said it planned to replace temporarily paved parts of the route with a permanent, wider greenway by the river and extend the path an additional two and a half miles through the Bronx to the Yonkers border. 
"People have been expressing hope for this route for years," said the parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern. 
"No one agency owns the waterfront," he said, "so it's taken the City Planning Commission, the City Economic Development Corporation, the State Department of Transportation and the State Department of Environmental Conservation to get it done."
Eventually, he said, the city hopes to persuade upstate counties to extend the greenway to Troy, more than 150 miles north of the city.
Mr. Kaehny said that as many as 800 bicyclists had been using the Hudson River greenway on spring and fall weekends. The opening of the inaccessible section, he said, "will itself substantially increase the total level of cycling in New York City."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "STREETSCAPE: Long-Awaited Link"The last section of the Hudson River Greenway, which cyclists and pedestrians can use from Battery Park to the George Washington Bridge, is to open Tuesday. Greenway ends at Little Red Lighthouse. Bridge at 181st Street crosses Henry Hudson Parkway and leads into Washington Heights. Recently completed greenway and park connect Riverside Park to Fort Washington Park. (Can use esplanade at northern end of Riverside Park) Access to temporary path is at base of Riverbank State Park. Permanent greenway is planned. Can use existing service road by water's edge. Plan for development of city-owned waterfront includes paved greenway. Paved greenway, Cherry Walk, was widened to 12 feet last year and relandscaped. (Can use existing Riverside Park esplanade.) Existing detour leads through Riverside Park underpass. Braced platform planned for west of underpass. (Can use existing esplanade in Riverside Park) Temporary paved greenway opens Tuesday. Permanent one will be built as Trump buildings are completed.

PERSON: Frederick Rath 

HEADLINE: Frederick Rath, 87, Pioneer Of Historical Conservation 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Frederick Rath, a pioneer of historical conservation in a country devoted to replacement and redevelopment, died in his sleep on April 1 in Cooperstown, N.Y. He was 87 and lived in Cooperstown.
 Mr. Rath served from 1949 to 1956 as the director of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, newly created by Congress to succeed the National Council for Historic Sites and Buildings, which he had also headed. 
 Originally inspired by the example of Britain's National Trust, the American body quickly took a very different direction under Mr. Rath's leadership. The United States' philanthropic tradition, its greater wealth and its less burdensome tax system encouraged private conservation efforts, allowing Mr. Rath to create what became essentially an advocacy organization that pressed the cause on Congress and the executive branch, rather than make a priority of owning and managing historic sites itself as its British counterpart does.
America's National Trust now manages just 20 historic-house museums and no land at all; it has about 200,000 members and income of about $40 million a year. Britain's National Trust, by contrast, runs 630 historic buildings open to the public, owns 600,000 acres of open countryside and coastline, and has 2.7 million members and income of about $100 million a year.
In 1957, after leaving the trust, Mr. Rath became vice director of the New York State Historical Association, in Cooperstown, and began teaching museum management at the Cooperstown Graduate Program in History Museum Training. Then, from 1972 until 1979, he had responsibility for historic sites throughout New York State as deputy commissioner in the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
From 1979 to 1987, he was chief executive officer at the Eastern National Park and Monument Association, a nonprofit body he helped found that publishes guides and books about historic sites.
Mr. Rath's approach to conservation sought to keep historic sites integrated in the life of local communities by encouraging commercial activity, rather than having the two isolated from each other as at Williamsburg, for example. He was a strong advocate of the South Street Seaport project, which saved a historic part of Lower Manhattan by turning old buildings into tourist-oriented shops and restaurants. And as deputy state parks commissioner, he championed state heritage areas, where communities work with the state government to develop historical sites as tourist attractions.
Frederick Louis Rath was born in Brooklyn and earned degrees in American history at Dartmouth and Harvard. He then joined the National Park Service, for which he worked at historic sites, and after serving in the Army during World War II he became a historian at the home of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Vanderbilt Mansion in Hyde Park, N.Y.
He married Ann Richardson in 1946. She survives him, as do two sons, William, of Cooperstown, and David, of Williston, Vt.

HEADLINE: Mourning Wards, a Store That Time Left Behind 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN

DATELINE: NORTH RIVERSIDE, Ill., April 6 

 BODY:
Mourners file past the blackened windows of this shuttered old department store.
 There is no sign of life inside. No bright and shiny home appliances, like whispering Frigidaires. No children's voices or ringing cash registers. No mothers sifting through racks of back-to-school clothes. And no more brand-new Schwinns to make a child's heart go thump. 
 The windows are filled with impenetrable black plastic and flanked by signs, like two tombstones, each with the inscription: "Sears coming in 2002." The rest of the story is clear: Montgomery Ward is dead.
Montgomery Ward, the noted department store known as Wards, which, with its glossy seasonal catalogs and aisle after aisle of merchandise under a single roof, pioneered one-stop shopping in America's heartland long before the explosion of malls and superstores, succumbed on March 25, of complications from a long illness. It was 129.
It is survived by Kmart, Wal-Mart and Sears, which has bought 28 former Wards sites.
It is all gone now. Every piece of furniture, every last cashier, clerk and stock boy, and every last men's gray or yellow striped shirt, which had been among the last things to go at the store in North Riverside.
For months, the customers had picked over the ugly shirts. So a former Wards clerk, Angie Surman, 44, and her colleagues bought them all, about 20 racks' worth, out of pride. They did not want to see Wards go out like a flea market. 
"We thought, 'You know what? We're going out with a big bang. We've held our head up high, we've kept our standards,' " Ms. Surman said. "A lot of the customers looked at us like we were weird because we were holding our end. We didn't want to cry," she said, her voice cracking.
There were tears. About 28,000 Wards employees at 250 stores across 30 states lost their jobs. Ms. Surman's daughter, Elizabeth Surman, also worked at Wards. She was lucky. She was hired at a jewelry store at the same mall. But the mother and scores of colleagues, some with more than 20 years at Wards, spent the last two weeks filing for unemployment compensation, a resurgent ritual amid almost daily news of layoffs.
Closed Wards stores now lie in state, soon to go the way of the eight-track player and "American Bandstand." In Chicago, the store's birthplace in 1872, its loss is especially felt.
But even admirers confess that the thrill of Wards had gone long ago and that the store was sputtering along on life support when its owner, General Electric, pulled the plug. Wards had lost that loving feeling, some here say. The clothes seemed cheaper. There are many for whom Wards' closing was a nonevent.
"Wards was all right," James Chambers, 29, said, passing by a closed Wards. Mr. Chambers was quick to note that he never shopped there. Well, almost never. "When they went out of business we bought some stuff," a microwave, and some tables, Mr. Chambers said. "I used to always try to get a credit card with them," he said. "They didn't ever approve me for it." He laughed.
Perhaps it is a negligible thing, the demise of a department store in an age of the Internet and megamalls.
But if life is made up of the scents, sounds and places that rekindle bygone seasons, then Wards, many people here say, was a part of theirs. Wards held the wafting smell of fresh popcorn, the memories of buying furnishings for a first home, of small children, now grown, back when they still thought their parents were the smartest people in the world. Its existence meant stability, connectedness to the past, to Christmases and Easters and Mother's Days. Strolling past Wards in the latter years was like driving slowly by an old house you once lived in. You didn't need to go in. It was enough just knowing it was there.
It was hard to get Wards out of your blood. Genevieve Setzen, 85, retired from a Wards store in Chicago after 20 years. That was 25 years ago, but she always found her way back to Wards, to shop, or just to stroll. Over the last five years, she has always visited the mall at North Riverside after taking her sister to the hospital for dialysis. Three days a week, Wards was the first stop. 
"I miss it," Ms. Setzen said.
Elizabeth and Charles Kirian stared at the shuttered Wards at North Riverside. Mrs. Kirian and her husband had shopped at Wards for their two children, then their four grandchildren. A lot of things have changed since then. Mrs. Kirian's hair has grown white, both of their steps have gotten slower over time. Now Wards is gone. 
"It's an institution that went down and that's too bad," Mrs. Kirian said.
"A lot of businesses are going under," Mr. Kirian said.
His wife sighed. "It says everything is changing," she said. "I don't know, what are you going to do?" She shrugged.
In the end, there was little left, except the workers. 
"When you stopped and you walked out the door and you turned around and looked," Ms. Surman said, what you saw "was all the hard work, and all the tears and all the fights and chasing shoplifters." And the party her co-workers held to celebrate a colleague's 25th anniversary at Wards last year. "There are just a lot of memories," Ms. Surman said, "a lot of good memories."
At another mall in suburban Chicago Ridge, Robert Harmer, 70, and his wife, Marie, sat on a bench outside another empty Wards. Many years ago, his father bought a lawn mower from Wards.
"They brought their lawn mower out, they set it up and poured some oil in it, some gasoline, made sure it ran all right," said Mr. Harmer, a soft-spoken man with a white mustache and sideburns poking from underneath his green cap. Then there was his first bike, the one he bought from Wards as a boy, that he had to walk home for three miles because he had not yet learned to ride. 
"It was a Schwinn bike," he said, his face spreading into a smile. "It was red. It had a horn in there and knee action in the front."
He laughed.
"It was a good store, for its time," Mr. Harmer said. "For its time."

HEADLINE: NURSING SHORTAGE IS RAISING WORRIES ON PATIENTS' CARE 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM and LINDA VILLAROSA

 BODY:
Nurses, hospital executives and health care experts say that a shortage of nurses across the country is becoming so severe that it threatens patient care.
 The vacancy rate for nursing positions at 73 hospitals in New York, Westchester and Long Island is averaging 8 percent, up sharply from 5.5 percent in 1999, the Greater New York Hospital Association said last week. The shortage is even worse in California: vacancies in the 470 hospitals there averaged 20 percent in December, according to the California Healthcare Association. 
 At Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y., the largest and busiest hospital between New York City and Albany, more than 25 percent of the positions for operating-room nurses were unfilled as of late last year. Surgeries backed up and some were postponed, sometimes for several days. 
Since Jan. 1, the hospital has filled about half the openings by recruiting from other parts of the hospital, bringing in recent nursing school graduates, and hiring. But Ellen Widera, a longtime nurse at Westchester Medical, says it often takes months for new people to learn the operating room routine. "It is stressful having to do their job and your job, sometimes at the same time," she said. "You're up to your elbows in hepatitis blood and AIDS blood. It's dangerous." The hospital, which currently employs 1,500 nurses, had 190 openings for nurses on March 1, up from 144 only last November.
Because of short staffing, many nurses say they are forced to stay on the job when they are exhausted after a 12-hour shift. "It really ought to be illegal for nurses to work double shifts," said Lucien Leape, an expert on patient safety at the Harvard School of Public Health. "You don't allow airline hostesses to work more than eight hours. Why would anybody think nurses are less important?"
Hospital administrators and nurses expect the shortage to worsen. Enrollment in nursing programs is declining even as the population ages. The average age of nurses is rising.
And some nurses are becoming bitter. The shortage means those still on the job are responsible for more patients -- and those patients are often sicker, thanks to managed care requirements that more care take place outside hospitals.
Patients already find it harder to get a nurse to respond promptly when they call for help. Eighteen percent of consumers rated their last hospital stay fair or poor in a survey reported in 1999 by Karen Donelan and Robert J. Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health.
Frustrated, growing numbers of nurses are joining unions that threaten and sometimes call work stoppages as their militancy increases. Working conditions in hospitals were a central issue in at least 36 strikes by nurses in the last two years, including three in 1999 by the New York State Nurses Association. Many nurses are also pressing for state and federal staffing rules.
Hospital executives say they would hire more nurses if they could find them, but nurses say working conditions in hospitals are driving many of them out of the profession.
"The nursing shortage is one of the dominant issues in health care today," said Peter Buerhaus, associate dean at the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing in Nashville, whose findings were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association last year. "In some cases the problem is so severe that hospitals have had to shut down nursing floors and cancel surgeries. This crisis has the potential to create a disaster scenario in terms of the quality of care." 
In many hospitals, nurses say they are required to take care of 10 or more medical and postsurgical patients at a time, and those patients are often seriously ill. They complain of injured backs after lifting heavy patients and of risky accidents with contaminated needles.
"In the past year, the number of patients per nurse has increased and workloads have increased," said Relie Dema-Ala, a nurse at Glendale Memorial Hospital in Glendale, Calif. "The work is tremendously hard and stressful," she said. On Wednesday, nurses at Glendale Memorial voted 167 to 136 to affiliate with the California Nurses Association. 
At the same time, adjusted for inflation, average nurse salaries have hardly changed since 1992, according to a report in February by the Bureau of Health Professions in the federal Department of Health and Human Services. The average salary of a full-time registered nurse was $46,782 last year, it said. Hospitals, squeezed by managed care, have generally kept their salaries in check.
There were 2.2 million registered nurses working in health care last year, according to the Bureau of Health Professions report, but 494,000 nurses were not using their licenses, compared with 443,000 in 1996 and 387,000 in 1992. 
"We've burned out an entire generation of care givers," said Jeff Goldsmith, president of Health Futures, a hospital consulting firm. 
Hospital executives say they are trying hard to recruit more nurses, offering perks like health club and spa memberships, "night out" baby-sitting for nurses' children and even vacations in Hawaii. 
The Tenet Healthcare Corporation, the second-largest for-profit hospital chain, is experimenting with providing cordless phones for nurses to use at work, scholarships for their children and discount purchasing programs. Tenet would like to hire 3,000 more nurses for its 110 hospitals, said Alan R. Ewalt, executive vice president for human resources. 
But recruiting has been only moderately successful, and demand for bedside nurses has outpaced additions to the work force. There are now 100,000 openings for registered nurses, according to Joseph Boshart, president of Cross Country Travcorps, one of the largest temporary nurse staffing companies. 
The American Association of Colleges of Nursing in Washington said that enrollment of nursing students in entry-level bachelor's degree programs fell by 2.1 percent in the fall of 2000, the sixth annual drop. The lower enrollments mean the average age of nurses is rising. The health professions bureau says the average age of the 2.6 million registered nurses is 45.2 years and rising. In 1980, 52 percent were estimated to be under 40, compared with 31.7 percent currently. And only 18.3 percent of nurses are under 35, compared with 40.5 percent 20 years ago. 
Older nurses are often less willing to take on more patients and mandatory overtime. "Some nurses are just unable physically to handle the heavy demands of patients," said Linda Aiken, director of the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing. In a recent survey in Pennsylvania, 41 percent of the 14,000 nurses responding said they were dissatisfied with their job, and 22 percent were planning to quit within the next year.
P. K. Scheerle, a nurse who is now chief executive of American Nursing Services, a temporary staffing agency, said: "When I was a young nurse I used to be able to work 12-hour shifts, but now that I'm in my 40's and with children at home, if I worked that kind of shift, muscling eight patients, I'd be totally exhausted."
About 350,000 of the 2.2 million nurses working in health care are union members today, up from 300,000 in 1995, according to the Census Bureau. And the nurses unions are becoming more active: the Massachusetts Nurses Association voted to leave the American Nurses Association on March 24, saying the national group was too moderate. The California Nurses Association, which became independent in 1995, announced an alliance last month with the United Steelworkers of America, which already represents other employees in a number of hospitals. 
"Wages are always an issue, but they are not the principal issue," said Susan Bianchi-Sand, director of United American Nurses, the labor union affiliate of the American Nurses Association. "Safe staffing and the quality of patient care are higher priorities."
Nurses are getting increasing attention from legislators. In Washington, they have been pressing, with bipartisan support, for increased federal subsidies for nursing education. And last month, Representatives Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, and James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced legislation that would ban mandatory overtime for nurses. 
But last week, President Bush proposed to cut spending for medical education by 60 percent, to $140 million from $353 million.
California, Kentucky and Virginia are setting standards for appropriate staffing. Legislators have introduced less specific proposals in New York, Ohio and Oregon. 
In addition, 15 states, including New York, Connecticut, California and Illinois, are weighing bills that would prohibit forced overtime for nurses. Maine passed an overtime measure, and New Jersey is drafting overtime regulations. 
"Mandatory overtime is a huge issue," said Stephanie Reed, a lobbyist in Washington for the American Nurses Association. "Nurses have to work overtime when they are exhausted. The nurses have a tremendous fear of making mistakes. It's a patient safety issue."

HEADLINE: Talk of Lost Farms Reflects Muddle of Estate Tax Debate 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WELLSBURG, Iowa 

 BODY:
Harlyn Riekena worried that his success would cost him when he died. Thirty-seven years ago he quit teaching to farm and over the years bought more and more of the rich black soil here in central Iowa. Now he and his wife, Karen, own 950 gently rolling acres planted in soybeans and corn.
 The farmland alone is worth more than $2.5 million, and so Mr. Riekena, 61, fretted that estate taxes would take a big chunk of his three grown daughters' inheritance. 
 That might seem a reasonable assumption, what with all the talk in Washington about the need to repeal the estate tax to save the family farm. "To keep farms in the family, we are going to get rid of the death tax," President Bush vowed a month ago; he and many others have made the point repeatedly. 
But in fact the Riekenas will owe nothing in estate taxes. Almost no working farmers do, according to data from an Internal Revenue Service analysis of 1999 returns that has not yet been published.
Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist whose tax advice has made him a household name among Midwest farmers, said he had searched far and wide but had never found a case in which a farm was lost because of estate taxes. "It's a myth," Mr. Harl said.
Even one of the leading advocates for repeal of estate taxes, the American Farm Bureau Federation, said it could not cite a single example of a farm lost because of estate taxes.
The estate tax does, of course, have a bite. But the reality of that bite is different from the mythology, in which family farmers have become icons for the campaign to abolish the tax. In fact, the overwhelming majority of beneficiaries are the heirs of people who made their fortunes through their businesses and investments in securities and real estate. 
The effort to end the estate tax -- which critics call the death tax -- gained ground when the House of Representatives voted Wednesday to reduce the tax and then abolish it in 2011. The bill faces an uncertain fate in the Senate.
The estate tax is central in the debate over taxes, not only because the sums involved are huge but also because to both sides it is a touchstone of national values. To those seeking to abolish it, the estate tax is a penalty for success, an abomination that blocks the deeply human desire to leave a life's work as a legacy for the children. It is also a complicated burden that enriches the lawyers, accountants and life insurance companies that help people reduce their tax bills.
To its supporters, on the other hand, the estate tax is a symbol of American equality, a mechanism to democratize society and to encourage economic success based on merit rather than birthright.
Yet for all the passion in the debate, the estate tax does not always seem broadly understood. 
While 17 percent of Americans in a recent Gallup survey think they will owe estate taxes, in fact only the richest 2 percent of Americans do. That amounted to 49,870 Americans in 1999. And nearly half the estate tax is paid by the 3,000 or so people who each year leave taxable estates of more than $5 million.
In fact, the primary beneficiaries of the move to abolish the estate tax look less like the Riekenas and more like Frank A. Blethen, a Seattle newspaper publisher whose family owns eight newspapers worth perhaps a billion dollars.
"Being ever bloodthirsty, the I.R.S. will start with the highest value it can on my estate," said Mr. Blethen, the 55-year-old patriarch of the publishing family. The figure for his share will probably be several hundred million dollars, more than half of which would go to the government. Mr. Blethen is trying to avoid almost all those taxes through a plan also used by other wealthy families, but if he does not succeed his sons' interest in the business will be wiped out, he said.
Estate taxes are paid by few Americans because they are not assessed on the first $1.35 million of net worth left by a couple. Amounts above this are taxed at rates that begin at 43 percent and rise to 55 percent on amounts greater than $3 million. As the Riekenas and the Blethens have learned, there are many legal ways to reduce the value of one's wealth for estate tax purposes. So even for the largest estates, the tax averages 25 percent.
Family farmers are often cited as victims. As Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa hog farmer and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, put it, "The product of a life's work leaches away like seeds in poor soil."
Yet tax return data show that very few farmers pay estate taxes. Only 6,216 taxable estates in 1999 included any agricultural land and equipment, the I.R.S. report shows. The average value of these farm assets was $440,000, only about a third of the amount that any married couple could leave untaxed to heirs. What is more, a farm couple can pass $4.1 million untaxed, so long as the heirs continue farming for 10 years.
In Iowa, the average farm has a net worth of $1.2 million. Loyd A. Brown, president of Hertz Farm Management in Nevada, Iowa, which runs more than 400 farms in 10 states, said none of his firm's clients nor anyone he knew was facing problems because of the estate tax.
Just 1,222 estates in 1999 had enough in farm assets to make the farm property alone subject to estate taxes. But these farm assets amounted to one-tenth of these estates, suggesting that the tax applies mostly to gentleman farmers and ranchers, rather than to working farmers like the Riekenas, whose fortunes are tied up in their farms.
As the Riekenas were surprised to discover, avoiding the estate tax was easy. Their lawyer developed a simple plan that involved making gifts to their daughters and buying life insurance to offset any estate taxes that might be due if the parents died before most of the farm had been turned over to their daughters. 
There is a real cost, of course -- payments to the lawyer and for the insurance. And in any case the paucity of affected farmers does not end the debate. Patricia A. Wolff, the Farm Bureau's chief lobbyist, said the organization made estate tax repeal its top priority because, while it has not surveyed its members, she was confident "the majority of farmers and ranchers believe that death taxes are wrong and that it is wrong to tax people twice on what they earn."
But Mr. Riekena and all two dozen other farmers interviewed across central Iowa -- every one a Republican -- said that while they favored increasing the amount that could be passed to heirs untaxed, they did not support the repeal proposed by President Bush and other leaders of his party. A few snickered or laughed when asked whether the estate tax should be repealed to save the family farm.
But Senator Grassley himself opposes the estate tax, in large part because he thinks that while a decision to keep or sell an asset is an appropriate trigger for a tax, death should not be.
He added another reason: "I do not think that the function of government is to redistribute wealth."
Indeed, that seems to be the fault line in the debate: should the government play Robin Hood with estates?
"If you worked hard and put your money away, you paid tax on it as you went along, so it's yours and you should be able to pass it on to your children without the government penalizing you," said R. Elaine Gunland, who grows grapes in Fresno, Calif., and whose family may owe estate taxes when she dies.
Mr. Blethen, the fourth-generation publisher of a newspaper started in 1896 with $3,000, says he speaks for many others in supporting repeal of the tax in the name of preserving family businesses.
"I firmly believe that family-owned businesses are the heart and soul of the country," said Mr. Blethen, who has created a Web site called deathtax.com.
Mr. Blethen says the estate tax benefits publicly traded companies at the expense of family-owned businesses. The reason is that the public companies can often buy family businesses at a discount because the owners did not raise the cash to pay estate taxes and must sell quickly at fire sale prices.
Mr. Blethen said some of the seven smaller papers his family bought in Washington and Maine came from families that had not planned carefully for the estate tax and decided it was easier to cash out.
"If you like corporate culture, and think America needs more of it, then you love the estate tax," he said. "I think this march toward corporatism is not healthy and we lose innovation, jobs and charitable giving."
Mr. Blethen said the estate tax also discouraged major new investments in family businesses late in the life of the primary owner because such investments consumed cash that might be needed at any time to pay estate taxes.
He said the estate tax also "forces you into irresponsible gift making" to heirs. He felt compelled to give half the future growth of his fortune to his two sons when they were not yet kindergartners even though he had no way of telling whether the boys would turn out to be industrious, as they did, or scalawags.
Despite his fierce opposition to the estate tax, Mr. Blethen does not support President Bush's current plan to repeal the tax because it would also exempt from capital gains taxes the profits on assets passed to heirs when those assets are sold. "That's not fair," Mr. Blethen said.
He said Mr. Bush's proposal would have the perverse effect of encouraging the sale of family-owned businesses, because heirs would see death as their chance to sell tax-free and to diversify their portfolios, instead of continuing to bear the risks of holding a single enterprise.
Mr. Blethen thinks that rather than taxing an estate, taxes should apply when a business is sold. "You want to defer those capital gains and let them grow so large that the family will keep the business to avoid the capital gains taxes," he said.
The debate does not divide neatly among rich and poor. Since February more than 800 wealthy Americans have joined in a public appeal to keep the estate tax. They argue that repealing the tax would further enrich the wealthiest Americans and hurt struggling families. They also argue that financial success should be based on merit rather than on inheritance. 
Warren E. Buffett, George Soros, Paul Newman and William H. Gates Sr., father of Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates III, are among the most prominent in that group, which also includes many people with holdings of just a million dollars.
Mr. Buffett said the estate tax fosters economic growth by encouraging Americans to rise based on merit, not inheritance. "If you take the C.E.O.'s of the Fortune 500," he said in an interview, "and put in the eldest son of every one of those who ran the place in 1975, the American economy would not run as well as letting the Jack Welches, who started out with nothing, rise to the top of General Electric."
Back in central Iowa, Mr. Riekena had another reason. He said Washington was focused on the wrong issue when it came to saving family farms.
"For most farmers around here, the estate tax is not high in their minds," Mr. Riekena said. "What we need are better crop prices."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about farms and estate taxes referred incompletely to the position of Loyd A. Brown, president of Hertz Farm Management in Iowa. Mr. Brown said that while he did not know of anyone who had lost a farm because of the estate tax, he thought Congress should either eliminate the tax or increase the amount that could be inherited untaxed.

HEADLINE: What Now in Roosevelt Field's Court Fight? 

BYLINE:  By TERRY CONSIDINE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
FOR two years the neighborhoods surrounding Roosevelt Field, the Island's largest shopping mall, savored victory. Residents compared their success to David's defeating Goliath.
 But a court decision on March 21 has given Goliath a second life. 
 The Appellate Division of State Supreme Court reversed a 1999 decision by the Town of Hempstead's Board of Zoning Appeals, which had denied the mall's application for a special permit for a major expansion, which was to include a 150,000-square-foot Saks Fifth Avenue store, another 34,000 square feet of retail space and an additional 187,000 square feet for parking garages.
The mall's owner, the Simon Properties Group, appealed the board's decision to State Supreme Court in Mineola, which upheld the board's decision. The case then went to the Appellate Division's Second Judicial Department, in Brooklyn, which ruled last month that the board's decision was "arbitrary and capricious." The court sent the case back to the zoning board and told it to assess what impact the proposed addition will have on the environment, as outlined in the State Environmental Quality Review Act. 
"The appellate court's decision mandates our position," said Herbert M. Balin, a partner in Certilman Balin Adler & Hyman, the East Meadow law firm that represents Simon Properties, the country's largest mall developer.
At issue in the case is what is known as the floor-area ratio, which is a measurement of construction density, sometimes expressed as percentage. In 1989, the ratio for the industrial zone that includes Roosevelt Field was reduced from 0.75 to 0.40, which meant the total square footage of a building could be only 40 percent of total area of the site, instead of 75 percent.
But at the time, Roosevelt Field was already built to a 0.529 ratio, making it a nonconforming use. In 1995, the zoning board approved a "special exception" permit to increase the mall's ratio to 0.696 so that the Nordstrom department store could be built. Now if the proposal for more expansion is finally approved, the mall's ratio would increase to 0.75, the maximum that had been allowed before 1989. 
Gary Fishberg, the counsel for the Village of Garden City, said of the appellate ruling: "They disregarded our experts and said we didn't show empirical data because we didn't do our own traffic reports. What we did show, using the Roosevelt Field traffic experts' own data, was that their traffic evidence was not sufficient and shouldn't be given much weight."
Joseph Ra, the Hempstead Town attorney, said he was surprised at the ruling. "We really think this decision is wrong," he said. "We want to appeal it." If the town takes that route, the case will go to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest.
Despite its Garden City mailing address, the mall is not actually in the Village of Garden City but in East Garden City, an unincorporated part of the Town of Hempstead.
Like Mr. Ra, residents living near the mall also expressed surprise, as well as frustration and anger, over the court's decision.
Eileen Murphy, who lives in Garden City about a mile from the mall, helped organize her neighbors to protest the expansion plans at a zoning board hearing in 1999. "We're all aware that's a very overdeveloped mall," she said last week, "but we have to realize it's all been done within the law. The problem here is the Town of Hempstead zoning law."
"Until the town puts a limit on the number of special exceptions granted to a single applicant," she added, "and until the town puts a maximum cap on the floor-area ratio for a single property, they will continue to negate their 0.40 legislation. And developers will continue to stretch the limits. As long as it's economically viable, there's nothing to stop them from inching on. We have to work toward getting those changes."
Patricia Bauerschmidt is the vice president of the Civic Association of Carle Place, an unincorporated area that borders Old Country Road, the mall's northern boundary. 
"It's hard to believe the mall has room for any more stores," she said. "People here can't believe the mall wants to build more without doing anything about the traffic situation. We're drowning in traffic here. They keep telling us to look at the whole picture, but nobody at the county level seems to be."
Jerie Newman of Garden City who worked with Mrs. Murphy in coordinating the neighborhoods' protest efforts, said she was disappointed in the court decision. "Nobody's speaking for us," she said. "It's as if we aren't important, and yet we are the ones most affected by this. I think they're looking down the wrong end of the telescope. I wish they would turn it around and look at the entire Hub area. That's 2.9 square miles that includes not only Roosevelt Field, but Roosevelt Raceway, Nassau Coliseum, Museum Mile, the Country Glen Shopping Center, Voice Road and Mitchel Field."
All are being developed to their legal limits without special permits, she said. "Think about that and the traffic that will be generated," she added. "That affects our daily lives. Not just the frustration of the traffic jams, but the air we breathe and probably the water will be affected, too."
Neighborhood opposition to the field's proposed expansion was noted in the Appellate Division's ruling, but it found the zoning board's decision, which said that the mall's expansion would be detrimental because of increased traffic and air pollution, was not supported by the evidence.
Bruce Torino, a lawyer and the Garden City trustee who presented the village's opposition to the mall's expansion before the zoning board, found the court decision troublesome. "The court is putting the burden on the public, the wrong party," he said. "It puts the people in a double bind. If they object, they're dismissed. If they say nothing, it's deemed to mean approval. That's very disturbing."
The impact of increased traffic is still the focus of many residents' objections to the mall expansion. With 250 stores and more than 3.2 million square feet of retail space and parking garages, Roosevelt Field is the country's fifth-largest shopping center, attracting 10 million visitors a year.
Nick Episcopia, the vice president of the Eastern Property Owners Association, which represents about 40 percent of residents who live closest to the mall, said that during peak shopping hours, getting into Roosevelt Field was like trying to cross the George Washington Bridge at rush hour. "Next it will be like the traffic jams on the Cross Bronx Expressway," he said.
Garden City plans to join the Town of Hempstead in asking the Court of Appeals to hear the case. John S. Wallenstein, a lawyer in Hempstead who represents Hardy F. Glass Inc., said he would also apply to the court. The Glass company, an insurance agency at 600 Old Country Road, next to one of the entrances to the mall, contends that its three employees have to come to work at 7:30 a.m. to beat the traffic going to the mall. 
The Court of Appeals may or may not grant permission to appeal. Mr. Balin, the mall's lawyer, said that he doubted that the court would take the case because the four appellate judges were unanimous in their decision. And because they asked for an environmental review, he said, the decision is not considered final, a condition usually necessary before the Court of Appeals will hear a case.
Mr. Ra, Hempstead's lawyer, and Mr. Fishberg, Garden City's lawyer, said they might ask the Appellate Division to rehear the case.
The two sides disagree on the extent of the environmental review that the court has ordered. Mr. Balin said that no new information could be presented and that the zoning board would have no choice but to rule that there were no environmental objections to the expansion. 
But Mr. Ra said that since the zoning board had originally chosen not to complete an environmental review because it believed that it had already heard enough evidence to make a decision, the process would start all over again. That would mean that current traffic counts could be considered and that a public hearing would be held. But in the meantime, nothing will happen until the Court of Appeals decides whether it will hear the case. 
Leasing the 250,000-square-foot Stern's department store, which is scheduled to close in August when the entire Stern's chain goes out of business, is a separate matter from the proposed development, Mr. Balin said. Asked if Saks might lease the Stern's store, he declined to comment, as did Saks.
A second zoning application for expansion filed by Simon Properties last December, while it was waiting for the outcome of the Appellate Division appeal, did not mention Saks as a prospective tenant. The new application sought a smaller building with two floors, not three, containing 100,000 square feet. 
Kevin Ryan, the public-relations representative for Roosevelt Field, said there had been a great deal of interest in the Stern's store because Roosevelt Field is one of the most successful malls in the country. "There are a number of major retailers around the country who are interested in being in the New York market," he said.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; 
Once the Wallflower, Bonds Now Have Suitors

BYLINE:  By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
NOT all fund investors were mauled in the first quarter. While most equity funds saw insult added to last year's injuries, bond funds basked in the glow of positive returns.
 The average taxable bond fund had a total return of 2.33 percent for the quarter and 6.89 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, according to Morningstar Inc., while the average municipal bond fund returned 1.89 percent for the three months and 9.45 percent for the 12 months. 
 "Last year was the first in some time that the bond market had its day in the sun," said Connie J. Plaehn, a managing director of J. P. Morgan Chase & Company who, as senior fixed income portfolio manager for mutual funds, pension and other institutional clients is responsible for managing more than $73 billion in assets. 
Usually at presentations to institutional clients, "equity managers get two hours -- I get five minutes," Ms. Plaehn said. "But given how tough the equity market has been over the past year," she added, "much more attention is being given the bond market."
Individual investors, too, are showing new interest in bonds, say fund managers and independent investment advisers. Is it indeed time to start moving out of ravaged equity funds and into bond funds? The answer is a resounding "yes, but."
A well-diversified portfolio should certainly include bonds, and most investment advisers are recommending higher percentages of bonds versus stocks than they were in early 2000, when the stock market was charging from gain to gain. Bonds can provide an income stream and can smooth portfolio volatility, but their performance has historically lagged behind stocks over the long term. 
Doug Lockwood, vice president for shareholder education at American Century Investments in Kansas City, Mo., said his company's recommended asset allocation for moderate investors was now 30 percent bond funds, 60 percent stock funds and 10 percent cash or equivalents. Investors can build individual asset allocation plans by visiting the company's Web site, www.americancentury.com, clicking on the "Investing Workshop" tab, then clicking "Investing With a Purpose" and answering a short questionnaire.
Mr. Lockwood, who is a lawyer and a certified financial planner, said that once the asset allocation model is determined, investors should look at the different segments of the bond market, consider their risk tolerance and select funds that are likely to meet their income goals. But he cautioned against a big shift into bonds.
It is "wise to take the long-term view," he said, adding that investors "are better off riding out the periodic downturns."
Michael Stolper, an independent investment adviser whose firm, Stolper & Company of San Diego, works with institutions and affluent individuals, said that when clients asked, "Should I have more bonds?" his answer was, "What is the problem we are trying to solve?" If they are trying "to flee equities, we'll take baby steps, move 5 percent," Mr. Stolper said.
"Our clients are wealthy to begin with," he added. "We don't want to undermine their good fortune."
If the client is retired and needs an income stream, a bond fund like the Vanguard Intermediate Corporate fund, which "pays attention to credit risk," may be appropriate, he said, but he would put only enough of the client's total portfolio into the fund to provide a three- or four-year income stream, leaving the remainder in stock funds for greater long-term growth.
Generally, Mr. Stolper said, he opposed a big move into bonds.
"This is a classic bear market" in stocks, he said, "and it is probably closer to the end than to the beginning." That means an opportunity to buy funds holding large capital losses, he said, and to "ride up the hill tax-free."
For investors who do want to move money into bonds, Ms. Plaehn recommends a broadly diversified fund, not direct purchases of bonds.
She said the bond market had already priced in a 4 percent federal funds rate, so most of the money to be made on bonds will come from yield, not from capital gains. And in a slowing economy, quality is especially important, she added, pointing to credit downgrades at companies like Xerox and J. C. Penney that hurt the value of their debt securities.
RETURNS on long corporate issues will lag behind in the near term, she predicted, while Treasuries will outperform. But ultimately, she added, "corporate issues can give you a lot of additional spread relative to Treasuries." 
David Brownlee, senior vice president and fixed-income team leader of the Sentinel Advisors Company, agreed that it made sense to realize appreciation in Treasuries and to go into corporates. "The majority of the rally in bonds is over," Mr. Brownlee said. "The market has fully priced in a 4 percent federal funds rate," and that means anyone going into Treasuries will be buying at the top of the market.
"You're better off in money markets," he said, but "you see the highest subscription when things have run their course."
Mr. Brownlee, who manages two government securities funds for Sentinel, said he was now focusing on "niches and nuances in the mortgage-backed market."
A WORD of caution for investors who feel burned by stock funds and are looking for safety in bond funds: Do not defeat your purpose by reaching for yield alone. The top of the charts is filled with high-yield, or junk, bond funds, but such funds move more in tandem with the equity markets than with the bond markets and will be particularly vulnerable if there is a prolonged economic downturn with many corporate defaults.
Many people look to 2001 as a recovery year for high-yield bonds, said Brendan M. White, manager of the Touchstone High Yield fund and senior portfolio manager at Fort Washington Investment Advisors, but he is skeptical. Mr. White noted a sharp increase in defaults and problems in the telecommunications industry, a major issuer of high-yield bonds.
Still, Mr. White said, high-yield bond funds, when they make up 10 percent to 20 percent of a portfolio, can iron out volatility by producing some income when stock prices are falling.
"High yield is attractive from a yield standpoint," he said. "I would not look for robust capital gains." He advised investors to "gravitate to higher quality," rather than "reaching for yield and getting equity-like risk."

HEADLINE: HOW TO; 
Run In 2004

BYLINE:  By Ned Martel 

 BODY:
 In just 45 months, someone will be taking the oath of national office. The Republicans, in all likelihood, have their man. While Al Gore ponders his options, Capitol Hill teems with Democratic rivals. Consider yourself one of them. Your strategy is to leave Gore alone -- he's going to emerge as the presumed nominee or dejectedly fade away, and you won't want to be seen as anything but a spectator to either fate. Instead, focus on building your name, your stamina and your bank account. Most important, you'll need to learn the lessons of the last race before anyone else does.

1. Proceed as if you've never heard of campaign-finance reform. Lean on the 19 Democratic governors hard. As George W. Bush understood, governors tend to raise money more efficiently than Washington lawmakers because they can do immediate favors for donors.

2. Avoid Bill; schedule a working lunch with Hillary. Don't be part of any drubbing of either of them -- it always backfires. Contribute to her aims to accomplish something legislatively; party loyalists want this for her. Treat Bill like a fun-loving Denis Thatcher. Ask no favors of him; he'll expect them to be returned.

3. Flaunt your independence. Balance your most liberal stance with a conservative capitulation. Support tax cuts and be the first in your party to back a prominent judicial nominee. Hold the line on worker safety, consumer protection and pollution prevention, the battles that will intensify if the economy worsens.

4. Break away from the nasty stalemates that will develop inside the Beltway. Champion new local experiments that do something counterintuitive but sensible: family planning combined with religious reflection, holistic nutrition in the inner city, Internet-based group therapy for veterans.

5. Get booked on the political talk shows. Go for exposure that's national but rational. Accept Russert. Decline O'Reilly.

6. Make an inventory of your past indiscretions. Be prepared to acknowledge them and apologize, but like Bush, refuse to elaborate on them. If you've done something really bad, adopt the pose of a chastened rogue. No one likes to be duped by a goody-goody with a double life.

7. Take charge of the family finances for at least six months. You can still be grilled on the price of bread, milk and eggs. Add to that list gas, electricity, doctors.

8. Acquire an age-appropriate hobby. Acceptable: riding motorcycles, climbing mountains, jamming in a cover band with a witty name, like the Love Handles. Unacceptable: riding foreign motorcycles, heli-skiing, D.J.-ing electronica.

9. Repeat this Bush-specific mantra: Love the man, hate the policy. Get to know the president -- earn a nickname, talk box scores with him, praise something he did in Texas (that's when he was flying relatively solo, so he's proudest of those achievements). When you criticize him on the campaign trail, he'll be much more rattled if he considers you his friend.

HEADLINE: Lighting Up a House With the Sun's Power 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE WOODSIDE 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER installed solar panels at the White House to heat hot water for a kitchen, but President Reagan had them removed shortly after he took office.
 That's about how it has gone for the solar revolution, a technology that holds much promise, but hasn't had much impact. Still, despite the high costs of installing such a system, a tiny group of Connecticut homeowners use the sun for their electricity and hot water and have shown that with conservation, the sun, even in often gloomy New England, is enough. 
 In Bethlehem, the electric meter outside Robert Maddox's house runs very slowly because of his solar hot-water heater, and he's saving money to install a solar electrical system next year. His goal is to have the meter go in reverse -- to sell his own sun power back to the electric companies. 
Judi and Lou Friedman, who had a solar-powered hot water heater for years, decided to use the sun completely and installed a solar electrical system at their home in Canton last year. They are still connected to the electrical grid as a backup. In Bridgewater, Edward Witkin has gone cold turkey: He uses no electricity at all. He built a log house for his wife, Ellen Shrader, and their two young daughters and used solar-powered tools to do it.
"Psychologically, it's very restful and fulfilling. There's something very natural about it," said Mrs. Friedman, chairwoman of People's Action for Clean Energy, a group that promotes solar energy. Mrs. Friedman and her husband have had a solar hot-water system since 1976 and last year installed photovoltaic panels to convert sun into electricity.
Economically, solar isn't so fulfilling. Solar users all understand that they could get more power for less money through the electrical grid. In bald financial terms, power made with fossil fuel or nuclear power remains much cheaper than using backyard sun to power hot water and electricity. One energy consultant, Joel Gordes who runs Environmental Energy Solutions in Colebrook, estimates that solar electrical systems provide $140 worth of electricity per year.
Then there is the cost of the equipment itself. For a typical house, the photovoltaic panels and related equipment for electricity, combined with the solar hot-water equipment, cost about $35,000. This means that owners of solar systems will recoup their investments between 15 and 20 years after these systems go on line.
But solar power users said they value solar energy for reasons other than economics. They said it's important to them that they have decreased their dependence on fossil fuel to just the small tanks of propane for their stoves and to back up their water heaters. They are proud that their energy use doesn't pollute air or water, and that it uses a natural resource, light, that comes directly to them, quietly.
"If the sun comes out here, you almost need sunglasses in here," Mr. Maddox said, as he looked out of his south-facing windows.
"You can do this, and be comfortable, and you don't have to give up the conveniences of the 21st century," he said. "Ultimately, with the energy choices I've made, I'm convinced there will be a time when I can sell power back to the grid."
Even in New England, there is enough sun to power a house, the solar users said, but only if people cut their energy use to a fraction of what most people consume. Today, the average household in Connecticut uses 716 kilowatt hours per month, or 8,592 a year. A typical photovoltaic system produces an estimated 1,400 kilowatt hours a year, or about 16 percent of average use.
Anyone serious about going solar must think differently about life.
"Conservation is the basis of it all," Mr. Gordes said. "It makes zero sense to go out and buy an expensive photovoltaic system unless you're taking conservation steps."
When the goal is to go solar, "the solar should be the last thing people think about," said Mr. Witkin, who runs the Bridgewater office of Solar Works, a company that provides solar panels and related equipment. "With all this crisis in California, there's very little talk about conservation. Conservation doesn't mean changing our lifestyle."
Homeowners who have made the jump to partial or total solar energy use insisted that it's easy to get by on less energy. From their refrigerators to their televisions to their laundry machines, these mavericks love to show off the changes they have made in basic routines.
Mr. Maddox, a former state representative who grew up on a dairy farm adjacent to his Bethlehem house, doesn't own a clothes dryer. He hangs his laundry in his extremely sunny living room in the winter and on a clothesline outdoors in the summer. When he decided to build the passive solar house, Mr. Maddox found a used solar hot-water system that cost $740 (a new one would probably have cost about $6,000). He hopes to invest about $10,000 in photovoltaic panels next year to supply his electricity, and he's getting ready now by conserving every bit he can.
He banished electricity-gobblers such as coffee makers, instead heating water on his propane stove and pouring it through a drip filter into a thermos. Mr. Maddox also follows a personal rule to cut every "phantom load" of electricity he can find. No computer monitor sits neglected. He unplugs the television and any appliance like it that continues to draw power when it's off.
Installing the equipment himself, Mr. Witkin and his wife spent $27,000 a decade ago, and he anticipates it will be paid off through a lack of electricity bill sometime in the next few years.
"We're definitely in the extreme," Mr. Witkin admitted. He said the reason he never hooked up the house to the power grid, though many solar users keep it as a back-up, was that "I was concerned that if did that we would rely too much on the electricity."
Mr. Witkin has to spend some time most days putting a little muscle into running the household. He might start his morning by reaching out of the skylights to brush off snow or debris from the photovoltaic panels that cover the southern slope of his family's roof. More panels face the front door on the other side of the building.
Over the winter, as an experiment, Mr. Witkin installed a set of what look like bicycle pedals next to the house battery supply. Anyone in the family who wants a little exercise can generate 50 to 100 watts as the pedals spin the shaft of a 24-volt generator. The power gets stored in the batteries.
When necessary, he also starts fires in the upstairs wood stove and the downstairs "Russian stove," which is like a small wood-fired stone furnace. By evening, his daughters can feel the heat coming up through the radiant-heat floor tiles as they play with their scooters downstairs. The tiles generate warmth after sundown with the help of the hot-water system.
The family washes their dishes in a large porcelain double sink instead of a dishwasher. They run their clothes dryer off propane, and their refrigerator is a special "Sun Frost" model, costing about $2,500, with more insulation and the heat-generating compressors mounted on top. It uses about a sixth of the energy of a conventional refrigerator.
Mr. Witkin even devised a solar-powered driveway light. On top of a former well house roof sits a photovoltaic panel. During the day it collects sun and funnels it into a battery below. At night, the light glows for several hours.
Mr. Maddox, the Witkin-Shrader household, and the Friedmans all rely on compact fluorescent light bulbs, a standard among solar power users. These use a quarter of the energy of regular bulbs.
The modern solar energy business was born in 1973, when the federal government began to test systems using photovoltaic panels. Solar energy systems date to the 1880s, when the first experiments to convert light used selenium photovoltaic cells. These managed to use only 2 percent of the available sun. In the 1950's, pure crystalline silicon technology came along, and Bell Telephone Laboratories produced a silicon photovoltaic cell that was 11 percent efficient. By the late 1950's, American satellites used solar energy to power radios.
There are three basic kinds of solar power, all based on simple concepts of collection and storage. To get electricity, "photovoltaic" panels use silicon to collect sunlight, and a converter turns power into alternating current, while batteries store energy for later use. Solar hot-water heating systems -- used by President Carter at the White House and several hundred homeowners in Connecticut -- use pipes filled with solutions similar to anti-freeze; they run from the roof to a tank where, like coils, they warm the water. The third way to use the sun is to draw heat into the house through south-facing "passive solar" buildings, which number into the thousands here.
From 1979 to 1983, people who bought solar panels and related equipment for their homes could claim a federal income tax credit, but that incentive has disappeared. A 1998 Connecticut law makes all solar equipment exempt from municipal property taxes.
Today, solar energy as a mainstream power source remains on the wish list of the state government.
The power grid serving southern New England carries power from a combination of sources. Most of it is oil (44 percent), nuclear energy (30 percent) and trash incinerators (9 percent). Small percentages of natural gas, hydroelectric power, and even solar that houses sell back onto the grid, make up the balance. Several natural gas power plants are proposed to be built in Connecticut, while nuclear energy is expected to decline.
Michael Cassella, chairman of the Connecticut Energy Advisory Board, which advises the state on energy issues, said the board wanted solar energy to become one of several energy sources in the future. The board has asked the State Legislature to try to make it easier for people to afford solar energy. They want the state to fund emerging technologies, including wind and hydroelectric, so they could be made more affordable to the general public.
"You can't cost-justify a solar installation right now," he said. "We're going to look at the technology: In terms of public policy, what can we do not only to encourage it, but to increase the pace of the proliferation of the technology?"
The mavericks who already use solar suggest that people examine other things on which they would spend a lot of money, not necessarily money they could recoup, and then ask themselves if they can afford solar energy.
"People go out and buy an S.U.V. and don't think about the investment," Mr. Witkin said.

Another Sign Of Slowdown: Smaller Paychecks

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
WHEN we had a dozen jobs to fill last fall, we had only 18 candidates to pick from, and now we have three dozen candidates. The applicants back then had 5 of the 10 skills required, and now they have all 10."
 That is how Barbara Hughes, the Pittsburgh area manager for Manpower Inc., the nation's largest supplier of temporary workers, describes the economic slowdown as she experiences it. "No longer do we have to go to a corporate client and say we cannot fill a job order with enough qualified people," Ms. Hughes said, "and the client says, 'Offer a higher wage and bill us for it.' We are able now to keep wages and the bill rate pretty flat." 
 For all its excesses, the boom years, starting in 1996, dignified tens of millions of ordinary workers, by raising their wages faster than inflation, a rare experience for most working Americans. The gains have been particularly strong in the bottom half of the work force -- people earning $12.35 an hour or less, adjusted for inflation. These are the nation's office workers, sales clerks, factory personnel, hotel and restaurant workers, technicians, mechanics and the like. But as the economy slows, the best earning years for these folks since Richard Nixon's first term as president appear to be ending.
"The minute you get a little slack in the labor force, wages for the bottom half seem to stagnate," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. 
Mr. Bernstein throws in a caveat: his concern may be premature. But the anecdotal evidence from managers like Ms. Hughes appears more conclusive than the data. There is always the chance, of course, that we will wake up from the nightmare of a cascading stock market and a corporate sector bent on shrinking payrolls to find the economy rebounding. The unemployment rate, which has edged up to 4.3 percent from 3.9 percent last fall, will turn south again, and Ms. Hughes will find herself once again offering higher wages to satisfy the labor needs of her clients.
"There are people available now," she said, "and that is a blessed relief for us." 
Two sets of Labor Department wage data, adjusted by Mr. Bernstein for inflation and for hours worked, suggest that the nightmare is real and that the income gains of ordinary workers are fading. One set shows that the median hourly wage of all American workers -- half earn less and half more -- is no higher today at $12.35 an hour than it was a year ago. Lower on the scale, among those earning $8 an hour, and at the upper end, among those earning $27.70 an hour, the healthy gains continued through the summer and then ceased.
"The people who did really well in the boom years were at the very low end, and this despite the fact that you had people entering the work force from the welfare rolls," said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard.
The other data set focuses on weekly wages for all workers below the rank of supervisor -- about 75 percent of the nation's 132 million work force, and here the stagnation is much clearer. Not only are raises smaller, but with output falling, hours have been cut. That shows up in smaller weekly paychecks for millions of people who had come to depend on the extra income. The average weekly paycheck is $470, adjusted for inflation. The amount has been falling each month since November, compared with the corresponding month a year earlier.
By all the standards of a generation or two ago, wages in the bottom half of the work force should not be weakening when unemployment is as low as it is today. 
There are some special factors. An uptick in the inflation rate helps to explain the latest inflation-adjusted wage data. Women's pay continues to rise, although not by enough to offset the drag from men, who are losing well-paid manufacturing jobs at an alarming rate. But more important, the old props that once helped to support wages in a weakening economy are gone. The minimum wage is no longer rising smartly. Union bargaining is a shell of its old self. Downsizing has become an accepted practice, frightening workers and making them less aggressive in asking for raises. And companies migrate much more often than in the past to reduce labor costs.
A tight labor market is the one wedge left for making wages outpace inflation. And recent months have tested just how low the unemployment rate must be for employers to raise pay or add hours because that is the only way to hire enough people. 
Four percent seems to be the magic number, or at least an unemployment rate headed toward that level, which Mr. Bernstein describes as the signal that the American economy is operating at full employment.
"Once unemployment begins to rise from 4 percent," he said, "wage growth below the median clearly slows."

Getting To Know You: America Fills Fox's Dance Card

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SOMETHING very curious is happening between the United States and Mexico: the countries are seriously talking about thorny issues like migration that for years had been the elephant at the party that no one wanted to discuss.
 American officials, for instance, had long criticized Mexico for turning a blind eye to border control problems. Mexico viewed migration as a fundamental right of its workers, who bolstered American industry and provided an escape valve for Mexico's own struggling economy. 
 But President Bush made President Vincente Fox's ranch his first foreign stop in February, and their personal friendship -- Mr. Bush had met Mr. Fox at least three times when Mr. Bush was governor of Texas -- has almost single-handedly transformed the tone of United States-Mexico relations. 
The two leaders have broken new ground in talks about trade, energy and fighting drug trafficking, and last Wednesday Cabinet-level officials from both governments met here and pledged to work on a broad set of proposals aimed at making the border safer for Mexican immigrants, expanding guest worker programs in the United States and creating new incentives to keep Mexicans from deserting their homeland for jobs in this country. 
To be sure, all of this has consequences for Mr. Bush. If Mr. Fox can succeed in stabilizing the border and strengthening the Mexican economy, for instance, the United States stands to gain a stronger trading partner, a safer, more secure, border and fewer problems with illegal immigration. But Mr. Fox, whose election ended decades of one-party rule in Mexico, has become a totem not just for Mr. Bush and the Republicans, but for the Democrats as well. Both parties seem to see in the Mexican president a rising star on the world stage, and a power broker whose ideas they can play for their own political advantage.
Republicans see Mr. Fox, a former Coca Cola executive, as a hard-nosed businessman out to fight corruption and drug trafficking, and promote free trade and less-onerous regulations. 
Democrats, for their part, underscore Mr. Fox's commitment to improving the lives of migrant farmworkers in America. Also, of university students in Mexico by providing them with high-speed Internet access to libraries worldwide. 
California's Democratic governor, Gray Davis, played host during Mr. Fox's two-day visit to the state last month, squiring the Mexican leader through Silicon Valley boardrooms (where Mr. Fox sought more high-technology investment and jobs in Mexico) and migrant rallies in farming communities. Mr. Davis is eager to shed California's anti-immigrant image, which grew under former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and from Proposition 187, the 1994 measure that sharply restricted benefits to undocumented immigrants. (Not to be outflanked on Mr. Fox's California visit, Mr. Bush dispatched First Lady Laura Bush to join Mr. Fox on a tour of an elementary school in the San Fernando valley.) 
"Fox is capable of being influential with the president, the Cabinet and the Congress, on all levels," said Representative Silvestre Reyes, a Texas Democrat who heads the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
Still, of all the issues driving the romance between Fox and the two parties, immigration remains the most prominent. Since Mr. Fox's inauguration, Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who supports expanding guest worker programs, and the Democrat-dominated Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which opposes Mr. Gramm's plan, have made pilgrimages to Mexico City to win Mr. Fox's blessing for their competing positions.
IN an unusual accord, farmers and labor unions struck a compromise late last year to gradually grant undocumented workers legal residency in exchange for expanding and streamlining the current temporary visa program that brings workers from Mexico for limited stays. But Mr. Gramm opposed the legalization component and scuttled the deal at the eleventh hour. 
Mr. Fox, sensing the political vise he could put himself in should he court either the Republicans or the Democrats too closely, has been careful to tell each side a little of what they want to hear without committing himself to a hard and fast position. By doing so, the Mexican president is maintaining the leverage he needs to continue wooing American lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on the issue on which his own popularity at home depends.
"Migration is the most fractious issue between these two countries," said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, director of the international migration policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "If they can show show real gains and create experiments where they test each other, then there will be a greater willingness to deliver on other promises." 
Mr. Fox is interested in Mr. Gramm's guest worker program as a way to allow Mexicans to come home with skills and money for the Mexican economy. But Mr. Fox also needs some sort of legalization plan to avoid alienating his liberal supporters in the United States. 
"If the purposes are in conflict, it could sink the whole deal," said Rick Swartz, an immigration advocate in Washington who has close ties to the Mexican government. 
For his part, Mr. Bush has signaled he wants some kind of deal on the guest worker issue, but has been cool to an amnesty, a politically charged term that has been banned from the Fox-Bush dialogue in favor of the deliberately vague word "regularize." 
But as Democrats and Republicans joust to court the Mexican president, Mr. Fox may see to it that the concept becomes the centerpiece of a new foreign policy. "The jury is still out on how far Fox will get on defining the interests of farmworkers, both documented and undocumented," said Ramon Ramirez, president of the Northwest Treeplanters and Farmworkers United, Oregon's farmworker union, in Woodburn, Ore. "But it's encouraging. A lot of people are watching."

Xiao Bushi on The Tiger

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Chinese may not feel superior to us in terms of economic power or fancy weapons.
 But when it comes to dynasties, the Middle Kingdom brooks no rivals. That is why the Celestial Empire decided to administer a lesson to the Kennebunk Empire. 
 When you are ruled by dynasties for 4,000 years, a family that produces two American presidents ruling for a mere four years and a couple of months is about as significant as a single stone in the Great Wall. 
To the Chinese, the Bushes are a puny dynasty.
The Bushes have hardly any old vases. Sure, they have a few ancient terra cotta warriors in the imperial court, but no known eunuchs or concubines. How can the dusty Crawford ranch compare to the ornate Summer Palace gardens of delight? How can the Vision Thing match up to the Mandate of Heaven? 
The Chinese custom of the kowtow -- prostrating oneself before the emperor -- supposedly went out with Mao. But the Chinee were determined to make the man they call "Bush Jr." or "Little Bush," translated as "Xiao Bushi," kowtow.
They have always liked his little dynasty and expected to get along well with the son of the pragmatic first Bush emperor, who lived in China and tried to learn its ways.
"The father of President Bush, Bush Sr., came over to China many, many times and had many meetings with me," President Jiang Zemin of China told The Washington Post two weeks ago. "We believe Bush Sr. will definitely push Bush Jr. to bring U.S.-China relations to a new level."
Big Bush often found himself in embarrassing spots with the Chinese. As the U.N. ambassador in 1971, he was leading an emotional fight to keep Taiwan from being expelled from the U.N., even as Henry Kissinge was making the first secret overtures toward Beijing, promising that President Nixon's goal was to have Taiwan expelled. (The Chinese press wrote that Mr. Bush's frenetic debating style resembled "ants on a hot pan.")
As president, Mr. Bush was hit with Tiananmen Square. Mr. Nixon counseled him, "Don't disrupt the relationship," and Mr. Kissinger defended the Chinese leaders. But friends of Big Bush, Patrick Tyler writes in "A Great Wall," worried that he was too sentimental toward Deng Xiaoping and too unemotional about the slaughtered students.
His son was caught last week in a similar vise, trying to be obsequious enough to China to win the release of the crew members and keep the relationship on track while voicing American anger over the detention.
W. devoted only one paragraph of his autobiography to his six-week trip to China after college to visit his parents when his father was envoy to Beijing. He wrote nothing about Chinese culture. He merely noted that the Chinese dressed alike -- "drab" -- and rode bikes that looked alike. He played Frisbee and jogged. The trip made him applaud free markets and long for Midland. 
Before his inauguration, W. seemed to be seriously pondering China for the first time. Asked by The Times's David Sanger if he was more concerned about a weak China or a strong China, the President-elect replied: "I'm trying to figure out if your question is a trick question."
Even before the U.S. spy plane was quarantined, the Chinese, like the Russians and Europeans, found the new Bush team less yin, more yang, less nuanced, more blunt.
Rummy and his even more hawkish deputy, Wolfy -- who were kept in the background last week -- managed to bring the Chinese and Russians closer together by dissing them both. Russia's power is no longer super, they say, so now we must put the new threat, China, in our crosshairs.
The Chinese must have mused, as Emperor Kangxi of the Qing dynasty wrote: "The arrogant dragon will have cause to repent."
China was willing to escalate the spy plane episode to signal how strongly it may react if Little Bush sells destroyers with Aegis radar to Taiwan, as conservatives demand.
The older dynasty understood the psychological Art of War, intending to rattle the little dynasty, diminishing Xiao Bushi before the conservative (but fickle) base he has s assiduously catered to. "President Bush has revealed weakness. And he has revealed fear," write Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan in The Weekly Standard, insisting Taiwan get its destroyers.
Like the terra-cotta warriors of Xian, the cold warriors of Little Bush are more fragile than they look.

HEADLINE: Working Hard, Doing Well, Less Than Excited About Bush's Tax Plan 

BYLINE:  By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: ALFRED, Me. 

 BODY:
In 1997, Steve Ducharme was carrying plasterboard when he heard something pop in his arm and felt something strange in his armpit. It was his biceps muscle, which had snapped and then sprung back into his armpit like a recoiling window shade. 
 That started the worst of bad times for Mr. Ducharme, a carpenter in this southern Maine town: unemployment, bankruptcy, a repossessed car, the works. 
 But four years later, these are the best of good times for Mr. Ducharme, 35; his wife, Lisa, 29; their three boys, and their two Rottweiler puppies. They have just moved into a four-bedroom house they cannot believe they actually own; he drives a new four-wheel-drive Ford truck; there is work galore for him, and his family can afford to do more on a Friday night than ride the $1 trolleys not far from the Bush compound in nearby Kennebunkport. 
In their past downs and current ups, economists say, the Ducharmes are typical of the American working-class family earning $30,000 to $50,000. They owned too little stock -- just a couple of thousand dollars in Mrs. Ducharme's 401K plan, which they pulled out when they needed it -- to benefit from the levitating market. But they have reaped a bonanza in pay raises and longer work hours thanks to the economy's prolonged vigor and low unemployment. 
The funny thing is that the Ducharmes' prosperity seems to dim their enthusiasm a bit for the tax cut proposed by President Bush. What matters most to them is to avoid a recession, but they say they are not certain the tax cut will do that. As for the tax dollars they would save, even though Mr. Ducharme goes without health insurance, he and his wife said they would rather see government money go to the truly needy than back into their own pockets. 
"If we have all this surplus, why do we have so many hungry kids and homeless people?" asked Lisa Ducharme, who earns about $20,000 a year working full time in a homeless shelter. "We have a roof over our heads, our kids are clothed, we have everything we need to live." 
"It's nice the working class will get some kind of benefit, but they should put more into the poor to help them get back on their feet and get back into the working class," Mrs. Ducharme said. "But right now they're not going to see a dime of it; how could they?"
The Ducharmes figured they would each probably get a few hundred dollars back under the Bush plan. In fact, they would benefit more: largely because of their three children and the president's proposal to double the tax credit from $500 to $1,000 on each child, they would reduce their basic tax bill by about $2,300, to only about $400, as calculated for The New York Times by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. 
But even when told about those additional savings, Lisa Ducharme seemed lukewarm. The added child credits made a lot of sense, she said, because children cost much more than $500 a year, and she would be glad to get that money. But what about a welfare mother who, given the money, "could take her child to McDonald's, something we all take for granted?"
The Ducharmes may be less excited than one might expect because they have recently reaped a much greater windfall, one that made more difference to their lives than a tax cut would. Last year, they were renting a two-bedroom trailer for $700 a month, wondering how they could get a mortgage with a bankruptcy in their history, and thinking without enthusiasm that they should perhaps add a room to the trailer. 
Luckily for them, Mrs. Ducharme had noticed a house on Shaker Pond in Alfred that sat empty for years. She had dreamed of living there, though there was no sign that the house was for sale. She managed to get the owner's unlisted number on Cape Cod and called him up. He talked to the Ducharmes, decided they would take good care of the house and, to make a long story short, sold it to them for $160,000 when he could probably have gotten more than $200,000.
That gap between price and value persuaded the bank to give the family a mortgage big enough to cover a new truck for Mr. Ducharme's work as well, and after months of work on floors and walls and ceilings long neglected, the Ducharmes moved in this February. 
"My parents were factory workers," Mr. Ducharme said. "I never dreamed in this life I'd have anything this nice. I take a walk out back and ask, 'What am I doing here?' " 
Mrs. Ducharme, meanwhile, has worked at the shelter since 1994, but her initial salary was $6.30 an hour, compared with the $11 she makes now. Mr. Ducharme makes $25 an hour. A few years ago he made $18.
Most working-class families have not seen such generous raises; in fact, economists say, the rise in income that families in the Ducharmes' bracket have seen comes largely from increased work hours rather than from pay raises. 
The current edition of "The State of Working America," a book published by the Economic Policy Institute, says incomes for households like the Ducharmes' dropped slightly between 1990 and 1995, and have risen by about 2.5 percent since 1995. But average wages went up by only 1 percent, so the rest of that increase must have come largely from extra work hours. A typical middle-income family, the book points out, worked 247 hours, or about six weeks, more in 1998 than it had in 1989.
"It's very good news that we got back to family incomes rising nearly as rapidly as they did during the booming Vietnam War days," said Barry Bluestone, a labor economist at Northeastern University. "However, this time it has come at the expense of rather dramatic increases in hours of work; the earlier time it came out of a much larger increase in wages." 
Indeed, the Ducharmes work hard. Lisa Ducharme worked at the shelter right until she delivered her two younger sons, Nick, nearly 3, and Josh, 11 months. Her oldest son, Kevin, is 12. Steve Ducharme often has to take "carpenter's holidays" when the weather is bad, but he has been averaging 45 hours of work a week lately. He tries to keep his hours down to preserve time with his family, but he is also well aware that the good times may not last. 
The bankruptcy showed his vulnerability. After his biceps snapped, he needed an operation, and without insurance that meant $6,000 out of pocket. He could not work at full strength for months. The bills piled up until the pile toppled over. For a while, when Lisa was pregnant with Nick, she would put off prenatal doctor's appointments because under her insurance plan she had to pay for them herself and then be reimbursed, and she lacked the cash. 
"That was an awful, awful time," she said. 
For such families, Professor Bluestone noted, what is most critical is to prevent a recession that would cut their hours of work. What they need most is an economic measure, whether a tax cut or an idea he prefers -- a quick $500 "prosperity rebate" to every taxpayer -- to prevent such a recession. 
It has only been in the last couple of years, Mr. Ducharme said, that he has gotten back to making the kind of money he made in the late 1980's, before the last recession. The current economic slowdown is not affecting him yet, he said. "But believe me, the worries are there. You watch it on the news and it's 'Oh, no, not again!' No, just give me a few years!"
The Ducharmes, both high school graduates and the children of factory workers, are not politically active. Mr. Ducharme voted for George W. Bush mainly because he liked the first President George Bush and because he wanted to punish the Clinton administration for what he saw as its sleaziness. Mrs. Ducharme voted for Vice President Al Gore because she liked Bill Clinton's job performance.
Mr. Bush's promised tax cut influenced neither of them, they said, because they did not believe it would happen. But now they say they are disturbed by the analyses showing that the tax cut will benefit the rich far more than it will benefit the poor or the middle class. 
"They'll give back billions to the rich people," Mrs. Ducharme said. "It's not going to the economy." The tax cut will benefit her family, she said, but the money will probably just be eaten up by house expenses or back taxes and make no real difference in their standard of living.
She remembers the shame, she said, of having a pink lunch ticket, showing that her lunch, unlike most of the other children's, was subsidized because her family was poor. If the tax-cut money went to the poor, she said, parents could pay for children who cannot now afford to go on school field trips or learn to play an instrument, and save them the humiliation of a pink lunch ticket.
"Why should any child have to go through that?" she asked.
This is the last article in a series about how taxpayers at varying income levels would be affected by the Bush tax cut proposal.

HEADLINE: Senate Takes Small Step Toward Health Coverage for Uninsured 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
The Senate took a small step toward reducing the number of people without health insurance this week when it called for spending an additional $28 billion over three years to cover adults with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid.
 The Oregon senators, Ron Wyden and Gordon H. Smith, Democrat and Republican respectively, proposed the change in the budget resolution, and it was adopted without dissent. But without the detailed legislation that the resolution called on the Finance Committee to develop, there was no clear sense of how many people would be covered. 
 The range of individuals to be covered, assuming that the provision survives a House-Senate conference on the budget resolution, would depend on the level of benefits to be provided and what sort of federal-state matching formula was established. Mr. Wyden said, "We think you can get meaningful help to about 15 million people," or more than one-third of the approximately 42.5 million uninsured.
But Diane Rowland, vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said she believed the money could reach two million to five million people. Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, said, "Without sounding callous toward the many millions of uninsured who aren't helped by this amendment, it's clear that it will provide coverage to more than several million people who don't have any health insurance, and that's a big step in the right direction." 
Mr. Smith told the Senate that the budget surplus presented a special opportunity. "We are trying to say, in this great society, that we can narrow this uninsured gap," he said. "I believe if we can't do it now, we will never be able to do it."
Senator Wyden cited the slowing economy, saying, "For the Congress not to respond now at a time when there are layoffs, when there is great fragility in our economy, for this Congress not to respond to the needs of the uninsured is, in my view, nothing short of government malpractice."
No one spoke against the proposal, which was first adopted without dissent Thursday and ultimately incorporated into the resolution passed Friday. 
Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, supported the amendment but also said more was needed. "This funding will help," he said. "But we need to go further. We need quality care for all, which means universal health care coverage."
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, argued that one use for the additional money would be to add adults to the Children's Health Insurance Program, enacted in 1997 to cover children from families with incomes just above Medicaid eligibility levels. And Mr. Smith said the measure could also be used to help businesses reduce the costs of insurance for low-income employees.
Several senators said that health policy has been largely deadlocked since 1994, when President Bill Clinton's national health insurance program died in Congress. 
The idea of expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program has been welcomed in the House by Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican from Connecticut, who heads the Ways and Means Committee's health subcommittee.
But Representative Johnson has also emphasized the importance of using tax credits to help the uninsured buy coverage, a measure proposed by President Bush. Mr. Bush has called for $72 billion for that purpose over 10 years.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: MISSILES AND THREATS; 
CHINA BUILDUP PUTS TAIWAN ON EDGE

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: CHIAYI AIR BASE, Taiwan 

 BODY:
The collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet has focused attention on China's military buildup. But none of the pilots at this air base in southern Taiwan need any reminders.
 With the Chinese mainland just 100 miles away, Taiwan's F-16 fighter aircraft roar into the air to patrol the uneasy Taiwan Strait. Their Chinese counterparts, in turn, take to the air in SU-27's and other Russian-designed fighters. 
 "We have a fuzzy peace," said the deputy commander of the F-16 squadron here, who asked to be identified only by his pilot's call sign, "Benson" Kao. "Recently, they have been flying a lot." 
China has steadily expanded its arsenal of missiles, aircraft, submarines and destroyers over the last several years as its economy has grown. Much of that buildup is aimed squarely at Taiwan. In fact, the midair collision near Hainan island arose in the context of Beijing's efforts to extend its reach in the air and seas around the Taiwan Strait and beyond, and the intensified American efforts to monitor the Chinese buildup. 
Whatever the outcome of the dispute over the collision, China and the United States are increasingly likely to jostle for dominance in the region, and in particular over Taiwan's fate. 
China has objected vociferously to the United States' sale of sophisticated weapons to Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province. The Bush administration is scheduled to decide on a package of arms sales later this month. 
President Bush, in his campaign for the White House, put Beijing on notice that the United States would come to Taiwan's assistance if it was attacked, going far beyond the ambiguous assurances made by previous presidents. "It's important for the Chinese to understand that if there's a military action, we will help Taiwan defend itself," Mr. Bush said. 
China's strategy behind its buildup along the Taiwan Strait is two-fold. First and foremost, it is a form of political pressure to compel Taiwan to accept Beijing's sovereignty. And it is also a way to frighten the United States from coming to Taiwan's aid by raising the specter of American casualties.
But there is also a military strategy that draws on lessons China absorbed from the United States' success in the Persian Gulf war. If Beijing decided force was needed, the aim would be to use long-range weapons to shock Taiwan into submission and win decisively at a low cost. The victory also has to come quickly -- before Washington can decide whether it wants to take the risk of intervening militarily.
"China would not try to destroy the economy or kill the population, and it is unlikely they would launch an all-out amphibious attack," said Parris H. Chang, a defense specialist and legislator in President Chen Shui-bian's Democratic Progressive Party. "They would try to destroy our will to resist and then call for negotiations."
The centerpiece of China's new arsenal is its force of short-range ballistic missiles, which are at three bases in or near Fujian province along the Taiwan Strait: Yongan, Leping and the newest at Xianyou.
American intelligence officials estimate that there are about 300 CSS-6 and CSS-7 missiles, which have the range to blanket the island. Taiwanese military officials put the number of missiles higher, at 400 or more. The main targets would be Taiwan's radars, command posts, airfields, ports, fuel depots and power plants.
The weapons, however, are very inaccurate and would do well to land 300 to 600 meters from their target. Still, the Chinese are beginning to incorporate improved guidance systems that rely on information from satellites.
According to American intelligence, China only has about 50 mobile launchers, which limits the size of each salvo and could leave an hour or more between each. That could be enough time for Taiwan to repair its runways and keep its air force flying, assuming its military made the necessary but unglamorous investments in such maintenance programs.
In addition to missiles, China has more than 4,000 warplanes. But few are modern fighters. China has acquired about 50 SU-27 fighters from the Russians and is planning to buy almost 200 more. It has also deployed about 10 SU-30 Russian-made attack planes and is expected to deploy as many as 50. 
But Chinese pilots have never practiced flying in formations greater than 20 planes, and in general China's pilots receive far less training than those in Taiwan, which also has a greater number of top-line fighters.
Other military options are more problematic. China does not have a convincing capability to conduct an amphibious assault across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's coastline is unsuitable for such a landing, and China has only enough military craft to move about 10,000 troops, far too few to seize the island. 
Nor would it be easy to mount an airtight blockade. China has only two supply vessels that can carry fuel and water to the ships that would be enforcing the quarantine, and only one ship that can transport munitions. And the longer a blockade takes to put in place, the more time the United States has to intervene.
Still, Taiwan's military experts worry that a missile attack could frighten and demoralize the population while China's submarines and ships placed added pressure on the island by mining harbors.
Tyson G. Fu, the director of the Institute of Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Taiwan, said the Chinese People's Liberation Army was "good at finding its enemies' weak points and exploiting them." 
Aware that Taiwan lacks an effective missile defense, the Chinese are brandishing their missile threat. "China's missiles may be more of a psychological threat than a military one," Mr. Fu said, "but sometimes psychological threats can be more powerful."
A senior Taiwanese official said the island's best hope would be to defend against China's first blows and hold out until the United States had time enough to decide to intervene -- perhaps several weeks.
Much of China's buildup, then, has been acquired with the intention of making the United States at least think twice about getting involved in a fight over Taiwan.
To deter Washington from dispatching carrier battle groups to the region, China has bought four Russian Kilo-class submarines. The submarines can operate using their diesel engines or batteries, which makes them quiet and hard to detect.
China has also bought two Russian-made Sovremenny-class destroyers. The ships are equipped with a sea-skimming antiship missile, a major worry for both Taiwan and the United States. But China has little capability to find targets at sea at long-range, and the Sovremenny destroyers have no real way to defend against submarines.
While most analysts believe the United States Navy could decisively defeat the Chinese fleet, Beijing is calculating that the prospect of American casualties would temper Washington's commitment to Taiwan's security.
Nobody in the region is eager for a war, least of all the Chinese, who are intent on developing their economy, absorbed with internal political struggles and hopeful of winning international acceptance by hosting the 2008 Olympics.
"China has a political strategy toward Taiwan with a military component, not vice versa," said James Mulvenon of the Rand Corporation. "The best option for the Chinese military is to win without fighting. The second best is to win by brandishing the swords or with low levels of military activity. The next to worst option is to fight an all-out war and win, and the absolute worst is to fight a war and lose. That would mean de facto independence for Taiwan and the end of the regime in Beijing."
Still, Beijing has not hesitated to rattle its sabers to press Taiwan to accept that it is part of China. During Taiwan's 1996 presidential election campaign, when China believed that the island was beginning to drift away politically, China fired missiles close to Taiwan's two major ports: the northern port of Keelung and the southern port of Kao-hsiung, where most of Taiwan's fleet is based. And many analysts believe that Beijing is prepared to attack Taiwan should it declare its independence.
Taiwan's leaders say the island needs to have a credible military force and close ties to the United States to stand up to Beijing's pressure. An acceptable political arrangement leading to greater integration between the two sides may eventually be possible, they say, but not at the point of a gun and only if Beijing moves toward democracy. 
The result has been a slow-motion arms race as China buys arms from Russia and Taiwan seeks to counter by buying weapons from the United States. And as the United States' commitment to Taiwan's defense has become less unambiguous, Taiwan's leaders have begun to argue that Washington's credibility in the region is linked to Taiwan security.
"There is no one-shot solution," said Pi-chao Chen, Taiwan's vice defense minister, of Taiwan's relations with China. "There is only an evolutionary process with an open-ended outcome. If we can succeed in deterring China from ever taking a punch, that will not only serve our interests. It will also serve the interest of China, Japan and America."

HEADLINE: Environmental Rollbacks 

 BODY:
Republican moderates are exasperated by President Bush's posture on environmental issues. They are not alone. In less than three months Mr. Bush has begun to remind people of the country's last genuinely anti-environmental president, Ronald Reagan. But where Mr. Reagan's attitude was one of careless indifference -- "You've seen one redwood, you've seem 'em all," was a typical Reaganism -- Mr. Bush's retreat on isses as large as global warming and as localized as poisoned drinking water seems aggressively hostile. 
 It could also be politically ruinous. The president says he must soften environmental rules to prevent a recession. He thus revives the historically insupportable notion that economic progress and environmental protection are incompatible. Further, Mr. Bush appears to have forgotten that Republicans inevitably self-destruct when they challenge environmental values that command public support. Newt Gingrich's hard-line agenda on everything from clean water to endangered species in the mid-1990's succeeded only in energizing the Democrats and persuading Bill Clinton to embark on the aggressive program of wilderness protection that Mr. Bush now seeks to repudiate. 
 If there has been any unifying theme to Mr. Bush's policies, it has been his eagerness to please the oil, gas and mining industries -- indeed, extractive industries of all kinds. The oil and coal mining companies helped shape his decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol on climate change as well as his earlier reversal of a campaign pledge to impose mandatory limits on carbon dioxide. These were hasty and ill-conceived decisions that have essentially left the United States without a policy on a matter of global importance. 
The mining industry also had a hand in two other rollbacks. One was a decision to withdraw a Clinton rule that reduced by 80 percent the permissible standard for arsenic in drinking water. The other was a decision by Interior Secretary Gale Norton to suspend important new regulations that would require mining companies to pay for cleanups and, for the first time, give the Interior Department authority to prohibit mines that could cause "irreparable harm" to the environment.
Mr. Bush seems to be backing off his plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, in part because Congress will not support him. But other sensitive and ecologically significant areas, particularly in the Rocky Mountains, remain vulnerable. Ms. Norton has targeted some 17 million acres of land, in 11 Western states, now designated as wilderness study areas. Mr. Bush is prepared to open up the 19 national monuments created by Mr. Clinton. And the administration has signaled a retreat on Mr. Clinton's most ambition conservation measure -- a Forest Service rule protecting nearly 60 million acres of largely untouched national forest from new road building, new oil and gas leasing and most new logging.
Killing that plan would represent a big victory not only for the timber companies but also for the the oil and gas industries. Although the roadless areas contain less than 1 percent of the nation's oil and gas resources, the energy companies have long had the forests in their sights. During his distinguished tenure as Mr. Clinton's Forest Service chief, Mike Dombeck managed to keep the drillers at bay. But Mr. Dombeck has now retired to private life, along with nearly every other friend of the environment from the Clinton administration. With few exceptions, they have been replaced by industry lobbyists and hard-edged advocates of development. It will be Congress's job to hold the line against them.

To the Editor:
 Re "Turning Niagara Falls Around" (news article, April 4): 
 I was born and raised in Niagara Falls, N.Y. My dad was employed by one of the chemical companies that polluted the city and then fled. 
After Dad died, Mom moved us out.
The city is besieged by high cancer rates, high crime rates, water and air pollution run amok, and public corruption.
The city is looking across to Canada for inspiration on development ideas -- casinos, hotels, tourist traps. Bad idea. The casino would lead to more crime -- of a different sort -- and the tacky tourist places would come off as a weak imitation of the pros in Canada. People would still find their way to the other side.
A better idea would be to buy up everything from the Niagara River to Hyde Park Boulevard and then turn the area into a national or a state park. Much of this downtown area is now boarded up anyway. Compensate people fairly. Tear down the decaying industrial sites. Clean them up.
Make the place into Yellowstone East, where people can camp by the river, see the stars again and wake up to a misty shower from the roaring wonder. Then people would flock back to our side. You can bet on it.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
The steamy side of the Internet, pervasive and resilient to recession, is the underpinning of a new online cash venture.

BYLINE:  By John Schwartz 

 BODY:
WITH the dark clouds of hard times filling the skies, many high-technology companies are cutting back and hunkering down. But some brave entrepreneurs are continuing to innovate. Take Duocash, a New York company that is pursuing one of the fondest longtime dreams of technology entrepreneurs and privacy advocates alike: anonymous, secure payments over the Internet. 
 One of the biggest stumbling blocks for such systems so far has been to come up with a form of online cash that businesses and customers will actually use. Duocash has found a way around the problem -- it uses prepaid telephone long-distance cards, a system already in widespread use. 
 And what was the first Web company to sign up with Duocash? Entertainment Network Inc., which runs thousands of so-called "adult" sites. The company, based in Florida, made headlines a couple of years ago by introducing "Voyeur Dorm," a Web precursor to reality television programs like "Survivor" and "Big Brother." 
The interest of an adult-entertainment company should come as no surprise, according to Bruce Fancher, the vice president for marketing at Duocash. "They're always the first," he said. "This industry has led the market in new technologies."
There aren't many industries that can call themselves recession-proof, but pornography companies can make the argument more credibly than most. Over all, X-rated Web sites continue to grow, according to figures tallied by analysts at Jupiter Media Metrix. 
The number of individual visitors at such sites grew more than 27 percent from December 1999 to February this year -- to nearly 28 million from 22 million. In the same period, retail sites measured by Jupiter Media Metrix showed growth of less than half that rate, edging up to 55 million from nearly 49 million.
And the adult-content companies have profit margins that their owners cheerfully acknowledge are obscene. Though not being too specific, Gerard Vanderleun, director of the online site for Penthouse magazine and vice president for Internet ventures at the parent company, General Media, says that the Web sites' profit margins "would be well above 50 percent and well below 200 percent."
Or, as Entertainment Network's founder, David Marshlack, put it, "It's almost like I owned a bank and was printing my own money."
One reason the online fleshpots can weather recession is that they don't depend on income from what has become one of the biggest problem areas for other kinds of sites. "We don't rely on advertising," said Bill Asher, who heads the Vivid Entertainment Group, a company that produces X-rated videos and owns a cable channel and Web sites. Like many of the adult-content producers, Vivid Entertainment's Web sites charge a subscription fee.
Of course, no company is totally immune to the business cycle, Mr. Vanderleun of General Media acknowledged. "We're still making profits," he said, "but it's not what it used to be."
The 45 percent growth curve the sites enjoyed in 1999, he said, look "more like a 25 percent curve today." That has led to General Media's version of belt tightening.
"We're not laying off anyone, but it's not as easy for me to get authorization to hire two more people," Mr. Vanderleun said.
The reason for the slowdown, Mr. Vanderleun suggests, is the decline of the kind of extravagance that marked the last few years. Web surfers who thought nothing of having high-speed Internet connections, which make the photograph-rich pornography sites more attractive, are harder to find. Now consumers are paying more attention to their budgets, and that sometimes means going back to less expensive, plain old telephone modem connections -- and those people "don't look at a $20-to-$25-a-month Web site as something they can afford anymore."
He said his company had recently introduced $10, two-day memberships to meet the new realities of a tougher marketplace. 
The adult companies are also profiting from the misfortunes of other Internet concerns, said Mr. Asher of Vivid Entertainment. He said he had noticed the greatest change when it came to hiring technical talent. 
"Now it's easier to afford the Internet guys," he said. "I don't have to pay some 27-year-old $250,000 to get him to talk to me. You had to have a basketball court in their office and a Ping-Pong table to keep them." The company is taking advantage of the economic lull and the bumper crop of available technical talent to begin digitizing its archive of movies and prepare for the next generation of high-speed Internet delivery, when customers will want to download and view whole films.
Mr. Marshlack, meanwhile, has expanded Entertainment Network beyond naked men and women to include other ventures. One is askoj.com, the site formed to allow people to pay for the privilege of communicating with O. J. Simpson. Another is Second Stroke, a site that sells used golf balls. 
But Mr. Marshlack said that there was something special about pornography, a business he compared to the bar he used to own. "During recessions," he said, "people still drink." The adult entertainment business, he added, provides the kind of cash flow that lets him operate nimbly and without debt.
Meanwhile, innovations like the Duocash deal help address credit card fraud, the biggest problem facing pornography sites. The industry has a high percentage of "chargebacks," or cancellations by credit card holders who claim that they did not authorize a purchase. In many cases, site owners complain, the credit card holder did in fact use his own credit card on a late-night pornography cruise but canceled the charge in the remorse of day; others cancel when their spouses confront them with the strange charges, Mr. Fancher of Duocash said. 
Duocash estimates that $5.2 billion is currently stored on phone cards, which can be bought at kiosks, in convenience stores and elsewhere. Consumers buy the cards and make their long-distance calls through an "800" number and then punch in a number found on the card. The Duocard system simply requires users to enter the same number into a form on the participating Web site, and bills the calling-card company.
Duocash, Mr. Fancher said, plans to expand into many markets, not just the X-rated one. "We don't want to be the porn card," he said.
But pornography companies, he added, move very quickly. "If it's a corporation, you have to go through a committee and the vice president and all the usual nonsense," Mr. Fancher said. "Where with these guys, it's 'great, let's do it.' "
And that might partly explain why, even as the new economy falters, the nude economy keeps going strong.

HEADLINE: Talks Are Stalled as the Deadline Comes Closer 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 8 

 BODY:
As April begins to edge toward May 1, the deadline in contract negotiations by the writers of Hollywood films and television series and the studios and networks that buy their scripts, there is growing concern about when the stalled talks will resume and whether there will be enough time to forge an agreement before the deadline hits.
 The talks broke down last month after six weeks of closed-door negotiations. The guild president, John Wells, said the union felt it was time to consult with members and initiated a series of informational gatherings in key cities around the country. At the same time, top officials from both sides invited journalists to briefings during which they tried to make a case for their own reasonableness and the other side's intransigence. 
 There were many charts and many numbers. Union officials said their demands were not only fair, but a drop in the bucket to modern entertainment conglomerates, amounting to an 11.3 percent boost in residual payments over the three years of the deal. Management leaders said that the writers' demands, if extrapolated across all the unions that would eventually be covered, would create $1.6 billion in new costs and effectively bankrupt the studios.
But the basic issue remains unchanged: residuals, the amount of money that writers are paid for subsequent use of shows and films based on their scripts after the initial theatrical run or television broadcast.
The two sides are in basic agreement about the numbers involved and the gap between their respective offers. Where they seem to diverge is in the way they describe how these numbers would actually affect union members and the entertainment industry.
The union is seeking increases, most particularly in the size of residuals its members are paid for videocassettes and DVD's and for foreign sales of films and television shows, areas that have become increasingly profitable since the union's current residual formulas were negotiated decades ago. Management officials say this would further erode shrinking profit margins and make it more difficult, if not impossible, to make money amid burgeoning production costs in an increasingly risky entertainment business.
Publicly, both sides have remained optimistic about prospects for a settlement, and there has been a growing chorus in the entertainment community warning that the current economic downturn may not be the best moment for either side to take down the whole industry. Despite all this saber-rattling, it is widely expected that the talks between the writers and management will resume relatively amicably after the middle of the month. And, with the country's economic woes increasing, there is growing optimism that neither side will have the stomach to take Hollywood out on strike.
But both are floating ominous warnings about what might happen if there is no settlement.
Among the veiled threats are that the unions, if there is a strike, could sign interim agreements with independent production companies that are not part of the negotiations and allow them to continue shooting films. This has happened in the past.
Amir Malin, chief executive of Artisan Entertainment, an independent company, said that he would certainly entertain the notion but would have to see the terms of the agreement. If the writers and, later, the actors insisted that the unions' current negotiating terms be used, that might not be attractive. But if, instead, companies signing interim agreements were only required to adhere to the eventual agreement in the negotiations, that might be very attractive. 
Potential management-side threats include allowing writers or actors to resign from their unions and continue working under federal rulings that permit such moves, as long as the new nonmembers continue paying union dues. Few at this point expect it to go that far, but it is not a far-fetched prospect -- it has happened in past labor impasses.
A more immediate threat, though, is something that Robert Iger, president of Walt Disney, has taken pains to mention at every news conference and media briefing. The television networks submit their fall programs to advertisers at the so-called upfront meetings in New York beginning on May 14. That means, Mr. Iger said, that around May 10 each network must decide on their fall season lineup, and it is highly unlikely they will stock it full of new, scripted series if there is a strike or if the talks remain locked. 
Instead, a lot of slots will likely go to news divisions or to reality programming, and it may prove difficult to win that time back. Television executives have reminded that the most recent writers strike, in 1988, led to a huge increase in the percentage of prime time turned over to network news divisions for magazine-style programs.

New Battle Brews on Magazine Mail Rates

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
It's the magazine industry versus the post office, Round 2.
 Last year, the Magazine Publishers of America kicked up a fuss when the postmaster general, William J. Henderson, proposed a postal rate increase of 15 percent that would have applied to consumer magazines mailed to subscribers. At the time, publishers grumbled and started to think about alternate ways, like FedEx, to deliver their magazines to subscribers. 
 After a $10 million campaign waged by the group, the rate that finally went into effect on Jan. 1, 2001, was 9.9 percent. 
Now, the organization is lobbying again to stall another proposed rate increase that the post office is planning to announce this summer. This one, according to Nina Link, the president of the publishers group, could reach as high as 25 percent. 
The magazine industry feels particularly like a victim, Ms. Link said. 
"That kind of increase could cost us $500 million," she said. "It is an outrage." 
Price increases for consumer magazines have rarely if ever been proposed in two consecutive years. 
Greg Frey, a spokesman for the post office, said that postal economists had not yet decided how large an increase to propose. 
With declining sales at the newsstand and sinking advertising revenue, this is not a great year for the magazine industry, but times are also bad for the post office, which is facing a budget shortfall of $2 billion to $3 billion this year. Postal management is under pressure to cut administrative costs by 25 percent, and it has frozen capital spending this year, Mr. Frey said. 
"Factor into that the economy, which has gone into near-recession since late fall," Mr. Frey said. "We basically reflect the economy and our volumes and revenues have been considerably off. We are trying to stem the shortfall, but we are really slipping into a hole here."

Volkswagen revamps the Beetle campaign to be more informative.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
FOR only the second time since they brought back the offbeat Beetle in 1998, Volkswagen of America and its agency, Arnold Worldwide in Boston, are revamping the way it is marketed. The shift, evident in a television, print and Internet campaign that begins today, is emblematic of the changes made by auto makers when the economy starts to soften and enthusiasm flags among car buyers.
 In the campaign, Volkswagen of America, part of Volkswagen A. G., and Arnold, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas Advertising, are focusing far more on specific selling points of the New Beetle than they did in the two previous series of ads. The campaign, carrying the theme "Round for a reason," conveys information about practical elements of the Bug like interior space and safety equipment that was largely absent from the image-oriented campaigns of 1998 and 2000. Those tended more to toward photographs of New Beetles alongside funny, pithy headlines. 
 That emphasis on the rational rather than the emotional is typical of the approach automotive marketers take during downturns, when it becomes harder to convince car shoppers to part with suddenly scarcer dollars. Though in the Beetle's case, by no means does the humorous campaign revive the old-fashioned "hard sell" used during the recessions of the 1950's through the early 1990's. The reason? Consumers now typically insist on entertainment with their advertising; otherwise they will change the channel, turn the page or surf to another Web site.
Besides, the original Beetle campaign by the old Doyle Dane Bernbach agency, to which Arnold paid homage in the introductory work for the New Beetle, made fun of traditional auto pitches. So it would hardly be fitting for its successor to start yelling "New and improved!" or call on a president from Mount Rushmore to peddle the metal.
As signaled by the play on words in the theme -- "round" meaning "around" as well as round-shaped -- the new campaign is as slyly droll as its two predecessors. There are subtle sight gags in the television spots, as when a befuddled narrator misses by a moment glimpsing the New Beetle he was extolling. The print ads carry wry headlines like "Roomy. In a fun house, optical illusion sort of way." and "The crash test dummies were not only O.K., they wanted to do it again."
Also, the print ads and the pages on the Volkswagen of America Web site (www.vw.com) devoted to the New Beetle make claims in a tongue-in-cheek manner that parodies conventional car ads. For instance, one diagram shows that 9 laundry bags, 12 dachshunds or 970 coffee cups could fit inside a New Beetle, while another presents the dashboard as wide enough to display 13 statues of gyrating hula girls.
For all the levity, recent sales for the car are sobering, prompting the change in direction. After an explosive start, demand for the Bug slowed, then slumped.
From April 1998, when the New Beetle arrived, through December 1998, sales totaled 55,842, far higher than estimated, then climbed to 83,434 in 1999 -- second among all Volkswagen models behind only the Jetta. But in 2000, when total Volkswagen of America sales rose 12.6 percent from 1999, New Beetle sales declined 2.8 percent to 81,134.
Worse yet, for the first three months of 2001, Bug sales fell to 15,019, down 27.5 percent from the corresponding period in 2000.
The New Beetle "still remains a magnet for the brand," said Karen Swartz, advertising manager at Volkswagen of America in Auburn Hills, Mich. "When people think about Volkswagen, they think about the New Beetle. And buyers have a tremendous amount of satisfaction; loyalty rates are high."
But "what we're finding is people want to know more about the car," she added. "Hence our new campaign, that there's more to the car than meets the eye."
The campaign is also intended to counter negative perceptions found in consumer research, Ms. Swartz said, including comments "that it's small, with not much space inside."
"It's an adorable car," she added, "but it's also a well-engineered car, which is what VW is about." That's why some print ads depict, for the first time for the New Beetle, cutaway diagrams showing safety features and headroom dimensions.
"I've been working on the New Beetle since the beginning," said Alan Pafenbach, executive vice president and group creative director at Arnold, "and you can't help but notice how the car is shaped is its real essence."
"The first two campaigns were about the shape from the outside," he added. "This campaign is about the shape from the inside."
"The first word we got out about the New Beetle was 'Here's an unusual-looking car that will make you stand out from the crowd,' " he added. "I think we accomplished that."
"What else can we tell, the next part of the story, that it's a roomy, well-made car," he added, "that if you love it for the way it looks, it's also tight and solid."
The campaign is appearing in media outlets that reflect what Ms. Swartz described as the "pretty broad audience" that buys the New Beetle, mostly men and women ages 18 to 49. The commercials will run on national broadcast and cable networks as well as on local stations. The print ads will run in fashion, food, home and life style magazines.
As for spending, Ms. Swartz said, Volkswagen of America hopes to avoid another automotive tradition during downturns, that of drastically reducing ad budgets.
"Despite "the market being as it is," she added, "we'd like to remain strong in our spending and continue to support our brand."
While Ms. Swartz declined to discuss details, according to CMR in New York, formerly Competitive Media Reporting, Volkswagen of America spent $106.7 million last year to advertise the New Beetle, an increase of 218.6 percent from the $33.5 million spent in 1999.

How to Salvage Two Companies Buried in Debt

BYLINE:  By BARNABY FEDER and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Most of the headlines concerning the business ventures of the billionaire Craig O. McCaw in the last year have focused on his high-stakes maneuvering to pursue his dream of creating a satellite communications empire.
 But right now, Mr. McCaw also has pressing problems with his two major land-based telecommunications investments: Nextel Communications and Xo Communications. 
 Both are deeply indebted, rapidly expanding money-losing voice and data communications companies that, unlike the satellite ventures, are accountable to public shareholders, as well as bond and note holders. Before either Nextel or Xo have a chance of breaking even, they need to raise billions of dollars in new loans or equity to complete their ambitious development plans. 
A year ago, doubts about their ability to raise the money were offset by the McCaw mystique. After all, the visionary Seattle entrepreneur had become a legend for his ability to use borrowed money to expand his family's cable television business and then McCaw Cellular. In both cases, financing pressures eventually rose to the point the Mr. McCaw decided to sell, but investors who had hitched their fortunes to Mr. McCaw's vision profited handsomely. 
The sale of McCaw Cellular to AT&T for $11.5 billion in 1994 was particularly stunning. Some of Mr. McCaw's resulting fortune was plowed into rescuing Nextel, a nearly bankrupt wireless carrier that was attempting to break into the crowded cellular market using digital radio communications technology developed by Motorola. The successful revival of the company by managers Mr. McCaw installed after he gained control in 1995 added billions of dollars to the parterships and trusts he controls. 
In 1998, Mr. McCaw rounded up former McCaw Cellular executives to create Nextel Partners, an affiliate of Nextel Communications that extends its wireless technology to small and midsize cities. Nextel Partners raised more than $470 million in its own initial public offering last year. 
Meanwhile, Mr. McCaw had also founded and taken public NextLink Communications, a company based in Reston, Va., that started out as developer of fiber optic networks to provide phone and data services to business customers. After acquiring radio spectrum the government auctioned off for new wireless services and buying an Internet networking company, NextLink changed its name last fall to Xo Communications.
Both Nextel and Xo were organized with special classes of stock and management agreements that gave Mr. McCaw ultimate control. The reputations of Mr. McCaw and the executives he has recruited to work with him helped generate billions of dollars of investment from banks, fund managers and venture capitalists. Forstmann-Little alone put more than $1.2 billion into Xo and its affiliates.
In the last year though, investors have become increasingly cautious about the aggressive growth tactics of the McCaw-controlled companies. And in recent months, as the economy has slowed and numerous telecommunications companies have stumbled, the shares of the McCaw ventures have fallen to the point that institutional investors have begun to think the unthinkable. Could these companies eventually be forced into bankruptcy reorganization?
Nextel, which had $5.7 billion in revenues last year and more than 6.7 domestic subscribers, says it has roughly $7 billion in available financing and $14 billion in long-term debt. Although revenues are growing rapidly, analysts figure the company spent nearly $3 billion more than it brought in last year and may run up a similar cash shortfall this year. Last month, the company trimmed projections for subscriber growth in the current quarter to 500,000 from the previous forecast of 530,000 and said that cash from operations might be 15 percent lower than in the previous quarter.
The company also had to drop plans for a public offering to raise money for Nextel International, the wholly owned subsidiary for Nextel's overseas holdings, as investors fled the telecommunications sector. Many analysts figure Nextel could go well into 2003 without having to raise cash. But that assumes a round of cuts in the company's planned expansion and other belt-tightening. -- Such moves would save cash but could leave the company less competitive in the long run.
"Its prospects don't look as good as they did," said Frederick Moran, an analyst who follows Nextel for Jefferies & Company. "The stock got ahead of itself due to its seemingly endless growth prospects. But with the onslaught of competition, tight capital markets, and a possible recession, the company has lost some of its subscriber growth momentum."
With Nextel's shares down from $79.81 just over a year ago to $12.31 last Friday, The 11 percent stake in Nextel owned by Mr. McCaw's investment group is worth some $5 billion less. But his more immediate concern must be Xo, in which he and his partners have a 22 percent stake. Xo shares ended trading Friday at $3.31, down from their peak of $66.25 13 months ago.
Xo is on course to run out of cash within a year, and investors are nervously wondering what steps, if any, Mr. McCaw plans to support it. Mr. McCaw bought 29,500 shares at $17.48 a share early this year, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but a purchase of outstanding shares is not the kind of endorsement the investors have in mind. Xo's own projections, which may now be too optimistic, suggest a need for roughly $2.5 billion in new loans or equity to carry into 2005, the year it expects to start breaking even.
"I must have gotten over 100 calls from institutional investors wanting to know if he'll step up," Aryeh Bourkoff, a UBS Warburg debt analyst, said last Wednesday. That was the day after Xo's shares dipped below $3 and bad news was swirling about the financial woes of similarly debt-laden rivals like Teligent and Winstar. 'A funding gap is death in this market, " Mr. Bourkoff said.
Responding to the anxiety, Xo issued a statement late Wednesday attempting to reassure investors. Daniel Akerson, the company's chairman and chief executive, said that the company had $3 billion in cash available. That was enough, he said, to allow Xo to "weather the carnage that the telecommunications industry is now experiencing." Xo said it expected to be able to raise money in the future and to take advantage of the opportunities created by the current industry shakeout.
It seems unlikely, though that there will be a major infusion of cash from Mr. McCaw and his partners anytime soon. "It's not Craig's approach to just throw money at things," said Dennis Weibling, president of Eagle River, Mr. McCaw's investment holding company. "There is a lot you can do to adjust the burn rate." Mr. McCaw is actively involved in Mr. Akerson's effort to revise Xo's business plans to reduce the financing gap and delay the day it needs more cash, according to Robert Ratliffe, Mr. McCaw's spokesman.
Mr. McCaw has plenty of incentive to keep his companies afloat. As things stand now, Nextel and Xo have so much long-term and secured debt compared with the market value of their assets that his own equity interests might well become worthless in a bankruptcy reorganization. A lot of investors are hoping he has not lost his touch for engineering profitable escapes from tight financial corners.

HEADLINE: Fears on Privacy Law Spur Warning by Armey 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
A top Republican leader in the House is sending a strong message to lawmakers hoping to address the privacy worries of their constituents this year: go slow. 
 The message will be delivered today in a letter from the majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, to all House Republicans. 
 The letter's wording is both folksy and stern. "I don't want strangers poking around in my business any more than they want me poking around in theirs," Mr. Armey writes, but "in the fast-paced world of the Internet, we must avoid silver-bullet solutions that will quickly become obsolete or leave ourselves vulnerable to criticism that the government is not meeting the standards it requires from others." 
The letter, said Richard Diamond, a spokesman for Mr. Armey, is an attempt "to lay out this issue for members" and to show "the various traps and pitfalls that await on privacy issues if they do it wrong."
Few issues have risen to prominence as quickly as privacy. As Americans have gone online by the millions, they have become increasingly concerned over ways that their digital footprints can be traced, especially by companies that use personal data for marketing.
The Federal Trade Commission recommended that Congress legislate privacy standards for Web sites, and a number of lawmakers have filed bills intended to fill in the patchwork of privacy laws on the books. 
Mr. Armey's letter says that the new economy is a target that moves too fast for government to address with any competence. "Congress is an inexperienced and amateur mechanic trying to tinker with the supercharged, high-tech engine of our economy," it says. "We need to be careful not to let our good intentions get in the way of common sense." 
The leader of a technology industry trade group said the Armey statement was welcome. "I think the tide is turning away" from strong new privacy legislation, said Jonathan Zuck, head of the Association for Competitive Technology in Washington. A rush to pass poorly drafted privacy bills, Mr. Zuck said, would result in the introduction of "a host of unintended consequences without the benefits that they seek." 
But Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the United States Public Interest Research Group, said that the real purpose of the letter is to help business evade regulation and to prevent House Republicans from trying to bring new privacy bills forward.
"Really, the leadership is sending a message not only to the public, but also to the rank and file," Mr. Mierzwinski said. "It's clear to me that the K Street forces are out, and they are pushing their anti-privacy agenda, and they've convinced the leadership to make it their agenda." 
The letter from Mr. Armey tries to shift the privacy debate away from a focus on business excesses to those of government. He cites an October 2000 report by the General Accounting Office as saying that only 3 percent of federal Web sites met all standards proposed by the F.T.C.
"The government should review its own practices before it becomes too preachy about privacy." Mr. Armey wrote. 
He cited health privacy regulations issued by the Clinton administration, assailing the rules as violating citizens' privacy by giving the Department of Health and Human Services overly broad authority to collect medical records from regulated companies. 
The Bush administration's secretary of health and human services, Tommy G. Thompson, has announced that he will delay and reconsider the rules.

HEADLINE: Income-Tax Enforcement Is Broadly Declining, New U.S. Data Indicate 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Broad enforcement efforts against individual taxpayers by the Internal Revenue Service have fallen by half or more since the early 1990's, according to new data from the Justice Department and the I.R.S. 
 The tax agency has become much less likely to question those with unreported income, to take taxpayers to court or to seize their property. For example, the I.R.S. took civil court action in 641 cases against recalcitrant taxpayers last year, down from 2,519 in 1992. 
 The figures on enforcement come from a study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which was released yesterday. 
The report confirmed that audit rates are also down sharply, to one in 204 for taxpayers with incomes of more than $100,000, not adjusting for inflation, from one in 9 in 1989. The study also showed that the audit rates vary a great deal by region, both for both individuals and corporations. 
These findings came three days after the Senate Finance Committee was told that the I.R.S. had become so weak and ineffective that hundreds and perhaps thousands of promoters are marketing tax frauds, especially over the Internet.
The criticism of the I.R.S. as ineffective contrasted with Congressional criticism of I.R.S. zealousness in 1997 and 1998, fueling restrictions on the agency's enforcement and leading to a new emphasis on taxpayer service. 
Charles O. Rossotti, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, did not challenge the new study's findings. 
In a recent letter to the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Rossotti said that without more personnel, the I.R.S. could not pursue many issues raised in computer checks of tax returns and as the result of information reported by employers, banks and other sources of income. 
The I.R.S. took action in 1998 in only one of every six cases where its computers showed income from employers and others that was not reported on tax returns, down from pursuit of almost two-thirds of such cases in 1991, the latest data show. 
Correction notices, which ask taxpayers to explain discrepancies in their reports, or to pay additional taxes, were sent to 1.4 million taxpayers last year, down from 4.8 million in 1991, the study indicated.
Actions to seize property from taxpayers have all but halted, the study said, falling to 174 last year from more than 11,000 in 1991. Criminal prosecutions have fallen by half since 1992, to about 50 cases a month.
Audit rates varied substantially by region, the study found. Just one in 588 taxpayers in Georgia with incomes of $100,000 or more was audited last year. The audit rates for taxpayers with such incomes in upstate New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, Virginia, West Virginia and in metropolitan Houston were all about one in 400, or less. The strongest such audit rate occurred in Los Angeles -- one in 69. 
The drop in I.R.S. efforts to enforce the tax laws is not limited to individuals. Last year, the I.R.S. audited 31 percent of the largest corporations, down from 55 percent in 1992, the Syracuse University analysis showed.
In addition, the I.R.S. appears to be concentrating its resources on fewer corporations. The number of hours devoted to such corporate audits fell by just 9 percent, suggesting that the search for major corporate tax-evasion schemes is consuming a big share of the dwindling I.R.S. capacity to audit such businesses.
The agency also treated companies differently, based on where they were situated. For example, in upstate New York from 1997 to 1999, three of four of the biggest corporations were audited each year, while only one in five in Delaware and Maryland bore such scrutiny. 
"These differences mean that the big companies in upstate New York have a real economic disadvantage, compared with those in areas of the country where corporate audit rates were far lower," said David Burnham, co-director of the Syracuse University clearinghouse, which gathers data on how a variety of federal agencies operate.
The new data also suggest that the I.R.S. could deploy its corporate auditing staff more efficiently, Mr. Burnham said. Auditors in upstate New York are asked to recommend less in additional corporate payments per hour than auditors elsewhere, he said. 
Terry Lemons, an I.R.S. spokesman, said that the discrepancy in audit rates might reflect issues affecting different industries rather than any difference in the vigor of agency audits in different regions.

Those who want to control information find an ally in a public that seems to accept restrictions.

BYLINE:  By Felicity Barringer 

 BODY:
NEWSPAPERS' basic needs are simple. They need money for presses, paper and workers. They need readers, the better to get advertising revenue. They need information, the better to get readers.
 At this year's relatively somber convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington, the public and private conversations indicated that there was less of everything. Less advertising revenue is likely to mean circulation price increases -- which tend to accelerate a decline in circulation, which has been dropping for 15 years. 
 But as nasty as the budget numbers are, the forces involved are familiar. What is happening with information is new. With more of it available than ever before, the ranks of those trying to control and limit information have rapidly expanded, and the public appears willing to accept new restrictions. People are more worried about their own privacy -- say, the confidentiality of medical records -- than abstractions about the public's right to know.
What is going on? It is partly a privacy backlash created by the Internet-driven, exponential growth in accessible information. It is also the new economics of the information age, which gives increasing value to all kinds of things, from real estate prices to voter registration lists to the photographic images or the play-by-play facts from sports events. 
And it is partly the perennial desire of government and business to avoid embarrassment or damage to their assets -- desires codified in nondisclosure agreements in business, in legislation passed by Congress last fall but vetoed by President Bill Clinton, which would have made it a felony to reveal "properly classified" information. Not to mention the sporadic resistance or delay that greets information requests that should be routine under freedom of information laws.
President Bush, asked by an editor about information restrictions, said, "There needs to be balance when it comes to freedom of information laws." He said that his administration would cooperate with such a request "when it does not jeopardize national security." 
There was nothing in the answer that foreclosed the president's options, should the C.I.A.-backed antileaker bill make a comeback. 
But for all the concern about that legislation, the legal ground on which it can be fought is well trodden, defined by things like whistle-blower protection laws and the Supreme Court's decision in 1971 to permit The New York Times to resume publication of a secret government history of the Vietnam War.
The legal ground of the new information battles is less familiar. The dispute between Major League Baseball and newspapers over who controls the use and the transmission of game photographs is rooted in intellectual property law and contract law -- the contract, in this case, being the press credential used by photographers to enter the stadium.
The fight, which appears near resolution, involves the limits professional baseball seeks to place on things like the use of game photographs for other commercial uses, like posters. In the early stages, it involved the suggestion that teams could use newspaper photographs for their own commercial purposes, for a token fee, and that they had a right to restrict the transmission of play-by-play facts during a game.
Noting that most sports teams and leagues have Web sites and, like many Web site owners, are trying to figure out how to make money online, several journalists on a panel about sports credentials pointed out that the leagues, as publishers, were restricting their publishing competitors. After all, someone following a game on the Web is likely to go to the site with the freshest information and best photographs.
Those arguing on the league's side have said that the credentials issue is unrelated to Internet concerns. "Internet issues are not central to anything that is going on," said Bob Bowman, the president and chief executive of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, in a panel discussion at the editors' meeting.
During last fall's Olympic Games, Internet concerns -- and the desire to protect the lucrative broadcast rights owned by NBC and others networks -- were paramount for the International Olympic Committee when it barred athletes from keeping online diaries for Web sites of their hometown newspapers. The Internet was the backdrop for the National Basketball Association's unsuccessful court fight to keep Motorola and a sports data service from sending game information to their subscribers' pagers.
Rich Jaroslovsky, the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal Online and president of the Online News Association, said that his core worry was that, whatever the motivation, "These restrictions are being imposed on journalists as a precondition of their ability to cover the event." 
"We should not just be picking on baseball," Mr. Jaroslovsky said. "This goes far beyond baseball and beyond sports teams. If this is not checked, it will become pervasive."
Just as the legal grounds are less familiar in some of these information battles, the battles of public perception are less favorable. Polling conducted by the editors' group and the Freedom Forum showed that ringing defenses of the right to know sound off key when personal information were bought and sold.
A survey last fall of 1,005 adults showed that 56 percent of those polled found it completely acceptable or somewhat acceptable if privacy laws hampered efforts by news organizations to investigate wrongdoing. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
So what chance does The Orlando Sentinel have in getting support in its court fight to overturn a new state law limiting access to autopsy photos? The newspaper had sought to have an independent doctor examine the autopsy photos of the race-car driver Dale Earnhardt, who died in a crash at the Daytona 500, and test Nascar's claims about the cause of death.
The newspaper obtained a court-mediated agreement, but the law is in effect. Yesterday, the court battle was the focus of an antimedia call to arms by Mr. Earnhardt's widow, Teresa, urging people "to speak up, for one day you may find yourself facing down a powerful media company seeking personal and private records about you or your loved ones for no benefit, only harm."

HEADLINE: Minority Staff Members In Journalism Are Fewer 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
The math presented by the American Society of Newspaper Editors 24th annual survey of minorities was simple: 596 minority journalists were hired in 2001 and 698 left the profession, dropping the total number to 6,563 from 6,665. Minorities now make up 11.64 percent of journalists, the survey showed, compared with 31 percent of the national population.
 The numbers and percentages fell among all four groups counted. The greatest percentage loss was among American Indians, whose numbers declined by nearly 15 percent. American Indians, the smallest group of the four, had the greatest numerical loss, ending 2000 with 249 journalists, down 43. 
 The opportunities generated by the robust economy of early 2000 likely contributed to the fall-off of minority numbers among the total work force, which increased last year to 56,393 reporters, editors, photographers, page designers and graphic artists. Small newspapers, with daily circulations below 50,000, had the most trouble retaining minority staff members.
The number of Asian-American journalists declined by 22; they now make up 2.3 percent of the work force, according to the survey. There were 27 fewer black journalists, taking that group's percentage down to 5.23. There were four fewer Hispanic journalists in 2000; Hispanics make up 3.66 percent of all journalists.
The number of women in newsrooms rose slightly, to 21,062. They now make up 37.35 percent of the work force.
For the leadership of the editors' group, whose members make the hiring decisions, the trend was depressing. Charlotte Hall, the managing editor of Newsday and the chairman of the society's diversity committee, said in a statement that newsrooms needed to be places where journalists of color could flourish, where they felt welcome.
For others, it was infuriating. At a panel discussion at the editors' annual meeting, William Sutton Jr., the president of the National Association of Black Journalists and deputy managing editor at The News and Observer in Raleigh, N.C., argued that publishers needed to goad editors by tying annual bonuses more closely to hiring goals. The majority of editors have not made it important, he said.
Among large-circulation papers in the New York region, Newsday had the highest minority representation in its newsroom, with 24 percent. For The Star Ledger in Newark, the figure is 19.8 percent. At The Daily News, 18.6 percent of newsroom employees are minorities; at The Wall Street Journal, 17.1 percent. Minority journalists make up 16.2 percent of the newsroom of The New York Times and 13.9 percent of the newsroom of The New York Post.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Politician Returns to the U.S. as a Voice for Yugoslavia

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN Milan Protic reopened the embassy of Yugoslavia last month, it was like stepping into a haunted house, he said. Most of the furniture was in storage and a thick layer of dust and grime coated the few items that remained: a cheap phone and an ancient computer.
 It was hardly a glorious return to the United States for the first ambassador of a newly democratic Yugoslavia, which sought to renew ties with Washington after the long-awaited collapse of the Serbian nationalist government of Slobodan Milosevic. 
 Mr. Protic had been waiting -- and working -- for that to happen since 1992, when he left the University of California at Santa Barbara after studying and teaching European history there for a decade to become an opposition leader in the Democratic Party of Serbia. 
He remains wistful about his years in Southern California, where he played basketball, acquired nearly perfect English and, he said, learned the value of intellectual tolerance. But he voices no regrt at leaving.
"I couldn't imagine sitting back in California, enjoying the nice weather with my beloved students while such important things were happening in my homeland," Mr. Protic said.
Yet for Mr. Protic (pronounced PROH-titch), a lifelong anti-Communist and opposition leader, selecting new carpets was a welcome diversion from the diplomatic task immediately thrust upon him: persuading American policymakers that his government was cooperating with efforts to prosecute Mr. Milosevic and other former officials at the war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
Within days of his arrival, Mr. Protic staked his credibility on an insistence that Mr. Milosevic's arrest was imminent. At the end of March, hours after an American-imposed deadline had elapsed, Yugoslav authorities at last followed through. Bush administration officials, relieved, immediately certified Belgrade's cooperation on war crimes and prevented Congress from withholding about $50 million in much-needed economic aid.
But the Hague tribunal is just the most visible irritant in relations between Yugoslavia and the United States, Mr. Protic acknowledged. His compatriots feel lingering resentment toward the West for a bombing campaign to drive Yugoslav troops out of Kosovo province that many perceived as indiscriminate and anti-Serbian. 
And in Washington, officials from both parties are skeptical that President Vojislav Kostunica is prepared to come to terms with the exceptionally brutal policies of ethnic cleansing carried out by the Milosevic government as the Communist-era Yugoslavia split apart.
In an interview, Mr. Protic, a big-shouldered 6-foot-6 with a gentle manner, said the West was demanding too much too fast by demanding a trial for Mr. Milosevic in The Hague. Instead, he said, the deposed president -- one of about 15 war-crimes suspects believed to be in Yugoslavia -- should stand trial at home.
"We strongly believe it's up to us to deal with Milosevic in the first place," he said. "Our people deserve that. It was our people who overthrew him. It wasn't done by NATO, or even with the assistance of the U.S. government."
Sounding alternately adamant and accommodating, Mr. Protic, 43, is a deft interlocutor in the uneasy relationship between his nation and the United States.
He is the great-grandson of Stojan Protic, who served as prime minister of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929). He grew up in a family of non-Communist intellectuals and attended law school in Belgrade before his sojourn in California. Once he returned to Yugoslavia, as Mr. Protic and his colleagues charted a course of nonviolent opposition to Mr. Milosevic, the United States and NATO veered between negotiating with him, rolling back his expansionism and bombing Belgrade.
"I felt it was unfair to bomb our people because they couldn't cut a deal with Milosevic," Mr. Protic said. "I always felt we were innocent victims because of a misunderstanding between Milosevic and the international community."
Last October, after Mr. Milosevic tried to manipulate the results of an election that the opposition seemed to have won, Mr. Protic and hundreds of thousands of Yugoslavs poured into the streets in protest. With his childhood home just a stone's throw from City Hall, Mr. Protic said, he was surrounded by familiar faces, defiant and weeping.
THE police ringed the protesters, and throughout the tense night of Oct. 5, the only thing that was clear was that a decisive moment had arrived. Mr. Protic pleaded with the crowds to avoid bloodshed.
"You're either going to prevail and become a part of a great historical victory for your people, or you're going to disappear or be annihilated," he said. "Curiously for me, that was a very soothing feeling."
He recalled with pride how his father, a onetime law student who had been expelled for his anti-Communist activities, had greeted him the day the opposition triumphed.
"He said, 'Listen, son, I've been waiting for this for 60 years,' " Mr. Protic said. "He didn't even ask me how I was."
For his part, Mr. Protic was elected mayor of Belgrade, becoming the first elected official of the democratic government. The city he briefly ran was filthy and impoverished but still cosmopolitan, and ultimately resilient, he said.
Now that he has become ambassador, he said, he has promised his wife and centsfamily that the three years he expects to spend in Washington will be his last foray into politics.

DEAR DIARY: 
I live in Richmond, Va., and was visiting New York on St. Patrick's Day when a contingent of firemen passed by in the parade. Suddenly, one fireman broke rank, ran to the side of Fifth Avenue and 84th Street, knelt on the pavement and proposed marriage to his girlfriend. She said yes, grabbed his face and gave him a huge smooch as the crowd applauded. The fireman then took out an engagement ring and slipped it on her finger. She gave him another huge smooch and the crowd went wild with delight. He then lifted her over the parade barrier and they walked arm in arm up Fifth Avenue to a new life. What a town!

A long line of skiers waited to buy lift tickets in Vail, Colo., when another sales window opened and Morton Landowne and another man jumped over to it at exactly the same moment. Not wishing a confrontation, Mr. Landowne motioned to the man to go ahead of him. Then, as he put it, "feeling proud of my consideration and graciousness" and wanting the gesture to reflect well on his hometown, he told the man, "I just wanted you to know that I am from New York City." To which the man replied, "I am, too, so I know how hard that was for you."
Barbara Maher enjoyed this sign posted at Gray's Papaya at 72nd Street and Broadway. "Bummer!!! Starting April 15 we are forced to raise our popular 'recession special' to $2.45 (tax included). Please don't hate us!!!"
Elaine Whitehouse was walking uptown toward 38th Street when she noticed a well-dressed woman walking a well-groomed Pomeranian. They were advancing toward another dog walker with two small dogs on leashes. "Don't bark. Don't bark. Don't bark," the Pomeranian's mistress muttered as the dogs got closer. When the three dogs were almost nose to nose, the Pomeranian burst into a snarling frenzy, barking and straining against its leash. The two small dogs responded in kind, snapping and growling. Once they had been dragged away, the Pomeranian's owner hissed: "I knew it! You'll never have any friends!"

Dear Diary:
I knew it wasn't going to be a good day when my doorman called me at work and said, "Are you sitting down?" Fortunately, I was.
He then informed me that a four-man construction crew that was scheduled to demolish and remodel the kitchen in an apartment four floors above mine had accidentally ripped out my kitchen. The crew was apparently ready to go on to demolish my bathroom when the woman who had commissioned the work, wondering why her contractor hadn't arrived, was told by the building staff that the crew had indeed arrived -- four floors below. She ran down to my apartment to stop the carnage.
How, you may ask, did this happen? First, the number on the work order was accidentally transcribed as my apartment number. I was told later that there were several construction jobs going on in the building. 
How did the crew get into my apartment? My 18-year-old son, home from college for vacation, readily let the men in, believing they were building maintenance men and having heard us, at various times, discussing work we were planning to have done. Once my son let them in, he went off to the dentist.
It's true that in a city where surgeons sometimes operate on the wrong side of the brain, this fiasco is ultimately harmless, though expensive and inconvenient. The contrator has promised restitution. The check is not yet in the mail.

For gracious gloves I search with care
But travail comes to naught;
No two the same are anywhere
A pairilizing thought.
This one's aright, the next awrong
In some unlikely way;
And here's a short that can't belong,
A matchless disarray.
I stumble stunned, and glumly gaze
At leathers, suedes and knits.
Perhaps this sad assorted maze
May someday give me fits.
But should you choose to greet me now
I hope you'll understand
And raise no disapproving brow
At what I have on hand.

Dear Diary:
As a 5-year-old in New York City in 1941, I was allowed to walk to the corner of our Riverside Drive block in the afternoon to buy a hot dog for 5 cents. My grandfather, a doctor, who paid for these excursions, was away one day on house calls. Looking in my "secret" box, I found four pennies and headed for the yellow umbrella. Seeing me approach, my regular vendor began placing sauerkraut and mustard on my hot dog. When I handed over my 4 cents, he looked at me, looked at the roll and bit a fifth off the end. It was my first business negotiation, but one fully understood by both of us. I didn't become ill, so my grandfather's threat of "going to the Health Department" was not realized. I am still alive and still enjoy my New York City hot dogs, but I don't share bites anymore. NORMAN LEBHAR
AGING ATHLETES
When we were young, we relished sports;
You should have seen us score.
But now the points are getting sparse --
Just thinking makes us sore.
Yet age can be a wondrous thing,
Or so it's understood:
In memory, as games go on, 
Our skills seem twice as good!
 ROGER FENDRICH
 Eleanor Meyerhoff was in a wheelchair in a rehabilitation hospital, and her inspiration for recovery was a vigorous, independent octogenarian who was recovering from heart surgery. Each morning, arms swinging, he would stride past her open door as he circumnavigated the hospital corridors. One morning, she awakened to see him striding past holding a full-scale walker high above his head. "Do you know what that is all about?" Ms. Meyerhoff asked her roommate. "Yes," said the roommate. "Yesterday the nurses told him he would not be allowed to take his walks unless he held on to a walker, so he's complying."

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: THE CREW; 
In Third Visit, U.S. Diplomats Meet With Only 8 of 24 Detained Americans

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: HAIKOU, China, April 8 

 BODY:
Despite asking for "unfettered" access to the detained crew members of a downed American surveillance aircraft here, American diplomats were allowed early today to meet with only 8 of the 24 at their third meeting with the crew members and were denied a fourth meeting later in the day.
 The diplomatic team, headed by Brig. Gen. Neal Sealock, the defense attache from the American Embassy in Beijing, waited without word today on its request to meet with the crew twice a day. 
 The crew remained holed up in the officers quarters of a sprawling low-security Chinese Navy base in the southwest of this economically depressed city on southern China's Hainan island. 
The gate to the camp, a square, whie-tiled archway bearing a large, faded red star with the Chinese numerals for 8 and 1 pained in its center, sits at the end of a road scattered with grimy auto repair and hand-carwash shops. The numbers refer to Aug. 1, 1927, the date of a Communist uprising in the city of Nanchang, which represented the establishment of what became the People's Liberation Army.
Sailors in and out of uniform strolling through the gate today claimed no knowledge of their special guests, who are housed mostly two to a room in a building on the base. Guards at the gate, though, turned tongue-tied when asked about the Americans.
Hainan is a military stronghold for China's South Sea Fleet, a modest collection of about 50 ships and several airbases, including the one at Lingshui on the southeast end of the island where the American crew's crippled EP-3E Aries II aircraft landed a week ago after colliding off the coast with a Chinese F-8 jet. The American plane remains on a runway at the air base.
The American officials in Haikou confirmed that General Sealock and a consular official, Ted Gong, were able to meet with only some of the crew today at a long-delayed meeting that took place between 1 and 2 a.m. It was not clear how the eight crew members were selected for the meeting.
China has not yet assigned a status to the 21 men and 3 women that it has in custody. Although China says the American pilot broke Chinese laws by entering its airspace and landing at a military base without permission, it has not said that any member of the crew has been formally arrested. 
And China has not, for example, described the Americans as detainees, a status for which there are clear rules regarding consular access and other matters under a 1980 bilateral agreement. Under the rules of that agreement, for example, there would be no need for the tedious two- or three-hour meeting to negotiate the terms of each meeting with the crew.
China has said only that they are keeping the crew for their own investigation of the incident. An article in the military's Liberation Army Daily today said that Beijing is entitled to "thoroughly investigate" the crew and its plane. 
One thing complicating negotiations for the crew's release is believed to be the involvement of China's conservative military, which has the crew in custody.The military hopes to use th incident to force the United States to stop military surveillance flights off China's coast.
China continued searching for the pilot of the jet that crashed into the sea after hitting the American plane a week ago, though few people believe that he will be found alive. The Chinese media have already reported that the area where he was last spotted descending by parachute is frequented by sharks.
Still, the search, reportedly the biggest ever by China's navy, is continuing amid a nationwide propaganda campaign promoting the pilot as a national hero. Today, China said the search was joined by more than 800 fishing boats from various parts of China, including Taiwan, over which Beijing is trying to regain sovereignty.
Many people in China believe that the American crew will not be released until the search has been called off and the country has gone through what it believes to be an appropriate period of mourning.

HEADLINE: Bodies of 16 Recovered From Crash In Vietnam 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, April 8 

 BODY:
Recovery teams removed the bodies today from the crash of the helicopter searching for remains of American soldiers missing from the Vietnam War.
 The helicopter crashed into a mountainside in central Vietnam on Saturday, killing all seven Americans and nine Vietnamese aboard. The Russian-made MI-17 helicopter, with its Vietnamese pilot, was part of a major cooperative search operation throughout Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and southern China that has been under way since 1985 for missing American servicemen. 
 The search for the Americans, about 2,000 of whom are still missing, has been the cornerstone of Vietnam-American relations, an arena of cooperation embraced by both sides as they grope toward a more open political and economic relationship. 
Officials said they were still investigating the cause of the crash, the first loss of life since search operations began. Witnesses said they saw the helicopter making strange swinging movements in hazy weather before crashing and burning.
"The helicopter tilted side to side, then fluttered up and down in an abnormal patern," said Nguyen Viet Cuong, a local resident, speaking by telephone. "The helicopter crashed into the mountain and exploded. We all saw flames flare up."
Local officials said recovery teams carried the bodies in stretchers 30 minutes down a hillside for transportation by car to Hanoi. American officials said the bodies of the Americans would be returned to the United States but withheld the victims' names pending notification of next of kin.
The former enemies with a mutual tragedy issued statements of condolence today. President Bush offered condolences to the families of those killed, saying: "Today's loss is a terrible one for America. Although not lost in a hostile act, like those for whom they search, they too have lived lives of great consequence, answering a calling of service to their fellow citizens."
Vietnamalso issued a statement, saying, "On behalf of the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien has sent his deep condolences to the families of the Vietnamese victims and at the same time to the government, the people and the families of the United States."
The helicopter was part of an advance mission for a 95-member American team due to arrive from its base in Hawaii in early May to investigate six possile recovery sites, said the task force spokesman, Lt. Col. Franklin Childress, speaking from Hawaii. "We've been flying in this type of aircraft for a number of years and this is the first accident," he said. "Every mission is a dangerous mission. It's a very difficult area to operate in. Sometimes you can go in an area that's totally clear. And then right over the next hillside, it's totally fogged in."
The accident occurred near Thanh Trach village in Quang Binh Province, about 280 miles south of Hanoi. Quang Binh, the southernmost province of what was then North Vietnam -- just north of the demilitarized zone -- was heavily bombed during the war and contains many crash sites.
Advance teams like the one involved in the crash prepare base camps and supplies for the arrival of recovery teams at sites where probable remains have been identified.
The Hawaii-based operation, known as the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, maintains a permanent team of Americans in Vietnam, working with Vietnamese investigators. It conducts about 10 major operations each year, involving dozens of American experts from Hawaii, each lasting about 30 days.
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said the crash involved the first loss of life either side has suffered in 65 joint missions in Vietnam.
"Since 1985, American teams, with the full support of their Vietnamese counterparts, have conducted investigations and excavations in that country," he said. "As a result of this sustained cooperation, we have recovered and identified the remains of more than 600 Americans and continue to search for those still missing in Southeast Asia."
The United States spends from $5 million to $6 million a year on recovery operations in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, officials said. This year, five operations are planned in Laos, four in Vietnam and one in Cambodia, Colonel Childress said.
The task force has recently expanded to search for missing soldiers from World War II and the Korean War.
Although it has helped the United States in its search operations as the price of improved relations and trade, the Vietnamese government has no organized program to search for its own missing soldiers, which it estimates at 300,000.
There is no official estimate of missing soldiers from the defeated army of the former South Vietnam, which was allied with the United States. More than three million Vietnamese are estimated to have died in the war.

HEADLINE: Rebuilt City Starts to Feel Effects of the Slowdown 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
Halfway across Fort Pitt Bridge, a city of glittering office towers and graceful overpasses appears in the afternoon sun. Downtown Pittsburgh blares prosperity. But enter one of these office towers, to visit with Dennis Yablonsky, who tries to generate corporate investment, and a different image intrudes. The slumping national economy governs his days.
 After steel declined, Pittsburgh nurtured high technology companies and dot-com start-ups, and as they grew, a more diversified city thrived in the 1990's. Mr. Yablonsky's task, as president of Pittsburgh Digital Greenhouse, an economic development initiative, is to keep the expansion flourishing. The latest strategy is to make Pittsburgh a center for the design of computer chips, using Digital Greenhouse's public and corporate money to lure companies. Just five companies have nibbled so far, gingerly setting up shop here, employing in total only 20 people -- far off the old pace of job creation. 
 "We are trying to get a lot of companies to put semiconductor design centers here, but one-third to one-half tell us they want to defer any decision and we should call back in the future," Mr. Yablonsky said. "That is a message we started hearing in January." 
Everywhere in Pittsburgh, and in cities like it around the country, business executives are cutting back. Their curtailment of investment spending and expansion plans is contributing to what now appears to be a nationwide slide toward recession. That is likely to dash hopes -- not only among ordinary Americans but on Wall Street and in Washington -- for a quick recovery from the stock market rout without much damage to the economy.
The March employment report addd more cold water. Employers shed 86,000 jobs in March, the Labor Department reported on Friday. That was the largest drop for one month since November 1991, when the economy was wobbling out of a recession. 
American business is losing its exuberance, and that is now the biggest drag on the $9 trillion economy. Consumers are still spending, if not quite as enthusiastically as before, at least enough to hold up their end.
Home construction and auto sales, two other pillars of the economy, remain solid, and job growth, while slowing, has not yet braked enough to push the jobless rate above a still low 4.3 percent.
Capital spending is lagging, and that is starting to pull down the rest of the economy. As executives wake up to overcapacity, shrinking profits and an unfriendly stock market, their spending for all sorts of ventures and equipment has fallen from an annual growth rate of 21 percent in the first quarter of 2000 to a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in the fourth quarter. Two-thirds of the decline in the economy is a result of the pullback in business investment, the Commerce Department reported.
While Mr. Yablonsky waits, little setbacks are weakening companies already here. Cities that diversified and thrived in the 1990's, shedding their reliance on a single industry, are entering their first hard times in their new garb. That exposes a different vulnerability. Pittsburgh, minus the steel giants, must continually add small, vigorous enterprises to sustain prosperity, and the momentum is fading. "The slowdown has also reduced the number of jobs that companies in Pittsburgh want to fill," Mr. Yablonsky said.
None have announced mass downsizings, but there have been numerous small layoffs, particularly among the once-flourishing start-ups like OnlineChoice.com, founded by Sanjay Chopra, a 33-year-old Carnegie Mellon University graduate, who won an entrepreneur of the year award in Pittsburgh in 2000. Last month, Mr. Chopra was removed as chief executive. "It is surprising how quickly markets evaporate," he said afterward.
The idea behind OnlineChoice is to recruit thousands of consumers over the Internet and combine their buying power to purchase items like phone services, electricity or insurance at a discount. Unable to turn a profit or obtain new venture capital since last spring, Online has shrunk to 15 employees from 60. And far from investing in equipment, it has sold 12 idle computers, an extra copier and the office coffeemaker.
OnlineChoice's experience helps to explain the increase in Pittsburgh's unemployment rate, to 4.1 percent lately from an average of 3.7 percent last year. That is still slight, but many companies are no longer expanding. As a result, job applicants wait, wages are rising more slowly and bonuses are smaller.
"The M.A.'s and Ph.D's coming out of our universities used to have jobs before they graduated," said Wilbur S. Harmon, vice president for human resources at ANSYS, which develops software to test products and is one of the few dot-coms here still hiring. "Now they are graduating without jobs."
Outwardly, the city seems to be thriving. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the city's largest employer, with 28,000 on the payroll, continues to expand, partly through acquisitions. Home sales are strong, and new office buildings, started last summer before the slowdown, are in mid-construction. While the city has lost more than 100,000 steel jobs, it has replaced them with jobs in other industries.
Some $25 million a month flows into Pittsburgh, mostly in state and federal money, for the construction of a football stadium in addition to the just-completed baseball stadium and a convention center now rising along the Allegheny River. It is a vast riverfront project, employing 1,500 construction workers. That pleased Jack Shea, president of the Allegheny County Labor Council in central Pittsburgh.
"We have a mayor who is proactive in public investment," Mr. Shea said, pointing to a green "Tom Murphy for Mayor" cap displayed on his credenza. "The slowdown has not manifested itself in my life yet, except for the pockets of layoffs at dot-com companies. And we don't represent those workers."
But if Mr. Shea is at peace, Victoria K. Barnhart is increasingly uneasy. She runs Barnhart's Honda/ Suzuki dealership, selling motorcycles and small all-terrain vehicles along Route 79, on the southern fringe of the metropolitan area. Sales began a decline in October, but jumped back in February, only to fall again in March when they should have spiked in anticipation of spring.
"We cannot figure out what people are thinking," Ms. Barnhart said as she walked through a warehouse stacked nearly full of the balloon tire A.T.V.'s. Farmers like the vehicles for getting around in the fields, and until last fall there were more than enough customers for Barnhart's and a competing dealership that opened in 1999 about 30 miles down the highway. Now, the competition is a threat, one investment too many.
"Neither one of us is going to get as many sales as we should in this slowing economy," Ms. Barnhart said. "I am going to hang in and hope that my competitor decides to quit."
The slowdown is seeping into other corners. Revenue from a local sales tax has sagged, suggesting that retail sales are beginning to weaken. The family-owned William A. Fischer Carpet Company, which Ann Fischer has run since her husband's death in 1999, installs carpets in hotels and offices, and orders have fallen precipitously since December.
"Companies are deferring," Mrs. Fischer said, invoking a word frequently heard in Pittsburgh these days. "We'll be O.K. until July, and we'll have men on vacation, which should get us through the summer."
In a city where the average age is higher than almost anywhere else in the country, hundreds of thousands of retired steelworkers draw pensions as well as Social Security, and that income keeps coming, immune to a slowdown. But those still employed in the steel industry are not so fortunate. One of the largest employers, the Allegheny Ludlum Corporation, with 3,200 steel workers in the area, has cut overtime more than 50 percent, a loss the United Steelworkers of America says it cannot offset through wage increases in contract negotiations just starting.
"They have to accept a lower standard of living," said Andrew Palm, a district director for the steelworkers' union. "These are older workers and what you try to do is get more on the pension side."
Manufacturing's woes precipitated the national slowdown, and manufacturers here see hard months ahead. Frank A. Archinaco, executive vice president of PPG Industries, goes out of his way to express the pessimism that drives his company to consolidate factory operations, reduce overtime and trim costs -- all in the name of bringing capacity into line with demand. 
PPG, which has its headquarters here, makes auto glass and industrial paint. The research and development labs are also here, with more than 800 employees.
"We have not reduced our R. & D. spending, but we have tightened to get rid of weaker performers," Mr. Archinaco said. "It should not take a downturn to get rid of poor performers. We should have done that anyway and now we are forced to do so."
Peter C. Johnson, a surgeon, faces a different constraint. He is the chairman of TissueInformatics, a biotech start-up that develops software to analyze human tissue.
But like other high-technology companies, TissueInformatics does not generate enough revenue to finance expansion, and Dr. Johnson raised only $4.5 million from investors last year, instead of the $20 million he had sought. So he postponed plans to develop a databank of tissue samples, holding the payroll at 40 people instead of the nearly 80 he once planned to have by now.
"In a booming economy, speed is important to beat others to market," Dr. Johnson said. "But in a slowdown, the emphasis must shift to good tactics to sta4 alive."
That is also the way that Richard S. Kushner, a senior director of marketing at Marconi Communications, sees it. As a manufacturer of communications switches for telephone and Internet companies, Marconi, which has its North American headquarters here, has been hurt by the cutback in capital spending. 
Revenue is growing more slowly, and to keep it from flagging even more, Mr. Kushner is pushing a new virtue of Marconi's equipment: Rather than use it for expansion, he tells customers, buy it or lease it to cut costs.
"Our customers are increasingly capital constrained," Mr. Kushner said, "so they come to us for an operating agreement and they lease the equipment, which we then install and maintain and operate and manage." Still, Marconi's once rapidly growing staff has leveled off at 1,800 employees. And there are other adjustments. Marconi had long made donations to support the city's arts.
"We are declining some requests outright this year," a Marconi spokesman said. And last month, the company pulled a television commercial that used to call attention to its "aggressive hiring" in the Pittsburgh area.

HEADLINE: Cornell Will Open A Medical School In the Persian Gulf 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
In one of the biggest deals yet in the growing export of American higher education, Cornell University is establishing a branch campus of its medical school in the Middle East, where students will receive the same diploma as those 6,700 miles away in New York City.
 Cornell will announce today that it will create the Weill Medical College of Cornell University in Qatar, a tiny, wealthy Persian Gulf nation that has agreed to spend $750 million on the school over 11 years, including a fee to Cornell. 
 American universities have increasingly been establishing programs abroad, from student exchanges to research institutes to distance education programs conducted over the Internet. But few, if any, are as comprehensive as the Cornell agreement, which will give a full Ivy League medical degree to students who may never set foot in the United States. And many are encountering challenges. 
Cornell's president, Hunter R. Rawlings III, said he and others were initially concerned about conditions in Qatar. The university investigated everything from human rights and the treatment of women to the country's political stability.
"Some of our Jewish trustees and alumni were especially concerned," Dr. Rawlings said. "But as they learned more about Qatar and its ambitions, they were willing to proceed." 
He said the medical college in Qatar would have a nondiscrimination policy, just as the one in New York does, and would accept Jews -- and even Israelis -- as faculty members and students. 
"We are bound to a nondiscrimination policy and we will respect that," said Abdulredha Abdulrahman, the managing director of the Qatar Foundation, which is financing the project. "Entrance will be controlled by Cornell. This has nothing to do with nationalities. Anyone who is qualified is welcome."
Robert Zemsky, a professor and director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania, predicts that there will be many more instances of American universities venturing abroad. "There is a major international market emerging in higher education."
He points to examples like the University of Chicago's executive M.B.A. program in Singapore and Barcelona, and another project in Singapore in which the Johns Hopkins medical school trains doctors to be researchers, but does not award a degree. He said that Cornell appeared to have dealt with challenges that have sometimes stymied other American universities seeking to go abroad, including language (the Qatar medical school will be conducted in English), economics (Qatar is paying the bill), and whether the American university is seen as a carpetbagger (Qatar wanted Cornell to come, and has treated Cornell officials like dignitaries).
"We are very familiar with education in the United States and knew that Cornell was among the top 10 medical schools," Mr. Abdulredha said. "We found Cornell very keen."
The foundation, established by the emir of Qatar and led by his wife, Sheika Mozah bint Nasser al-Misnad, has committed to pay an estimated $750 million to operate the medical college for 11 years. Neither Cornell nor the foundation would discuss the size of the management fee, or of a donation that the foundation is also making to the medical school. Both say that the donation was not a factor in the agreement. 
Cornell will control the curriculum, the faculty and the admission of students, who will have to take the same tests and meet the same standards as those in New York, the university said. 
Cornell's medical college is among the most selective in the United States. This year's entering students -- 101 in all -- were chosen from 6,344 applicants and had a 3.7 grade point average on their science courses in college. 
Cornell is aiming for an entering class of about 50 students in Qatar, drawn from there and other countries, within the Arab world and without. Mr. Abdulredha said the agreement called for 70 percent of the class to come from Qatar unless too few Qataris qualify, in which case more students from outside the country will be admitted. If too few total students qualify, the class will be smaller, but Mr. Abdulredha said he did not expect that problem. "We will get the brightest students from Qatar and the region, and they will excel," he said, "We have the brains. We don't have the education system." 
Qatar, an oil- and gas-rich neighbor of Saudi Arabia with 750,000 inhabitants, many of them foreign workers, is smaller than Connecticut. It has no medical school and is trying to create an education city anchored by an array of elite American universities in the capital city, Doha.
Qatar is widely considered among the most forward-looking of Arab states. A Qatari satellite television station, Al-Jazeera, beams frank public affairs discussions and interviews, including talks with Israeli leaders, into homes across the Middle East.
An Israeli trade representative office opened in Qatar five years ago and has remained open over the past six months despite pressures on Qatar to close it in solidarity with the Palestinian uprising. 
As part of the medical school arrangement, Cornell will also run a two-year science-intensive premedical program to prepare students to apply. That program will begin taking students next year, and plans call for the medical school to open two years later. Students who complete the premedical program will not necessarily be accepted to the medical school; they will still need to take the medical school boards and apply to the medical college. 
When the Qatar Foundation first approached Weill Cornell Medical College two year ago, it found immediate interest. Dr. Antonio M. Gotto Jr., the dean, studied abroad as a Rhodes scholar. As a cardiologist, he treated many foreign patients, including many from the Middle East. 
He also created an office of international medicine at the medical school, where nearly half the students take a medical elective in a foreign country.
"I am convinced that medicine and health are global problems," he said, "and we in the United States have an obligation to work with the rest of the world."
"The initial reaction from many people was," he added, " 'Why on earth would you want to do something like that?' "
He ticked off the arguments he heard against the project: "It's far away. It could be dangerous. They have very different customs. You might dilute your resources, and distract your management. You may not be able to recruit faculty or find students. Some of your alumni and friends may not understand it."
After extensive discussion and trips to Qatar, the medical school's leaders decided to go ahead. They plan to have about 65 faculty members in Qatar, and to supplement their teaching with courses in New York, presented over live video.
Dr. Daniel R. Alonso, a pathologist and former senior associate dean for academic affairs at the medical school in New York, will be dean of the new Qatar campus. He said he planned to go to Qatar next year and remain at least until the first class graduates, in 2008.
"How often do you have the chance to do something unprecedented like this?" Dr. Alonso, who was born and raised in Argentina, asked last week. 
Sanford I. Weill, the business executive who is chairman of the medical school's board of overseers and whose name the medical school bears, acknowledged that there were uncertainties involved in the project. 
"I don't think Arab-Jewish relations are the issue at all," he added. "This is about health care, medical education and medical research. We're not in the political business; we're in the science business, the education business."
Mr. Abdulredha acknowledged the political tension and said, "For an American university to come to this part of the world requires lots of studies and assurances."
Cornell is only one of the universities that the Qatar Foundation has approached. The University of Virginia came close to establishing an undergraduate college, winning approval from both the State Legislature and its own trustees. But it ultimately backed off, citing concerns over accreditation. (Cornell says it anticipates no problems with accreditation.)
The Qatar Foundation is continuing to talk to other top universities about setting up programs in business, engineering and information technology, although it will not name them. (Virginia Commonwealth University is already running a design program.)
"I think after Cornell, the others will follow," said Mr. Abdulredha, who earned his bachelor's degree in Britain and a graduate degree at the University of Texas. "A lot of people don't believe we will succeed," he added, "but I think we will surprise them."

HEADLINE: California Energy Plan Punishes the Good Guys 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The problem with setting California's energy baseline at any percent of the amount consumed a year ago during the comparable billing period is that it profoundly penalizes the consumers who have already been conserving power (Economic Scene column, April 5). 
 There are those of us who lived through the energy crisis in the 1970's and have been responsible about power ever since. 
For those who have been wasteful, to reduce power usage by 10 percent will be simple. For those who have been conserving, it is hardly fair to penalize them when there may be no areas in which it is possible to conserve.
I suggest that we set a baseline that allows a modestly sized home to be run efficiently. Any amount over that would be billed at a much higher rate.

Wieden & Kennedy Is Cutting Staff 12%

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliot 

 BODY:
In another sign of the effect of the slowing economy on advertising, Wieden & Kennedy is laying off 12 percent of the 314 employees at its headquarters in Portland, Ore., and its New York office. 
 They are the first major dismissals at the agency since June 1998; overseas offices in Amsterdam, London and Tokyo are not affected. 
 Dan Wieden, the company's president, blamed "economic realities that have to be faced," for the move.
While there have not been spending cuts by clients like Coca-Cola, ESPN, Miller Brewing and Nike, there are obviously far fewer opportunities in technology advertising, a specialty field of the agency.

HEADLINE: For the Poor, a Lawyer With 1,600 Clients 

BYLINE:  By JANE FRITSCH and DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Last year, Sean P. Sullivan had 1,600 clients, all of them poor and charged with crimes. He did not have to hustle to get the work. His thriving law practice came courtesy of New York City, whose courts appointed him to all the cases, a record number for one lawyer in a single year.
 On a recent Thursday morning, he ambled into the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building in a rumpled gray suit, a shirt with a frayed collar and a stained necktie. Entering a packed courtroom, he called out the names of his first five clients. Two waved to him from the audience. He nodded, plopped down on a bench and went to work on a crossword puzzle. 
 Over the next four hours, Mr. Sullivan would represent a dozen defendants, and as they waited, half would complain bitterly that he never returns phone calls or that he runs away when they try to speak to him. Twice that morning, he would show up in the wrong courtroom. A colleague would have to fill in to represent a client whose court appearance Mr. Sullivan could not make. 
He would miscalculate by several weeks the amount of time remaining before one client's case would have to be dismissed under speedy-trial rules. He would learn that another client had grown so frustrated with him that he had come up with the money to hire a lawyer. And back in the cramped office he shares with 11 other lawyers, he would admit that he had no particular filing system. 
"I use the same filing the judges do," he said, tossing an imaginary folder toward an imaginary point on his cluttered desk. "They just throw it in the basket and someone else files it." But Mr. Sullivan cannot afford to have someone put his files away. Court-appointed work, he lamented, just does not pay enough. "Sometimes I come back here and I throw it down and then when the deadline comes for the motions, I miss them."
At the age of 38, he summed up his attitude toward his job with a baseball analogy. "Some guys can be in the major leagues and be frustrated they're not living up to their potential," he said. "Another guy can realize he's going to be a .250 hitter and be happy he's a .250 hitter. I can do this, and there's some satisfaction out of doing something and doing it reasonably well."
Mr. Sullivan was paid $125,041 by the city last year. He is one of dozens of private attorneys who, working alone, represent hundreds, even thousands, of indigent clients each year in a court system so desperate for lawyers that it puts no limit on the number of cases any one lawyer may take.
Mr. Sullivan acknowledged that clients complained about him but said he did a good job. "It's a high-volume place," he said. "I'm a symptom of the problem." 
Nearly four decades after the United States Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that indigent defendants have a right to legal counsel, almost no part of New York City's plan for providing the lawyers functions as it was intended.
More than most big cities, New York relies on private lawyers to represent defendants who cannot afford to hire their own. Most big cities assign such cases to public defender's offices, government agencies that have hundreds ofstaff attorneys, supervisors and support personnel, like investigators, social workers and secretaries.
In New York, the Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit organization, was supposed to function like a public defender's office, representing nearly all indigent defendants. But Legal Aid, weakened in a dispute with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, now represents only about 50 percent of the roughly 385,000 people arrested for misdemeanors and felonies each year.
In sharply cutting Legal Aid's budget, the mayor also diluted the strength of a powerful force that regularly pursued civil cases to protect suspects' rights in the criminal justice system. 
In the new system created by the mayor, several smaller organizations are now given 18 percent of the cases.
That leaves about 115,000 defendants in need of lawyers. To fill the gap, the city turns to private lawyers, not only for those defendants, but also for roughly 170,000 more who are given summonses each year for low-level violations as part of Mr. Giuliani's quality-of-life campaign.
Judges, lawyers and defendants say the system is at the breaking point.
"We too often see lawyers who were woefully unprepared, did little to investigate, were ignorant of the applicable law, had inadequate trial skills and did not appear to be committed to their client's cause," said Richard M. Greenberg, the attorney in charge of the Office of the Appellate Defender, a nonprofit organization that handles appeals of criminal convictions.
For indigent defendants, even those charged with the least serious transgressions, the stakes are growing. New laws have made criminal convictions grounds for denying people jobs, evicting them from city-owned housing, denying college financial aid and cutting off welfare benefits.
The flood of cases comes at a time when the number of lawyers willing to represent the indigent has dropped sharply, to 1,200 from 2,200 in 1993. Their chief complaint is New York's pay, $40 an hour in court and $25 an hour out of court, the second-lowest rate in the nation. Only New Jersey pays its appointed lawyers less -- $30 an hour in court and $25 out of court -- but most indigent defendants in New Jersey are represented by the state's vast public defender system.
More than a year ago, Judith S. Kaye, New York State's chief judge, said there was an "acute shortage" of lawyers for the poor and the problem had reached a crisis stage. Little has changed since then.
The problems have escalated over a period of years and have become "more and more dire," said Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief administrative judge. "I've never seen it like this, and I've been in the system for 30 years," Judge Lippman said. "Day in and day out, we are struggling to level the playing field. This can't continue."
The city spent $125 million on indigent defense last year, up from $116 million in 1995. But adjusted for inflation, that is a drop of 11 percent. 
During the same period, the number of arrests for misdemeanors and felonies rose by 30 percent, and the budget of the city's prosecutors rose by 6 percent, adjusted for inflation, to $220 million from $179 million.
A committee appointed by the State Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki is trying to reach an agreement that would raise rates for appointed lawyers, but the members are struggling to work out whether the state should pay part of the cost. The Legislature sets the pay rates but the city pays the bills.
In the past, there has been little discussion of alternatives to appointed lawyers, like the public defender systems used in other states. But New York officials are beginning to consider revamping the entire system, according to Katherine N. Lapp, Governor Pataki's criminal justice adviser.
If the state ends up paying for a wage increase, it could mean state oversight of a system that now has little monitoring.
City and court officials do not monitor, for instance, how many cases a particular lawyer has pending at any given time. Nor do they stop overextended lawyers from taking on more cases. And they do not review the work that lawyers do on individual cases, other than to check for double-billing.

The Crush
Caseloads Stretch Into the Hundreds
Last year, the 20 busiest private attorneys were assigned to represent more than 9,000 defendants whose cases went past arraignment, and hundreds more
who agreed to plea bargains on the day they were arrested, according to city records and the bills submitted by the lawyers.
In all, at least 28 lawyers were each assigned more than 300 cases last year. At least 13 had more than 400, placing them beyond the caseload limit set by New York City's courts for the Legal Aid Society and similar organizations. Standards cited by the National Legal Aid and Defender Association say that no lawyer should handle more than 150 felonies or 400 misdemeanors in a year. And the American Bar Association code of responsibility says lawyers have a duty to refuse cases if they lack the time or expertise to handle them.
Sara Goldman, a lawyer from Leonia, N.J., represented 805 defendants charged with parole violations last year, nearly 10 percent of the 8,500 parole cases in New York City and more than double the recommended case limit. If convicted, the defendants are usually returned to prison.
Ms. Goldman's cases are heard in the half-dozen parole courtrooms crammed into three trailers on Rikers Island. At a typical session one Friday morning last December, she met 10 new clients and arranged for 6 to plead guilty. The other four cases were postponed, and she was done before lunch.
For most cases, she bills the city for one hour of work in court and three hours out of court. The out-of-court work generally involves opening a case file, preparing a written notice that she has been assigned to the case and, after the case is over, reviewing the judge's decision and closing the file. Sometimes, she bills for 30 minutes of case preparation. She was paid $118,027 for her work last year.
In an interview, she acknowledged that she sometimes interviews her clients in the courtroom, in the presence of the prosecutor and the judge. She said they do not pay attention to her conversations with defendants.
"I think I do a good job," she said, "but I've been doing it for a long time." In parole cases, she said, defendants do better with an experienced appointed lawyer than with a lawyer they might hire. "They could have Johnnie Cochran, and he wouldn't be able to get them a better deal."
Arleen Ralph, a Brooklyn lawyer, handled at least 560 cases last year, according to city records, but there were dozens more that went uncounted. The city does not track the number of cases lawyers handle during arraignment, when many are resolved with a quick plea bargain. Whatever Ms. Ralph's total, it was well beyond the maximum of 400 recommended for misdemeanor cases.
Ms. Ralph's clients typically pleaded guilty, as do most defendants charged with misdemeanors. Working from an office on Court Street, she has made indigent-defense work into a full-time job. 
Ms. Ralph did not respond to telephone messages and a letter sent to her office.

The Fallout
Legal Aid Is Hobbled
In a complex arrangement established in 1965, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court was given responsibility for ensuring that indigent defendants in New York City had lawyers. The Legal Aid Society was supposed to take nearly all cases. Private lawyers were to be given only homicide cases and the small number of cases in which Legal Aid had a conflict of interest; for example, a case with two clients accused of committing a crime together.
The private lawyers were to be assigned and monitored by the Appellate Division, choosing from a list of lawyers who had signed up in advance.
Over the years, private lawyers have been allowed to take an increasing number of cases, tens of thousands by 1994. After Mayor Giuliani took office that year, he said he planned to reduce the role of appointed lawyers drastically and shift the cases back to the Legal Aid Society.
But when Legal Aid lawyers went on strike in late 1994, Mr. Giuliani reversed course, vowing to eliminate the society's "monopoly." He cut Legal Aid's budget by 25 percent and arranged for seven new organizations to take limited numbers of cases. Mr. Giuliani said the new groups would create competition that would improve the general quality of legal work. They would also lessen the effect of any future strikes by Legal Aid.
At the same time, the mayor began a quality-of-life campaign that flooded the courts with thousands of new cases. Far from eliminating private lawyers, he had made them more necessary than ever.
Now, judges often bypass administrative procedures and assign lawyers on their own, sometimes drafting anyone who happens to be in the courtroom.
Some lawyers complain that judges, under pressure to move a huge volume of cases through the system, force more cases on them than they can handle. In a pending lawsuit seeking higher pay rates for appointed lawyers, several filed affidavits describing court officers and judges who walk the halls of the courthouses looking for lawyers to represent indigent defendants. 
The lawsuit, filed by the firm Davis Polk & Wardwell on behalf of the New York County Lawyers' Association, describes a system "in the grasp of a steep downward spiral." Many appointed lawyers, the suit says, "do not have functioning law offices with essential legal research facilities, secretaries, message takers, investigators, legal assistants or other basic support services."
For a large number of assigned lawyers, the suit says, trial preparation is a "dreamlike fantasy made distant by the need to put food on the table."
A hobbled Legal Aid Society represented about 200,000 indigent defendants last year, roughly the same number it did six years ago but with a fraction of the resources. The city cut the society's budget to $60 million from $80 million in 1994, forcing deep cuts in personnel. Its roster of staff lawyers has dropped to 340 from 517, and the number of supervisors has dropped to 37 from 103. The staffs of investigators and social workers have been cut in half.
"We're starving for resources," said Daniel L. Greenberg, the executive director of Legal Aid. The society has filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that Mr. Giuliani breached the city's contract with Legal Aid and unlawfully retaliated for the 1994 strike.
Citywide, 200 of the society's lawyers have caseloads beyond the recommended limit of 400. Particularly hard hit is Legal Aid's office in Manhattan, where the deluge of cases generated by the quality-of-life campaign has been heaviest.
Many of the most experienced lawyers and supervisors have fled the Legal Aid Society to take jobs with the new defense groups established by the mayor. The new groups often pay more and, unlike Legal Aid, have caseload limits set by their contracts with the city.
There are other signs of strain at Legal Aid.
Last December, an appeals court in Brooklyn threw out the conviction of a Legal Aid client on the grounds that the lawyer had botched the case. The defendant, Kevin Maldonado, had been in prison for three years for a robbery he says he did not commit.
Mr. Maldonado, now 25, was arreste in 1995 at Newtown High Shool in Elmhurst, Queens, where he had gone because his nephew had gotten into trouble. As Mr. Maldonado sat in an office, a student passed by and said Mr. Maldonado had been one of the five strangers who had robbed him in a stairwell two months earlier. The police were summoned and he was arrested.
Mr. Maldonado, a construction worker with no criminal record, rejected a plea bargain that would have given him five years of probation. His first trial ended in a hung jury, and he was again offered probation. But, insisting that he had been at work at the time of the robbery, he demanded a retrial.
A new Legal Aid lawyer, Manuela Grobe, was assigned. But at the retrial, she did not call three defense witnesses who had testified at the first trial, according to trial transcripts and other records. And, like the first Legal Aid lawyer, she did not contact two alibi witnesses who would have testified that Mr. Maldonado was at work at the time of the robbery. He was convicted and sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison.
It was only after Mr. Maldonado's family and co-workers hired a lawyer, Elliott B. Leibowitz, that the two additional witnesses were contacted. A nonprofit group called Appellate Advocates took the case and won the reversal. Michael Brovner, an assistant district attorney in Queens who was recently assigned to the case, said in February that he would demand a third trial.
Last month, Mr. Maldonado gave up his fight and pleaded guilty in exchange for a sentence of time served. He said he wanted to go to the Dominican Republic to see his father, who is ill, before he dies. "There's no justice in this country," he said in a recent interview. "They be playing with people."
Ms. Grobe died in 1997, but at a hearing after the conviction she testified that she believed that her cross-examination of the victim had been so effective that Mr. Maldonado would be acquitted. Susan L. Hendricks, the deputy attorney in charge of Legal Aid's criminal defense division, said the handling of the Maldonado case had been assessed by supervisors, who agreed that Ms. Grobe's trial strategy was appropriate. She said she could not elaborate.
But Ms. Hendricks acknowledged that the Legal Aid Society is having difficult times. After five years of city cuts, the organization "is at the breaking point," she said.
"We're holding things together with bubble gum and string," she said. "We don't have enough lawyers, we don't have enough investigators, we don't have enough social workers. We don't meet the standards for any of this."
Perhaps more significant, Legal Aid has fewer resources to devote to the sort of class-action litigation that has forced systemwide changes in the past. In 1991, for instance, the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, ruled in a case brought by Legal Aid that suspects must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours. Until then, suspects frequently spent days in jail before seeing a judge.
The city keeps a close watch on the Legal Aid Society, requiring that it file monthly reports on its activities and on the number of cases handled by each staff lawyer. And each year, the Appellate Division commissions a report on its performance, as well as on the performance of the smaller groups.

The Oversight
Lawyers Receive Scant Monitoring
But no one monitors the performance of the vast majority of the appointed lawyers who represent the indigent. Only once in the last 36 years has there been a review of the lawyers, and then only for those who handle felonies in Manhattan and the Bronx.
That effort, begun in 1994 by a volunteer committee that screens the lawyers for the Appellate Division's First Department, has just been completed. The volunteers, working with no staff or funding, checked with judges and other lawyers, but did not review work on individual cases. About 60 of the 600 lawyers reviewed were removed from the indigent-defense pool.
"If we could have staff support, it would make a world of difference," said Norman L. Reimer, a former chairman of the committee. "You can't just have people coming in and taking as many cases as they want and working as many shifts as they want and expect them to render quality."
Harvey Fishbein, the current chairman of the committee, said there were no plans to review the hundreds of lawyers who handle misdemeanor cases. "You can't just ask people who are doing this on a voluntary basis to put in the hours it takes to do the recertification work," he said.
In Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island, there are also no plans to review the felony or misdemeanor lawyers.
So it is largely left to the appeals courts to examine the work of appointed lawyers. But most cases end with plea agreements and are never appealed. The courts are so overcrowded and the push for guilty pleas is so strong that less than 1 percent of misdemeanors and 6 percent of felonies go to trial.
In recent years, appeals courts have criticized appointed lawyers for a range of failings. In one case, a lawyer filed no motions and failed to request the proper jury instructions. In another, the lawyer made an incorrect legal argument. And in a third, a lawyer failed to interview a witness before calling him to the stand and ignored warnings from another lawyer that the witness's testimony would "bury" his client.
Mr. Reimer, the former head of the screening committee, said the errors were not surprising. "The starvation of this system over the past 15 years has resulted in a complete evisceration of quality," he said. "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that if you starve the system and play one group off the other for survival, you're going to drive it down, and that's what has happened."
Mr. Fishbein said he would like to return to a system that relies primarily on a strong central defender. Private lawyers, he said, should be used only for cases in which the central defender has a conflict of interest. 
"Only a strong defender service would have a voice in the criminal justice system," he said. "Being fractured and divided, the defender services don't have a voice. A unified voice would be much stronger."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about lawyers who represent the indigent referred imprecisely to the disposition of cases handled last year by Arleen Ralph of Brooklyn. Records provided by Ms. Ralph after the article appeared show that most cases she resolved after arraignment ended in dismissals, not guilty pleas. Many of her cases were resolved earlier, at arraignments, when guilty pleas are common, but data on the disposition of those cases are not available.

HEADLINE: Seizing the Phone Giants' Turf; 
Upstart RCN Digs In Despite Industry's Turmoil

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
David C. McCourt, the RCN Corporation's chairman and chief executive, says he did not set out to become a pioneer, at least not in the telecommunications industry.
 When Mr. McCourt returned to Boston two decades ago after graduating from Georgetown and working for 18 months as a probation officer's aide in Washington's hardscrabble Anacostia neighborhood, he just thought he was going home. 
 "When you grow up in New England," he said, "you just expect that you're going to return." 
Mr. McCourt, now 44, was not simply going home. He was returning to his father's trade: construction. In 1981, Mr. McCourt found himself digging trenches all around Boston for entrepreneurs who wanted to deliver a then-novel service called cable television. 
Twenty years later, Mr. McCourt is still laying cables and building networks, though he and RCN are now based in Princeton, N.J. ("In the 200 years since my family moved over from Ireland, I'm the only male McCourt to leave Boston; I still have to explain myself at Christmas," he says.) And he is also building a special place for himself in the telecommunications industry.
That is because 5 years after the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which promised to open broad vistas of competition in formerly cloistered markets, RCN is the only company of significant size that is focused on giving consumers an alternative to the local telephone and cable television monopolies for a combination of local phone, cable TV and high-speed Internet services. AT&T, WorldCom and a few cable companies have made efforts to give consumers an alternative source of local phone service, but no other significant company is competing against local incumbents with RCN's breadth of services. 
After the telecommunications act, hundreds if not thousands of new companies sprang up to deliver local communications services in competition against old local phone giants like Bell Atlantic and Southwestern Bell. But most of those companies look for business customers. And logically so: a midsize business, after all, might spend tens of thousands of dollars a month on communications.
Then there was RCN, quixotically building networks in residential neighborhoods, hoping to sign up households that might spend $100 a month on phone, cable and Internet service. By the end of last year, RCN sold at least one of those services to about 985,000 homes, mostly in New York City and other parts of the Northeast, but also in Chicago and along the California coast.
"The vision has always been to build a new network for the residential environment that's capable of selling all of today's services -- voice, video and data -- with plenty of capacity for tomorrow's services," Mr. McCourt said in an interview last week.
These can be tough times for telecommunications visionaries. Many of the local communications start-ups are starved for capital, their very existence now in question. A year ago, for instance, shares of Teligent were trading as high as $55.50. On Friday, Teligent's shares closed at 37.5 cents. Last week, Winstar Communications, whose shares touched $56 around this time last year, announced that it would cut 2,000 jobs. On Friday, Winstar's shares closed at 40.6 cents.
And there amid the carnage stands RCN. Mr. McCourt is not happy that his stock closed on Friday at $3.97, down from a 52-week high of $55. Nor is he happy that RCN, to conserve cash, has had to scale back its plans to enter new markets. 
In addition, a fair number of analysts think that RCN's sales, general and administrative costs are far too high, a problem that Mr. McCourt has at least tacitly acknowledged and is moving to fix. Mr. McCourt openly admits that RCN's so-called "back office" systems, the computers that keep track of customers and bills, installation requests and service problems, need a lot of work.
But RCN might just have a vital ally as it tries to tighten its budget: time. At the end of last year, RCN had $1.7 billion in cash on hand and another $500 million available in a line of credit. Most analysts appear to believe that the company is in no danger of going under any time soon.
"I'm a big believer in the long-term outlook for this company; our model does indicate that the company's scaled-back business plan is indeed fully funded," said Mark Kastan, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. He added, however, that he thought the company's cash reserve would eventually hit a low of only about $150 million, rather than the $500 million that RCN had predicted.
The fact that RCN does not appear to be in danger of going out of business any time soon is surely a comforting thought to its employees, investors and customers. But RCN's mere existence carries a larger significance: It is possible for a small start-up company to challenge the local telephone behemoths and cable television incumbents and give residential consumers a choice of provider for both basic communications services and fast Internet access.
According to the Federal Communications Commission, big businesses and institutions had about 46.5 million phone lines at the end of last June. Of those, 17.5 percent were served by competitive carriers (not the dominant local telephone companies). For corporate customers, competition clearly is taking hold. 
But at the same time, homes and small businesses had about 145.1 million phone lines and of those, only 4.6 million, or about 3.2 percent, were served by new carriers. Competition is obviously coming much more slowly to consumers than it is to business customers (which may be why, relative to inflation, local phone service is generally no cheaper now than it was 15 years ago).
One of the challenges in competing with the dominant local phone companies is that in order to generate sustainable profits in the telecommunications, a company usually has to own substantial network assets of its own: fiber optic lines, switches and other equipment. The Telecommunications Act required big incumbent local phone companies to sell access to pieces of their networks -- like the copper lines that run into almost every home and business -- to other carriers. But each part of a network that is leased by a new carrier rather than built and owned reduces that new carrier's chances for profitability.
"You need to own your own network to have a viable business plan," Mr. Kastan said. "And to do that you need to raise a huge amount of capital."
That voracious appetite for capital is one reason so many competitive local carriers are in trouble. In the current economy and stock market, the capital markets are essentially closed to them, making it difficult to raise money for network construction and for weathering the up-front losses the new networks incur.
One key reason many analysts expect RCN to survive the downturn is that Mr. McCourt raised billions of dollars when the getting was good. Having parlayed his cable ditch-digging skills into small communications companies -- one in Boston, a second in London -- that he nurtured and then sold, Mr. McCourt used his proceeds in 1993 to start a partnership with the Peter Kiewit construction empire, to take control of a small communications company in Pennsylvania called C-Tec. After a series of spinoffs, Mr. McCourt kept the company that is now called RCN -- the name was derived from "residential communications network" -- which he moved to Princeton.
In 1999, Paul G. Allen's Vulcan Ventures agreed to invest $1.7 billion in RCN and still owns about 27 percent of the company. That year, RCN also secured a $250 million investment from Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, the investment firm, which still owns almost 8 percent of the company. In addition, RCN made secondary stock offerings in both 1998 and 1999.
Another key to RCN's viability has been the relatively efficient way that the company has built its networks. Part of that is simply the operational know-how from Mr. McCourt's long construction experience. But the company has also marshaled its resources by concentrating on relatively densely populated areas, often with many apartment buildings, rather than trying to string together single-family homes. 
But while deep pockets and careful construction are necessary for a new local carrier, there is also the complicated business of running a communications carrier. The mundane but crucial tasks include scheduling and dispatching installation technicians efficiently and making sure that customers are being billed every month (and cutting off customers who don't pay). Many a start-up has stumbled on such basic steps, and so far RCN's record on these matters has been mixed. 
"The issues right now are expense control and upgrades of the back-office systems," Mr. Kastan said. "They have the right strategy, but this company will have to demonstrate a lot more on the expense control and the system-upgrade sides before they really get out of the woods. I'm a big believer in McCourt. But they need to show better execution."
Mr. McCourt acknowledges the need for RCN to tighten up its operation. This year, he recruited two senior executives to ride herd on expenses and the company's field technicians. And last week, the company announced it would buy a new billing and customer management system from the Convergys Corporation.
The billing system is of particular concern because many of RCN's customers who use the company for multiple services now receive multiple bills each month. Unified billing would probably please customers and would also give the company more flexibility in offering promotions and lower prices for people who subscribe to a package of phone, cable and Internet services. It might also enable the company to sign up more customers more efficiently.
"We kept getting phone and cable on separate bills and over all, it did seem more expensive than what people in other buildings were paying," recalled Ashley Quigley, 24, an executive conference planner in Manhattan. Until last fall, she lived in an apartment building on the Upper East Side served by RCN. Despite the billing issues, "I was impressed that the service people I dealt with were actually intelligent and efficient human beings," she said. "The service people were really good."
Mr. McCourt, who is married with two children, says he has no intention of leaving RCN. But he concedes that the day may come when he is no longer the right person for day-to-day management. 
He said he expected his eventual successor to come from within the company. RCN's senior management team includes Michael A. Adams, Mr. McCourt's longtime business partner, who is now president of RCN's wholesale and strategic development group; Robert J. Currey, RCN's vice chairman and former chief executive of 21st Century Telecom Group, a small local carrier in Chicago that was acquired by RCN last year; and Jeffrey M. White, president of RCN's customer and field operations group, who was formerly the chief financial officer and No. 2 executive at Telecom New Zealand.
"It takes a different skill set to come up with an idea and start a company than it does to run it and maybe take it to the next level," Mr. McCourt said. "Might I be chairman at some point and someone else is C.E.O.? Maybe. But I will see RCN's dream become a reality. I'm not going to sell out. I think I'm qualified to finish that dream."

HEADLINE: Hopes for Change in Jordan Are Beginning to Fade 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, April 7 

 BODY:
The billboards loom large over highway intersections, showing people from various walks of life. One features a yuppie in rimless eyeglasses and a tie, the next a village womn with a gold tooth wearing a head scarf and embroidered dress.
 "Jordan" the advertisements proclaim in huge, stylized Arabic letters, while smaller script flowing near the bottom quotes a line of medieval poetry that translates loosely as "You reap what you sow." 
 Adil Milhameh supervises a restaurant grilling chickens a few hundred yards from one billboard, and he waves dismissively when asked about it, saying, "Please ask someone else because I have no idea what it means."
The answer you get depends on whom you ask, and invariably mirrors the debate over the direction King Abdullah II, who is scheduled to meet with President Bush in Washington on Tuesday, has pointed this small desert country since assuming the throne two years ago. 
To the brash young consultant class brandishing East Coast M.B.A.'s who swirl around the 39-year-old king, the advertisements embody a thoroughly modern Jordan. They applaud the royal court for commissioning a British advertising agency to develop a slogan exhorting Jordanians to work harder as they join the globalization parade.
To many Jordanians outside the royal circle, the ads represent folly. They are too Western, too cerebral and too expensive. The business model for selling detergent cannot be applied to transforming a conservative, tribal society, they say, and the attempt indicates a dangerous detachment from a people feeling adrift, impoverished and doubtful about promised economic and political change. 
"I had hoped that something was going to change in Jordan, that we would get things like free speech and freedom of the press," said Emad E. Hajjaj, Jordan's leading political cartoonist. He was questioned by the secret police and ultimately fired from his job at a government-controlled newspaper after a series of cartoons mocking the leading cell phone company, bureaucrats opposing privatization and the king. "The situation is the same as it was before, maybe getting worse."
Before, of course, refers to the 47-year rule of King Hussein. Just before his death in February 1999, he abruptly switched the line of succession to the next generation, from his brother Prince Hassan to his own oldest son. 
The new king, born of an English mother and educated almost entirely outside Jordan, was unexpectedly catapulted onto the throne from his job as special forces commander. 
The sniping started early about Abdullah's poorly pronounced, barracks Arabic; about his seeming inability to travel anywhere in the world with fewer than 100 people; and about what many call the admittedly impossible task of matching the royal stature that his father projected both at home and regionally. 
Abdullah has, by all accounts, worked hard. He can now make a speech in classical Arabic that is passable, if not poetic. He spends more time at home and last month was host for a meeting of Arab leaders. 
The fact that nobody stormed out or engaged in the past practice of heaving plates at each other was considered something of an achievement for the king. (Jordanians flipping between local television and satellite channels noted that the former praised the summit meeting as a triumph while the latter detailed the failure to agree on lifting United Nations sanctions against Iraq.) 
Leading up to his meeting with Mr. Bush, the king has been in Washington this week, lobbying for improved economic ties and greater American involvement in ending Israeli-Palestinian violence.
Since his first speeches, Abdullah has promised Jordanians democracy with all its trimmings and economic growth. In emphasizing the economy, he talks less about political change. Information Minister Taleb Rifai said November elections might be postponed briefly. 
On the economic front, Jordanians credit the king with many achievements, including negotiating a rare free trade agreement with Washington (its approval is still pending in Congress), rewriting dozens of laws to attract investors, and marketing Jordan as a potential mecca for Internet technology. 
But many worry about haphazard implementation. To take one instance, English and computer instruction was inaugurated in elementary schools, but critics say computers were delivered to teachers untrained in using them. 
Last weekend the palace organized a Dead Sea retreat for 300 private and public sector leaders to discuss goals for economic and social change. Those close to the king extolled his atypical consensus building, while many others grumbled about being props lending a domestic stamp of approval to ideas dreamed up by an American consulting firm. 
Jordan is to an extent hobbled by its geography, sandwiched between Iraq and the West Bank. Bloodshed there in the last seven months has not only savaged Jordan's crucial tourism industry -- visits early this year were down by one-third -- but also made investors wary. 
Trade with Iraq that once earned Jordan more than $1 billion annually is now about one quarter that. Per capita income for an average Jordanian, $1,187 in 1998, slipped $20 a year later. Officially nearly 16 percent of Jordanians ae unemployed, but unofficially up to one in three has no job. 
"I hear that the government is encouraging investment, but you don't see it on the ground -- there is nothing in real life," said Amin Tamim, who owns a downtown business selling bathroom parts. 
Jordan has always had certain fault lines. The most pronounced lies between native Jordanians and Palestinians, who form the business elite and at least 50 percent of the 5 million population. At a recent soccer match, fans of a native Jordanian team chanted for Israel to strengthen its army and for the king to divorce his Palestinian wife, Queen Rania, 30. 
In good times this could be dismissed as adolescent exuberance, but in hard times anything might spark unrest. One demonstration last fall in support of the Palestinian uprising against Israel ended with marchers smashing expensive cars. Mass protests have largely been denied permits since then, including one this week by professional unions. 
The unions spearhead opposition to the 1994 peace treaty with Israel, and in January their Antinormalization Committee published a list of individuals and businesses it said should be boycotted for dealing with the enemy. It included prominent names like the royal court chief. The secret police soon hauled seven committee members out of bed in the middle of the night and off to jail. 
"The authorities still think of themselves as Big Brother, that they know what is right for the country," said Asma Khader, a human rights lawyer who says the government should have taken the list-makers to court for slander and inciting violence. 
The government makes no apologies. "It had to be stopped -- it was becoming like the Inquisition in Spain," said Mr. Rifai, the information minister. "Nothing was done outside the existing law. If you tell me the existing law needs to be changed, well, maybe."
Some Jordanians draw a parallel between their country and Syria next door. Its young leader, Dr. Bashar al-Assad, also unexpectedly inherited a country from his father and promised to transform it. Although Jordan is far freer than Syria, there are parallels in that the secret police, tribal politics, cronyism and an entrenched bureaucracy all work to smother change. 
"What difference does it make if you have a young driver but it's still the same old vehicle?" said Adnan Abu-Odeh, a former United Nations envoy and adviser to King Hussein. "Until the vehicle is changed, you can't expect any real difference."

The Purloined Treaty

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
You will be relieved to learn that France's copy of the Treaty of Fontainebleau -- signed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814 but which mysteriously vanished from the French national archives in 1988 -- has been safely in F.B.I. hands for five years.
 That's how long it has taken Mary Jo Molasses, the dilatory U.S attorney in New York, to prosecute a couple who tried to sell the treaty through an auction house in 1995. In the document, Napoleon -- crushed by russia, Austria and Russia -- abdicated as emperor before being exited to Elba. 
 I discovered the Case of the Purloined Treaty in a little gem of an article by Robert D. McFadden, the patron saint of rewrite men, who next month will celebrate his 40th anniversary at The Times. McFadden's story invites the question: What is an international treaty worth? 
At its best, a treaty is worth a nation's honor. What Germany's Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg derided in 1914 as a mere "scrap of paper" was Britain's guarantee of Belgium's neutrality, which took the British into World War I. A long generation later, that Western reputation for sticking by agreements to stop aggression gave credibility to NATO, thereby averting a war.
But sometims treaties are worthless. In bellicose statements just after the Aries collision, China -- seeking to extend its territoriality far from its shores -- evoked the Law of the Sea Treaty. That was a product of the Carter era, almost turning ownership of the ocean's resources over to a new U.N. bureaucracy supposedly representing "all mankind." 
Some of us derided that treaty to undermine free enterprise by using its unfortunate acronym -- LOST -- and Ronald Reagan saved the U.S. from signing it. We adopt as custom useful provisions in LOST about free passage, but the U.S. is not signatory to its socialist aims and we were not obliged to attend to China's fulmination. 
Another attempt to draw the U.S. into a protocol against our national interest was pressed a few years ago in Kyoto, Japan. 
That would have forced the U.S. to roll back its emission of carbon dioxide in this decade to 7 percent below 1990 levels -- at immeasurable cost in economic growth and jobs -- while countries like China, India, Mexico and Brazil go on apparently hotting up the planet. President Clinton, after milking the issue for the publicity, never submitted the global deal to the Senate for ratification. 
Let's stop and think this through, said George W. Bush, thereby outraging environmentalists. The new president had erred in a campaign document by including carbon dioxide as a pollutant, a "promise" not much noted last summer. When he corrected himself last month, greens turned purple, accusing him of breaking a solemn pledge. But is it wise to leap into signing treaties, which become the supreme law of the land, without full knowledge of real sacrifices required? 
Another international agreement attracting those afflicted with treaty-itis is to establish an International Criminal Court. Its goal sounds noble: to make permanent a process begun in Nuremberg to bring war criminals to justice. Three years ago, at a U.N. conference in Rome, 116 nations signed up. But not us, and not Israel. 
That's because the agreement empowers a global court to arrest, try and imprison American, Israeli and other citizens of democracies for an undefined crime of "aggression." With no Security Council veto to restrain the I.C.C., its prosecutor would surely accede today to an Arab League request to indict Israeli soldiers, and tomorrow to indict any U.S. officeholder or servicemember who dared to offend a local dictator. 
An international prosecutor, answerable to no nation and unrestrained by any Bill of Rights, is the rest of the world's weapon to bring the too-sovereign superpower to heel. Were we to subject ourselves to the rule of the lawless, no U.S. sailor or president could travel abroad without becoming vulnerable to arrest by a politically motivated prosecutor. 
Multilateral treaties that weaken the U.S. do not strengthen freedom abroad; uni- is not iso-. In our reluctance to appear imperious, we could all too quickly abdicate leadership by catering to the envious crowd. After his calamitous retreat from Moscow, Napoleon said with rue, "From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step."

HEADLINE: America Is Borrowing Trouble 

BYLINE:  By Franco Modigliani and Robert M. Solow; Franco Modigliani and Robert M. Solow are Nobel Prize winners in economics and professors emeriti at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Many have criticized President Bush's proposal for a deep and lasting cut in income taxes, but hardly anyone has addressed its implications for what may well be the greatest potential danger facing the economy in the years to come: the large and growing deficit in our international trade balance. A massive, permanent tax cut would make the international economic position of the United States worse, not better. This is in addition to its other disadvantages. 
 The past decade has been one of exceptional economic vigor: output increased nearly 40 percent, investment more than doubled and consumption grew just over 40 percent, pushed by a spending spree that reduced personal saving to near zero. But this rosy picture was accompanied by one worrisome development: throughout this period, spending grew faster than what the country earned, spilling over, in large part, into a growing trade deficit. By the end of 2000, the excess of expenditure o
er income had reached about 4 percent of America's gross domestic product and was apparently still on the rise.
 For a country, just as for a family, there are only two ways of getting the money to spend more than one's income: borrowing it and selling assets. In the case of nations, the creditors and the buyers of the assets are foreigners. And inded, throughout this prosperous past decade the United States sold more and more assets, like government bonds and shares in its companies, and went deeper and deeper into debt.
But why should one worry about this development? It is not serious as long as the debt is small and remains under control so as not to worry creditors. But if the debt is not under control, or if some event makes the debtor appear less creditworthy than before, the creditors may decide that they are not willing to finance a country's growing debt -- for fear of a depreciation of the debtor's currency that lowers asset values in their own currencies. They may even want to liquidate part of their investment in search of diversification. If such a thing happened to the United States, there could be very unpleasant consequences for Americans.
Depreciation of the dollar would make imports so expensive and exports so cheap as to eliminate the trade deficit. But this depreciation would create a further motive for foreigners to liquidate their American assets, dumping the dollars so obtained in exchange for foreign currency. The size and power of the American economy has protected us from capital flight in shorter episodes of unfavorable trade balance, but there is no guarantee that this will remain true. Nor could the dollar be propped up through purchases by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury, since their small reserves of foreign currency would be woefully inadequate to stem the tide. (The United States reserves amount to some $60 billion compared with a current trade deficit of $400 billion a year, just two months' borrowing.)
Thus a flight from the dollar would produce a deep devaluation and accompanying rise in the prices of imports and of things made with imports. At worst we might experience a wage and price spiral, calling for sharply higher interest rates. The final result could be falling investment and output, and high unemployment. And our weakness would be very likely to spread to other countries.
Few believe that this hard-landing scenario is an immediate threat. But there is good reason to believe that if nothing is done to change the current course, the probability of a costly ending will keep increasing. To avoid that danger, the administration and Congress should develop a plan that promptly stops the growth of the trade deficit, then reduces it to zero and possibly produces a positive balance, allowing for some repayment -- and all this without an appreciable increase in unemployment.
The success of such a plan would rest on two main ingredients: a gradual reduction of total domestic expenditure relative to income -- that is, a rise in national saving -- and an increase in net exports. These two components should proceed hand in hand; indeed, given the current level of demand for domestically produced goods and services, if we added to it by shifting more of our output to exports prematurely, the result would be inflationary pressures. Conversely, a reduction of domestic demand would have to be ountered by an expansion of net exports to avoid creating a contraction in output and employment.
Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the administration and Congress are concerned with the balance of trade issue or are even aware of it. On the contrary, President Bush is galloping in exactly the wrong direction with his advocacy of using the likely (though by no means certain) large forthcoming budget surplus for a deep, permanent tax cut, rather than for retiring the debt or endowing Social Security -- or both.
The president's proposal is just the opposite of the needed increase in national saving, and the consequences would be very negative. First, it would raise consumption by roughly one dollar for every dollar of tax reduction -- which is precisely what the supporters of the bill claim to be its justification. But, given the limitations on our labor force and our abiity to produce, the rise in consumption would sooner or later produce some combination of the following unhealthy outcomes: significant inflationary pressures, in part undoing the tax rebate; a likely rise in interest rates to counter the inflation, leading to a reduction in investment; and a further increase in the trade deficit.
Can anyone really favor encouraging a further expansion of the recent spending spree at the expense of investment, the source of future growth? Or reducing taxes at the expense of a sharp addition to future taxes, required to service a much larger debt at higher interest rates? Or supporting a tax cut financed with money borrowed abroad, even in the favorable case in which foreign lenders would be prepared to finance a rapidly growing debt?
If Congress is acting responsibly, the least it can do is to postpone a deep permanent tax cut until this trade balance has turned positive.
But, some tax-cut proponents will argue, what if right now there is a clear danger of a significant economic contraction? If this were clearly the case -- and it is still in doubt -- then some measure to support demand might be appropriate. But the best approach would be to expand net exports, helping both domestic demand and the trade balance -- perhaps by aiming at a controlled, limited devaluation of the dollar and by encouraging other countries, like Europe, to pursue more expansionary policies in their own interest.
It may even be justifiable to consider a modest, temporary tax cut, but with a warning that theory and evidence suggest that transitory tax cuts are likely to produce only limited, quick effects.

HEADLINE: Baghdad Journal; 
O Iraqi Youth, Dig It, the Time Has Come to Rock

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
"What's wrong with you guys? You're all such a bunch of quitters!" said the brittle-voiced young woman doing the afternoon stint as disc jockey on the most popular radio station in Iraq, Voice of Iraq FM.
 A call-in program, conducted in Eglish, was in its second hour, and no one had successfully answered any of the prize-winning questions. "It's so easy!" the D.J. said, her tone heavy with exasperation. "All I'm asking is, tell me the Metallica song that won a Grammy in 1989!" A few minutes later, another caller couldn't name the "four different types" of music sung by Bob Dylan, and still another faltered when asked to name the "godfather of heavy metal." 
 "Give me a break," the caller stumped by the heavy metal question said, eager for a prize -- for women, a shopping spree at a fashionable Baghdad boutique; for men, a six-month membership in a popular body-building club. But the D.J. was unsparing. "Seems like you are such a loser," she said. "I don't like to say that, but you are!" 
In the land of Nebuchadnezzar, of the Islamic caliphs, and of Saddam Hussein, radio has gone cool -- or as cool as a team of young producers and on-air personalities can make it.
Baghdad, after all, has been isolated from the world by a decade of economic sanctions. And the visa requirements of Western countries, the jamming of foreign radio broadcasts, and Mr. Hussein's stringent restrictions on who can go abroad, have not made it easy to keep up with what is hip in London, Los Angeles or New York.
Still, to be driving through Baghdad and have your taxi driver tune in to "FM," as the station is commonly known, is to experience a sort of somersault of the mind. Mr. Hussein's Iraq, for a decade, has produced some of the most virulently anti-American propaganda anywhere. 
In newspapers and newscasts -- even those on "FM" -- President Bush is "the little criminal" (his father is the big one, for having assembled the military alliance that drove Iraq from Kuwait in 1991). And the sanctions, although imposed by the United Nations Security Council, are America's way of "annihilating an entire nation."
Why, then, is the government allowing a radio station to draw millions of listeners with programming that speaks to, and may encourage, an addiction to things American, especially among Iraqis drawn to rock, rap and country music -- and, what's more, broadcasting in English? And why are its programs broadcast over the tightly regulated, state-owned broadcasting network? 
The answer, in part, lies with the station's owner -- Uday Saddam Hussein, the older of the Iraqi ruler's two sons, a man with a notorious capacity to shock. Iraqi opposition groups abroad, and the State Department's annual human rights reports, have declared for years that Uday Hussein, now 36, has a history of violent and unpredictable behavior. This is said to have included shooting and knifing to death individuals who have crossed him and ordering executions or the amputation of hands for those accused of having shamed the country.
One report in recent years said that he had imprisoned members of Iraq's national soccer team after they lost an important match. 
In Iraq's highly secretive, fear-driven society, it is impossible to determine whether such stories are true, or, as government officials contend, invented to discredit Saddam Hussein and his son. In any case, Uday Hussein, now a member of Parliament and for years president of the country's Olympic Committee, has added a powerful string to his political bow -- and, his loyalists claim, a strong following among young Iraqis -- by founding "FM" and a sister television channel, Youth TV.
Jawad al-Ali, who has run the two stations since Uday Hussein drafted him from the No. 2 position in the state broadcasting network in 1993, said in an interview that "FM," at peak hours, draws 95 per cent of the listening audience across Iraq, and that Youth TV, also broadcast over the state network's facilities, also draws a lopsided slice of the viewing audience with its two channels -- 75 percent.
If accurate, the figures suggest that the Stalinist fare offered by the only state-owned television channel has alienated Iraqis -- particularly the two-thirds of the 23 million population under 30 -- in droves. This, to anybody who has watched the channel, is scarcely a surprise. 
Evening broadcasts feature stone-faced announcers reading vehement denunciations of the United States, interspersed with long sequences of Saddam Hussein meeting top officials or accepting frenzied welcomes from crowded ranks of ordinary Iraqis.
Youth TV has a sports channel and a "general" channel, whose main attraction is pirated Hollywood movies that have become a focal point of Baghdad social life. The movies include recent releases, with a heavy emphasis on tough-guy films starring Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jean-Claude Van Damme. Mr. Ali acknowledged that many of the movies were recorded off foreign satellite movie channels and rebroadcast without permission 
Satellite television is denied to all but the most privileged Iraqis by a law that provides severe penalties, including imprisonment, for owning a satellite dish. But Mr. Ali seemed to revel in answering a question about the pirating, turning his answer into a gibe at the United States, delivered with a half-smile. "We say you stole all the world, so just let us steal this small part," he said.
As for Uday Hussein's stealing the state network's audiences -- and offering markedly less hagiographic coverage of Saddam Hussein -- Mr. Ali said that Uday Hussein had put the idea of starting the private stations to his father, who enthusiastically endorsed it.
The private channels have drawn attention for gentle prodding of the government in their news coverage and documentary programs. But Mr. Ali stiffened when asked if a program featuring the interior minister, in charge of police and prisons, had featured complaints about human rights abuses. "Absolutely not," he said smoothly. "No one has said anything like that."
Among Iraqis, there is quiet -- very quiet -- discussion about the role Youth TV and the FM station could play in the eventual succession to Saddam Hussein, who is 63 and the subject of persistent rumors in recent months, officially denied, that he is ill with advanced lymphatic cancer. In an assassination attempt in 1996 that was ascribed to Iranian agents, when a rocket-propelled grenade was fired as his sports car on a Baghdad street, Uday Hussein was critically wounded and spent months recuperating. 
Now, he has moved back into the public eye.
Iraqi opposition groups based in London and New York have speculated that his role as a broadcaster is part of a behind-the-scenes struggle for the succession with his brother, Qusai, who is 34 and a major political figure in his own right. Qusai Hussein is the leader of the army's elite Republican Guards, and, some say, oversees the most powerful security and intelligence agencies. One recent rumor about Saddam Hussein's health said he had appointed a family council, headed by Qusai Hussein, to govern the country in the event of his death.
But if there is a family power struggle, Mr. Ali refused to be drawn out on the subject. "Uday Hussein is a popular man, with or without Youth TV and FM," he said. "He is the son of the president, and of course you know he is very intellectual, he has a Ph.D. in international politics."
As for his own prospects, in the kind of high-profile job that has seen many prominent Iraqis fall from grace, sometimes fatally, the broadcast chief smiled. Was it not inevitable, given the Western-style, laid-back programming offered by FM and Youth TV, that he would eventually go a step too far, he was asked.
"Everybody makes mistakes, but so far, I've made no big mistakes," he said. Then, after a pause, he added, in Arabic, "al Hamdulillah," "Thanks be to God."

HEADLINE: OPPOSITION BUILDS TO SPENDING CUTS IN BUSH'S BUDGET 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8 

 BODY:
Even before Monday's formal release of President Bush's detailed budget and the cuts it would make in various domestic programs, influential constituencies have begun to howl in protest.
 But Vice President Dick Cheney warned Congress today not to go too far in restoring spending, saying Mr. Bush would reject spending that he viewed as excessive. 
 "The president has the right to veto appropriations, and this president is eager to veto appropriations that come in over budget," Mr. Cheney said on the ABC News program "This Week." "If Congress is going to pass porked-up appropriations measures, they will run into a veto." 
Mr. Bush will release full details of his $1.96 trillion budget on Monday, providing fresh examples of his proposed cuts in corporate subsidies and in some housing, health and social welfare programs.
The White House says the cuts are needed to put federal spending on a more sustainable path after several yea0s of rapid growth. But some members of Congress from both parties have objected that the cuts are compelled mainly to pay for the large tax cuts Mr. Bush has been seeking.
Lobbyists, having learned many of the details, are mobilizing efforts -- with their allies in Congress -- to preserve or expand the programs.
Mr. Bush says he can save billions of dollars by reducing "corporate subsidies," eliminating "duplicative nd ineffective programs" and wiping out pork barrel projects approved at the behest of individual lawmakers. But the reality is often more complex than the White House suggests.
The president will, for example, propose eliminating federal loan guarantees for people who buy commercial ships built in American shipyards. The White House says such subsidies for oil tankers and cruise ships are not needed.
The American Shipbuilding Association is determined to get $100 million of loan guarantees this year, and it has lined up support from powerful Republicans from coastal states like Mississippi (Senator Trent Lott), Louisiana (Representative Billy Tauzin) and Alaska (Senator Ted Stevens). 
Cynthia Brown, president of the shipbuilders association, does not like the word subsidy. Ms. Brown insists that the loan guarantees are a way to preserve shipbuilding capabilities essential to national security at a time when Navy ship procurement is "at a rock-bottom low." The loan guarantees are made under a 1936 law passed at the request of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who wanted to revitalize the merchant fleet.
Mr. Lott and Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, recently wrote Mr. Bush, saying the loan guarantees should be increased to "historic levels." A bipartisan group of 10 House members sent Mr. Bush a letter seeking $100 million for such guarantees, which is more than three times as much as Congress provided for the current year. The money, they said, would help finance construction of environmentally safe double-hulled oil tankers and large oceangoing cruise ships.
On Feb. 28, Mr. Bush issued an outline of his budget, giving a peek at his plans and priorities. In the five weeks since then, lobbyists have ferreted out details and sharpened their arguments against Mr. Bush's proposals. Lobbyists will use the next two weeks, while Congress is in recess, to present their cases to lawmakers back home.
The National Association of Children's Hospitals and the American Academy of Pediatrics have joined members of Congress trying to prevent cuts in children's programs. The administration wants to trim $35 million from a $235 million program for training doctors at children's hospitals. 
Senators Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, and Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio, and several Democratic senators -- Dianne Feinstein of California, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts an Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut -- have expressed concern.
Bush administration officials said the program, at $200 million, would still provide much more money than was available last year. In any event, they said, the money is used mainly to train doctors, not to care for patients, and other programs provide care to children.
The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials is fighting other proposed cuts, including one to slice $700 million from a program for construction and repair of public housing. Congress provided $3 billion for the public housing capital fund last year.
The housing association's Web site, www.nahro.org, includes an "action alert" with "talking points" for local housing officials to use in lobbying lawmakers during the Congressional recess.
Likewise, a wide range of businesses are scrambling to protect the Export-Import Bank from cuts that will be proposed by Mr. Bush. Defenders of the bank include the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and exporters of all sizes. They recently sent a letter of protest to the White House. "A reduction in Ex-Im Bank financing will translate directly into fewer U.S. exports and a consequent loss of export-related jobs, at a time when the slowdown in U.S. economic growth is already resulting in large-scale layoffs," the letter said.
Mr. Bush is expected to propose a 24 percent reduction in the bank's budget, below the current level of $927 million. Representative Jim Kolbe, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the bank, said, "We need to be expanding, not reducing, the amount the bank gets." 
Thomas J. Donohue, president of the Chamber of Commerce, said a record trade deficit last year highlighted the need for such assistance.
Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, praised Mr. Bush for trying to reduce what Mr. Moore called "corporate welfare programs."
But Mr. Moore said: "The programs are very difficult to eliminate because powerful corporate interests spend a lot of money to retain them. Some of the biggest donors to the Republican National Committee and to individual Republican candidates receive grants, loans, loan guarantees and insurance under these programs."
Mr. Bush will also propose eliminating federal subsidies for loans made under the main lending program of the Small Business Administration. He would raise fees charged to borrowers and to lenders.
The lenders are lobbying against Mr. Bush's proposal. They deny that they receive any federal subsidy. They say the White House overestimates the number of defaults that will occur. And they say the president's proposal would sharply reduce the ability of small businesses to obtain the capital they need to grow and prosper.
The lobbying campaign is led by the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, a trade association of 700 institutions ranging from giants like the Bank of America and Citibank to small local lenders. The association, based in Stillwater, Okla., was created in 1985 for one purpose: to represent banks that make loans under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act.
Senator Christopher S. Bond, the Missouri Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Small Business, opposes Mr. Bush's plan. The proposal, Mr. Bond said, would deny credit to small businesses at a time when the economy was slowing and loans were more difficult to obtain.
Mr. Bush also plans to reduce the budget for one of President Bill Clinton's favorite programs, Community Oriented Policing Services, to $855 million next year, from $1 billion this year, administration officials said. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, said this would be a serious mistake, "a misguided retreat from our commitment to keep crime down." 
Administration officials said there was no proof the program had reduced crime, and they said the hiring of police officers was mainly a local responsibility.
Mr. Bush wants to save $25 million by eliminating a disaster preparedness program known as Project Impact. He said the program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, "has not proved effective." 
Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, has won support from the Senate for her efforts to save the program, which shores up buildings to minimize damage. The project, Ms. Murray said, saved lives in the earthquake that jolted the Pacific Northwest on Feb. 28.

Chart: "Proposed Cuts in Some Programs Energize Defenders"

Management Walks a Unified Line in the Hollywood Talks

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 8 

 BODY:
Normally, they are the best of enemies, scrapping over film and television projects, competing to sign major stars, plotting to outmaneuver one another for the prime release dates, sometimes even going so far as to take undisguised glee in the misfortunes of the others. 
 But now, the major studios and TV networks find themselves thrust together to negotiate contracts with Hollywood's writers and actors, bound by a two-decade-old vow of consensus under which no conclusion can be reached unless everyone agrees to it -- in effect, putting everyone at the mercy of the most stubborn person in the room. 
 How the companies cooperate on the main goals while maneuvering to secure their own agendas will be one of the driving forces determining whether the Hollywood entertainment machine keeps humming through the summer or clicks off like a light bulb.
The prospect of dual strikes by writers and actors, which would, together, effectively shut down the entertainment industry in Southern California, is growing more urgent.
On one side of the table sits the Writers Guild of America, representing some 11,000 movie and TV writers, whose contract expires on May 1. Later, negotiators for the estimated 135,000 actors represented by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, whose contract expires on June 30, will begin their talks. 
Opposite them sit Nicholas Counter, the president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and chief negotiator for the studios and networks, and representatives from some of the alliance's top members.
The alliance represents 350 production companies and studios, but in practice the dominant members are those referred to by both sides as "the companies," meaning the major Hollywood movie studios and the production arms of the broadcast and cable TV networks. It is these big players that dominate the negotiation committee, whose unanimous agreement is required for any settlement.
While these top companies share many of the same concerns about keeping production costs low and minimizing wage increases, they also have their differences and their own sets of goals and demands that they will have to negotiate, not only with the guilds but with the other members of the management team.
Not all members of the alliance are equal, not even the major ones whose top executives have come to play a dominant role in the negotiations. The most striking difference is one of scale. Four of the companies are simply larger entertainment entities than the others: AOL Time Warner, whose huge holdings include the Warner Brothers movie studio and the fledgling WB network; Viacom, whose holdings include Paramount Pictures and CBS; Walt Disney, which includes the Disney movie studios and ABC; and the News Corporation, which includes 20th Century Fox film studios and the Fox network.
"Basically, there are four big players in the room and the rest of us are pipsqueaks," is the way one executive from a smaller entertainment company put it.
Universal Studios, recently acquired by Vivendi, a French conglomerate, is also now a huge Hollywood player, though Vivendi's eclectic mix of businesses, including film production, cable TV and water services, makes it unclear how it will fit in with the other media heavyweights. Indeed, Vivendi has not yet played a dominant role in the current talks, people on both sides said. 
And as for Sony and its Columbia Pictures subsidiary, its mix of film production and digital enterprises is overshadowed by the hardware businesses of the parent company, based in Tokyo, keeping it from wielding the same authority across the entertainment spectrum as the studio-and-network companies like Disney and Viacom.
Indeed, the prominence of those four big players has been mirrored in the executives who have played dominant roles in the negotiations thus far. Although Mr. Counter is the chief negotiator for producers in the talks, the executives who have played the largest roles in the crucial discussions over economics, according to officials on both sides of the table, have been Barry Meyer, chairman of Warner Brothers; Robert Iger, president of Disney; Jonathan Dolgen, chairman of the Viacom Entertainment Group; and Peter Chernin, the News Corporation's chief operating officer. Mr. Meyer and Mr. Iger have taken the lead in public, speaking at news conferences and briefings for the news media.
In the talks over so-called creative rights, the contentious issues involving writers' perception that they are treated as second-class citizens in the moviemaking process, the lead players have been the DreamWorks SKG co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg; the chairwoman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group, Sherry Lansing; and the president of Warner Brothers, Alan Horn, though Mr. Katzenberg has played the leading public role.
For the first time since such negotiations began a half-century ago, a majority of the studios taking part are owned by huge media conglomerates that also own major networks, putting them in the potentially conflicting position of seeking demands that would benefit their production divisions while being economically disadvantageous to their network arms.
"Everyone knows that when they come into these negotiations they must be wearing their producer hats, not their network hats," said one studio executive involved in the talks. "These talks are on behalf of the producers, the production companies. And believe me, if someone tried to take a position that was more beneficial to some other division, like a television network, it would be pointed out very vigorously by the others in the room. These are not shy, submissive people."
Part of what keeps people in line is taking the long view, Mr. Counter said. "Whether it's a TV issue or a theatrical issue, every company in the room realizes that their mix of programs and movies change from time to time," he said. "While they may not be particularly heavy at the moment in TV, in two or five years, they may well be. Right now, Fox has the most television production. Three years ago, it was Warner Brothers. Three years from now, it could be any one of them."
Early in the talks, there was some speculation that the increasing corporatization of the studios -- which has transformed them from independent enterprises presided over by men called moguls to buttoned-down divisions of huge media conglomerates -- might create a situation in which differences among them could fracture their shield of unanimity. But few now expect this to happen. In fact, many argue that the combination of so many studios and networks has made the companies more alike than they have ever been.
"What is different is that most of these companies have other businesses that they can rely on for revenues, if there's a strike," Mr. Counter said. "They're not solely in the business of producing television programs and movies. They're also more similar. Many more of them have both studios and networks, and most have some sort of cable outlets, so there's a great deal of agreement on goals."
Because so many of these companies have holdings in so many different areas -- AOL Time Warner has its Internet empire as well as publishing and other concerns; the News Corporation has a global network of newspapers, publishing, cable and satellite TV -- they are more likely to be able to weather a strike in one part of their empires. 
But it is not the case for all of the management parties in the talks. DreamWorks, for instance, remains largely a movie production company, with some smaller involvement in popular music and TV production. Unlike older studios like Warner Brothers, the seven-year-old DreamWorks has no deep library of films that it can draw on for revenue in a strike. And many other, much smaller production companies are in a similar position. 
In another sense, though, companies without TV networks or cable divisions may be in a stronger position to weather the early months of a strike. That is because the studios have been able, through accelerated production schedules the last six months, to stockpile enough films to last well into 2002. It is the networks, needing fresh material for the fall season, that would feel the initial brunt of a strike.
It is the rule of unanimity, Mr. Counter said, that kept the various parties focused on the issue they have in common -- the desire for lower production costs -- rather than on the issues raised by their individual situations.
A prime example of this is the special exemption that the fledgling networks -- Fox, WB and UPN -- were able to negotiate regarding residual payment. When the Fox Network first started out, it argued that since it was not yet as established as networks like NBC or CBS, it could not pay writers and others as much in residuals as those networks did. This year, however, the writers guild insisted that Fox pay the full freight, arguing that it had received no discount when it negotiated against the major networks over things like professional football broadcast rights. 
When the talks broke off last month, management offered to raise Fox's residuals to 75 percent of the amount paid by the major networks. But keeping Fox's residuals low is a prime example of an issue that is of keen interest to one party while not at all in the interests of others whose companies also own big networks.
What happens when something like this occurs? 
Representatives from both sides use the same analogy to describe the process, that of a Congressional appropriations bill. "You've got one senator with a pet road project and another senator with a pet dam project, and they agree to support each other's project in the interests of getting the overall appropriations bill passed, which all of them want," one studio executive said. 
The key, Mr. Counter said, is maintaining that unanimity.
"We've got to have an absolutely firm position," he said. "Technically, any member of the alliance that broke away and tried to make their own agreement with the unions would be in violation of their agreement with the other companies and liable for damages. But that's not going to happen. We've been through some tough times over the years, and the rule of unanimity has always worked."

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK -- Marguerite Vogt; 
A Lifetime Later, Still in Love With the Lab

BYLINE:  By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
At the age of 88, when any sensible woman might feel entitled to indulge in a second childhood, Dr. Marguerite Vogt is still contentedly working on her first one -- a childhood spent in that grand, intimate, luxuriously rigorous toy store otherwise known as a scientific laboratory.
 After all, she began publishing research papers while she was practically still a child -- when, as a 14-year-old girl in Germany, she described a series of fruit fly mutations that cast whisker-thin rays of light on the darkness of embryo development. 
 And for the past three-quarters of a century, Dr. Vogt, now a molecular biologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego, has not strayed from her youthful calling and the bliss that only a bench cluttered with beakers, tubes and petri dishes can bring. 
She did research as a university and medical school student, skipping classes to putter around in the lab and making up for missed lectures by memorizing her textbooks. She did her bench work right through the Nazi era, when, for political reasons, her scientist-parents were thrown out of the Kaiser Wilhelm/Max Planck Institute in Berlin, where her father had been director, and they were forced to open their own research center in the Black Forest.
She did her work through the ruins of postwar Germany, and, after immigrating to the United States, she continued her research wherever bench space could be had, first at the California Institute of Technology, and then at the Salk. Before Louis Kahn's renowned Stonehenge-like structure was completed in 1963, Dr. Vogt worked for the nascent institute in a suffocating windowless woodshed, under hoods that barely protected her from the dangerous microbes she studies.
Over the decades, Dr. Vogt has won the respect of legions of her peers and proteges. She worked for years with Dr. Renato Dulbecco of the Salk Institute on groundbreaking studies of how the polio virus forms distinctive plaques in tissue culture, work that has proved essential to the development of a polio vaccine.
Later, the two researchers explored how a type of mammalian tumor virus called the polyoma virus transforms ordinary cells into cancer cells, research that lifted the study of cancer biology from a mere cataloging of the gross anatomy of a tumor cell to an exploration of the genetic mutations that underlie the disease.
But while Dr. Dulbecco eventually won a Nobel Prize for his research, Dr. Vogt has yet to be awarded a single significant prize, or even to gain membership in the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. Not that you would hear a grumble of bitterness or complaint from Dr. Vogt. "I'm happy not to have been bothered," she said. "When you get too famous, you stop being able to work." 
Dr. Vogt is a small, weathered, unfailingly gracious woman, with foam-white hair and old-world manners, who insists on serving her guest Swiss chocolates and coffee, followed by a slice of rum-soaked cake. She is still reasonably spry, although she says that she no longer can run and do push-ups and calisthenics, as she did every day of her life until a year or two ago. She is hard of hearing, and she speaks in a soft, quavering voice that one must bend close to hear. 
She also has become absent-minded, and has difficulty sometimes remembering to do things like split a dish of cultured cells before they have used up all their nutrients. Then again, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows a quarter of her age have been known to commit similar sins, and worse. 
And few of them have her enormous dedication. Dr. Vogt is in the laboratory 10 hours a day, seven days a week. "I like it here," she explains. "If I were to stay at home, I'd be bored."
Over the years, she has mastered a wide variety of research topics, including oncogenes -- the genes that, when mutated, result in cancer; immunology; and the behavior of telomeres, the distinctive chromosome tips that serve as molecular timepieces in healthy cells but that play a nefarious role in cancer by refusing to shorten as they should. 
"Marguerite recognized early on that telomeres were interesting and important," said Dr. Martin Haas, Dr. Vogt's good friend and collaborator for the last 30-odd years. "She kept bringing them up and bringing them up, until finally I agreed that we should study them."
Dr. Haas, 54, treats Dr. Vogt with something approaching a son's devotion and affection, arranging her transportation to and from the lab, making sure that she regularly changes the batteries in her hearing aid, writing about her life and work for the journal Cancer Research. Dr. Haas said that nothing would make his great friend happier than to follow her father's example and work up to the very last, with her final glimpse of life being the view through a microscope.
Dr. Vogt is the oldest working scientist at the Salk Institute, although Dr. Dulbecco, the institute's director, is only a year younger. Well-known, deeply respected and frankly beloved, as few scientists are, Dr. Vogt nevertheless presents a complicated sort of role model, particularly for the young women in science who meet her, or know of her reputation. 
On one hand, Dr. Vogt's life has been nothing short of heroic, as she has devoted herself to her work at a time when women rarely did, and often under political and economic conditions that might crush the confidence of even the smuggest young male Turks.
On the other hand, by some reckonings Dr. Vogt has sacrificed too much to the greedy gods of science. She not only never married or had children, she says she never dated anybody, never fell in love. "During the Hitler era, when I was young, I avoided every man," she explained. "I didn't want to end up dating a Nazi, and in Germany at that time, you could never be sure of somebody's politics."
Dr. Haas said, "She was a competitive athlete, and her friends say one of the reasons she took up running was so that she could outrun any man who tried to catch her."
Dr. Vogt also felt that she had to choose between being a scientist and being a wife and mother, and, she said, "Science was my milk." 
Dr. Vogt's older sister and only sibling, Marthe, also became a scientist, studying the biochemistry of the brain, and she, too, opted against marriage and children. 
When asked why the daughters thought they couldn't pull off their mother's trick of emulsifying accomplishments and intimacy, Dr. Vogt replied: "Ah, my mother. She was an exception to the rule."
Beyond the totality of her sacrifice of the personal for the professional, there is also the question of Dr. Vogt's apparent willingness to remain in the background, to hammer away at the bench without demanding any reward beyond the science itself. "When she did the work with Renato, women, with few exceptions, were not treated as equal to men in carrying on research," said Dr. Edward B. Lewis, a fruit fly geneticist at the California Institute of Technology and a good friend of Dr. Vogt's. "Marguerite should have received much more recognition than she did, that's for sure. She's certainly one of best and most intelligent scientists I know."
Dr. David Baltimore, the president of Caltech, said: "Marguerite is just a deeply devoted scientist who worked very hard, loved what she did and was uninterested in the professional side of the business, or in being recognized for what she did. She didn't try to establish herself in that way, or to get out there and tell her story. She let the stories tell themselves. Or, in the case of the work she did with Renato, he was the spokesman for the pair of them."
But Dr. Vogt is not indifferent to the trappings of fame and recognition. She is extremely proud of the fact that her sister, who immigrated to Great Britain in the 1930's, became quite prominent in neuroscience, and was elected to the prestigious Royal Society of London. Dr. Vogt also takes deep pride in her friendship with Dr. Barbara McClintock, the corn geneticist who won a Nobel Prize but who was considered something of a misanthrope.
Yet whether out of personal disinclination or insecurity, Dr. Vogt has never expected laurels for herself. Dr. Vogt also had little regard for her personal safety. When, in the 1950's, she and Dr. Dulbecco were developing the plaque assay for studying the polio virus, she again did much of the work, laboring under a hood in a basement with a pathogen that other biochemists wouldn't touch.
"I didn't tell my parents that I was working with polio virus," said Dr. Vogt.
Dr. Haas added, "They found out about it inadvertently, and they were very angry."
But despite her parents' disapproval of her polio research, Dr. Vogt absorbed her altruistic derring-do from them. Eminent in neurology and psychiatry, the Vogts met and mingled with scientists from around the world, who flocked to the Kaiser Wilhelm/Max Planck Institute, the epicenter of brain research. In the 1920's, officials in the Soviet Union invited Oskar Vogt to Moscow to study Lenin's brain.
"They wanted to show that Lenin was a great communist, and that communism was heritable," said Dr. Haas.
Oskar Vogt also helped the Russians establish a string of brain research institutes of their own. Because of their Moscow connection, though, the Vogts came under suspicion when the Nazis rose to power in Germany. Nor did it help that many of the Vogts' friends and fellow scientists were Jewish. Eventually, the Nazis forced the Vogts to resign from their posts, and they might have put the couple in jail, or even to death, were it not for the intercession of the powerful Krups family, several of whom had been patients of the Vogts. The Krupses donated money to build them a new research center, in the back woods of Neustadt, where they continued their scientific research, while offering refuge to a number of Jewish scientists and their family members. 
"Nowadays, one cannot imagine such a crazy world," said Marguerite Vogt. "I'm glad that I've managed to forget most of it."
Dr. Vogt had been so repelled by her wartime experience that when, in 1950, she was offered a research position in the United States, at Caltech, she jumped at the chance, even though it meant abandoning fruit fly genetics. "There was no interest in Drosophila research," she said. "So I had to take up something new" -- the study of viruses and tumor biology.
On moving to America, Dr. Vogt brought along only one possession: her grand piano. She still plays the piano regularly, and on Sundays holds recitals with fellow musician-scientists. Otherwise, she left Germany wholly behind. She has traveled to many countries, but she has never been back to Germany. And when young German scientists come to the lab, eager to meet the famous Doktor Vogt and to chat with her in their native tongue, she replies, sternly, in English.
By contrast, she would gladly greet a visiting Sorbonne student in French, which, because her mother was French, was the first language she learned. "I have no moral hesitations about that," she said.
Dr. Vogt's moral sense and generosity never waver. "When young people came to the lab, if they didn't have money, I've seen her lend it to them out of her own pocket," Dr. Baltimore said.
When her older sister's health began failing, Dr. Vogt moved her to San Diego and helped care for her, and Marthe is still alive, at 98. A longtime liberal, Dr. Vogt marched in protests against the Vietnam War, and her filing cabinets are decorated with photographs of Democratic presidents from John F. Kennedy through Bill Clinton. She thinks that times are better now for women in science than they were when she was getting started, but she also sees considerable room for improvement.
"There have to be many more of us around," she said. "Maybe then it will be hard to ignore us."

 BODY:
In the emerging information-based economy, Americans need access to knowledge and learning across a lifetime. Teaching workers new technology skills is as important as teaching farmers new agricultural skills was before the turn of the last century. But the Internet and digital communications are being largely wasted as a resource for the kind of broad education the future demands. 
 While it might be a stretch to say that we are in danger of creating a vast digital wasteland, entertainment of marginal quality dominates commercial attempts on the Internet to reach a mass audience and, sad to say, the most consistently profitable sites deliver pornography. Meanwhile, the treasures in our libraries, schools and museums are locked away for want of money to make them digitally available to the full American audience. 
 In the 18th century, the Northwest Ordinance set aside public land for primary schools. In the 19th century, Congress granted land to establish public universities. In the 20th century, the G.I. Bill profoundly expanded educational opportunities. We need a similar public investment to realize the potential of digital communication. Fortunately, there is a public financing source available.
Today, among our most valuable and yet little known public assets are the frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum over which television and radio are broadcast and communication signals are sent. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the auctions of these public assets will raise $28 billion over the next 10 years. We propose using $18 billion from this windfall to make a digital gift to the nation: a public trust administered on the model of the National Science Foundation.
It is easy to imagine some of what such a trust could make possible: Online literacy programs connecting adults with a virtual one-on-one "reading tutor." A digital model of the human body, from molecular structure to gross anatomy, for students and doctors. Universal access to nearly all important historical manuscripts, photographs, art and recordings now held in museums, libraries and archives. But there is potential for much more that we cannot yet imagine. It is the nature of technology to flourish when people with ideas are given time and support to develop them.
Our idea for a Digital Opportunity Investment Trust already has backing from many educators, library and science officials, as well as executives of companies like Microsoft and Novell. Public, educational uses of the Internet and other digital communications technologies will not change their commercial vitality, but will make the online realm even more crucial in American life. We have the financial resources as a nation to make a sizable investment now, and Congress should act to make it happen.

BYLINE:  By Guy Trebay 

 BODY:
Provenance: Gianni Versace
 Anyone seeking a posthumous glimpse into Gianni Versace's psyche had a fine vantage in the sale rooms of Sotheby's last week. As the head of a multimillion-dollar fashion empire, a designer whose clothes helped frame the tastes of a decade and an adman with few equals, Gianni Versace was often depicted as protean. Certainly his appetites and budget were outsized. But behind the energetic self-publicizing that inspired reporters to compare him to everyone from Jay Gatsby to Julius Caesar was a man who prized comfort and coveted art treasures of the sentimental academic kind. 
 The three-day sale consisted primarily of objects from Casa Casuarina, Versace's villa in Miami. Resurrected from the shell of a rundown South Beach apartment house originally built for a Standard Oil heir in 1930, Casa Casuarina was just one of several Versace residences; he had others on Lake Como in Italy, and in New York and Milan. But Miami was where the designer gave riotous sway to his tastes, most particularly to emblems of the classical. 
It was all there at Sotheby's last Thursday through Saturday -- the sphinxes, the gorgons, the sibyls, the putti, the lions, the obelisks, the static life studies and the fake Attic urns. "There are old things and new things," Matthew Weigman, a Sotheby's spokesman, said before the sale. "If he couldn't find something he wanted, he had it made." That the imitations were crammed alongside the antiquities barely seemed to register with potential bidders. Anyway, said Gary Indiana, the author of "Three Month Fever," a book about Andrew Cunanan, who shot Mr. Versace on the steps of Casa Casuarina in 1997, "Nothing's imitation with Versace; it's all real Las Vegas." 
Not until 1999, when the family parted with 25 Picassos Mr. Versace owned did a deaccessioning campaign begin. Casa Casuarina was sold last year to a telecommunications executive, Peter Loftin, for $19 million, and Versace's heirs have begun to mine his Aladdin's hoard.
Arranged in suites that attempted to approximate the mood of Casa Casuarina, the accumulations of the designer's life were carted off by happy buyers, some of whom were interested in the resale value, many of whom came for a Versace souvenir. "The celebrity factor is unpredictable," Mr. Weigman said. He noted that the Duchess of Windsor's jewels fetched roughly seven times their catalog estimate in 1987, but that the celebrity markup on Greta Garbo's Impressionist paintings in 1990 was "zilch."
The Versace sale was estimated to bring $5 to $7 million and realized $10.8 million, not including buyers' commissions. Upholstered furniture by Mr. Versace was subject to the greatest inflation: hammer prices three times the high estimate. After three days of auctions, it is hard to believe there is more in store. "I don't know how he had time to collect it all," said Lou Colasuonno, a Versace family spokesman. "Apparently he needed very little sleep."

The House of Stella McCartney
Proving perhaps that there is luxury-brand potential even in a "My Little Pony" aesthetic, the Gucci Group made official yesterday its long-rumored decision to finance the designer Stella McCartney's introduction of a globally distributed brand. Ms. McCartney, who has been designing for the French label Chloe, where she took over from Karl Lagerfeld in 1997, said in a statement that she was "incredibly excited" about the venture. Ms. McCartney's assistant, Phoebe Philo, 27, will assume the role of creative director at Chloe.
Ms. McCartney, 29, the daughter of the ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and the late Linda McCartney, brings her Hollywood connections, fringed rocker dresses, horsy T-shirts and ethical aversion to the exploitation of animals to a firm whose product portfolio includes fusty old-line soaps (Roger & Gallet), high-end costume jewelry (Boucheron), flashy stilettos (Sergio Rossi), woven leather handbags (Bottega Veneta) and Yves Saint Laurent. 
She is the latest acquisition in the shopping spree that followed the $3 billion sale in 1999 of 40 percent of Gucci's stock to Pinault-Printemps- Redoute -- a transaction that saved Gucci from being swallowed whole by LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. 
"Stella's design talent, energy and star power will ensure her continued success," Tom Ford, Gucci's creative director, said in a statement yesterday.

HEADLINE: The City Finds Hiring Lifeguards Is as Easy as Swimming Upstream 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
You know spring has arrived when New York City officials begin fretting about lifeguard shortages at the city's 53 outdoor pools and 14 miles of beaches. 
 "I cannot say the tides are in our favor," said Henry J. Stern, the commissioner for the Department of Parks and Recreation, reflecting upon what has become a chronic problem here and in many parts of the country. "I don't know how a generation of young Americans can be taught to swim." 
 This spring, for the first time, the city is looking for answers across the East River in immigrant-rich neighborhoods of Queens. The push into Queens is part of a $70,000 promotional campaign to attract enough summer lifeguards -- about 200 of the city's 1,000 positions need to be filled, with 800 returning from previous years -- so the city can keep the beaches and pools open without interruption. 
If the plan works, students like Karma Kunsang, 18, of Astoria, who was born in Nepal, and Julio Molina, 16, of Flushing, who was born in Peru, could well play an important part. The two are among several dozen Queens residents who have responded to the city's appeal in recent weeks, many of whom come from newly tapped immigrant groups.
"He loves the sea, but I am afraid of it," said Aldi Molina, Julio's mother, who moved to Flushing from Costa Rica in 1996.
"We are very proud," she said of his lifeguard aspirations. "He is my only son and we are very happy about it."
A pool on 30th Road in Astoria has been set aside once a week for free conditioning and training for the prospective lifeguards. Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses and Parks Department vehicles have been plastered with "Lifeguards Wanted" signs.
Parks employees have staked out the N subway line during the after-school student rush and have approached teenagers everywhere from Frankie's Pizzeria in Astoria to St. John's Preparatory School in Long Island City. This week, lifeguard recruitment will begin during Mets games at Shea Stadium.
Even movie tickets at some theaters in the borough are being issued with an accompanying become-a-lifeguard leaflet.
"We are swimming harder than ever," Mr. Stern said.
There is no demographic evidence that Queens has a reservoir of aspiring lifeguards, and the first few weeks of the campaign have produced only mixed results. But with 2.2 million people in the borough and recruitment efforts in previous years in Connecticut and New Jersey coming up short, parks officials are betting there are at least a few good swimmers in Manhattan's often-overlooked backyard who need just a little nudge. 
Last year, the city made a special effort to find lifeguards in Rockaway, Queens, but parks officials said most candidates there grew up on the beach and were not interested in working at pools. This year, the department is looking more widely in the borough, with a particular focus on Astoria, where the Variety Boys and Girls Club of Queens has become the center of operations.
For three hours every Wednesday after school, the club's pool is set aside for lifeguard training and qualifying tests. Similar centers have been run for years in Manhattan, Brooklyn and, most recently, Staten Island, but Astoria has been added this year in the hope of enticing swimmers who might not want to travel so far.
"Astoria is a very diverse community and is just growing and growing," said Jason R. Stanevich, 24, a parks official and an Astoria resident, who oversees Operation Astoria, the department's name for the project. "It provides an entry into the immigrant community."
But even in Queens the Parks Department is learning the same lesson it learned in other boroughs in previous years: for most teenagers, swimming is not considered particularly cool, at least not swimming well enough to complete two lengths of the pool in 35 seconds. That is the minimum requirement to qualify for the free training and a guaranteed summer job at $9.32 an hour.
Much has been made of the work ethic of teenagers, many of whom have enough money to forgo summer jobs or who would rather spend their summer volunteering in a field more directly related to their career ambitions. But Commissioner Stern and some of the city's full-time lifeguards say the problem with recruiting lifeguards runs deeper than that.
The number of qualified swimmers, they say, is not growing.
"There are not enough programs for kids to reach the swimming level needed to become a lifeguard," said Felix Jemenez, 28, who has worked summers as a city lifeguard since he was 17. "There is a lot for little kids, but something is wrong when you get to the 12-to-16 age group. They are not being motivated to swim."
Officials say swimming lessons for children at the Parks Department, the Y.M.C.A. and elsewhere are as popular as ever, with waiting lists at many pools. But as the degree of difficulty and proficiency increases, enrollment in the courses drops off sharply. 
Nationally, according to the American Red Cross, one of the biggest providers of training for swimming instructors, 2.2 million people took Red Cross-approved swimming lessons last year. Of those, however, only 61,000 enrolled in Level 7, the top Red Cross course considered the entry point to lifeguard training.
The problem is especially evident in New York. The American Red Cross in Greater New York, which encompasses the city and the counties of Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Sullivan, reports a noticeable drop in recent years in the number of certificates issued to people who complete swimming courses at all levels.
The decline is believed to be responsible for a shortage of qualified aquatics instructors in many parts of the city. The shortage got so severe at the Y.M.C.A. in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, that the Red Cross was asked to create a special aquatics training class for employees there, according to Deanna Amoroso, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in New York.
"Once people get away from the pool and into other activities, it is hard to get them back to the pool," said Connie Harvey, a health and safety specialist for the Red Cross in Washington. "It is very clear that we still need to encourage people to go through the full spectrum of learn-to-swim courses and continue to stay in the pool."
At the Boys and Girls Club in Astoria, the problem was on display one recent Wednesday afternoon. Javier Rodriguez, 40, a lawyer who works part time for the city as a lifeguard borough coordinator, was testing a dozen or so aspiring lifeguards, most of them high school students.
Several applicants said they had experience on competitive swimming teams. But when Mr. Rodriguez announced over the loud slurps of water being sucked into the pool's filter that they would be required to swim 50 yards in 35 seconds, there was a general sense of alarm. One boy, standing at poolside in his bathing suit, left before getting wet.
One after another, most of the swimmers fell short of the requirement, by stopping for a rest on the wall, touching the bottom with their feet or swimming with their heads out of the water. Mr. Rodriguez scribbled "NQS" in big letters on the top of the applications: Not Qualified to Swim.
Karma Kunsang was among those who did not make it, but he said he would try again. Only Julio Molina and three others completed the task and were invited to begin the 40-hour training course.
"It is a beautiful job, but as you can see, we just can't get enough experienced swimmers," said Luis Virella, 32, a lifeguard assisting Mr. Rodriguez. "What the Parks Department may have to do is start a separate class for all of those who fail. We could teach them the technique. That way we wouldn't lose the people who are motivated enough to show up."
One who passed, Jacob Buck-Malarsky, 19, of Jamaica Estates, Queens, said that if the economy continued to sour, the shortage might ease anyway as more teenagers who swim well took a new look at the lifeguard jobs.
Mr. Buck-Malarsky, who swam on his high school swim team, said he needed to make money during the summer to help pay for college, because his father, an architect, has seen his business slow down.
"Being a lifeguard sure beats flipping burgers all summer," he said.

HEADLINE: Leftist Ex-President Makes Surprising Comeback in Peru 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 9 

 BODY:
It was only 11 years ago that Alan Garcia left the presidency as a political pariah, blamed for presiding over an inflation rate of more than 1,000 percent, rising terrorist violence, army massacres, food rationing, huge devaluations of the currency and uncontrolled government corruption.
 Today Mr. Garcia awoke as a major contender to become president again after a first round of balloting on Sunday. Even by the standards of Peru's incomprehensibly mercurial politics, Mr. Garcia's strong finish, apparently in second place, has astonished Peruvian political analysts. 
 If he enters the second round of voting as expected, Mr. Garcia will remain a long shot to overcome Alejandro Toledo, a former business professor who led the drive that ousted President Alberto K. Fujimori last year. 
But Mr. Garcia's seductive speaking style and Mr. Toledo's personal peccadilloes make the outcome unpredictable, according to pollsters.
With 73 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Toledo won 36.48 percent of the first-round vote, followed by Mr. Garcia, who won 26.11 percent, and Lourdes Flores, a former congresswoman, with 23.79 percent. 
Ms. Flores conceded defeat this afternoon, acknowledging that she will not be the candidate facing Mr. Toledo in the runoff election, expected in late May or June.
As the votes were counted, Mr. Garcia tried to pose as a far different politician from the one who shocked international bankers and investors in the mid-1980's by calling for Latin American leaders to band together and limit their foreign debt payments and then by trying to nationalize Peru's banking system.
Greeting the media dressed in a formal suit on Sunday night, Mr. Garcia promised to reach out to all sectors of society and not rely too heavily on his leftist party, known by the acronym APRA. Its members and supporters are called Apristas.
"This time I need a government with the best economists," he said. "I'm not interested in an extreme devaluation that would punish the people. I guarantee stable economic indexes."
Then Mr. Garcia found time to meet with former President Jimmy Carter, an election observer, as a sign that he wanted friendly relations with the United States.
Mr. Garcia fled Peru for Paris in 1992 rather than face corruption charges. His party was so discredited by his presidency that fans at sporting events customarily screamed "Aprista!" at referees after questionable calls. The party's presidential candidate won less than 2 percent of the vote last year.
Mr. Garcia may still face criminal complaints by prosecutors. And several Wall Street analysts predicted today that the Peruvian bond market would skid badly in the weeks ahead if a Garcia victory appeared imminent, a development that might help Mr. Toledo argue that stability will depend on his own election.
When Mr. Garcia, now 51, announced that he was returning to Peru two months ago to run, the announcement was treated as a curiosity in an election that appeared to be safely in Mr. Toledo's grasp.
Mr. Toledo won wide credit for leading the drive to overthrow Mr. Fujimori, who resigned and fled into exile himself last November. But while Mr. Toledo's rags-to-riches personal story resonated among Peru's Indian and mestizo masses, he has proved to be a candidate with serious weaknesses.
Two weeks ago the political magazine Caretas published a copy of a hospital report showing that Mr. Toledo tested positive for cocaine use in 1998 after being seen in a hotel with three women other than his wife. The magazine also reported that Mr. Toledo had offered the reporter a job if he did not publish the piece before the elections.
Mr. Toledo has not given clear responses, contending that the attacks were intended to block his election and were part of a campaign led by allies of Peru's fugitive former intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos.
The Caretas report followed a continuing controversy over a 13-year-girl who said she was the abandoned illegitimate daughter of Mr. Toledo, who has refused to take a DNA test to prove or disprove her claim.
The candidate who appeared to have the most to gain from Mr. Toldeo's problems was Ms. Flores, 41, a moderately conservative lawyer with a scandal-free past. But Mr. Toledo, 55, effectively attacked her for having a number of congressional candidates on her ticket with long ties to the Fujimori government.
The defining moment for the Flores campaign came two weeks ago, when her father made an off-the-cuff racist remark comparing Mr. Toledo to a llama or an alpaca. 
Ms. Flores, who is single and lived with her parents until her mother died last year, failed to distance herself firmly from her father's remark. And by continuing to travel with her father on the campaign trail, she appeared to be sending a signal that she was the candidate of Lima's white middle class and insensitive to those of Indian descent.
She dropped sharply in opinion polls, mostly to the benefit of Mr. Garcia, who came to appear to be an elder statesman in comparison with his two principal opponents.
But it will more difficult for Mr. Garcia to stay above the fray, and his political past is likely to become a major issue in the weeks ahead.
"Toledo and Garcia will start out as gentlemen," predicted Alfredo Torres, a leading political consultant. "But then Toledo is certain to point out that Garcia led a failed government, and Garcia will then counter that Toledo is personally corrupt."
Whatever the eventual result, Mr. Garcia's party appears to have won 29 seats in a 120-member Congress deeply divided by eight political parties, which will mean that he will have a strong hand in deciding future policies.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
NBC to Shut Most of Its NBCi Web Portal

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 

 BODY:
Ending its costly experimentation with Web portals, NBC said today that it would spend $85 million to buy all outstanding shares of its online spinoff, NBC Internet, and probably shut down most of those operations.
 NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric, became the latest example of a large entertainment company to push into the emerging space for Web portals, only to find that its name brand failed to lure Internet users away from the smaller companies who entered the space first. 
 Though millions of viewers proved willing to follow NBC from their TV screens to the computer screens, company executives said, most advertisers did not.
"What looked like a sector tailor-made to our interests and ready for growth turned out to be an economic disappointment for just about everybody in the portal sector today," said Marty Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive Media, a division of NBC. 
NBC, which owns 38.6 percent of NBC Internet, said it would pay public shareholders $2.19 for each of the roughly 39 million shares it did not already own. That price is a 46 percent premium over the stock's closing price on Friday of $1.50. In the initial public offering, in February 2000, the shares began trading at $81.38.
Shares of NBC Internet rose 43 percent after the announced acquisition today, gaining 64 cents, to close at $2.14. Shares in General Electric gained 83 cents, to close at $42.
Citing a decline in Internet advertising revenue, the News Corporation and the Walt Disney Company said this year that they intended to buy back their separately traded online affiliates.
NBC still has a strong Internet presence with MSNBC.com, a partnership with Microsoft, and CNBC.com, a complement to its financial-news television network. Neither were part of NBCi.
The company said it would certainly keep nbc.com, the entertainment portion of NBC Internet's network of Web sites, to promote its television programming. But NBC executives said they would probably sell many of NBC Internet's other assets and abandon any hopes of coaxing profits out of the Web portal business model.
Roger Maes, a spokesman for NBC Internet, said the company would lay off about half of its 370 employees within the next week and eventually close its New York offices and San Francisco headquarters. "We will clearly be downsizing NBCi," said William Lansing, the company's chief executive, "and, over the course of the coming weeks will be sorting out which of the assets will be integrated into NBC and which of the assets will be shut down or sold."
NBC Internet was formed in 1999 through the joining of CNET's snap.com, xoom.com, nbc.com and other sites; it united the many sites under the NBCi.com brand the next year. Last year it reported a net loss of $661.8 million, or $10.89 a share. Most of its $89.7 million in online advertising revenue came from dot-com companies, NBC said.
John Inch, an analyst who covers General Electric for Bear, Stearns, said General Electric was wise to pull the Web portal's operations back into the safety of a large company, without the pressure from shareholders whose investments had plunged.
"They took a shot at this, they had some great properties, the time was right for a short period of time, but the industry hasn't emerged," Mr. Inch said. 
In February, traffic to the NBC Internet network of Web sites ranked 14th in the United States, with 15.4 million unique visitors, according to Jupiter Media Metrix, a market research firm. But the Web sites trailed far behind the leaders who pushed into the Web portal business early, including AOL Time Warner, with 69 million visitors; Microsoft, with 60 million; and Yahoo, with 57 million.

HEADLINE: A Makeover for Mr. Familiar; 
In Race for Mayor, Mark Green Seeks a New Image

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Mark Green bounced up the steps of the last stop on the No. 7 train in Flushing the other day, grinning broadly at what awaited him on the sidewalk: television crews, news photographers, microphones, reporters and onlookers drawn by the bustle of the candidate with his escort of government and campaign aides. "It's like late October," Mr. Green exclaimed of the turnout as he headed up Main Street to tour one of New York's most heavily Asian-American neighborhoods.
 Mr. Green should not have been surprised. His campaign for mayor is his ninth candidacy in a primary or general election since he first ran for Congress 21 years ago. As the city's public advocate and its former consumer affairs commissioner, Mr. Green has been an energetic font of reports, investigations, snappy quotations and press conferences timed for slow Sundays. He is among the most familiar elected officials in New York today, except for the man he is trying to succeed, and he is certainly better known than his three major challengers in the Sept. 11 Democratic primary. 
 But the Mark Green who presents himself to voters this time is not exactly the same Mr. Green who has been such a provocative and colorful -- his critics would say abrasive -- figure in New York public life for so long, the proponent of the liberal wing of his party, the inexhaustible tormentor of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. In a noticeable and what advisers say is a deliberate way, Mr. Green, at the age of 56, is recasting himself in this, his first campaign for mayor. He is striving to come across as more mature and measured in his temperament, and a bit less liberal in his views.
The result, at least so far, has been a campaign notable for its restraint, as Mr. Green offers a safe if sometimes gauzy case for his candidacy to become New York's first Democratic mayor in eight years.
As he moves around New York, Mr. Green is as likely to be talking about his record of fighting A.T.M. fees, Passover price gouging and teenage smoking (he issued a "five-point plan" to fight the problem last week) as he is to be deploring police abuses, embracing campaign finance reform or advocating 20-student class limits for kindergarten through third grade. "We don't need better schools. We have to have the best urban schools in the country," Mr. Green declared the other day, in the kind of pronouncement that seemed unlikely to stir a quarrel with any of his opponents.
The man Mr. Giuliani has held up as the embodiment of New York liberalism and as an anti-police agitator -- an unfair characterization, Mr. Green said -- is calling for the abolition of parole, a point of view he said he came to two years ago. His first major speech was on managing crime and police conduct, and it included a pledge to reduce crime by half and to raise the salaries of police officers. On any given day, Mr. Green is far more likely to mention his endorsement from William J. Bratton, Mr. Giuliani's first police commissioner, than his decades-long association with Ralph Nader.
Mr. Green applauds the restrictions in the welfare system pushed through by President Bill Clinton, to the distress, he notes, of some of his own liberal supporters. (He said it was a position he had held since 1986.) And like his approach when he ran for Senate in the Democratic primary in 1998, Mr. Green responds to questions about his political philosophy with a complex and nuanced summation that seems to straddle the era of Mr. Giuliani and of his Democratic predecessor, David N. Dinkins.
"O.K., I'm a pro-child, future-oriented Democrat," Mr. Green said, sipping soup from a paper container while sitting in his makeshift campaign office near Grand Central Terminal. "I'm a very practical, common-sense, progressive Democrat who is pro-choice, anti-racial profiling, and who reduced the size and increased the performance of the two city agencies I've run. So I'm a balanced-budget progressive Democrat."
He continued: "I'm more interested in substance than stereotype, and rivals -- some rivals without much else to say -- may slip into labels from an earlier era. On choice and integration and consumer justice and environmental health, I'm an outspoken, progressive Democrat. But nobody has an example of me doing anything other than being pro-police, anti-crime, and for spending within our means."
Other candidates have been using these early months to test vivid messages for the campaign ahead. Fernando Ferrer deplores New York as an economically polarized city under Mr. Giuliani's rule, while Peter F. Vallone urges voters to inspect his record as City Council speaker to appreciate what he could do as mayor. Mr. Green, pointing to his years as public advocate and consumer affairs commissioner, simply offers himself to voters as an energetic fighter, who would produce a "safer, smarter city."
"I believe my record as an outspoken fighter for working people, consumers and families, with a record of getting things done, is exactly the credible record you need to show that you'll get things done as a mayor," Mr. Green told an audience of labor leaders a few weeks ago.
Mr. Green still criticizes Mr. Giuliani, but with nowhere near the fervor of Mr. Ferrer or even, it seems, with the fervor of Mr. Green himself as recently as last year, when he took the mayor to court over his decision to release the juvenile criminal records of Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed man who was shot by police in Manhattan. "He ain't running and he's history," Mr. Green said of Mr. Giuliani. "What counts is not merely that you have the courage to stand up to him when necessary, or that you had an intelligence to stand with him when it helped the city."
That line offered a hint of potential confrontation ahead: the criticism Mr. Green is ready to offer of Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller who is also running, asserting that he had been too supportive of Mr. Giuliani. 
Mr. Green also seems to be heeding advisers' suggestions to steer away from what his own supporters describe as the smartest-kid-in-the-class one-liners -- usually hinged on a pun or alliteration -- that have landed Mr. Green on the news, but which can make him look less than mayoral.
For now, Mr. Green's campaign is by design making few waves as he moves from deploring cigarette smoking by teenagers one day to criticizing drugstores that fail to post price lists the next. More than almost anything, the tone and the topics reflect the significance that Mr. Green and his aides have paid to early polls that show him with a solid lead over his opponents. While polls this early in a campaign are notoriously unreliable, they have heavily influenced the rock-no-boats campaign Mr. Green has waged.
Mr. Green said he paid only the slightest attention to polls. "In my office, we have a no-gloat, no-coast rule," he said. "So every time others publish good polls, we're determined to work twice as hard."
Gloating or not, it is clear that Mr. Green and his advisers have invested quite a bit of thought in these polls. A letter Mr. Green sent out to potential supporters earlier this year prominently noted "my current standing in the polls" in making the case for his candidacy, and included a memorandum from his pollster, the Mellman Group.
"Our just completed 'testing the waters' poll shows that Mark Green is in a strong position to win the 2001 Democratic primary for mayor of New York City," the memorandum said.
Mr. Green's advisers recite poll results, from borough to borough and ethnic group to ethnic group, right down to the decimal point, margins of error notwithstanding. Their manner suggests that they believe Mr. Green's contest against Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, Mr. Vallone, the City Council speaker, and Mr. Hevesi is his to lose.
When asked if he thought it was possible that the numbers were little more than a reflection of his exposure during all these campaigns and news conferences, Mr. Green spat a spoonful of hot soup back into its paper cup and stared across the desk in astonishment.
"Name recognition is not exactly like being convicted of bank robbery," he said. "Most people hope to get known for good deeds. Since I've never ridden on an elephant, or worn a funny hat, or broken into someone else's press conference -- purely for the purpose of getting attention -- I have to assume that the public knows me" because of issues with which he has associated himself. He noted in particular his history of pushing for ways to curb police misconduct.
In any event, Mr. Green said, he was not paying attention to what his rivals were doing. "This campaign to me is like golf," he said. "I'm taking dead aim at the hole, and my goal is to tell everybody who will listen how I've worked hard and successful for them and have a vision for a smarter city. And if someone else in my foursome, or someone ahead of me or behind me, shoots a 67, let them win. I'm going to shoot a 68."
Mark Green, a golfer? Well, actually, no. "I take my kids to a driving range," he said. Mr. Green does not play the game.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Many Voices for Beijing

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 9 

 BODY:
Zhang Yin, an elderly newsstand owner, recalled a song from the Korean War to explain his feelings about the current crisis with the United States: "When friends come, we have good wine to entertain them; but if jackals and wolves come, we'll use hunting rifles to shoot them," he sang, adding, "I have good feeling for the American people, but China should have shot the plane down!"
 The streets of Beijing are filled with Mr. Zhangs, which helps explain why the negotiations with the Chinese to free the 24 crew members of the grounded American spy plane are going so slowly. 
 Although China remains a Communist Party dictatorship, it is no longer headed by a charismatic figure like Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping, someone who has the authority to arbitrate disputes in the leadership or personally set the country's course. Now, its leaders must cater to a range of constituencies, from government ministries to citizens like Mr. Zhang. And, increasingly, public opinion matters. 
What is obviously smart for the pursuit of smooth relations with Washington is often not fit for domestic consumption in a country where some high officials are still ambivalent about China's dance with the West, and where anti-Americanism is now running high.
"Jiang Zemin has very diverse constituencies, and they all have to be brought on board, both in the bureaucracy and in the public," said Anthony Saich, a China specialist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. 
Unlike the American president -- who has broad leeway to act unilaterally in such cases -- President Jiang heads an unwieldy bureaucracy and must build a mandate anew on every important decision. 
"I don't think anyone in China -- including Jiang Zemin -- could have made a prompt decision that Bush asked for to let the crew go," a Chinese political scientist said. 
In this case, building a consensus would have been particularly delicate, he said, since it would involve the military, which remains strongly suspicious of American motives and was recently stung by the defection of a senior Chinese Army officer to the United States. 
The Chinese military is deeply conservative, and some officers probably would not mind undermining some of Mr. Jiang's goals -- like joining the World Trade Organization, which they worry will court social unrest and enhance Western influence. Sunday's Liberation Army Daily said China had the right to "investigate thoroughly" the commanders of the American aircraft. 
And right now Mr. Jiang is likely to care -- a lot -- about what the military thinks. Next year he is scheduled to step down as Communist Party chief, and the year after that his term as president ends. But he is likely to try to retain his position as chairman of the Central Military Commission, which oversees the People's Liberation Army and would allow him to retain a large measure of power. 
"A lot of P.L.A. commanders will be thinking, 'If we're not tough on this issue, when will we be?' " said a researcher at a government think tank. "A Chinese plane crashed, the pilot is missing, and the people expect the government to do something." 
Among ordinary Chinese, there has not been a raw emotional outpouring as there was during the period that led to stone-throwing protests after NATO planes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999. But most people were nonetheless angry about the American spying, grieved by the death of a pilot, and frustrated by President Bush's unwillingness to apologize. 
At the root of their complaints was a sense of wounded national pride -- that China has suffered at the hands of foreigners before and is not prepared to suffer again. In one opinion poll on the Chinese Internet -- always a hotbed of nationalist sentiment, 13,000 of 15,000 net surfers said the collision was the result of a "deliberate provocation." 
During the Maoist era, from the 1950's into the 70's, China's people -- then mostly isolated farmers -- yielded to Mao's disastrous social and economic policies, even though those led to millions of deaths. 
But today, the average Chinese is plugged in, quickly receiving and passing on information by phone if not on the Internet. Protests against government policy are frequent and widespread. And while voting is only possible in local elections, the increasingly loud voices of the people weigh heavily on national leaders. 
"China has changed, and politicians are far more accountable," Professor Saich said. "There is definitely public opinion now. It forms, and it becomes part of the political debate." 
Last week, for instance, the more xenophobic branches of the government were probably strengthened by the public anger over the air collision, he said. 
"I think the government got tougher with the United States as the week went on partly because of popular feedback that it wasn't being tough enough," said Jian Yi, a student. "People's first reaction was that the plane was brought down by the United States on our doorstep -- that's pretty hard for people to take."
Mr. Jian said the downing of the plane tapped unquenched anger over the Chinese Embassy bombing two years ago, which he said the United States, while insisting it was an accident, had never adequately explained. 
"I know that in the United States there is a feeling that the Chinese government is taking a hard line on the plane," he said, "but we as students sometimes feel that in the last few years China's been making too many concessions -- that the government's primary foreign policy goal has been good relations with the United States."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs; 
The Two Wangs

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
It is ironic, to say the least, that the crisis in U.S.-China relations, sparked by the bumping airplanes, coincided with the entry into the N.B.A. of the first Chinese basketball player. The 7-foot-1-inch center, Wang Zhizhi, the star of the Chinese Army basketball team, joined the Dallas Mavericks the same week that a Chinese Army pilot, Wang Wei, lost his life going one-on-one with a U.S. EP-3E surveillance plane off the coast of China. While Wang Wei's widow is furious with America, Wang Zhizhi couldn't be happier: "I feel very calm because finally I can play in the N.B.A.," he said.
 I asked David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, whether he saw any parallels between Wang's adjustment to the N.B.A. and the China-U.S. plane tussle. Mr. Stern mulled that over for a moment and said: "You know, in Chinese basketball there is no such thing as illegal defense. In the N.B.A., there are strict guidelines against illegal defenses. How's that?" 
 That's pretty good, actually. Because what these two cases have in common is China being asked to adjust to new rules and forms of competition, set from abroad. Just as Wang Zhizhi is adjusting to playing in the big leagues of basketball, China's leaders are adjusting to the big leagues of geopolitics. And neither is easy. (I realize that basketball is not geopolitics, although if it were it might solve a few problems. Mr. Stern cited a poll that showed that 25 percent of Chinese youth owned at least one N.B.A.-logo item of clothing, and N.B.A. games are now shown on 10 different Chinese networks. In fact, 300 million Chinese watched Wang Zhizhi's first game with the Mavericks, carried live on Chinese TV.)
China, the country, is going through two transitions at once. At one level it is joining the global trading system, to an unprecedented degree, by becoming a member of the World Trade Organization. The W.T.O. is the N.B.A. of the global economy, and joining the W.T.O. is all about one thing: opening your economy to trade and investment from abroad, but under hard rules set by outsiders, which ban the arbitrary decision-making, intimidation of investors and favoritism for Chinese companies that have been the hallmark of Communist bureaucrats. 
At the same time, China is going through the growing pains of becoming a great power. With each year the modernization of China's economy and military makes it a more important global actor. China wants to be acknowledged as such, and should be. But part of being a great power, at this moment in history, means taking responsibility for today's international system. And that means adjudicating disputes according to rules, not force. China is understandably aggrieved by the loss of its pilot. But demanding a U.S. apology before both sides have had a chance to properly gather all the facts is another way of saying the facts don't matter, that rules don't matter. All that matters is force.
"The world that we want to see evolve today is not a world of one, two or three contending powers, but rather a world governed by rules," argues Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign policy expert at Johns Hopkins. "That is already increasingly true in the world of economics, and what we hope is security affairs will eventually mirror that. The idea is not to end competition, which is enduring, but to regulate it. We want a world where countries apologize when they are wrong, but we don't want a world where countries are coerced to apologize when they are not wrong."
One of the great dramas of international affairs today, adds Mr. Mandelbaum, "is persuading the Chinese that they are better off following the rules than not." But that is still a work in progress. Because while China's growing economic and geopolitical stature push it to accept the rules of the game, its obsession with recovering Taiwan, and the regime's authoritarian character, push it toward acting with force. That's why China today seems as if it's half in the world system and half out. 
That's also why how this crisis ends matters. It matters for U.S.-China relations; it matters for how China is perceived in the world; and it matters for what it will tell us about the balance inside China between those who want to live by global rules and those who want to shirk them. When Wang Zhizhi joined the big leagues, he left his local rules behind. Can China's leaders do the same?

HEADLINE: California Official Spars With U.S. on Power Policy 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, April 9 

 BODY:
As California and other Western states gird for a summer of energy shortages and rising electricity costs, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said today that the Bush administration would do everything possible to ease the problem -- except give California what it wants most, price caps on wholesale fuel costs.
 For the two dozen state leaders and energy officials who gathered here for a meeting with the commission's chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., the message was a reaffirmation of the administration's belief that market forces should determine energy costs, which, in turn, would encourage conservation. In general, the eight Western states led by Republican governors support the administration policy against controls on wholesale energy prices. The three led by Democrats, California, Oregon and Washington, oppose it. 
 As the meeting's lone representative from California, Steve Larson asserted that the administration's position was helping erode the California economy, a worsening situation that could eventually harm the national economy. 
"Whether they're temporary or permanent, something has to be done," Mr. Larson, executive director of the California Energy Commission, told Mr. Hebert. "This can't be done by California alone. We need your help."
In response, Mr. Hebert challenged Mr. Larson, saying that the federal government stood ready to provide assistance, like shortening the review process for construction of energy projects, but that California was stuck on the idea of permanent price caps, as opposed to temporary ones. 
"This has been dissected again and again and again over price caps," Mr. Hebert said. "Every time we'd say remove them, someone would say extend them."
He looked directly at Mr. Larson and added, "If you say temporary caps will do, tell me the end date."
"I don't know that, Mr. Chairman," Mr. Larson said.
"Exactly this dialogue is why you'll never get temporary price caps," Mr. Hebert said.
"I'm not saying temporary is attractive," Mr. Larson said. "But price caps in some form would be immensely beneficial to California."
Conceding that the Bush administration was helpful in approving a new pipeline into Kern County near Bakersfield, Calif., in the lightning speed of three weeks, Mr. Larson said he was nonetheless disheartened to hear Mr. Hebert respond so unequivocally to California's need for wholesale price caps.
"He sounded like a hard-line purist," Mr. Larson said in an interview after Mr. Hebert's remarks. "We're pragmatists. We want the problem solved."
In a separate interview, Mr. Hebert said he knew of no simple or short-term solution that would ease the crunch in California or anywhere else until new plants and transmission lines were built and full market forces could take over.
Besides, he added, "price caps send the wrong signal."

HEADLINE: Prosperous Colombians Flee, Many to U.S., to Escape War 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, April 9 

 BODY:
Sergio Foschini's construction supplies store is gone now. He also liquidated three shops in other cities and shuttered his once profitable construction company on the Caribbean coast, leaving dozens of employees without work.
 With his wife and children, he then left Colombia, joining hundreds of thousands of his compatriots -- many of them college-educated, a growing number of them affluent like Mr. Foschini -- who have fled conflict and economic stagnation for the United States and beyond. 
 "We spent two years thinking about it, two years of losing money and not producing," Mr. Foschini, who has been in Miami since last June, said in a recent telephone interview. "And finally we decided on another adventure, another path. It's not what you want, though. You want to stay in your country." 
Frustrated with four years of recession and terrified by the crime and kidnappings that feed on and flourish in a grinding civil conflict, many of Colombia's most promising young professionals and business people have reluctantly abandoned this country in the hope of finding success and stability.
In all, nearly 1.1 million of Colombia's 40 million people have departed since 1996, the government says, a mass migration that rivals the exodus of Cubans after Fidel Castro's revolution in 1959. Many have wound up in the United States, which the Census Bureau estimates has a Colombian-American community of 435,000.
In the United States they have injected new life into a decades-old community in Queens and added muscle to an increasingly politically active enclave in Miami. Still others have made new homes in far-flung locales like Australia, Toronto and Madrid, while some have started businesses in Costa Rica.
The departure has meant more hopeful lives for innumerable families and a flow of remittances from abroad that are sure to help others who are struggling here in Colombia. But the size of the departure has started to raise concerns about the long-term effects here, both to Colombia's economy and to its battered psyche. Some entrepreneurs and investors are liquidating businesses and laying off workers, contributing to an economic morass that helps to feed the social unrest that led to armed conflict in the first place. 
According to conservative estimates by business organizations, the flight of capital -- in closed bank accounts, investments and other assets -- has reached $2 billion in two years, sizable in a country with a $90 billion gross domestic product.
Some academics and intellectuals here say the exodus has also deepened the class-based schism that is ingrained in Colombian society. Many who leave are urban middle- or upper-class Colombians who have the bank accounts and property that permit them to obtain travel visas. 
Poor Colombians, those most vulnerable in the country's largely rural conflict, have virtually no chance of leaving legally.
Perhaps most distressing, some Colombia experts and economists say, the migration is draining the best and brightest from the solid middle class, the kind of people the country sorely needs to rebuild.
"The departure of educated people from Colombia represents a significant brain drain," said Bruce Bagley, a leading Colombia expert at the University of Miami. "The talent pool, more and more, is being reduced. If they get rid of all the professionals and all of the entrepreneurs, then all you're left with is the political hacks. And that is not good for Colombia."
The conflict that has spawned the exodus is increasingly brutal, pitting leftist guerrilla groups against an ineffective military and an illegal right-wing paramilitary army responsible for most of the massacres.
Although most who flee the country are rarely touched directly by war, a growing number say rebels have taken aim at them for extortion or kidnapping. Colombia is the world's leader in kidnappings: last year 3,706 people were taken hostage, 66 percent of them by the two largest rebel groups.
Colombia has also been hard hit economically in recent years, reversing decades of economic stability and one of Latin America's longest-sustained growth rates. The economy contracted by 4.5 percent in 1999 and grew by 2.81 percent last year. The unemployment rate stands at 20 percent, Latin America's highest.
The overwhelming sentiment here is that those who can leave Colombia should.
Yet perhaps because there is also a sense that the exodus could make an already difficult situation worse, a nascent movement involving business people, academics, students and the media has begun to try to reverse the trend.
Jorge Giraldo, owner of Publik, a company specializing in electronic billboards, has begun a multimedia campaign called "Here I Stay," in which the country's attributes are lauded. At the University of the Andes in Bogota, art students have plastered streets with posters and handed out fliers that ask people, "Why haven't you left for Miami?" -- a question meant to spur debate.
And at RCN Radio and Television, a daily campaign asks Colombians, "Why are you proud to be Colombian?" Those who answer with poems, drawings and essays can win computers or scholarships.
"The campaign is looking to confront the large-scale skepticism that we have in this country and reduce the number of people who leave," said Constanza Escobar, manager of marketing for RCN. "We're trying to inject some positive feeling for the whole population."
Not everyone who follows the economy agrees that the exodus will have negative repercussions.
Alvaro Cadavid, director of an executive headhunting firm in Bogota, said many Colombians who left could not find work and so their departure served as an economic safety valve. "It's too bad people have left," he said, "but it's good, too, because they opened space for others."
Many economists and academics disagree.
"There's no question that this is a very worrisome trend," said Donald F. Terry, manager of the Multilateral Investment fund of the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. Colombia has enjoyed a strong entrepreneurial class and a force of well-educated workers, Mr. Terry said.
But if large numbers of those people leave, he said, "then one of Colombia's most positive aspects in terms of growth will be adversely affected." He said that if the trend continued over a decade, "then I think it is Pollyannish to think that this is in any way positive."
Many Colombians who have left or are planning to leave agree that the mass migration is detrimental.
"We're losing a youth that's prepared," said Augusto Lopez, 64, who left Colombia in 1999 and runs a venture capital firm in Miami. "They're coming from good universities in Colombia and also good ones in the United States, and then they haven't gone back."
But prospective immigrants in Bogota as well as recently arrived ones in Canada, New York and Miami said in interviews that the country's myriad problems left few options.
"You might try to say to yourself, 'Stick around, things will get better,' " said Miguel Pinedo, a Bogota resident and business manager who will soon leave for New York. "But in the next 10 years I don't see things getting better."
Jenny Romero, 24, a biologist, said her professional future had dried up because she could no longer carry out her work in the rebel-controlled countryside. She said half of the biology students who graduated from college with her had also left the country.
"You don't have a real motivation to stay, because it's quite difficult to get a job," said Ms. Romero, who is now working on a graduate degree in Canada. "And if you have a job it's hard to get into the countryside."
Most Colombians are leaving for well-established Colombian-American communities in the United States, with 256,831 people traveling on tourist visas last year, up from 136,584 in 1996.
Many later extend tourist visas for up to a year or switch to student visas, which can be used for longer periods. Wealthy entrepreneurs can apply for an investor visa, and highly skilled workers can obtain temporary or even permanent work permits.
A growing number are also applying for political asylum, with 1,165 Colombians, or 65 percent of applicants, winning approval in 2000. In 1993 only 17 Colombians received asylum. Others are joining an illegal population of Colombians that numbers an estimated 85,000.
Those who have embarked on new lives, even professionals with plenty of work experience, say it has not been easy. The spacious apartments, maids and country homes of Colombia become a distant memory.
Maria Robles, 34, and her husband, Oswaldo Ovalle, 35, architects who owned a construction company in Bogota, left for Miami after the rebels demanded money. Now, Mr. Robles works at a construction job.
"It's been traumatic to the point that sometimes we say, 'Let's go back,' " Ms. Robles said. "But the security issue is so important, and then we think about our children."

VIGNETTE EXPECTS TO REPORT LOSS

BYLINE:  NYT 

 BODY:
 The Vignette Corporation, which develops software used to build Web sites, said yesterday that it expected to report a first-quarter loss. Revenues for the quarter were better than had been predicted by market analysts, but the company said it anticipated a loss of 1 cent a share. "While our revenue is within the range of financial analyst estimates, it did not meet our own expectations," said Greg Peters, chief executive of Vignette. The companybased in Austin, Tex., said revenue for the quarter would be about $90 million. And Mr. Peters said the company should finish the quarter with about $420 million in cash. Changing the "economic climate" of the company and cutting costs, he said, improved the financial outlook. In January, Vignette cut its work force by 15 percent, laying off more than 300 of its 2,300 employees.

OKLAHOMA: GOVERNOR'S WIFE A CANDIDATE
The wheels of state Republican politics began turning over the weekend when Cathy Keating, wife of Gov. Frank Keating, announced that she would run for Congress, presumably for the seat held by Representative Steve Largent, at lower left. Mr. Largent is expected to run for governor next year, since state law prohibits Mr. Keating from a third term. The congressman plans to announce this summer whether he will give up his seat early. If he does, a special election could be called to replace him, and under law the governor would decide the date. But Mr. Keating has said he will leave the decision to the lieutenant governor.

MARYLAND: MORATORIUM ON EXECUTIONS
Lawmakers struggled to reach an agreement on a proposed halt to executions in the state, but the measure appeared doomed as the 2001 legislative session entered its final hours. State Senator Clarence M. Mitchell IV, a Baltimore Democrat who supports the proposed moratorium, sought to delay a Senate decision on the proposal, saying supporters lacked the votes to defeat a filibuster by opponents of the measure.

TEXAS: CHALLENGING ROBIN HOOD
Four affluent school districts filed suit in Austin against the state's so-called Robin Hood law, which requires richer districts to share property tax revenue with poorer districts. The suit, which is expected to be joined by at least 34 other districts, argues that the system is unconstitutional and creates the equivalent of a state property tax. Jim Yardley (NYT)

FLORIDA: PUNISHMENT FOR BAY OF PIGS TRIP
An association of veterans of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion expelled two of its members for traveling to Cuba last month for a conference on the ill-fated mission. An official of the Association of Bay of Pigs Veterans said the two, Mario Cabello and Jose Luis Hernandez, were accused of defying an association policy that forbids dealings with Cuba. Dana Canedy (NYT)

GEORGIA: LAW ON 'SOCIAL PROMOTIONS'
Gov. Roy Barnes signed into law a measure ending the practice of "social promotion" in schools. Under the law, students in the third, fifth and eighth grades must pass a statewide test before moving to the next grade. Those who fail will be able to retake the test before the next school year starts, but a second failure will require a principal's decision. The system will be phased in beginning with the 2003-4 school year. David Firestone (NYT)

MISSISSIPPI: POLL FINDS BACKING FOR CURRENT FLAG
A poll released on Sunday found that two-thirds of those questioned preferred the current state flag, which incorporates the Confederate battle emblem, to a proposed flag that does not. A statewide referendum on the issue will be held next Tuesday. The poll, conducted by Mississippi State University and commissioned by a group of news organizations, found that 66 percent preferred the 1894 flag and that 22 percent preferred the new flag. A majority of blacks wanted the new flag, but almost 30 percent did not. Kevin Sack (NYT)

WISCONSIN: MAKERS OF LEAD PAINT ARE SUED
Lawyers for the City of Milwaukee sued two companies that manufactured lead pigments and paint, seeking to recover costs of cleaning up houses with lead-paint contamination. The defendants are NL Industries, formerly the National Lead Company, which produced lead pigments, and Mautz Paint, which made lead paint. In a statement, the city's lawyers estimated that 4 of every 10 children in areas that had required cleanup suffered from lead poisoning. John W. Fountain (NYT)

WASHINGTON

TEAMSTERS BACK REFUGE DRILLING
President Bush's proposal to allow drilling for oil and gas in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has won the support of the Teamsters union. James P. Hoffa, the union's president, said drilling in the Alaska refuge would help stabilize the economy and create employment, including 25,000 Teamster jobs, at a time when the nation appears near recession. The proposal is one of the few offered by Mr. Bush that have been enthusiastically embraced by a union. Steven Greenhouse (NYT)

SUPPORT FOR NEW ALCOHOL STANDARD
The Century Council, which represents makers of distilled spirits, will announce its support today for a lower national standard for drunken driving. The group is the first in the alcoholic beverage industry to support the standard, set by Congress last year, which considers drivers drunk if their blood alcohol concentration reaches .08 percent; the old standard was .10 percent. President Bill Clinton signed a bill that required states to adopt the new standard or lose federal highway money, and the Century Council will work with Mothers Against Drunk Driving to persuade them to do so. (NYT)

CONTRACT CHALLENGE REJECTED
The General Accounting Office rejected a challenge to the Army's decision to award a $4 billion contract for 2,100 light armored vehicles that are at the center of the service's plan to field lighter, more agile fighting forces. United Defense, a subsidiary of the Carlyle Holding Corporation, filed the protest in December after the Army chose a consortium led by General Dynamics and General Motors. In its challenge, United Defense said its bid met the Army's criteria and cost less than half the winning bid. Steven Lee Myers (NYT)

TOWER DEVELOPER CHOSEN

BYLINE:  By Charles V. Bagli 

 BODY:
 The Giuliani administration has selected Edward J. Minskoff to develop a 34-story office tower on a New York City-owned site in TriBeCa. Mr. Minskoff said yesterday that he planned to build a 1-million-square-foot granite and glass building on an L-shaped lot bounded by West and Greenwich Streets, between Warren and Murray Streets. 
He said he would begin building the tower, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, in a year, with or without a major tenant. It would be the first new office building in Lower Manhattan in more than a decade. Robert M. Harding, the deputy mayor for economic development, said yesterday that the project "would make a significant contribution to meeting the growing demand for commercial space." The city's Economic Development Corporation did not disclose the sale price for the land. Charles V. Bagli

Who Gets What Slice of the President's First Federal Budget Pie

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

 BODY:
State Department
 International affairs funding would increase by 5.5 percent over the 2001 budget under the Bush administration's budget proposal, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he intended to build more embassies, refurbish old ones and hire more foreign service workers. 
 The $23.1 billion in international financing includes $731 million to fight the drug trade in South America. Much of the aid will be directed to Colombia, but neighboring countries will also receive considerable assistance to prevent the drug war from spreading into their territories. 
Of the total foreign affairs budget, the State Department would receive $7.5 billion, an increase of almost 14 percent over current funding.
The budget calls for the hiring of more than 600 State Department employees, including 186 security personnel to be stationed at embassies around the world. Funding is also set aside to design and construct seven new embassies or consulates. Brazil, China, Indonesia and South Africa are among the possible sites.
The administration is also requesting $151 million to beef up security around 28 vulnerable posts, a program that gained increased urgency after the terrorist bombing of two United States Embassies in East Africa in 1998.
The Agency for International Development, which administers foreign aid programs, would receive $7.7 billion, a decrease of $100 million from current funding. Assistance to Egypt and Israel, the two largest recipients of economic support, would decrease. Israel would receive $720 million under the proposed budget, compared with $840 million in the current budget. Egypt's share would drop to $655 million from $692 million.
Ecuador's economic aid would increase significantly, to $30 million under the proposed 2002 budget from $5 million this year. Officials said the money would go to secure Ecuador's northern border, which abuts Colombia, and to help the country with an ongoing economic crisis.
The Export-Import Bank will see its budget shrink from $909 million in the 2001 budget to $687 million.
The State Department budget sets aside $210 million to improve the department's antiquated computer systems. The goal is to provide all employees with Internet access in the next year. Another objective is to provide classified computer linkups at overseas posts.
Secretary Powell, who has vowed to increase morale among State Department employees, said the funding would help revamp and reinvigorate the department.
"The president's budget provides for a major investment in the people, the instruments and the infrastructure of America's foreign policy establishment," he said. MARC LACEY

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE BREAKDOWN; 
Who Gets What Slice of the President's First Federal Budget Pie

BYLINE:  By WARREN E. LEARY 

 BODY:
Research
 The Bush administration's proposed spending on science next year, with the exception of biomedical research, is generally characterized by either flat budgets or small increases that barely keep up with inflation. 
 NASA would get a modest increase but would have to cancel some programs.
Proposed budgets for most scientific agencies contain some new initiatives, but money for new programs generally comes from reducing existing programs and working within the confines of this year's levels. 
The National Science Foundation, which sponsors most of the nation's university research and science education programs, would get a 1.3 percent increase, raising its budget to about $4.5 billion. The agency's money for science and engineering research would increase only 0.5 percent, to $3.3 billion, but its education budget would increase 11 percent to $870 million.
Smaller scientific agencies also saw the same modest proposed increases. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the Department of Commerce, saw its research spending request increase from $312 million to $347 million, with increases going to materials science and physics programs. The U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of Interior agency that maps the nation and supports land and resource research, would have about a 6 percent budget reduction to $814 million.
NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, characterized the situation of research agencies today at a budget briefing, saying: "The president has told us that we must live within our means. Doing so will require some difficult decisions."
Under the proposal, NASA would receive a 1.5 percent increase to $14.5 billion, a level that requires canceling several programs, including one that would send a robot craft to Pluto, and stretching out others, like an orbiting infrared telescope. As another belt-tightening measure, Mr. Goldin said the new budget would no longer cover so-called earmarked programs mandated by Congress but not accompanied by extra money.
The budget allots $2.1 billion for the International Space Station, about the same as last year. But it requires NASA to curtail future spending on the project, including canceling planned sections of the station, to absorb an estimated $4 billion in cost overruns expected over the next five years.
Even with these financial constraints, the agency said it would begin about 50 new projects, including research on an aircraft that can change its shape in flight, much like a bird that stretches or contracts its wings and feathers to optimize its performance in the air. WARREN E. LEARY

Attack of The Killer Utilities

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
The weather last weekend was so bad here that the television weatherman apologized to tourists. The state's biggest utility declared bankruptcy. San Francisco's economy is tubing, and in Los Angeles the movie industry is slouching toward a strike.
 And then there is the California prune glut. "This is not going to turn around overnight," warned a prune industry spokeswoman recently. 
 Unlike the dot-com crisis, the energy crisis and the scriptwriter crisis, however, the prune crisis comes equipped with its own message of hope. The prune people have changed their product's name to dried plums. "When it's dried plums, people seem to listen more," said Peggy Castaldi of the California Dried Plum Board. The other day I heard a TV anchorman refer solemnly to "the fruit formerly known as prunes."
This is the kind of creativity California needs more of. Gov. Gray Davis (the politician formerly known as possible presidential material) went on TV the other day to explain his new energy plan, which sounded a whole lot like the old energy plan, and it was a disaster. They had barely turned off the studio lights before Pacific Gas & Electric declared bankruptcy.
Think how much better Mr. Davis would have done if he had dropped the talk about three-tiered pricing policies and simply announced he was changing electricity's name to potentially dangerous voltage. It would sound so much more pleasant when people are informed they won't be getting any.
As the whole world knows, the state deregulated its utilities back in the mid-90's -- at approximately the same time the dried-plum makers started planting too many trees. Since then wholesale energy prices have skyrocketed, while consumer prices stayed capped. The utilities lost a pile of money and the rest is all rolling blackouts and Chapter 11.
There are no heroes here. The day before the bankruptcy filing, P.G.&E. handed out more than $50 million in bonuses to its employees. In the few hours between his speech and the giant utility's announcement, Mr. Davis found time to attend a campaign fund-raiser in La Jolla.
State Senator Steve Peace of San Diego, one of the legislative experts on energy matters, canceled all his appointments and flew back to the State Capitol, declining comment. "He's not in a frame of mind to talk. He's just kind of in this funk," said his spokesman, Art Castanares.
Mr. Peace is widely regarded as the chief author of the bill that deregulated the state's utilities -- a distinction that has made him the first California state senator to achieve celebrity status without being married to Jane Fonda.
"People come up to him in restaurants," said Mr. Castanares, who acknowledged that when this happens, their intentions are generally hostile.
Personally, I cannot imagine feeling negative about Mr. Peace, who underwrote his political career by producing the movie "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes." But somebody has to take the fall.
Mr. Peace would prefer to blame Texas-based energy suppliers who have made a fortune on California's woes. "He says if we don't do something we might as well raise the Texas flag over the California Capitol," reported his spokesman.
The chances that anybody will come up with a short-term solution to California's problems are slim to none, so the question of whom to blame takes on a certain desperate tone, like a high-stakes game of Clue. (It was Gray Davis, with a revolver! George Bush, with a candlestick! Pete Wilson, with a rope!) One particularly popular nominee is Ralph Nader, who backed a state referendum that theoretically could have discouraged investment in new power plant construction. It was defeated, but blaming Ralph Nader is so appealing that nobody wants to drop the option.
Californians are definitely feeling cranky, and short on team spirit. The state is attempting to encourage conservation by weaning residents away from their second refrigerators, but the major appliances are not going quietly. "I absolutely need it," a 78-year-old widower who lives alone told The Los Angeles Times.
On the bright side, soon a bankruptcy judge will enter the fray and there will be a new villain to blame when he starts giving out rate hikes to Pacific Gas & Potentially Dangerous Voltage.

TWO CUSHMANS, THEN ONE

BYLINE:  By Charles V. Bagli 

 BODY:
 Cushman & Wakefield, a New York-based international real estate services company, said yesterday that it would acquire Cushman Realty, based in Los Angeles, in an effort to expand its presence in California and Texas. The combined company would have revenues of about $900 million, with 965 real estate brokers in 174 offices. 
The companies did not disclose the sale price. The boards of both companies must approve the deal. Arthur J. Mirante II, chief executive of Cushman & Wakefield, said the pending deal underscored the need for consolidation among brokers as the economy cools. John C. Cushman III and his twin brother, Louis, founded Cushman Realty 23 years ago after leaving Cushman & Wakefield, which was founded by a grandfather, J. Clydesdale Cushman. Charles V. Bagli

HEADLINE: New York, Still Falling Behind 

BYLINE:  By Richard Lowry; Richard Lowry is the editor of National Review.

 BODY:
Rudolph Giuliani saved New York from the abyss. Shouldn't that be enough? Perhaps for Mr. Giuliani, who will be considered by many to be one of the great reform mayors of the 20th century, but not for the city.
 The recent burst of vitality in New York, fueled by immigration and a soaring stock market, shouldn't obscure a steady loss of economic ground to the rest of the country in the last 30 years. With the Wall Street boom ending, the last few years may soon look like a false dawn. 
 This is why it is crucial for the next mayor to carry Mr. Giuliani's nascent economic initiatives forward, even though it will mean confronting the city's stale political orthodoxy and entrenched status quo.
New York operates on a Depression-era economic model. Public works Keynesianism seemed like a brilliant idea 60 years ago, when the New Deal was new. But it put the city on a fiscal treadmill of ever-rising spending, taxes and debt. Even Mr. Giuliani, frugal by New York standards, will leave the city facing a potential $2.4 billion budget shortfall in the first full fiscal year after he leaves.
As economic liberalization has swept the globe, it is now understood almost everywhere that excessive taxation hampers economic growth. Except, apparently, in the financial capital of the world.
Set aside the city's smaller taxes -- the hotel occupancy tax, the three different auto taxes, the six excise taxes. That still leaves the "major" taxes: the property tax, the commercial rent tax, the mortgage recording tax, the real property transfer tax, the personal income tax, the general corporation tax, the banking corporation tax, the unincorporated business tax, the sales tax and the utility tax.
Most cities have only a few major taxes, financing their operations with, say, a property tax and a sales tax. New York has them all. And, in comparison to other major cities, its taxes enjoy the Lake Wobegon effect -- they're all above average.
First, New York has something most other cities don't: its own income tax. But its shoppers also pay an astronomical sales tax. And even New York's property tax, while much lower for single-family residences than that in some of its surrounding suburbs, is higher overall than the average for the country's 10 largest cities.
This tax regime gives every other area in the country -- especially the South and the Sun Belt, where taxes are generally much lower -- an invaluable edge over New York.
Mr. Giuliani has tried to pare back taxes around the edges. In 1994 he cut the hotel occupancy tax, which had noticeably depressed the city's convention business. He has scaled back the commercial rent tax, which gives businesses a direct incentive to locate elsewhere. But just tapping on the brakes isn't enough. The personal income tax rate, for instance, is still higher than it was when Ed Koch left office at the end of 1989.
Cutting taxes is impossible, of course, so long as the spending side of the city's ledger is so high. In his first term, Mr. Giuliani kept the budget under control. But discipline slipped in his second term: spending has increased at roughly three times the rate of inflation.
Meanwhile, debt service costs have risen from $2.8 billion annually to just under $4 billion since Mr. Giuliani took office in 1994. The city projects major new capital commitments over the next decade that will further increase the debt.
There is steady upward pressure on New York's budget from the most powerful interest group in the city: the public-employee unions. Their clout in city elections gives them too much control over the leaders of the city government that sits across from them at the bargaining table. The result, typically, is fat contracts that keep the city payroll large, taxes high -- and, not coincidentally, public-sector unions powerful.
Mr. Giuliani tried to break this expensive and enervating cycle, to no avail. The hospital workers' union made it impossible to reform the city's bloated health care system. The teachers' union resisted efforts to shake up the schools. These agents of the status quo have the city's politics and finances in a headlock.
If Mr. Giuliani saved New York from a 30-year crime wave and the stagnation of the Dinkins years, the next mayor needs to take a further step forward: creating the conditions for effective competition with other cities. There is no reason New York's entrepreneurs can't be as free and as vibrant as those in some faraway Southwest suburb -- unless New Yorkers are ready to concede that the future, despite Gotham's recent nice run, really belongs to someplace else.

HEADLINE: Bush Encourages Resolution Of Conflict in Oil-Rich Region 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
President Bush urged the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia today to keep up momentum toward a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
 Mr. Bush held separate meetings with the Armenian president, Robert Kocharian, and President Haydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan at the White House in the wake of their peace talks last week in Florida, which ended on an upbeat note with both sides reporting excellent progress. 
 The two former Soviet republics have been split for 13 years over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, dominated by ethnic Armenians who tried to secede from Azerbaijan in 1988.
About 35,000 people have died in the conflict, which also drove some 800,000 Azeris from their homes before a formal cease-fire in 1994. Despite the truce, about 200 people are killed each year by land mines and snipers, destabilizing Azerbaijan.
Some interests in the United States are eager to see an end to the conflict, in the hope that stability will help Azerbaijan become a major oil supplier for Western markets.
"The president encouraged both leaders to keep at the process, to work to overcome the differences," said a senior administration official.
"And all the parties to the discussion agreed that peace will bring considerable benefits to the region, to the peoples of both countries and to the entire South Caucasus region and beyond," the official said.
Mr. Bush invited the two leaders in for meetings as a sign of respect for the work they did last week in Key West, Fla., in talks held under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, with the aid of American, French and Russian mediators.
Mr. Aliyev told reporters after the meeting, "We are hopeful the United States of America and other co-chairs will intensify their efforts in order to achieve peaceful resolution to this conflict."
Two senior American officials who briefed reporters declined to provide details on the differences remaining between the two sides and how close they were to an agreement.
Items on the table in the Key West talks included the presence of Armenian forces in the disputed region, trade blockades that have crippled the local economy, the resettlement of refugees left homeless by the war, and how much autonomy the Nagorno-Karabakh region should have.
Mr. Aliyev would also make no predictions, and Mr. Kocharian left without talking to reporters. "I haven't had a chance to measure how close we are now," Mr. Aliyev said.
Meetings in January and earlier this month in Paris failed to make headway. The pair are to meet again in Switzerland in June.
One senior American official praised the roles of Russia and France in the peace effort, and cited Russia's involvement as an example of the genuine cooperation the United States can make with Russia at a time of some frictions with Moscow over American plans for a missile defense system.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE BREAKDOWN; 
Who Gets What Slice of the President's First Federal Budget Pie

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Military
 The $310.5 billion that President Bush proposed for the Department of Defense today amounted to little more than what Pentagon officials said was a rough draft of a final defense budget to be unveiled next month. 
 Mr. Bush included a promised $1.39 billion increase in military pay and benefits and $2.6 billion for new research and development, but the proposal provided few other details of how he intended to reshape the nation's military. 
The president's proposal was so scant on details, in fact, that budget officials from the four armed services did not even bother to stage their traditional budget briefings to outline the effect on weapons production and other programs.
At the Pentagon, officials said Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld would unveil a detailed budget once he completed reviews of the nation's military strategy and structure.
That is now expected around mid-May, which is still enough time for the Congressional debate over appropriations bills and, Pentagon officials believe, for a significant increase in military spending.
The $310.5 billion budget outlined today largely reflected the last spending projection made by President Bill Clinton, whom Mr. Bush repeatedly criticized during the 2000 campaign as eroding the nation's armed services.
While many other federal agencies faced spending cuts, the proposal for the Department of Defense represented a 4.8 percent increase over its $296 billion budget this year. The increases largely reflected inflation and the pay and research proposals already detailed by Mr. Bush. 
The proposal included only one area of significant cuts: spending for the purchase of weapons, which Mr. Bush proposed dropping to $59 billion from $62 billion. Pentagon officials, eager to expand weapons purchases, said the cut should be disregarded and predicted that Mr. Rumsfeld's review would result in a large increase for new weapons.
The overall defense budget also included $14 billion in spending on nuclear weapons by the Department of Energy and another $1.4 billion in other areas of the government, for a total of $325 billion.
The Department of Energy's weapons budget would remain essentially flat, but Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said he planned to re-establish the capacity to produce plutonium pits, a crucial component in nuclear weapons. STEVEN LEE MYERS

HEADLINE: Back in Business; 
Supply-Side Economists Regain Influence Under Bush

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Stephen J. Entin has just about every credential that a true supply-side economist could want. He holds a graduate degree from the University of Chicago. He worked in the Reagan Administration's Treasury Department. He runs a Washington research center, and its Web site contains photographs of him with Jack Kemp and Steve Forbes, the two political figures who have probably done the most to keep the tax-cutting flame alive.
 During the 1990's, Mr. Entin said, he never set foot inside the White House or the Old Executive Office Building, where much of the work of the president's staff is done. In the first two months of the Bush administration, he has visited three times. 
 On the face of things, supply-side economists -- a fairly small group who argue that lower tax rates are the key incentive to promoting economic growth -- appear to have returned to their influential role of the early 1980's. After a decade of relative anonymity, working for trade groups or researching issues that had little chance to become policy, they again have a seat at the table of power as a new president has made a big tax cut the central focus of his first year. 
But ask them what they think of the White House proposal, and their responses are surprisingly tepid. "It could have been a lot worse," Mr. Entin said. Alan Reynolds, the director of economic research at the Hudson Institute here, added, "It's a hodgepodge, a mixture of good and O.K." And Kevin Hassett, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute here, said: "The sun is shining again. It's certainly not heaven, but it's nice to see."
These mixed feelings highlight the unusual role that supply-siders are playing in the current political debate. Even as they attend top-level meetings -- and even though they express confidence that the White House will try to do much of what they want before President Bush's first term ends -- they find themselves frustrated on two main issues. 
Unlike two decades ago, when President Ronald Reagan cited the work of Arthur Laffer to argue that tax cuts could actually increase government revenues, currently the supply-sider position does not comprise the core of the administration's publicly stated rationale for a tax cut. Instead, President Bush has more often described his plan as a stimulus, using the language of the supply-siders' longtime intellectual rivals, Keynesians, who believe the government can best jump-start a slowing economy by spending more, either through tax relief or new programs.
In addition, the president's proposal, even before the Senate moved to scale it back, did not include some of the supply-siders' other favorite ideas, like cutting the tax on capital gains or reducing corporate taxes.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's top economic adviser, who made a name for himself in the 1980's with a Harvard economics dissertation that defended the 1981 tax reduction, has told conservative groups that such moves are not a high priority now. 
Still, most supply-side economists say they remain optimistic that their differences with the White House relate more to political strategy than to economic philosophy. With the economy in a slump, a senior White House adviser said, the administration simply believes that the Keynesian rationale for a tax cut has the best chance of winning public support. If Mr. Bush can overcome the opposition of Democratic leaders in Congress, supply-siders expect he will turn to other items on their wish list in the second half of his term. 
"The president understands tax reduction in the way Reagan did," said Lawrence A. Hunter, the chief economist at Empower America, a group here run by Mr. Kemp, the former representative who was a driving force behind the last large tax cut, the one in 1981. "That said, the president is a good politician."
The White House has given the economists good reason for their confidence. Mr. Lindsey, in his standard speech these days, says: "Let's face it. The federal tax code is a mess, and it is going to need substantive reform. But we picked a number of particular reforms that we think need doing right away."
Such comments also fuel the criticism of more liberal economists who say that Mr. Bush's tax cuts are largely a boon to wealthy Americans, rather than the economy as a whole, and that the government cannot afford the plan he submitted to Congress this year. The White House says its plan will cost $1.6 trillion from 2002 to 2011. Opponents say the actual figure will exceed $2 trillion because of higher borrowing costs, a recently revised estimate of the revenue loss from eliminating the estate tax and various plans to make the cut effective in 2001. 
The House has passed an early version of Mr. Bush's plan, but the Senate voted last week to limit the tax cut to about $1.2 trillion. 
At its heart, supply-side economics -- also often known as neo-classical economics -- holds that decisions made by individuals and businesses should not be distorted by regulations and taxes. Left to their own devices, consumers and managers will collectively make decisions that will cause the economy to soar.
The most fervent advocates go further, contending that overall tax receipts should rise even as rates fall. The Laffer curve -- generally shown as a sideways "U" with tax rates on one axis and government revenues on the other -- depicts this outcome, but after the huge budget deficits of the 1980's many economists discount it as a gross exaggeration. 
"When you say supply side, you think of people who say tax cuts pay for themselves, and I don't think any serious economists believe that," the adviser to President Bush said.
Supply-siders credit Herb Stein, the late economic adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, with inventing the term in 1976, even though he used it in a speech that criticized the notion that the federal budget affected mainly production, or the supply side of the economy, and not demand. Still, the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and conservative economists like Robert Mundell, Norman B. Ture and Jude Wanniski quickly embraced the term.
Republican politicians, chiefly Mr. Reagan and Mr. Kemp, soon made tax cuts the crux of their economic proposals. In 1981, Mr. Reagan signed the Economic Recovery and Tax Act, lowering tax rates and cutting the top income tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent.
The decade that followed -- a generally strong one for economic growth, but also one with rapidly rising budget deficits -- was not the panacea that supply-siders had predicted. Even so, their ideas picked up some support among economists.
"The debate is now about the magnitude of the effect on behavior and its role in policy, rather than about whether tax cuts affect behavior," said Joel Slemrod, a University of Michigan tax expert who says supply-siders overstate the benefits of tax cuts.
But the shift has been subtle, and supply-siders were hardly among Washington's power brokers during the last dozen years. In 1990, President George Bush and a Democratic-controlled Congress raised taxes, pushing up the top rate to 31 percent after it had been cut to a low of 28 percent in 1986. In addition, while the Reagan administration included many hard-core supply-siders, the elder Bush's administration was not particularly open to hearing the supply-side argument.
"That was frustrating to a lot of people," Mr. Hunter said.
Then Bill Clinton took office and pushed through a tax increase in 1993, saying it would help narrow the budget deficit.
At the time, supply-siders argued on television and in newspaper articles that higher tax rates would cause investment to dry up and the economy to stagnate. Instead, American businesses spent trillions of dollars on new equipment, unemployment fell to levels not seen since the 1960's and the economy enjoyed its longest expansion ever.
"It's hard to find any prediction that was more wrong," said Benjamin Friedman, an economist at Harvard University.
Out of step with the Clinton administration, the supply-siders quickly lost status in Washington. Mr. Hunter, for example, was fired from his job as the chief economist at the Chamber of Commerce, a business lobbying group. "I got thrown out," he said. The chamber "wanted a seat at the table."
Mr. Hunter made his way to Capitol Hill after the Republicans had taken over in 1995. Other supply-siders worked at research centers and wrote papers about retirement accounts, the Social Security earnings test and other details.
"We didn't disappear," said Gary Robbins, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Policy Innovation. "We kept sharpening our nails on the scratching post. We just weren't being heard."
Now they are, although few of them actually hold posts in the administration. Mr. Bush's top economic officials -- including Mr. Lindsey; the Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill; and R. Glenn Hubbard, named to be the next chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers -- like to think of themselves as pragmatic conservatives, rather than true believers of supply-side theory.
Mr. O'Neill, the former chief executive of Alcoa, even committed something close to supply-side heresy when he said in January that corporate managers did not make decisions about how much money to spend on research and development based on the taxes they face. And Mr. Lindsey, in a meeting with supply-side economists earlier this year, said the country was suffering because businesses had recently invested too much money in new equipment and technology.
"That surprised a lot of people," said Mr. Hunter, who attended the meeting. 
But White House officials say they do want eventually to overhaul the tax code. First they want to pass a tax cut, Mr. Lindsey said. Then a consensus might emerge about further changes, much as Congress followed its 1981 tax cut with a 1986 bill to lower many rates and eliminate some loopholes, Mr. Lindsey said. 
Mr. Lindsey said neither he nor President Bush liked to identify themselves strictly as members of one school of economic thought. Supply-side economics is one of three main streams of economic thought, Mr. Lindsey added. 
Keynesian theory helps governments manage the short-term business cycle, he said. Monetarism describes the proper role for the Federal Reserve in setting policy. And supply-side theory allows policy makers to think about how to enhance long-term growth.
Because the president was a business executive for many years, Mr. Lindsey said, "I think he is most comfortable with the third."

HEADLINE: The Tailors Behind the Tailors Behind the Man 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
There were five of them -- two-button suits, some in navy, some in gray, all made from a wool bearing the sort of name that could be applied to a defense weapon, Super 120. The suits were part of George W. Bush's inauguration wardrobe, an assemblage that also included a black cashmere overcoat and a single-breasted tuxedo.
 At the time of the inauguration, credit for Mr. Bush's clothes went to Gassane Tailors, a maker of custom suits in Austin, Tex., which also outfitted Lyndon Johnson and has dressed Mr. Bush for the last six years. But a recent visit to Giliberto Designs in Manhattan's garment district revealed that the president's clothes were made far from the center of Stetsons, in a sewing room on West 36th Street that might have provided a location for a De Sica film. On a rack at Giliberto hung a tagboard pattern approximating the president's frame, with the words "George W. Bush, January 2001" inscribed on it. 
 What Ghassan Karim, a co-owner of Gassane Tailors, did for Mr. Bush was to visit him at the governor's mansion in Austin and take his measurements, Mr. Karim said. Those measurements were then quietly sent to Rosario Giliberto Sr., a 63-year-old Sicilian-born tailor and an owner of Giliberto Designs, who, with the help of assistants, made the preliminary patterns, cut the garments and sewed them together. Mr. Karim merely tweaked the pattern ("I said, 'You do this, you do that' ") and administered the final touches, he explained.
It is a fairly well-kept secret in the world of men's wear that those who call themselves custom suit makers (or makers of slightly less personalized made-to-measure ones) often do not take hand to scissor, needle and thread. Although Mr. Karim does sew some suits himself in Texas, he often sends others to Giliberto in New York. 
Similarly, a visit to Mohan's Custom Tailors on East 42nd Street will result in a suit made not in a back room, but in Hong Kong, Mohan's owner, Mike Ramchandani, acknowledged. At Paul Stuart, made-to-measure suits are made off premises, a publicist for the store confirmed, though she would not divulge where. And James Jurney, an owner of the hip custom suit maker Seize sur Vingt in NoLIta, will design a suit's outline -- three-button versus four-button, narrow lapel or wide -- and take his client's measurements "with these medieval-looking devices," he said. But in the next step, he sends the measurements, along with fabric, to Rocco Ciccarelli Custom Tailoring in Long Island City, Queens. That is where patterns are made and suits are sewn together. Mr. Jurney has an in-house tailor attend to the final nipping and tucking.
The customer who comes in assuming that the guy with the tape measure around his neck is the one making the trousers in the basement is arguably not being told the whole story. But Suzanne Kilgore, the executive director of the Custom Tailors Association of America, a 300-member group, counters that it doesn't matter. "The customer isn't getting duped, because he is still getting a custom suit," she said.
"Rocco makes the pattern," she added, referring to Rocco Ciccarelli, "and it hangs on the famous hook."
Mr. Ciccarelli's hooks do have a certain mystique in the winnowing sphere of custom men's wear. A third-generation tailor who immigrated from Rome in 1955, Mr. Ciccarelli shares with Mr. Giliberto the status of premier tailor-behind-the-tailor. Trained at the legendary Italian house of Caraceni, Mr. Ciccarelli now derives most of his business from other tailors, about 30 of them around the country, he said. His 13,500-square-foot workroom is replete with 40 stitchers toiling at old Singers, many of whom appear to have their 50's and 60's behind them.
Mr. Ciccarelli, like the Giliberto Designs outfit, has private clients who come to him directly. Clients who bypass the front men pay about 30 percent less for the custom suits that generally cost between $1,800 and $8,000 from a neighborhood tailor, who farms out the work.
While there still exists a small community of custom tailors in New York who actually fashion suits with their own hands -- typically at the rate of one a week -- many others turn to Mr. Giliberto and Mr. Ciccarelli because their operations have something of a monopoly on the skilled labor needed to make high-end men's wear. "There are so few gifted cutters left," Jack Simpson, the creative director of Dormeuil, a custom tailor and fabric purveyor on the Upper East Side, who has occasionally used Mr. Ciccarelli's services, said. "It's getting tougher and tougher to find hands. The generation that should be coming up, isn't."
There's a joke in the trade regarding the diminished labor force. "I'll call the union, and I'll say we're looking to hire," Mr. Giliberto's partner and son Anthony Giliberto said. "They say to me, 'Oh, yeah? Call Cavalry Cemetery.' "
Having made suits in New York for 47 years, Mr. Giliberto Sr. observed that between 40th Street and 32nd Street there once were 18 custom tailoring operations like his. Old age and escalating New York rents resulted in many closed businesses. "Now, there's hardly anyone," he said. "There are no tailors left in New York."
In fact, there are 7,485, according to United States Census Bureau figures from 1990, the most recent statistics available. The number dropped from 9,700 in 1980. Many, however, specialize in alterations. 
"After the Second World War, many of the most skilled hands came from Italy, where tailoring was an honored profession," Mr. Simpson of Dormeuil said. The number of Italian-born tailors in New York declined even more precipitously between 1980 and 1990 than that of all tailors -- a reduction of more than 50 percent.
While the Gilibertos and Mr. Ciccarelli, all of whom wear ties to work every day, still have aging, primarily Italian tailors and seamstresses in their employ, they must now look to new immigrant populations when hiring. The younger Mr. Giliberto seeks talent by putting ads in Chinese and Pakistani newspapers distributed locally. Koreans and Dominicans, according to census figures, are also adding to the pool.
However anachronistic the world of custom tailoring might seem in the age of Dockers and Prada suits, there are no signs that its life span will be foreshortened. "People talk about the bad economy," Rosario Giliberto said. "Yes, I have a client who lost $11 million in the past few months, but he's got billions, does it really matter?" Last week, the tailor had in his hand a miniature work in progress, a custom blue suit for a 6-year-old.
Fortunately for people like Mr. Giliberto, the whole let's-have-a-meeting-in-our-swim-trunks culture is starting to erode. Sobriety is talking hold, and in certain circles that will always mean a $3,500 two-button.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Putting Faith In Discipline

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
The budget debate in Congress over the last two weeks revolved around one central dispute. Democrats argued that President Bush's proposed $1.6 trillion, 10-year tax cut could throw the budget back into deficit. Republicans countered that with $5.6 trillion in surpluses projected over the next decade, plenty of money would be available to reduce taxes and meet the government's needs.
 The budget the president released today showed that on paper, the numbers add up, as long as the politicians are as disciplined as he insists they should be about controlling spending. 
 But the budget reaches that point by assuming that spending on the vast majority of government programs will be less than what would be needed to keep up with inflation and population growth and by allocating no money or a very low amount for some costly measures that Mr. Bush himself endorsed either in his campaign or since he has been in the White House.
"What jumps out and hits you between the eyes is all the unaccounted-for costs," said Stephen Moore, a budget specialist at the Cato Institute who is also president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee.
Stanley E. Collender, managing director of budget consulting at Fleishman-Hillard, the public relations and consulting firm, agreed with that analysis, saying, "The budget works mathematically. Whether it's realistic is another matter."
In his presidential campaign, Mr. Bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative. On the scale weighing compassion against conservatism, the first Bush budget is definitely conservative, given the emphasis on a large tax cut that would mostly benefit the well-to-do. It could also be called compassionate in that spending on basic government services would not be eliminated, no departments would be abolished and no big programs would be wiped off the books.
Unlike Ronald Reagan's first budget in 1981 or the one proposed by Speaker Newt Gingrich and his followers after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1995, this is not a revolutionary budget.
"It says more about the future than the present," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office when Democrats controlled Congress and now the president of the Urban Institute. 
"He is talking about constraining future choices by promising that a large portion of the projected surpluses will be devoted to tax cuts," Mr. Reischauer said.
Beyond the president's pet causes like education and medical research, the budget allows no room for growth in the day-by-day government programs that are dear to the hearts of many lawmakers, and it actually calls for cuts in some areas like support for farmers.
The votes in the Senate last week left doubt as to whether the president could sustain this approach. In addition to reducing the proposed 10-year tax cut to $1.2 trillion from $1.6 trillion, the Senate voted to increase spending above the president's levels in education, agriculture, health insurance, veterans' benefits, energy and the environment.
The president would increase government spending in such areas in the fiscal year 2002 by 4 percent over 2001. The Senate would more or less double that.
"Boys will be boys," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the president's budget director, dismissing today what the Senate did last week as "free votes."
But Mr. Moore, who concentrates nowadays on raising money for Republicans in Congress, said the president might have to rethink some of these policies.
"These farm states are Republican states now," Mr. Moore said, alluding to the president's plan to trim agriculture programs.
Even more important in assessing the president's budget is the meager treatment the budget gives four big-ticket items that could cost the country a large sum of money over the next decade: private investment accounts under Social Security, prescription drug coverage under Medicare, a missile defense system and revision of the alternative minimum tax.
On Social Security, the budget seems to make $600 billion available over the next 10 years for changes in the Social Security system, presumably including Mr. Bush's campaign proposal to allow workers to use a portion of their Social Security taxes to establish personal investment accounts. Mr. Bush wants a commission to figure out how to do it.
The best estimates are that if people are allowed to use two percentage points of the 12.4 percent they and their employers pay in Social Security taxes to create private accounts, it would cost the government $1 trillion -- without making the Social Security trust fund any less solvent than it is now.
The budget sets aside $153 billion to give insurance for prescription drugs to the elderly and disabled people covered by Medicare. Lawmakers from both parties consider such insurance a political imperative, and most agree that the cost would be much higher than the president's figure. The latest calculation by the Congressional Budget Office is that this would cost at least $400 billion over the next 10 years.
Mr. Bush has suggested that savings could be found elsewhere by making big changes in the structure of Medicare, but he has given no clue how he might accomplish that.
The Defense Department is in the middle of a thorough review of its entire strategy and structure. When it is completed, the administration will almost certainly propose a missile defense shield much more elaborate than anything the Clinton administration contemplated. This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, and it is not reflected in the budget.
Finally, the White House and experts in Congress agree that if Mr. Bush's tax plan is enacted, an obscure part of the tax code called the alternative minimum tax will have to be revised. 
The purpose of this tax is to guarantee that rich people with large deductions cannot escape taxation. But if the Bush plan becomes law, the alternative minimum tax would apply to more than 35 million taxpayers, many of them far from wealthy, and would deny them the benefits of a tax cut. The expert tax staff in Congress estimates that it could cost nearly $300 billion over 10 years to fix the problem.
The budget sets aside about $800 billion over 10 years in what the president calls a contingency fund to take care of these unallocated costs. But the four big-ticket items alone would far exceed that amount. Nothing would be left for spending that cannot possibly be anticipated now -- for natural disasters or new commitments overseas or for any of the multitude of unexpected matters that arise each year and demand the government's attention and dollars.
And that is to say nothing of the baubles this president, like any other president, is going to have to promise individual members of this evenly divided Congress in order to win what are bound to be close votes on his top priorities.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: THE OVERVIEW; 
U.S. Shies Away From Threats In Plane Standoff With China

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
President Bush's senior advisers have concluded for now that the most severe acts of retaliation they could threaten in the spy-plane standoff with China -- selling advanced arms to Taiwan, restricting trade, derailing Beijing's bid for the Olympics -- would not speed the release of the 24 American crew members and could harm longer-term interests in Asia, administration officials said.
 One official involved in the first review of those options said today that "it became clear how little room for maneuver either side has" in a relationship that is "this interdependent and complex." 
 The official acknowledged that the administration is under growing pressure from conservatives in Congress to threaten stronger action, but has also been warned by business executives to assess any boomerang effects on the American economy before threatening trade sanctions. 
The absence of palatable options explains why Mr. Bush has issued only the blandest warnings to the Chinese about the diplomatic and economic risks they run in continuing to hold the Americans. 
The president issued two general warnings early last week, followed by far more conciliatory expressions of regret for the loss of their fighter pilot in the collision over the South China Sea. The American plane landed on Hainan island after the collision, which occurred on April 1. 
Today, Mr. Bush issued only the briefest of comments, saying each day the crew is held would "increase the potential that our relations with China could be damaged."
But his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, was pressed on how relations might be damaged. He retreated into ambiguity, and noted that two weeks ago, before the collision, Mr. Bush met in the Oval Office with Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen and talked about ways the countries could work together. "Much of the good they talked about can go wrong, or will go wrong," if the standoff continues, Mr. Fleischer said. 
But American officials acknowledge that neither side has much room to inflict harm on the other, unless they are willing to make major diplomatic and economic sacrifices. 
"The reality is that the Chinese hold the short-term tactical cards, because they have the crew, and we hold the long-term strategic cards," said one senior diplomat. "And both sides are using those to circle the other" as the talks drag on.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell put in play the mildest of sanctions on Sunday, when he seemed to suggest that Mr. Bush might cancel a state visit to Beijing after he attends the annual summit meeting of Asian-Pacific leaders in October, which was scheduled long ago for Shanghai.
"The whole environment is at some risk right now," he said.
And this afternoon, Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and a long-time supporter of selling arms to Taiwan, said, "Soon it will become questionable whether it is appropriate to have both an ambassador and hostages in the same country." 
Mr. Torricelli and other members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had held their tongues until now, after General Powell asked them last week to let the administration continue to seek diplomatic solutions.
But General Powell conceded then that if the crew remained in China a second week, it would be more difficult to keep members of Congress from publicly pressing for harsher steps.
Two White House officials tonight dismissed the idea of recalling the ambassador to China, Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, for consultations. One noted that because he is a former commander of military forces in the Pacific, "he's the only one we have whom the Chinese military really respects." 
Administration officials involved in the internal conversations about the standoff say, for example, that the United States probably does not have the clout with the International Olympics Committee to derail China's bid for the 2008 Games -- even if the Bush administration determined that was a wise course. There has been no public discussion of a possible American boycott of the Games if they are indeed held in Beijing. 
Similarly, any threat to delay China's entry into the World Trade Organization, while perhaps satisfying to critics who argue Congress should never have agreed to China's admission, could work to China's short-term advantage.
Ever since Congress acted to grant China permanent normal trade relations -- which takes effect only after China is admitted to the trade body -- Beijing itself has dragged out talks with the W.T.O. about the specifics of its admission. China must still reconcile differences in individual agreements it has made with members of the organization, a time-consuming process. 
Each year that its admission is delayed is another year that China can delay opening its markets to foreign competition, giving its state-run companies more time to adjust.
Experts on Chinese trade, including Nicholas Lardy of the Brookings Institution, have noted that a delay in opening China's market might be welcomed by many Chinese officials. "They might not be heartbroken," Mr. Lardy said.
One American diplomat drawn into the debate about possible sanctions because of his long exerience in dealing with China concluded, "We'd be hurting American carmakers and banks and workers as much as we'd be hurting the Chinese." 
And the option many in Congress are clamoring for -- selling Taiwan advanced arms and destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system -- also has its drawbacks.
"Look, if we have a bad relationship with China, does it make sense to sell more weapons to Taiwan?" asked one senior Bush administration official. "That would be ridiculous -- almost as ridiculous as the converse, that if we have good relations with China, we should starve the Taiwanese of what they need."
In fact, officials say, before the collision, the administration was leaning toward selling Taiwan Kidd-class destroyers, which have less capable weapon systems than the Aegis, and deferring any decision on the Aegis system, which the Chinese say they would attempt to overwhelm with more weaponry of their own.
Under that plan, the destroyers and the Aegis systems would be ordered for the United States Navy -- with the understanding that they could be transferred to Taiwan. But even if that was Mr. Bush's intent last month, if he pursues that track he could be accused by pro-Taiwan lawmakers of watering down the sale in order to appease the Chinese and get the crew members back.
"Beijing has made it impossible for the Bush administration, no matter what it decides," Senator Torricelli said in an interview today. "They cannot appear to have compromised on their previous intentions. In fact, every day that passes in this will make it harder not to do the sale of the Aegis destroyers. The only one who has benefited is the Taiwan military."
In the State Department, however, officials are worried that administration action could box in China's president, Jiang Zemin. "What happens to Jiang, and our hopes for avoiding a hard-line successor, if he lets the crew go and then we turn around and sell more gear to Taiwan?" one senior administration official said. 
While the official debate continued, American officials exacted Washington's strongest form of social revenge this evening. The Chinese embassy had long ago invited Secretary Powell, diplomats and members of Congress to a party welcoming Yang Jiechi as the new Chinese ambassador to Washington. Mr. Powell did not attend, and neither did any other senior administration officials.
"We're all very, very busy," one senior diplomat said tonight.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW; 
FIRST BUSH BUDGET PROPOSES TO RAISE AID FOR EDUCATION

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
President Bush unveiled his first budget today, describing his plans to increase federal spending on education and biomedical research while curtailing what he described as "recent explosive growth" in other federal programs.
 Under Mr. Bush's proposal, federal spending would rise by $104 billion, or 5.6 percent, to a total of $1.96 trillion in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. 
 In the last eight years, under President Bill Clinton, federal spending grew an average of 3.5 percent a year, as military spending was held down, the growth of health spending slowed and the Treasury reaped the fruits of deficit-reduction efforts begun under Mr. Bush's father, President George Bush. 
Two-thirds of the entire increase next year would go to six programs: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, the National Institutes of Health and the Pentagon.
By contrast, Mr. Bush would sharply reduce farm programs, especially those that supplement the income of farmers.
"This budget offers a new vision of governing for our nation," Mr. Bush told Congress, which will carefully weigh his proposals as lawmakers write appropriations bills in the coming months. After a brief meeting with his cabinet this morning, Mr. Bush added: "It's a budget that protects taxpayers, protects children, protects our surplus. It represents compassionate conservatism."
The shape of the budget was heavily influenced by Mr. Bush's top priority, a commitment to reduce taxes by $1.6 trillion over the next decade. The Senate voted last week to scale back the tax cut; the amount of that cut, to be worked out with the House, will affect decisions on the budget. 
Democrats asserted that Mr. Bush had cut worthy programs to accommodate the tax cut.
They cited, as examples, his plans to cut aid for the hiring of local police officers, the training of doctors at children's hospitals and the conservation of energy.
But Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the president's budget director, scoffed at such criticism. "It's completely fallacious," he said. "I think 'fatuous' might be a better word." 
Mr. Daniels said the new budget would achieve substantial savings from last year's budget just by canceling appropriations that had not been requested by Mr. Clinton -- money earmarked by Congress for specific projects, including roads and bridges and other public works.
Mr. Bush said his budget would produce a surplus of $231 billion in 2002, down from a projected surplus of $281 billion this year and an actual surplus of $236 billion last year.
In drafting his proposal, Mr. Bush focused on controlling discretionary spending, which is subject to annual appropriation and accounts for about one-third of the total budget. Under the president's budget, discretionary spending would rise by 4 percent, or $26 billion, in 2002 compared with average annual increases of 6.2 percent over the last three years.
In keeping with Mr. Bush's proposal to "leave no child behind," the Education Department would get one of the largest budget increases: $4.6 billion, or 11.5 percent, raising its total to $44.5 billion next year. That follows an increase of $10 billion approved by Congress in December for the current year.
The overall budget for agriculture activities would be chopped to $15.8 billion next year, from $29 billion this year. Spending on other activities would raise the total for next year to $17.9 billion. The budget of the Commodity Credit Corporation would be reduced to $8.3 billion, from $21.6 billion, and it would decline in subsequent years, to $6 billion in 2006.
The Bush administration said that "farm conditions are improving," an assertion disputed by lawmakers from farm states, who will strenuously resist the proposed cuts. 
Congressional aides said they were perplexed by the budget request for farm programs. Administration officials are apparently counting on Congress to provide emergency aid to farmers, as Congress has done in each of the last three years, to compensate for falling commodity prices and crops lost to bad weather.
Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said he doubted that Mr. Bush could win even Republican support for some of the "bewildering, curious cuts in this budget."
The president's budget continues many programs, with modest cutbacks or small increases, providing less than required to keep up with inflation.
The narrative explanation of the president's proposals has little of the fiery language in which Republicans used to attack the federal government and its role. Such language was characteristic of budget documents issued by President Ronald Reagan and his budget director, David A. Stockman, and by Richard G. Darman, the budget director for Mr. Bush's father.
For the first time in nearly two decades, the president's budget does not seek cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals. Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, praised Mr. Bush for refraining from such cuts, at a time when he said "more than half of America's hospitals are in financial distress."
The budget for the National Institutes of Health would rise by $2.75 billion, or 13.5 percent, providing $23.1 billion for biomedical research next year. This is the fourth installment of a five-year plan to double the budget of the institutes from 1998 to 2003. Congress devised the plan, and Mr. Bush has embraced it.
Mr. Bush's budget for 2002 provides the first detailed look at his priorities. In some respects, it may already have been overtaken by events on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Bush seeks $153 billion for prescription drug benefits and other, unspecified changes in Medicare over the next decade. But Republicans and Democrats alike say that twice that amount is the minimum that will be required for drug benefits, at a time when drug spending is rising more than 15 percent a year in many private health plans.
Mr. Bush tried to put his imprint on federal spending by cutting some of Mr. Clinton's favorite initiatives, including one to put 100,000 more police officers on the street. The budget for this program, Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, would be reduced by 17 percent from its current level of $1 billion. Some of the remaining money would be used to strengthen security at schools.
Mr. Bush's budget shows that he often prefers tax credits and other tax incentives, rather than direct federal spending, as an instrument of social policy. 
For example, Mr. Bush proposed new tax credits up to $2,000 a year to help uninsured people buy health insurance. He also proposed a tax credit to help families buy equipment that uses solar energy to generate electricity or to heat their homes.
Like presidents before him, Mr. Bush deployed numbers in his budget to justify his proposals. When he wanted to take credit for an increase that had already occurred in popular programs, like those of the National Science Foundation, he compared his request for 2002 with the amount spent in 2000. But when he wanted to cut programs, he criticized big raises made by Congress and Mr. Clinton in 2001.
Under Mr. Bush's plan, the White House said, from 2000 to 2002, the budget of the National Science Foundation will grow by 15 percent, to $4.5 billion. But Congress has already approved most of the rise, raising the budget to $4.4 billion this year, from $3.9 billion last year. And lawmakers of both parties have vowed to provide the science foundation with more money than the president sought.
The budget of the National Endowment for the Arts, once a source of fierce contention, would be increased slightly, to $105.2 million next year, from $104.8 million this year. The agency's budget reached a peak of $176 million in 1992. Arts organizations in New York State received nearly 14 percent of all grants last year, the largest share of any state.
Here are other highlights of the budget:
*Mr. Bush would split the Immigration and Naturalization Service into two agencies, one for law enforcement and one for the delivery of services. The number of Border Patrol agents would be increased by 570 in each of the next two years, reaching a total of 11,000 in 2003.
*States could use some of their federal welfare money to offset the cost of providing new tax credits to people who make contributions to state-designated charities. Such charities would work to alleviate poverty.
*Mr. Bush would create a new federal tax credit to encourage investors to build single-family homes for low-income people.
*The budget for Pell grants, the main form of federal aid to college students, would rise by $1 billion, to $9.8 billion next year. The maximum award would be $3,850, up $100 from the current year.
*Mr. Bush assumes that the federal government will raise $1.2 billion a year, starting in 2004, from oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Some of the money would be dedicated to research on solar energy technology.
Over all, the budget for protecting the environment and conserving natural resources would be reduced by 6.7 percent, to $26.6 billion next year, from $28.5 billion this year, according to budget documents.
The budget outlook depends, to some extent, on assumptions about the economy. But Mr. Daniels said the economic slowdown of recent months would not significantly reduce the surplus expected in the next five or 10 years.
"We're not concerned about the economy tanking," Mr. Daniels said. "We think that the economy is struggling along at the moment with unacceptably low growth, but at least it's still growing." 
Moreover, Mr. Daniels said, "if you look at our revenue projections, you will see we have essentially assumed a slow growth or even recessionary economy over the next few years, just out of a conservative approach."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE BREAKDOWN; 
Who Gets What Slice of the President's First Federal Budget Pie

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

 BODY:
Housing
 President Bush's proposed $30.4 billion budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development includes a 6.7 percent increase intended to expand programs for new homeowners and provide better housing for low-income renters. 
 In presenting the budget, Housing Secretary Mel Martinez announced two new programs that he said were intended to enable more members of minorities to become homeowners. 
"The sad fact is only 46 percent of Hispanic and African-American families own their own homes," Mr. Martinez said. "And we must do better."
The first program is a $1.7 billion tax credit over five years to encourage investors to build housing for low-income families. Mr. Martinez said the tax credit could help build 100,000 homes in low-income areas. 
The second program is intended to provide low-income families with money for a down payment. The American Dream Fund would provide $1 billion over five years which, HUD officials said, could help 650,000 low-income families to become homeowners.
In addition, the president's budget would add $3 million to church-based and community programs like Habitat for Humanity that build or repair homes for new homeowners. 
As promised, the budget includes increases of $197 million for 34,000 more housing vouchers and $150 million to help cover higher utility costs in public housing. 
Other proposals include spending $20 million to house 3,700 people living with AIDS and $10 million for a 10-year program to eliminate lead paint hazards in 2.3 million low-income households with children.
The budget discontinues several programs, including the $309 million drug-elimination program for public housing, which had helped pay for policing in public housing compounds. Mr. Martinez said this program duplicated other efforts.
The $25 million rural housing and economic development program was eliminated because officials said it duplicated many Agriculture Department programs. ELIZABETH BECKER

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW; 
Architectural Trendsetter Seduces Historic SoHo

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
Last week the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission made a decision of breathtaking importance for the future of architecture in New York. The 11-member commission unanimously approved a design by the French architect Jean Nouvel for a new hotel in SoHo, one of the first of the city's historic districts and one of its most preservation-minded neighborhoods.
 The design bears little resemblance to the derivative contextual aesthetic promoted by preservation groups and local community boards in recent decades. Mr. Nouvel's design is good news, but the enthusiastic support it drew from the Landmarks Commission and its commissioner, Jennifer J. Raab, is an even bigger deal. This is the most significant architectural initiative we've seen from city government since -- well, since the landmarks law was passed in 1965. 
 The 180-room hotel, called the Broadway, is being developed by Andre Balazs, owner of the Mercer Hotel (also in SoHo), and the Chateau Marmont and the Standard, citadels of chic in Hollywood. His partner in the project is Hines, a Houston-based development firm. The hotel will be built on a large site, now occupied by a parking lot and flea market, on Grand Street between Broadway and Mercer. Mr. Nouvel's Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris, completed in 1994, captured a perfect picture of modern Left Bank life. The Broadway will do the same for downtown Manhattan. 
While the design is as distinctive as any New York has seen in decades, it is sensitive to its surroundings. The building is massed into a six-story tower atop a six-story base. The tower's height is determined by what planners call the sky plane, the variable angle from which the sky remains visible from the street. The base extends the full length of the Grand Street block, with the tower set back to the north by 44 feet. The facades, glass compositions of overlapping rectilinear geometry, reflect the Manhattan street grid and its cosmopolitan life.
Just north of the building, a cut through the block between Mercer and Broadway will reveal a garden set two levels below the street. Lushly planted, with reeds whose frilly tops will reach above the sidewalk, the garden will adjoin a two-story spa. An angled wall enlarges the outdoor space and lets hotel guests peer down from their rooms. Another cut, on the Mercer Street side, reveals a steel mesh fire escape. Other amenities: glass elevator cabs, lobby, shops, luxury, the unending once-over.
Like the LVMH Tower on East 57th Street, designed by Mr. Nouvel's countryman Christian de Portzamparc, the hotel's outstanding feature is its innovative use of glass. This is not coincidence. In France glass has kept its connotations of modernity. It represents openness, lightness, technical innovation and a progressive view. Mr. Nouvel's design, like Mr. Portzamparc's, showcases technical advances in glass production and the expanded range of ideas they make possible. The facades are visually enriched -- ornamented, if you like -- with applied and architectonic features that give the glass uncommon depth and texture. The three street facades have steel grids of mullions and spandrels. Glass fins, used for support as well as for aesthetic effect, are set perpendicular to the walls. These amplify the play of reflections across the surface.
The transparency is further modulated by different types of glass, and by screening and fretting techniques that play against the strict geometry of the steel grid. Applied scrims of gradated color -- red, blue and gray -- also distinguish the design from glass towers of 40 years ago.
Like other contemporary architects, Mr. Nouvel stresses the relationship between inside and outside. Here he defines the relationship with the interaction of art and technology. The building's exterior includes the world immediately around it. The scale of the base and the proportions of the grid mirror those of nearby loft buildings, which would also be reflected in the glass. The transparency draws the outside inside, and vice versa.
The facades' industrial look recalls the origins of SoHo's architecture in cast-iron construction, but the glass is fabricated on a scale impossible a century ago. The steel grid evokes the mass production of SoHo's ornamental facades and the steel mullions of the classic American towers of Mies van der Rohe. Abstract imagery applied to the glass suggests SoHo's transformation from a district of light manufacturing to a center of computer-age design.
It would be obtuse to analyze the design in strictly formal or functional terms. This hotel is made for "Moody's Mood for Love" as performed by King Pleasure, on a rainy weekday afternoon, downtown, in a room surrounded by low-rise buildings. Think Edward Hopper crossed with Pedro Almodovar. Not least, this design is about sex. That is its major departure from the glass office towers of mid-20th-century New York.
In those buildings, glass stood for Reason: economy, technology, prefabricated construction. These meanings still hold in projects like the Rose Center for Earth and Space, by James Stewart Polshek and partners. Elsewhere, but especially in France, new techniques in glass have made possible a range of erotic suggestions. Mr. Nouvel has pursued them in projects including the Cartier Foundation, the Galeries Lafayette in Berlin and the (unbuilt) Victoria Building for Frankfurt. Modulating the visual texture of glass with reflectivity, fretted patterns, screened-on images, blurring, veiling, coloration, support systems and other techniques, these projects summon forth states of narcissism, exhibitionism, voyeurism, veiling, vamping, elusiveness, disconsolation, Hitchcock's blonde.
Novelty holds erotic appeal. Modern architects of the heroic era could not acknowledge this. They let movies say it for them, in sets for mysteries and romantic comedies -- "That Touch of Mink," "The Best of Everything," -- in which the gleam of the new denoted desire. 
Mr. Nouvel's vision has long been cinematic. He has used the New York City fire escape before, most notably in the Arab World Institute in Paris, but in the New York context the image derives more recognizably from the realm of "Rear Window" and "West Side Story." Grace Kelly has discovered that she is a better photographer than Jimmy Stewart, and that romantic intrigues are more photogenically combustible than wars and natural disasters. In an animated dream sequence, she sees the walls shattered by an explosion of high-pressure glamour, and the colored glass shards, transformed by the pressure into precious stones, pave the streets with diamonds, rubies, sapphires. It's that kind of building.
The hotel's northern side, which faces away from the street, is its most explicitly cinematic feature. A screened coating will render the glass gray, rhythmically punctuated by transparent rectangles with blurred edges. These resemble film sprockets or movie stills from an emphatically film noir genre. 
Mr. Nouvel's design is a supreme example of what we mean when we talk about an architecture of ideas. It is an aesthetic of differences that depends on an awareness of similarities, a design that demonstrates the extent to which continuity depends on periodic rupture and separation.
The miracle is that the members of the Landmarks Commission understood it. They got it completely. In fact, they overruled the opinion of the community board's preservation panel. I doubt that we could have counted on the commission's support even as recently as two years ago, certainly not to this degree. Perhaps it took the arrival of the millennium for the city to realize that it had produced almost no buildings of landmark stature in more than 30 years and that a resistance to ideas was to blame.
I suspect the commission's decision will have widespread repercussions, even outside New York, by identifying several fundamental principles. It points up the profound distinction between architecture and architectural history. It helps dispel the confusion between preservation and preservationism. And it demonstrates that the architectural context for great cities like New York is international as well as local. This is called leadership.

HEADLINE: ARTS ABROAD; 
It's a Circus Out There, but Cirque Still Isn't Satisfied

BYLINE:  By James Brooke 

DATELINE: MONTREAL 

 BODY:
In one stockroom, racks rising from the floor to the ceiling hold 700 plaster heads. With seven different shows on four continents, Cirque du Soleil wants to have each head on file in case a performer needs a new mask, wig or headdress.
 To venture behind the scenes at Cirque du Soleil's new international headquarters here is to explore an arts multinational that is booming through a blend of creativity and efficiency. At home, Cirque is seeking to turn this city into the world capital of circus arts. Abroad, Cirque plans to expand its entertainment concepts beyond the big top, into Cirque hotels, restaurants, art galleries and boutiques. 
 "Guy broke the rules with Cirque," Mario D'Amico, Cirque's vice president for marketing, said of Guy Laliberte, a onetime Quebecois accordion player, fire-eater and stilt-walker who formed the company in 1984 with a dozen friends. "Now with hotels and dinner theaters, he wants to build an experience around the customer."
New York area residents got another chance to line up to taste the Cirque experience when the company scheduled its "Dralion" show for an eight-week run in Liberty State Park in Jersey City starting on April 4. Like the six other Cirque shows, "Dralion" is a Felliniesque fusion of music and mime, acrobatics and dance, clowning and theatrical drama. A swirl of multicolored masks, costumes and sets create a world of fantasy and imagination under a traditional circus tent. Aimed at affluent sophisticates -- children and adults alike -- Cirque further breaks with circus tradition by using no animals and by eschewing a star system.
This approach has shaken up the circus industry, prompting Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey to counterattack with its own new-wave circus show, "Kaleidoscape." 
But Cirque officials are not resting on their laurels. Cirque has plans to build a 2,000-seat theater in London at Battersea Power Station, an empty 1930's landmark thought to be the largest brick building in Europe. Planned in a partnership announced in December with a Taiwanese investor, Victor Hwang, the Battersea renovation would include Cirque-inspired restaurants, hotels, art galleries and a spa and movie theater. Over the next 15 years, Cirque says, it plans to build four to six entertainment complexes around the world.
"We want to be in the major entertainment capitals of the world -- London, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney," Mr. D'Amico said. "You could see trapeze artists practicing when you check in, or there could be statue acts around the lobby."
Mr. Laliberte, Cirque's 42-year-old founding president, has mused about the possibility of clowns' delivering room service to hotel guests or mimes' climbing out of hidden compartments in elevators.
Moving beyond merchandising souvenirs, Cirque already takes advantage of its branded artistic aesthetic to sell Cirque wallpaper, fabrics, teapots, leather jackets, blown glass and handmade jewelry. It is considering a line of home furnishings, presumably something more innovative than armchairs with built-in whoopee cushions.
At home here, its ambition to establish this North American city, 90 minutes by plane north of New York, into a world center for circus arts. This city, a multilingual greenhouse for entertainers and artists, already has, in addition to Cirque du Soleil, the National Circus School of Canada; Cirque Eloize, a small touring troupe formed by Cirque veterans; En Piste, a Quebec circus association; dozens of street performers and jugglers; and the Canadian chapter of Clowns Without Borders, an aid group that has taken good cheer to war-torn areas like Bosnia and Kosovo.
The next step, Cirque officials say, is to band these groups together to form a world circus capital. Rising around the nucleus here of Cirque du Soleil would be a new center for training, creating and performing the circus arts called the Cite des Arts du Cirque.
"We want to create a critical mass in Montreal," said Chantal Cote, a Cirque spokeswoman. Located on a vast reclaimed landfill that Cirque made its home five years ago, the Cite would include residential housing for performers and would drive economic development in the surrounding St. Michel neighborhood, the third poorest residential area in Canada.
As with every decision by Cirque, a privately held company that reported $300 million in revenue last year, shrewd business calculations are at work in the Cite project. In an era when senses are dulled by a barrage of recorded entertainment, the thinking goes, worldwide demand for live circus entertainment outstrips the supply. 
Thirty million people have attended Cirque shows over the last 17 years, and company officials say that the demand justifies an eighth show, with a debut in the spring of 2002. 
Behind the magic of Cirque is a relentless international recruiting machine that must contend with the 20 percent annual turnover in skilled performers at the company. Beyond the lure of running away to join the circus, Cirque offers second careers to former Olympic athletes and coaches. Last year company talent scouts held auditions in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, France, Russia and Ukraine. 
Despite the company's Gallic stamp, only 20 percent of its 530 performers are Quebecois, with the remainder from 40 different countries. Although the working language for performers is English, safety signs in the high wire practice room are posted in English, Russian and Chinese.
On March 12 Cirque inaugurated a new step toward the Cite project, an $11 million workshop with spaces for hundreds of mask makers, dyers, costume seamstresses and artisans who fashion the trapezes and high-wire hardware. Cirque now employs 2,100 people, double its payroll of five years ago.
The Workshop joins the existing Studio, a four-year-old building that includes a three-story indoor space for acrobatic and trapeze training, as well as the traditional clocks on the wall befitting the international headquarters of a company with touring shows in Europe, Asia, Australia and the United States and permanent shows in Las Vegas, Orlando, Fla., and Biloxi, Miss. Unfinished metal and concrete were used to give buildings the air of a permanent work in progress. To recreate the collegial spirit of traveling troupes, a generous number of interior windows allow office workers and trapeze artists to see one another at work throughout the day.
"The theme is transparency," Ms. Cote said as she passed a room in which a Chinese child repeated a juggling act over and over again. "We started as street performers. We wanted something to remind us of our origins."

HEADLINE: A Single Hour That Can Save the Day 

BYLINE:  By NANCY RUBIN STUART 

 BODY:
The three-martini lunch is dead. So what has replaced it? As it turns out, many office workers are inventive about recharging their batteries during their lunch hour. And often, food has nothing to do with it.
 Andy Lerer, a cash analyst in the accounting department of the Manhattan publisher VNU/USA, delivers meals to house-bound AIDS patients. "It's important to switch gears," Mr. Lerer said. "I enjoy the clients, and it makes them happy to see me at lunchtime. That makes me feel good and gives me perspective." 
 Merna Skinner, a vice president at Exec Comm, a communications consulting firm in Midtown Manhattan, takes a more introspective approach. During her lunch hour, she often turns off the lights, the computer and the cell phone in her office and lights several candles. "My goal is to disconnect from all technology and reconnect with myself," she said.
Other people meditate, go to church, exercise or just wander aimlessly through stores -- anything it takes, it seems, to work off the stress of the morning and prepare them for the frustrations of the afternoon.
True, workplace stress is nothing new. And true, some people have always used their lunch breaks to combat it. But, specialists say, more people are stressed than ever. And since few of them knock back three martinis at lunch anymore, or even indulge in a glass of wine, more workers are devising strategies to lift their spirits at midday.
It is not just sobriety that is driving the trend. So are the hectic pace of the Internet age, Americans' growing health consciousness and now, fears of unemployment. Seventy percent of Americans surveyed last year by Penn, Schoen & Berland for the American Psychological Association reported high or moderate workplace stress, and 57 percent said they worried their heightened anxiety would cause health problems. The study was done in response to anecdotal reports from members of the association that job stress was increasing.
And while the jobless rate remains low, the recent economic slowdown and stock market slump are giving many the jitters.
"Today's rapidly changing economic climate, with its mergers and acquisitions and resultant uncertainty, inevitably has a stressful effect," said Rex Gatto, an industrial and organizational psychologist and author of "Controlling Stress in the Workplace" (Pfeiffer, 1993).
Even the lunch hour itself is being blamed for workplace malaise. "For many people, the lunch hour represents the frightening realization that half the day is over and yet there's lots more work to be done," said Marlin Potash, a clinical psychologist who has written a book about balancing work and personal life.
The information age is a major culprit, she said, because people feel trapped by the very technology that was supposed to set them free from much of their workload. "We have beepers, cell phones and pagers so that people can reach us all day long, even at lunchtime when we're supposed to be taking a break," Dr. Potash said. "Psychologically, that's a dangerous phenomenon because it means we're not in control and our jobs are running us."
Some people seek spiritual solace. Chuck Ughetta goes to Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. "It gives me a chance to pray, to find peace and have an opportunity to reflect," said Mr. Ughetta, secretary-treasurer of Gerard Klauer Mattison, a securities firm.
Charlie Buck, president of Charles Buck & Associates, an executive recruitment firm, favors a Hindu discipline, practicing hatha yoga once a week for 90 minutes. "It revs me up mentally and physically and gives me more energy than if I'd just had eight hours of sleep," Mr. Buck said.
Vigorous exercise, of course, is a time-honored break from the office grind. Every day, untold thousands of workers troop off to the gym or the indoor swimming pool or just to a nearby park for a quick jog or fast walk. Since 1987, membership in gyms and health clubs has nearly doubled to roughly 33 million from just over 17 million, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association. "After a workout, I feel rejuvenated, and my sense of humor and hopefulness have returned," said Linda Touster, a financial consultant for an oncologist on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Window shopping is another standby. Cynthia Reed, a word processor at the Falconwood Corporation in Manhattan, a merchant banking company, likes to browse in Saks Fifth Avenue. "Saks is my respite," she said, "especially when I leave my credit cards at my desk. Then I just wander though the store, looking at the clothes and at the interesting people who come to that store from all over the world."
Behavioral specialists say what you do is less significant than whether you do it. What is important, they say, is to shift gears -- to do something so radically different that you'll put work out of your mind.
"Change the pace, the type of activity and your environment, even if it's only for 15 or 20 minutes," Dr. Potash advised. "If you can't leave your office, leave the room or switch chairs. Put your head down for 10 minutes. You'll get several hours of renewed vigor from that."

Take deep breaths and meditate at your desk. Also do hand and neck exercises. (Ask a physical therapist about which ones to do.) Go outside during your lunch hour, if only for a few minutes. Do not let bad weather deter you. Fight self-pity, anger and other office blahs with mental pep talks.

HEADLINE: Europe's Rate Setters Wary of Slowdown 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 10 

 BODY:
If the United States catches a cold, can Europe escape with just a sneeze?
 At least for the last decade, the opposite was true: any mild economic setback in the United States usually led to pronounced problems in Europe. But as the American economy teeters on the edge of a recession, European central bankers are clinging to the hope that the slowdown will be significantly less acute on their side of the Atlantic. 
 On Wednesday, the European Central Bank will meet once again to decide whether to follow the Federal Reserve Board's lead and reduce interest rates. Alone among major central banks, the European Central Bank has so far held the line and refused to ease monetary policy, in part because its leaders were confident that American problems would have only a limited impact on Europe. The Fed, meanwhile, has reduced rates three times this year, the Bank of Japan cut short-term rates essentially to zero last month and the Bank of England made a modest reduction in February and another last week. 
But Europe has grown noticeably more anxious in the last few weeks. Forecasters in government and private industry have trimmed their predictions for 2001, and now expect growth of about 2.5 percent in the 12-nation euro currency area, down from 3 percent before. Germany, which accounts for one-third of the euro zone's output, has slowed even more, and growth there is not expected to exceed 2.1 percent.
That would still be faster growth than is now predicted for the United States, but those European forecasts are based on an assumption that the American economy will start to revive later this year. Without a pickup in America, all bets are off.
Confusion has compounded the anxiety. Three weeks ago, top officials at the European Central Bank hinted that they were ready to ease monetary policy. In a series of public comments, they acknowledged that European growth had slowed more than they had expected, and suggested that inflation worries were fading. But other members of the bank's board, including the president of the Bundesbank of Germany, quickly said they were not so sanguine about inflation and wanted to wait and see.
Cacophony has been a problem since the dawn of the euro as a common currency two years ago. But the central bank's likely next move seems especially hard to read, and analysts are revising their predictions every few days as they ponder the latest comment or scrap of economic data.
"It is true that signals were contradictory at one point," said Elga Bartsch, an economist in London at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "But that very much underlines that the consensus was shifting within the central council."
Three questions are at the heart of current policy battles within Europe. The first is how severe a slowdown Europe is likely to suffer, and what if anything the central bank should do to minimize it. A second question is whether it will directly affect Europe as a whole or be confined mainly to Germany. The third is whether the European Central Bank is responding quickly enough to changing economic conditions.
Officially, the bank is still sticking to a 3 percent growth forecast for the euro zone, though senior bankers concede unofficially that the figure is too high. Today, six institutes that advise the German government revised their own growth forecasts down to 2.6 percent, while the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research organization financed by industrialized countries around the world, reduced its forecast to 2.7 percent.
The O.E.C.D. and the German institutes both called on the European Central Bank today to reduce interest rates quickly. Those calls follow similar remarks last week by the head of the International Monetary Fund, Horst Kohler.
"The E.C.B. has a tendency to move incrementally, perhaps because of a desire to foster consensus," said Vincent Koen, a senior economist at the O.E.C.D. who wrote the survey on Europe published today. "At the same time, we think the time has come for a small move."
Most economists still predict that Europe will escape a recession. Despite a steady diet of discouraging news, consumer confidence appears to remain strong in most countries. And while exports to North America and Asia are expected to decline, many experts say European investment in technology and new equipment will remain fairly buoyant. 
"We haven't had as much of a bubble in Europe as we had in the United States," Mr. Koen said. Overspending on telecommunications and Internet networks, fueled by the stock market boom for start-up technology companies, was much more acute in the United States, he said. Beyond that, European consumers are not burdened by nearly as much debt as Americans, who have been on a spending spree that lasted through most of the 1990's. Nor have Europeans been affected as much by declining stock markets, because a much smaller percentage had been investing in stocks.
Germany remains one of Europe's biggest uncertainties. Though it is among the largest economies over all and a leading exporter of industrial equipment and automobiles, German economic growth has consistently lagged the European average. 
"At the time when the European Union was forming, everyone thought that Germany would be the standard, and all other countries would have to get their acts together to compete with it," said Stefan Schneider, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. "Now Germany is no longer the leader. It is more the laggard."
Germany has always been vulnerable to a global downturn because of its greater reliance exports of heavy machinery, but its problems in recent years have had more to do with lackluster demand for goods and services at home, which most economists attribute to a long series of tax increases.
"Export orders are slowing down big time, but that was expected," said Jose Luis Alzola, an economist at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London. "What was not expected was that domestic demand in Germany would not respond to tax cuts."
This year, the German government has passed the first significant tax reduction in years, but it also raised taxes on gasoline just when world oil prices went soaring.
"Germany is indeed the weak core of the euro area," Mr. Koen said. "Germany is slowing down the euro area, while France and the peripheral countries are doing better. Clearly there is a German problem, and maybe in part this has to do with the lack of structural reform."

HEADLINE: Mining Giant Steps Out on Its Own 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 10 

 BODY:
Anthony J. Trahar, the new chief executive of the mining giant Anglo American, was asked a few weeks ago to list the changes since he took over the company last July, in what many took as a sea change of generation and corporate style.
 The recurrent theme in his response was speed: "rapid" moves to reassure shareholders that a new strategy was unfolding; "fairly rapid" steps to shed noncore businesses and, most of all, a quicker-than-expected deal last month to disentangle the cross-holdings of Anglo American and De Beers, the diamond colossus that is Anglo's sister company in the Oppenheimer family empire. 
 A couple of days later, Mr. Trahar (pronounced TRAY-er) might have been forced to conclude that his rivals were moving with equal if not greater speed, as the world's mining and metals titans consolidate in face of uncertain commodity prices, seeking to outflank Anglo American as it sheds the final legacies of doing business in apartheid-era South Africa. 
On March 19, taking Anglo American by surprise, BHP of Australia and Billiton of London announced a $28 billion merger that, if completed, would leapfrog over Anglo American into the No. 2 slot of miners, after Alcoa. 
Anglo American maintained a studied silence, but the deal showed that the rough-and-tumble of the mining industry extends far beyond the deep pits where many of Anglo-America's 220,000 employees work to the boardrooms where strategies evolve.
Since its incorporation in 1917, Anglo American has tried to project a patrician visage. Its founder, Ernest Oppenheimer, was knighted. The atmosphere at its longtime headquarters in Johannesburg -- before the company moved its main stock market listing and some of its offices to London in May 1999 -- was more redolent of a gentleman's club than of a dealer in the mucky business of mining.
But Mr. Trahar, a 51-year-old South African, was appointed with a different mission: to implant a leaner style of management and to convince investors that however much the Oppenheimer dynasty has been seen as inbred and manipulative, Anglo American is moving into more open ground, with a keener eye on shareholders.
Unlike his two predecessors, Julian Ogilvie Thompson and Gavin Relly, Mr. Trahar was not a Rhodes scholar and did not get his start as a personal assistant to Harry F. Oppenheimer, the patriarch who died in September. (He is quick to point out, however, that he was once a personal assistant to Mr. Relly.)
Rather, he studied business and accounting in Johannesburg. "I actually wanted to be an architect," he said, "but my father said that if I did that, I'd be poor all my life." His father had a point: last year, with bonuses, Mr. Trahar earned some $975,000, a company spokesman said, a figure that will rise in 2001.
Like his predecessors, he is an Anglo American lifer, projecting the understated diffidence the company has used to cloak corporate aggressiveness. His brief time as an assistant to Mr. Relly helped as he rose to become a director in 1989 as head of the Mondi paper division -- his springboard to the top job. He bridles slightly at the suggestion that accounting is not an appropriate background for a mining boss. Anglo American, he said, "has never been run by miners."
"It's been run by financiers," he said. "This is about running people and people teams -- not about running mines -- and making people teams perform."
There is another, less obvious break with company history. Traditionally, Anglo's chairmen and chief executives were offered directorships of privately held Oppenheimer family companies, often perceived as the true power behind much of South African business. Those directorships blurred the lines of management and ownership. Once Anglo American listed in London in 1999, Mr. Trahar said "it was absolutely clear that those roles had to be separate and independent."
Disentangling the long ties that bind Anglo American, De Beers and the Oppenheimer family has been by far his biggest task. Even before his appointment as chief executive was announced, Mr. Trahar said, he had been thinking about ways to end the cross-holdings through which De Beers and Anglo American own about a third of each other's stock, protecting against swings in the diamond business, but also weighing down Anglo American's share price and unsettling investors.
Shortly before he died, Harry Oppenheimer told associates the arrangement "had outlived its usefulness," Mr. Trahar said.
It was Mr. Oppenheimer's son Nicholas, the head of De Beers, Mr. Trahar said, who came up with the idea of taking De Beers private in a way that will give Anglo a 45 percent stake, but separate the companies -- almost. The Oppenheimer family's stake will be reduced to 7 percent, guaranteeing Mr. Oppenheimer a seat on the Anglo American board. 
Anglo American, he said, is "completely independent of the Oppenheimer family."
Mr. Trahar objects to suggestions that the privatization was an inside job, one that hurt shareholders. But that is not the only message he must get across to investors. While rivals' stocks trade at higher multiples of earnings, Anglo American has lagged because it has been seen as slow to slim down. Yet Mr. Trahar lists several actions culminating in the De Beers' deal, which some analysts say may have distracted executives from developments like the merger of BHP and Billiton.
The slowdown in the American economy has also forced him to pare expectations, but he said he was hoping for a swing back to old- economy investments after the collapse of dot-com stocks. 
"We watched with a wry amusement," he said, "as dot-com turned to dot-bomb."

HEADLINE: Cutbacks by Daimler Leave A Bitter Residue at Chrysler 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 9 

 BODY:
When word emerged a month ago that Chrysler burned through $5 billion in cash last year, the radio talk show host David Newman wondered aloud what had happened. "How can money disappear like that?" he asked on the local powerhouse, WJR-AM. "I simply didn't know, and I still don't know."
 But his callers knew where to lay blame: at Chrysler's German parent, DaimlerChrysler A.G. Speculation flew that management had siphoned away the money to help keep its Japanese partner, Mitsubishi, afloat and to pay for projects at Mercedes-Benz in Stuttgart. 
 As the often xenophobic debate spread to the Internet and in the local media, Chrysler officials said the cash was depleted by declining auto sales, higher-than-expected rebates and an unplanned expense connected with vehicle introductions.
"There was no jumbo jet landing at Detroit Metro with pallets of money being shipped back to Japan and Germany," Chrysler's chief operating officer, Wolfgang Bernhard, said.
The episode illustrates the lingering resentment here over Chrysler's German superiors, who took control after the $39 billion deal that joined the Chrysler Corporation with Daimler-Benz in 1998.
DaimlerChrysler is about to hold its annual meeting in Berlin. The session follows a recent forecast that revenue will fall 13 percent this year and operating profit as much as 75 percent, dragged down by Chrysler.
The anti-German sentiment in and around Auburn Hills, Mich., where Chrysler is based, is complicating efforts by managers there to stem Chrysler's operating losses -- $1.8 billion last year -- and to make the company competitive again. "Being German adds an additional challenge," said Mr. Bernhard, who, along with the Chrysler division's new chief, Dieter Zetsche, had been imported from Stuttgart.
The hostility, which stirs anew with each spate of bad Chrysler news, brings to mind the Japan-bashing of the early 1980's, when Japanese automakers took sales from American rivals. That fervor reached a peak of sorts in 1982, when a Chinese-American, Vincent Chin, was killed by patrons in a local bar who thought he was Japanese.
By contrast, no one has threatened metropolitan Detroit's more than a million people of German descent.
"No violence -- it's been more or less verbalized," said Eugene C. Strobel Jr., founding president of the German-American Heritage Foundation International.
The debate takes place in doughnut shops, on radio shows and on Internet message boards.
"Dump Schrempp Now!" a posting on Yahoo's DaimlerChrysler board said last week, referring to the parent company's chief executive, Jurgen E. Schrempp. "Where's my stockholder value -- from $108 to $45 -- that's real German engineering, ya?" sic The American shares, which began trading in October 1998 around $82, are now a little shy of $50.
It was this sort of resentment that Mr. Schrempp had hoped to prevent with a strategy created ahead of the Chrysler deal. It included two corporate teams, three outside public relations firms, a memorial to World War II slave laborers and gifts to all employees of both companies.
In DaimlerChrysler's first year, more than 1,000 Chrysler employees signed up for company-sponsored German-language lessons or cultural awareness classes. But such enthusiasm soon disappeared, along with virtually all of Chrysler's American senior management, including Robert J. Eaton, the chairman who forged the deal with Mr. Schrempp, and Thomas Stallkamp, the first Chrysler president after the merger. The new managers' rapid move to cut 26,000 jobs, key to the turnaround plan, inflamed a raw wound.
"There are a lot of people who feel Chrysler would have been better off alone," a recently retired manager of a Chrysler parts supplier said. The deepest resentment was aimed at Mr. Schrempp, who, in a November interview in The Financial Times, said he had never intended the deal to be a "merger of equals."
Soon after, DaimlerChrysler ousted the second postmerger president, James P. Holden, and installed Mr. Zetsche and Mr. Bernhard. Though they are the only top managers sent from Germany, the moves generated dismay.
Mr. Newman, the talk show host, said he had been taken aback by the vitriol of his callers. Some even equated the new management with Nazis. "I have a shiver of embarrassment about it," he said. He has encouraged callers to take a more civil tone.
Others have followed suit. The Detroit Free Press columnist Doron Levin has since written a conciliatory column, and he was upbeat about Chrysler in a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit.
The creator of ChryslerTakeover.com says he removes postings with ethnic disparagements from the site. But the man, who works in Chrysler's product-testing operations, and refused to provide his name for fear of losing his job, remains contemptuous of management. "They are really playing right into the stereotype of the arrogant German manager," he said, by laying off workers en masse soon after they took charge.
Mr. Zetsche and Mr. Bernhard say they recognize the need to address such feelings. Among other efforts, they often eat in the employee cafeteria and regularly stroll down to visit managers in the enormous technical center, instead of summoning them to the executive tower.
Lately, support for Chrysler management has come from a perhaps improbable quarter, the United Auto Workers. Two decades ago, the U.A.W. barred Japanese cars from its headquarters parking lot. But last week, the union's president, Stephen P. Yokich, who sits on the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board, said he did not think that Chrysler would have survived its financial troubles as an independent company.
Nate Gooden, the union's vice president for DaimlerChrysler employees, added, "I think the American people had the wrong perception when the Germans came over." Under the U.A.W. contract, workers who are laid off receive virtually full pay and benefits until the pact expires in 2003. And improving sales, Mr. Gooden said, might eliminate the need for some job cuts.
Mr. Bernhard and Mr. Zetsche agree that financial recovery is the antidote to what Mr. Zetsche calls the "German passport issue."
"When we get the first signs of success," Mr. Bernhard said, "this stuff will die."

HEADLINE: Field Getting More Crowded In Japan Premiership Race 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 10 

 BODY:
The contest to determine who will replace Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori grew more heated today, with two more contenders entering the race.
 There are now five potential candidates for the leadership vote by the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party, to be held on April 24. But there is disagreement about whether the expanded field means that the party is becoming more democratic or less cohesive. 
 The new entries in the race are Shizuka Kamei, a former police officer who has risen to become the party's policy chief, and Taro Aso, the minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy, who has only recently taken a starring role in the party and who says he will run if he musters enough support from party members. 
Junichiro Koizumi, a party upstart who has been flirting with running for weeks, today canceled his allegiance to a faction that is unpopular with some members, apparently trying to position himself for a broader role. 
Mitsuo Horiuchi, another heavy hitter in the party, was said to be preparing a speech to announce his candidacy. And Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former prime minister and leader of the party's largest faction, is also in the running.
"The party's becoming more democratic," said Taro Kono, a young legislator. "It's not so different from the selection process that occurs in party primaries in the United States."
But others say the abundance of potential candidates for party leader, and thus prime minister, could be regarded as a sign that the fractious confederation of factions that has governed Japan since World War II with only a 10-month hiatus is closer than ever to disintegration.
"The fact that four or five names are popping up proves there is no one who can carry the party anymore," said Masumi Ishikawa, a professor at Obirin University. "They can't agree among themselves who should be their leader."
The broader field of candidates may be little more than a gimmick. Staging a competition for the top job addresses critics who say the leadership selection process is flawed, but past races have ended predictably.
Indeed, political analysts chalked Mr. Kamei's entry into the race as little more than an effort to play kingmaker. "Kamei basically wants to sell his faction's votes to either Koizumi or Hashimoto in a runoff election," said one party member. 
Mr. Kamei, who heads the party's third-largest faction, may find himself more of a contender than he imagined. Party members said meetings held on Monday by the leaders of Mr. Hashimoto's faction revealed an unexpectedly low level of support for him, and there is speculation that he will decline to run.
The party first forced its leaders to compete for the job in 1996, when Mr. Hashimoto and Mr. Koizumi squared off in a race that was dismissed by outsiders as little more than kabuki theater.
Mr. Hashimoto won, and when he resigned in 1998, three party members competed to replace him. But the winner, Keizo Obuchi, died suddenly a year ago and was replaced by Mr. Mori.
Mr. Mori did not have to run a race. He was elevated by five of the party's leaders in a smoke-filled hotel room, underscoring concerns that Japan has no clearly defined mechanism for replacing its leadership in a crisis. After he repeatedly embarrassed the party with verbal gaffes and protocol faux pas, it decided that it had no choice but to replace him or risk the wrath of voters in the election for the upper house of Parliament scheduled for this summer.
Mr. Hashimoto is unlikely to repair the party's relationship with the electorate, since he is remembered for increasing the sales tax and thus pushing the economy into yet another slide.
Mr. Koizumi scores highest in public opinion polls, bested only by Makiko Tanaka, an outspoken member of Parliament who has said she would support him if he abandoned his factional allegiances and agreed to appoint a cabinet to "reflect the will of the people."
But Mr. Koizumi is disliked by the more conservative elements in the party because he advocates the privatization of the postal savings system, a political sacred cow, and has generally assumed the role of the rabble-rouser in the party.

Recruiting in Caribbean
 The Board of Education is sending recruiters to the Caribbean this month in hopes of luring teachers from Barbados, Trinidad and Jamaica to New York City schools. The board wants to increase the number of Caribbean teachers in Districts 17 and 18 in Brooklyn, which encompass Flatbush and Crown Heights and have many students from Jamaica, Trinidad and Haiti. 

New Humanities Leader
The New York Institute for the Humanities at New York University, which has been looking to reclaim some of its old intellectual momentum, has named LAWRENCE WESCHLER, a staff writer for The New Yorker and the author of 10 books, as its new director. The institute was founded 25 years ago by a group of intellectuals, including Susan Sontag and Joseph Brodsky, and was intended to be a forum for discussion that linked the university with the city's intellectual, cultural and artistic life. It has about 120 members. Mr. Weschler replaces LEONARD BARKAN, who began leading the institute in 1997.

International Affairs
The New School, the adult-education division of the New School University, has created a graduate program in international affairs and named MICHAEL A. COHEN, a former World Bank official and expert on urban policy in developing countries, as director. Dr. Cohen said the program was intended to train practitioners rather than theoreticians. In the fall, he will teach a course on financial bailouts, looking at the experiences of Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Turkey and Indonesia.

Immigrant Scholarships
To encourage more immigrant children to think of attending small liberal arts colleges, Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., will begin offering 20 full-tuition scholarships a year to immigrants and children of immigrants. LEON BOTSTEIN, the president of Bard, said that immigrants tend to prefer large universities like the ones in their native countries and to focus on fields like science, technology and business because they believe careers in those fields will yield the greatest payoff.

Harlem Robot Is Tested
Cross a moving bridge, pick up a large ball and place it on top of an eight-foot structure and drag the structure back across the bridge without dropping the ball. 
That was the challenge faced by robots created by 330 schools across the country at the National First Robotics Competition in Orlando, Fla., last week, and a robot built by 30 students at Rice High School in Harlem, a Roman Catholic school better known for basketball than academics, came in 11th out of 84 schools in its division. In March, the Rice team, helped by engineers from Consolidated Edison, won the New York City regional competition.

Technology Grants Offered
New Visions for Public Schools, a nonprofit education group, is seeking proposals for $1.1 million worth of grants to help New York City schools enhance their use of computers and the Internet. Grants of up to $20,000 will be awarded to 24 public schools over a two-year period, starting in July. New York Life Foundation is awarding the grant money, and New Visions will help choose the winners.

Theater Group Moves
After 14 years at the Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities on West 18th Street, the Irondale Ensemble Project, an experimental theater group, has moved to the Brooklyn High School of the Arts at 345 Dean Street in Brooklyn. TERRY GREISS, Irondale's executive director, as well as an actor in the group, said the company would help students and teachers at the new location "in conceptualizing and implementing their musical theater program." Irondale will also continue producing its own professional plays. ABBY GOODNOUGH, KAREN W. ARENSON, KATHLEEN CARROLL and ALLISON FASS

The Tyranny Of Baseball Contraction

BYLINE:  By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
THIS wild-eyed, bushy-faced guy pounced on me outside the Metrodome the other day. Well, maybe not literally pounced, but with enough fervor to move me back a step.
He was there for Final Four basketball, but his thumping heart was obsessed with baseball.
 "You know this stuff," he said, displaying obvious derangement. "Are they going to have contraction?" 
 The man was old enough to have cheered Harmon Killebrew's home runs in the long Minnesota summer evenings, and he had surely witnessed Kirby Puckett's heroics in the cacophonous dome.
This zealot had his memories. Now there is talk of lopping off his team like a callus from the aching heel of baseball.
Apparently, there is this Darwinian theory that if baseball can just whack a couple of minor-market franchises with lousy facilities, then everything will be all right.
Clearly, somebody has been spending too much time watching "Survivor." 
The most obvious victims of contraction have already been speculated: Minnesota, Montreal, Oakland, Tampa Bay.
All right, you could scuttle the Rays and nobody would notice, but 29 is such an unwieldy number that teams with real history would be jeopardized.
With such dismal plotting going on, it was surely heartwarming to see the Twins and the Expos at the top of their divisions yesterday.
True, it was early in the season, but in baseball, you take your thrills when you can. The Expos beat the Mets vendredi, samedi et dimanche, but this team would be singled out for contraction if only so Vladimir Guerrero could be shunted to a truly deserving franchise (in New York, no doubt.)
Should teams be cannibalized for their spare parts? 
It has happened before. In November 1954, an early version of the Baltimore Bullets was disbanded 13 games into the National Basketball Association season. The players were absorbed, except for four, including a personal-foul specialist named Al McGuire. You could look it up.
But who would even think of contraction in a sport that prizes tradition? Why, it turns out to be none other than Commissioner Bud Selig.
"I will tell you today that the economic situation is so significant, and I would call it pervasive, that I wouldn't take contraction off the table," Selig said recently. "It's one of the options out there that we are considering. No question about it, I have had a change of heart." 
Selig, who has a new stadium for his family-owned Milwaukee Brewers, may be merely trying to shame taxpayers in Minnesota and Montreal into subsidizing a worthy welfare client like baseball to the tune of a new stadium.
That's what commissioners do. Selig may also be threatening the loss of 50 jobs in order to frighten the union, what with the contract ending after this season. However, the Players Association did not reach the A-Rod level of salary madness by being frightened of Bud.
Some form of salary cap and real revenue-sharing would be far too sensible for both sides. Boys will be boys.
Goodness knows, teams have flown the coop. You can't tell me hockey is any better for the trail of tears left by the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets. Baseball hasn't had a team move since the Washington Senators became the Texas Rangers in 1972. Football may have lost the Portsmouth Spartans after 1933, but it maintained the Green Bay Packers, courtesy of television revenue-sharing. The N.B.A. is bulging with losers, but turnaround is only one good draft pick away, breeding a form of optimism.
Losing teams should be unavoidably spontaneous, which could happen in the wake of all our dot-com geniuses and their bizarre little Ponzi schemes that made them so celebrated and rich for 15 minutes.
Sponsors and fan support could fade in this shaky economy, but baseball's first obligation should be to preserve a facade of calm.
However, instead of talking contraction, baseball could adopt relegation, like the European soccer system, which has sent historic teams like Fiorentina and Napoli to Italy's Serie B after losing seasons. 
Come to think of it, baseball should relegate on a sliding scale, linking performance to salaries. The Baltimore ownership is said to favor contraction. Fine. Under my plan, the Orioles would be in Class AAA right now -- and so would the Dodgers. That might shake them out of their dysfunctional doldrums, but would not terminate them outright.
Contraction is a ghastly signal for baseball fans like my wild-eyed friend out on the steppes of Minnesota. First-place Minnesota, that is.

HEADLINE: U.N. Report Says U.S. Slowdown Is Damaging Other Economies 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 10 

 BODY:
The American slowdown is damaging many other economies around the world, forecasters from more than 60 countries said in a report today. 
 Particularly vulnerable are Asian nations with high-technology industries that had just begun to recover from the 1997 regional crash. Mexico and Canada, however, are also paying the price of being closely linked to the United States in trade and investment, the experts said. 
 The report describes the spreading downturn as "an intended one, at least in its early stage, engineered by policy makers, in the first instance in the United States." The Federal Reserve's aim was to "put on the brakes" to head off inflation, said Lawrence R. Klein, professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania and leader of the forecasters' group.
"It looks as though they did it too hard and too long," said Mr. Klein, a Nobel laureate in economics who was an economic adviser to Jimmy Carter. He was speaking at a news conference here today.
Dozens of economists from around the world, meeting here this week, meshed findings from 79 national and economic models to arrive at global predictions. They said world economic growth is expected to slow this year to 2.4 percent from 4 percent in 2002.
Growth in the industrial market economies will slow, the experts said, especially in Japan, which can not be counted on for economic stimulus when other big economies lag. "One would have hoped that we would get some strength from the No. 2 economy in the world in terms of size of production, but Japan has a longstanding recessionary problem," Mr. Klein said. "The help is not coming there."
In the developing countries, already beset by rapid population growth, epidemic diseases and often weak economic bases, output growth is expected to decline to 4.4 percent from 5.7 percent last year. In the "economies in transition" from government control to a free market -- mostly former Communist nations -- the growth rate of 5.9 percent achieved in 2000 is "unsustainable," the report says. The rate will drop to 3.6 percent this year, it predicts.
Only countries rich in oil and gas can avoid serious problems, the experts said. They include Russia, the Middle Eastern petroleum exporters and some African and Latin American nations. 
The report, the latest Global Economic Outlook, was prepared by economic experts working through Project Link, a joint program of the United Nations department of economic and social affairs, led by Josef M. van Brabant, chief of the economic assessment and outlook branch, and a research center at the University of Toronto headed by Peter H. Pauly, dean of the university's Rotman School of Management.
At the news conference, Mr. Pauly echoed Mr. Klein's concern about the loss of Japan as a compensating factor, and expressed concerns about disappointing trends for Europe.
"The European performance, while solid, is not apparently sufficient to counteract the effect of the U.S. slowdown on the world economy," he said, urging what he called decisive monetary policy in both the United States and Western Europe and fundamental structural change in Japan to prevent a longterm slide in growth.
One of the report's central findings is that the expansion of international trade is expected to reverse sharply, falling to 6 percent from the 12 percent recorded last year. That frequently reflects loss of trade with the United States, the experts said.

To the Editor:
Re "China's Costly Rigidity" (editorial, April 9):
 The incident involving the United States spy plane and the detention of its crew serves for nothing more than stirring up the nationalist fervor of a people so that they will be distracted from the real source of China's problems: its corrupt ruling clique. 
 Beset from within by failures in its economy, growing discontent at its suppression of basic civil and religious rights and greater and more vocal international support for the people of Tibet and East Turkestan, China's Communist regime is, after more than 50 years, coming to the end of its life.
This standoff is about a regime desperately trying to create conditions for its survival.

HEADLINE: Phoenix Counts Its Many Challenges 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, April 6 

 BODY:
Benito's small backyard has become his workshop, a dirt square filled with cars to repair and parts to fix them. As he takes an afternoon cigarette break, his wife, Carmen, tends to clothes hanging out to dry. Their barefoot 3-year-old daughter, Fernanda, wanders about.
 This is their life here, a tattered two-bedroom home and a thriving business in a poor section southwest of downtown Phoenix. Inside a house across the street, a man is selling crack to walk-in customers. A few blocks away, prostitutes troll Van Buren Street. 
 "In 10 years, maybe Beverly Hills," Benito said wistfully, insisting that this was better than life was in Mexico before he sneaked across the border three years ago. He remains an illegal immigrant, which is why he would not give his surname. 
In record numbers, people like Benito are moving to the American Southwest. Here in Maricopa County, which is larger in area than each of seven states, new census figures show that from 1990 to 2000, the Hispanic population swelled by 108 percent, a rate fueled by a rising flow of illegal immigration as well as higher-than-average birth rates and migration from other states. The county now has 3.07 million people, of whom 763,000 are Hispanic. 
Officials estimate that a third of the 1.3 million Hispanics now living in Arizona, roughly 400,000 people, entered the country illegally. Five years ago, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the number was just 115,000.
The new illegal workers have helped sustain the state's buoyant economy, and economists and demographers acknowledge that without them, that economy and those of many other states could not have grown so fast.
At the same time, their growing numbers -- and their work in a shadow economy that earns them cash income on which they pay no taxes -- have exerted pressures on county agencies. Many schools, hospitals and libraries are struggling to accommodate rising need. 
"It has been a real challenge," said Luis Ibarra, president and chief executive of Friendly House, a community service agency in Phoenix. "All of a sudden agencies are not adequately staffed to deal with the demands of the population they are serving."
Of the four states bordering Mexico, Arizona had the greatest Hispanic population increase, in percentage terms, during the decade: 76.7 percent, compared with 46.1 percent for Texas, 33.4 percent for California and 23.5 percent for New Mexico.
Phoenix has become an especially strong magnet. The local economy remained particularly vibrant through the 1990's, and legal and illegal migrants alike say they were warned before arriving that Los Angeles and other larger cities had grown too expensive and the competition for jobs there too intense. 
"Here," said Ruben Marquez, a legal resident from Colombia who manages a shop selling medicinal herbs, "it's easier to live, and there are greater opportunities to work."
One result has been a regeneration of whole new communities, where rusting manufacturing plants along thoroughfares like McDowell Street and Van Buren are giving way to bustling strip malls. In another measure of change, nine radio stations now broadcast in Spanish, compared with three in 1990.
Hispanics now account for two-thirds of all those attending the city's 13 public high schools, compared with 42.7 percent a decade ago. Two-thirds of the children in the county's Head Start program are Hispanic.
At city and county libraries, officials cannot keep up with the demand for materials in Spanish. Toni Garvey, the city librarian, said her annual budget for Spanish reading and listening material and for Spanish-speaking personnel had increased fivefold, to $250,000, since 1996. Still, she said, "I can't hire Spanish speakers fast enough."
The rising numbers have also strained the county health system, the safety net for uninsured and under-insured residents. Since 1997, the county hospital in Phoenix has required new employees to speak Spanish and has more than tripled, to 10, the number of translators who help doctors talk to their patients. And, said Paul Strauss, vice president for planning and development, the value of uncompensated care to illegal immigrants and other uninsured county residents has been steadily rising, reaching $49 million last year. 
Francisca Montoya, executive director of Stardust House, a center that helps Hispanic families, said many of those newly arrived, fearing immigration officials, were reluctant to obtain municipal services. So, she said, doctors who volunteer at free clinics in neighborhood churches sometimes see as many as 1,500 people a day.
Several new immigrants interviewed here through a translator said their illegal status and a language barrier had left them feeling isolated and often preyed upon, though some were not reluctant to give a full name. 
Pedro Marin, who works for a pool cleaning company, said he hurt his left hand when he worked for a lumber yard last year and yet was told by a doctor to whom his boss sent him that he should go back to work the next day. Mr. Marin said he agreed to work the next two weeks, using only his right hand "because I needed the job." Then, he said, he was dismissed.
"If I was an Anglo," he said, "maybe this doesn't happen."
Damian Guadalupe, a construction worker, saw the difference this way: "If I had papers, I could make $10, $12, maybe $14 an hour. I make $6 or $7, and it's always, 'Hurry up, hurry up.' "
Many illegal immigrants said they were reluctant even to call 911 when they needed help. A friend of Benito said they were afraid that the police would arrive with immigration agents.
"That's why they are still selling crack over there," he said, pointing to the house across from Benito's. "Nobody around here complains."
Still the immigrants come in waves that include people like Maria Camacho, who was a lawyer in Mexico, and Luis Mario Moreno Gomez, who was a dentist in El Salvador. They are attending a class in English, though they know that as illegal immigrants, they will need years to have a chance for legal status. 
Those without legal status have found hope in recent talks between the United States and Mexico about a guest-worker program that would allow Mexicans to register as they cross the border to fill jobs that keep the American economy churning. 
But even if the talks fail and the American economy sputters, government officials and community leaders here say, the flow northward will continue, easing only when wages and living standards in Mexico and other Latin American countries improve.
"There has always been a pattern of economic migration," said Margie Emmermann, Gov. Jane Dee Hull's policy adviser for Mexico and liaison to the Hispanic community. "The only way this is going to slow down is with economic development in their home countries. Meanwhile, there is at least now dialogue at a high enough level for gradual change that would accommodate these things."

HEADLINE: At Title-Happy Companies, It's a Chief Per Bottle Washer 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Time was, being the chief executive meant one thing: you were the boss, the first among unequals, the person who stopped the buck; you were the "capo di capi," in the words of Geoff Unwin, global chief executive of Cap Gemini Ernst & Young.
 Now, many large companies have several chief executives -- one for each division, perhaps, or maybe one for each continent. 
 Cap Gemini, a consulting firm, actually has not one, not two, but nine chief executives.
Bertelsmann, the German media company that owns, among other things, the Random House publishing company, recently hired Joel Klein, the Clinton administration's chief antitrust lawyer, as one of the 8 to 10 chief executives Bertelsmann says it has in the United States alone. And just last month, Boeing announced that it would create three new chief executive positions as it moves from its longtime headquarters in Seattle. 
Titles apparently come cheap.
The tight labor market of recent years, corporate growth, mergers and acquisitions and the need to retain senior executives have led to more and more cases of so-called title inflation, executive recruiters and compensation advisers say. In decades past, a vice president or perhaps a president might have run a division of a big company; now it is a chief executive -- who actually reports to a superior chief executive.
"The title has really come a long way, certainly in the last 20 to 30 years," said Jay W. Lorsch, who teaches corporate governance at the Harvard Business School.
Today, he said, " 'chief executive' is immensely popular."
Among the reasons for the phenomenon, headhunters say, are ego and thrift. In a tight labor market, companies can make employees feel more important -- and so discourage them from defecting -- by nominally promoting them.
"If you run a company and you need to stroke somebody, you give them a title," said Peter Crist of Korn/Ferry, an executive search firm. "You can call someone anything you want -- C.E.O., C.O.O., vice chair. That's title inflation." 
High-powered titles are not only proliferating at the very top, said Mr. Crist, whose own title is vice chairman. With the rising numbers of baby boomers swelling management ranks -- even as more organizations adopt a flatter, less hierarchical structure -- only a comparative few can actually run the business. As a result, many companies are giving these people titles that make it sound as if they are in control. 
The bigger titles also impress clients, said Brian M. Sullivan, managing partner of the global financial services practice at Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search firm. 
"There's nothing like a client thinking that they're dealing with a vice chairman," Mr. Sullivan said. "There may be 25 vice chairmen, but the client doesn't know that."
The movement is also driven by corporate mergers. People who are used to running companies do not want to accept an apparent demotion -- even if they will tolerate an actual one when they are subsumed by a larger company -- and it makes more sense to give rank-sensitive former chief executives a big title than to make up for the shift solely with money and perquisites, Mr. Crist said.
Given these trends, the result is that a hefty title does not necessarily mean that its holder has supreme corporate power. Mr. Klein is assuming a position created especially for him, as the chief executive of a subsidiary of Bertelsmann, not of the German parent company. (A Bertelsmann executive said that determining the precise number of chief executives within the company's assorted divisions and subsidiaries is difficult because of its complex structure.)
Similarly, there is no question within Cap Gemini who is boss. "We have regional C.E.O.'s who report in to the chief operating officer, and then you have a global C.E.O., which is yours truly," Mr. Unwin said. The company has had that structure for several years, he added.
General Electric also has separate operating units, organized around products, like engines. The heads of G.E.'s overseas businesses have been called chief executives for more than 15 years, so that they can deal with business leaders in other countries on an equal footing. But the leaders of domestic business units were given the title of president and chief executive of their operations more recently, starting in 1992, according to Louise Binns, a spokeswoman for G.E.
"Each of them is running a significant business in its own right," Ms. Binns said. Analysts say that the increasing size of companies' divisions makes them more like stand-alone companies. That is why, they say, the job of running them can more appropriately be described as that of a chief executive.
Boeing made a similar move when it announced that it was promoting the leaders of its three main operating units by giving them the titles of president and chief executive. They were already in charge of their divisions but will now have slightly greater autonomy, said Larry McCracken, a Boeing spokesman.
"It gives them a little more freedom and flexibility," Mr. McCracken said. "With that title, they get greater leeway in setting their business strategies." They will continue to report to Philip M. Condit, Boeing's overall chief executive.
These situations, where the distribution of power is clear even if the distribution of titles is a little loose, is quite different from those of co-chief executives who try to share power. Those power-sharing arrangements rarely work for long, as shown when Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed both briefly held that title after Citicorp merged with the Travelers Group to form Citigroup. 
Mr. Weill and Mr. Reed clashed almost from the first days of the merger, and the arrival of a former Treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin -- someone who is certainly considered capable of running a company on his own -- further complicated the dynamic at the top of the company. Ultimately Mr. Weill -- formerly the Travelers chief executive -- took over, Mr. Reed retired, and Mr. Rubin is a member of the board and retains the awkward titles of chairman of the executive committee and member of the office of the chairman. Citigroup has five other chief executives serving under Mr. Weill.
Co-chief executives are a "dysfunctional business model," Mr. Crist said. At the helm of companies whose management has been widely lauded, like General Electric and Cisco Systems, he said, one person holds the wheel. "Look at the companies that have done well over time, and you find the benevolent dictator, the one person," whatever the proliferation of titles.
Several companies were reluctant to discuss why they had multiple chief executives under one roof. Among the few that would, most noted that their structures had not changed much in recent years.
For example, the News Corporation, a holding company that is the parent of media companies like Fox Television, has eight chief executives under the top chief executive, Rupert Murdoch. "There have always been C.E.O.'s," a company official said. "We're a diversified, international media company with lots of different lines of business, operating across a lot of different geographic boundaries, so it's natural that we're going to have separate operational structures."
In that case, the multiple titles probably make sense, argues Chris Dixon, an analyst who follows the News Corporation for PaineWebber. Like G.E.'s businesses, the News Corporation subsidiaries are very large.
Mr. Crist cited another reason for title inflation: executives in other countries need titles of sufficient grandeur to appear on an equal footing with local clients and the heads of local businesses.
"You must be a managing director in Germany to have any impact," he said. Changing a title may seem trivial, but in some cases it matters to people other than the holder.
Yet somehow Microsoft, one of the most valuable companies in the world, has only one chief executive -- and it is not Bill Gates.
Mr. Gates is now the chief software architect; the chief executive is Steven A. Ballmer.

HEADLINE: China's Generals 

 BODY:
The unyielding insistence on an American apology in the spy plane affair provides a revealing and disturbing picture of high-level decision-making in Beijing. China's actions betray not only a profound misreading of American politics, which might be understandable, but also a heavy reliance on the advice of Chinese military commanders, exactly the wrong group to shape the handling of this unfortunate incident. Despite yesterday's formal statement of regret by President Bush, the influence of the military leadership could delay a speedy resolution of the affair and distort the future course of relations between the United States and China. 
 The deliberations of China's leaders remain shielded from view at home and abroad, but the events since the midair collision of an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet 10 days ago offer important clues about the formulation of Beijing's response. The stamp of an assertive military seems evident in the rush to assign blame for the collision before the facts are established, the detention of the 24 American crew members and the stubborn effort to extract an apology from Washington when a reasonable diplomatic resolution is within reach. 
 Identifying a clear fault line between political and military leaders in Beijing in this case is impossible, and President Jiang Zemin has himself called for an apology. But China's military commanders in recent years have displayed a more distrustful and even hostile attitude toward the United States than the civilian leadership. 
In the current crisis, top military leaders may have found ready allies in the heads of the internal security agencies and some of the more ideologically conservative civilian party leaders. Public opinion, so far as it can be accurately measured in a totalitarian country, has also taken a strongly nationalist and anti-American tack. 
Defense officials and army newspapers have been uncompromising in their denunciations of Washington and their demands for an American apology. They have also insisted on an end to American reconnaissance flights near China's coasts. Military commanders may have sought to prolong the stalemate to allow time to dismantle and study the sophisticated American spy plane. That now appears to have been accomplished. But some military leaders want to go further, arguing that Washington's statements of regret for the loss of the Chinese airman have been insufficient.
Recent Chinese Communist history has left Beijing's military commanders as powerful political actors. Military leaders helped rescue China from the political and economic chaos of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960's. In 1989 they were called in again to help crush the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. Partly as a result, the military has remained a significant political force. 
Mr. Jiang, his top diplomat, Qian Qichen, both now traveling in Latin America, and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji all understand that a prolonged impasse with Washington would hinder China's prospects for trade and economic development. Mr. Jiang said yesterday that the two sides needed to "find an adequate solution to this problem." Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, told CNN this week that on a visit to China just days before the midair collision he found the top political leaders eager to improve relations with the United States. Those aspirations can be realized if this dispute is quickly brought to a fair conclusion. That is a job for China's diplomats, not its generals.

HEADLINE: Standoff Brings Calls to Boycott Chinese Goods 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
Kmart has received thousands of calls and e-mail messages from customers urging the discount retailer to stop buying so many of its shoes, fishing rods, T-shirts and stereos from China, prompting the company to warn Chinese diplomats that it will seek new suppliers unless the crew of an American surveillance aircraft is released promptly, company executives said today.
 The complaints that have streamed into Kmart's customer service line in Troy, Mich., in recent days were an unprecedented and apparently spontaneous response to the overseas crisis, the executives said. Store managers have also telephoned headquarters to relay concerns that customers were annoyed that the stores stocked so many "made in China" goods when American military personnel were being held in that country against their will, they said. 
 "Our customers are telling us to quit doing business in China -- that they're not going to buy things made there anymore," said Dale Apley, vice president for public policy. "These are just the people taking time out of their schedule to contact us. How many other people out there are thinking the same thing?" 
The outpouring of anger may indicate that the continuing standoff may have started to shake one of the foundations of the United States-China relationship: the partnership of trade and investment that has grown rapidly despite regular disruptions in bilateral ties during the last decade and a half.
Unlike China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in 1989 or its efforts to intimidate Taiwan by lobbing missiles off that island's coast five years ago, the current impasse directly affects United States military personnel. Business leaders said that made this crisis uniquely sensitive because the public put the safety of the crew above abstract notions of geopolitical stability or human rights for Chinese citizens. 
Like Wal-Mart, Target and other discount leaders, Kmart sells billions of dollars of Chinese-manufactured consumer goods each year. Total trade volumes have soared, and often, from month to month, the United States trade deficit with China tops the one with Japan. The most recent Commerce Department statistics showed that the United States trade deficit with China increased 19.3 percent in January, rising to $7.2 billion, while the deficit with Japan narrowed slightly, to $5.9 billion, the lowest in 13 months. 
Mr. Apley said Kmart had no plans to pull Chinese goods off its shelves and would like to continue to do business with factories there. But he said the customer response had prompted executives to put Chinese business contacts on notice that Kmart would have no choice but to "diversify its suppliers" unless the matter was resolved quickly. 
At Target Stores, based in Minneapolis, Patty Morris, a spokeswoman, said the company had decided not to answer media questions about customer complaints or product sourcing policies. She said that the company might have received a few calls related to the China standoff, but that the volume "was not alarming to us and does not warrant getting involved in the dialogue." 
Most corporate executives who have worked for years to cultivate cordial ties with Chinese officials are reluctant to say anything about the crisis in public, hoping that a low-key approach will encourage a speedy resolution that leaves few scars. United States companies accounted for almost half of the $40 billion in foreign investment in China last year, and many of the largest -- Boeing, Motorola and General Motors -- have declined comment or said talks should be left to diplomats.
But some business leaders in Washington share Kmart's alarm. Lobbyists here say they worry that the detention of the crew will make it hard to hold back a tide of anti-China sentiment. "We have been the most vocal advocates of open and expanded trade with China," said Thomas Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. "But we are going to support these young men and women being held over there. If this goes on much longer, the economic advances are going to be hard to sustain."
The crisis is so sensitive that some Chinese-American business leaders have expressed rare public opposition to China's diplomatic behavior.
Susan Au Allen, head of the United States Pan-Asian Chamber of Commerce, a group of Asian-American business executives, said she wrote a letter to the Chinese Embassy today saying her group had decided to cancel a May meeting on investment opportunities with Chinese trade officials in Washington.
"There is a glaring difference between this crisis and all the other issues with China because they are holding Americans against their will," said Ms. Allen, who was born in Guangzhou. "China does not need any more excuses. They have to grow up and act like big boys."
Unlike the fight in Congress last year over whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations, when the battle resonated only lightly outside the capital, the current standoff appears to have set off a grass-roots response that could affect the way Washington reacts.
Recent polls have found that a majority of people consider the military detainees to be hostages, though the Bush administration has not used that term. The polls also show that a majority do not want the administration to apologize for the incident.
Mr. Apley of Kmart said the company at first suspected that the volume of complaints indicated that an anti-China group had begun an organized campaign, but company officials found no evidence of that.
Still, some unions that have opposed expanding trade ties with China are using this as an opportunity to drive home their message. 
The United Association of Union Plumbers, Pipefitters and Sprinkler Fitters has devoted $500,000 to buy radio advertisements during baseball games around the country urging a boycott. "The crew of an American plane, forced to make an emergency landing in China, is held hostage by the Chinese government," the commercial says. "Think about that. And vow to buy no Chinese products until the servicemen and women are released."

HEADLINE: Prudential Sues A.I.G. on Merger Meddling 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 10 

 BODY:
Beginning a counterattack in the battle for the American General Corporation, the British insurer Prudential P.L.C. sued American International Group today, seeking to halt negotiations between the two American companies.
 American International Group, meanwhile, said today that it had signed a confidentiality agreement with American General and had begun discussions on a $23 billion takeover. 
 Prudential's suit, filed in state district court in Harris County, Tex., where American General is based, says that A.I.G. violated United States securities law and that it made "false and misleading statements" in offering a competing bid for American General last week, after Prudential had signed an agreement to merge with the company. The American General board voted Monday night to begin negotiations with A.I.G., which is based in New York. 
"Other companies are free to make a bid," said Victor Lewkow, a lawyer with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in New York, which is litigating the case for Prudential. "But our point is you have to play by the rules."
A.I.G. declined to comment.
American General shares rose 63 cents, to $42.75, on the New York Stock Exchange, while A.I.G. rose 90 cents, to $77.08. In London, Prudential shares slipped 12 pence, to 775 pence ($11.14). Prudential has no ties to the Prudential Insurance Company of America.
Several analysts and legal experts characterized the suit as more spitfire than heavy artillery since Prudential said last week that it would not increase its bid for American General. That bid is now worth $40.70 a share, less than A.I.G.'s offer of $41.60 a share.
"Prudential needs to show they are making a vigorous defense of their merger," said Roman Cizdyn, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in London. "But I don't think it's a goer."
In making its claims, Prudential is not without precedent. In a landmark 1987 case, a Texas jury ordered Texaco to pay Penzoil $10.5 billion for interfering in Penzoil's plans to merge with Getty Oil. Though the remuneration was reduced to $3 billion, the judgment eventually forced Texaco to file for bankruptcy. The Texas courts have since refined the notion of "tortious interference," an ambiguous concept that generally means wrongful meddling and was Penzoil's chief legal argument against Texaco. A Texas Supreme Court ruling last month in Wal-Mart v. Sturges now requires plaintiffs to prove that a third party, in addition to meddling, has broken the law in its attempt to gate-crash.
"You can no longer automatically associate Texas with a verdict like Texaco v. Penzoil," said Henry Hu, a corporate law professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin. "The Wal-Mart case introduces a burden on plaintiffs that wasn't there before."
Prudential, which seeks both undisclosed financial damages and a restraining order against A.I.G., says it meets those new requirements, contending that in failing to file certain documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, like a transcript of a conference call with analysts, A.I.G. broke the law. A preliminary hearing is scheduled next Tuesday.
Regardless of the merits of the case, most legal experts say the suit will make little difference beyond insuring that Prudential pockets its $600 million in breakup fees. "The market forces and economics will dictate who ends up owning American General," said John Cambria, co-chairman of litigation for the international law firm Salans. "This lawsuit is very unlikely to affect the outcome." 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 16, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about bids for American General, the life insurance company, misstated the value of an offer from American International Group. Based on its recent stock price, A.I.G.'s offer is worth about $46 a share, not $41.60.

HEADLINE: Motorola Reports Weakness In the Growth of Its Orders 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Investors hoping that the slumping economy is about to turn the corner did not get any encouragement from Motorola, which reported late yesterday that order growth had weakened across all sectors of the company in the first quarter. Motorola said it lost $206 million, or 9 cents a share, excluding special charges, in the three-month period.
 Motorola shares had risen $1.50, to $13 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange before the earnings were released in anticipation that the company would at least meet Wall Street's expectations of a loss no worse than 8 cents a share. 
 Revenues also came in lower than Wall Street expected at $7.75 billion, down 11 percent from the $8.75 billion Motorola reported in the quarter a year ago. In after-hours trading, the stock retreated 7.3 percent, to $12.05. 
Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., has historically been a bellwether stock because its telecommunications products and electronic components are used in so many industries and it is among the first large companies to report each quarter. In addition, weaknesses at Motorola have turned out to be early warnings of broader problems in several technology sectors in recent quarters.
"We see a continuing downturn in the U.S. economy beginning to spill over to the rest of the world," Christopher B. Galvin, Motorola's chairman and chief executive, said.
Analysts said last night that it would be difficult to assess the full effect of yesterday's report until Motorola's conference call, scheduled for this morning.
"The question is whether they will say anything to alter our overall impression that there is no visibility going forward and that business is bad," said Barbara G. Marcin, manager of the Gabelli Blue Chip Value Fund, a mutual fund with 110,000 Motorola shares.
Motorola's biggest unit, its cellular phone business, had sales of $2.3 billion, down 29 percent from a year ago. New orders were $2.8 billion, a milder drop of 10 percent, offering a faint hope that the worst was over, some analysts said. But the business lost $402 million, in contrast to a $53 million operating profit in the first quarter of 2000.
Semiconductors were the other hard-hit segment, with sales off 22 percent from last year, to $1.5 billion, and new orders plunging 47 percent, to $1.1 billion. The $131 million operating loss for the business was in contrast to an operating profit of $128 million in the period a year ago.
Motorola's phone network equipment business also suffered declining sales and orders, but it managed to stay profitable with earnings of $54 million. The radio systems segment managed to book increased sales and orders, but profits fell to $56 million from $96 million a year ago as more of the business was in low-margin products and services.
The smallest unit, broadband communications, was the only group to report increases in sales, orders and profits, but the growth was well below some analysts expectations.
Motorola had earned $481 million, or 21 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2000. The recent three months were the first quarter since 1985 that Motorola had lost money on operations.
The report would have been even bleaker if Motorola had not switched to a new accounting method widely used to dress up technology company earnings. For the first time, Motorola is joining the technology industry trend of issuing its earnings on a "pro forma" basis. The new accounting approach allows Motorola to exclude charges related to the difference between the book value of acquired companies and the higher price Motorola paid for them. If Motorola had stayed with its traditional accounting system, it would have reported a loss of $533 million, or 24 cents a share, for the quarter.
The bad news was scarcely a surprise. Motorola had warned Wall Street in February that the quarter was unfolding in disappointing fashion, with both the cellular phone business and semiconductor operations posting poorer-than-expected results.
Robert L. Growney, president and chief operating officer, said at the time that Motorola's problems were also afflicting its rivals and that the company was not losing market share, a claim that many analysts disagree with.
Motorola was once the clear leader in the cellular phone market but it was late to make the transition from analog to digital phones and subsequently bet too heavily on expensive, full-featured phones at a time when consumers wanted cheaper models. Nokia grabbed the market lead in the late 1990's and, by most analysts' reckoning, has been widening its advantage ever since.
Some analysts had projected otherwise a year ago when Motorola reported strong earnings growth as worldwide demand for cellular products surged. They said that the company had hot new products and had finally become a savvy enough marketer to fight back effectively.
"But they had execution problems," said Brian T. Modoff, who follows the company from San Francisco for Deutsche Banc Alex Brown. "The question is still, 'Can they get the phones into the market?' "
The weakness in the cellular phone business hurts Motorola twice since the phone units are major customers of the company's semiconductor group.
Concerns about Motorola reached a new peak late last week on reports that business had weakened to the point that the company faced a liquidity squeeze. After shares tumbled to a 52-week low of $10.50 on Friday, Motorola responded by strongly denying that any such crisis was in the offing. As of that day, Motorola said, it had more than $4.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term debts of $3.1 billion.
Mr. Growney stressed in releasing the financial results today that the company had increased its cash reserves during the quarter through a combination of revenues from operations and asset sales.
The company also stressed that it had been taking a number of steps to bolster its cash reserves, including cutbacks in capital spending and work force reductions. Since December, Motorola has announced a series of cutbacks and sales of operations that are set to eliminate 22,000 positions from a global work force of 147,000.

HEADLINE: Moody's Earnings to Beat Estimates 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The bond-rating agency and financial firm Moody's Corporation said yesterday that it expected first-quarter earnings to exceed analysts' consensus estimates, driven by revenue growth in all its business lines and recent cuts in interest rates.
 Moody's, which also announced a management shakeout and whose investor unit admitted guilt in an obstruction of justice case, said it expected earnings per share for the quarter to top analysts' estimates of 24 cents a share. 
 Moody's -- whose investor service unit yesterday admitted guilt to a criminal charge arising from the destruction of documents in a 1996 antitrust inquiry -- said it expected first-quarter revenue to be 25 to 30 percent higher from a year ago. 
The president and chief executive of Moody's, John Rutherfurd Jr., told investors in a conference call the company had agreed to pay a fine of $195,000 to settle the case with the Justice Department and described the incident as "isolated."
A Moody's employee had destroyed documents related to a civil subpoena issued by the Justice Department in connection with its investigation of suspected anticompetitive practices in the bond rating services industry in 1996.
"This settlement is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders," Mr. Rutherfurd said.
He said the matter did not relate to Moody's credit ratings, analyses, risk management or any other services the company markets to customers throughout the world.
The New York-based company expected diluted earnings per share in the range of 29 to 30 cents and pro forma diluted earnings per share in the range of 28 to 29 cents.
In the quarter to March 31, 2000, Moody's had posted diluted earnings per share of 22 cents and pro forma diluted earnings per share of 20 cents.
Mr. Rutherfurd added that Moody's did not expect any regulatory action from regulatory authorities that could affect the company's business after the case. The Department of Justice's antitrust unit rested its investigation in 1999 without taking any legal action.
Mr. Rutherfurd also said he would assume responsibility of Moody's global corporate finance business and the U.S. public finance business after the resignation of three senior executives, effective May 15.
Those who resigned were Donald Noe, senior vice president global ratings and research; Kenneth Pinkes, senior vice president and credit officer; and Douglas Watson, group managing director public finance.
Mr. Rutherfurd said none of the three had been involved in the destruction of documents case.
But he added that "issues arose regarding the timeliness of the executives' reporting of information relating to the conduct by another employee underlying the government's charges."
Moody's is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on April 18. Its shares closed up 87 cents, or 3.09 percent, at $29.05.

HEADLINE: A Step Backward on Nuclear Cooperation 

BYLINE:  By Michael McFaul; Michael McFaul is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an assistant professor at Stanford University.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
President Bush and his new foreign policy team have announced that they plan to undertake a full review of all aspects of American policy toward Russia on matters like economic assistance, NATO expansion and missile defense. There must be a new agenda, we are told, because the old approach of cooperation and engagement pursued by the Clinton administration has been ineffective. In hinting at the tone of their new policy, Bush administration officials have promised a realist approach, which would presumably include greater attention to Russia's international conduct and less to reforms within Russia.
 Reviews are necessary and rethinking of policies prudent. But why, before the review is completed, has the administration already announced plans to cut cooperative nonproliferation programs between the United States and Russia? Perhaps, after a thorough reassessment, the Bush team could make the case that the cooperative programs that we now sponsor in Russia and other former Soviet republics do not serve American national security interests. Until such a case can be made, however, the proposal to cut these programs by $100 million, or more than 10 percent, from current financing levels is bad policy and worse as symbolism. True realism on the part of the Bush foreign policy team would mean increasing, not decreasing, the size of these efforts. 
 Even two decades ago, it would have been unthinkable for Country A to pay Country B to destroy its weapons. But that is precisely what American-Russian nonproliferation programs have achieved in the past several years. With the end of the cold war, Russian leaders -- committed to greater cooperation with the West -- allowed the United States to pursue our national security interests by new, nontraditional means. In 1991, the idea that we could pay the Russians to deactivate nuclear delivery systems, enhance the storage and security of nuclear materials and keep their nuclear scientists employed was radical. It showed real leadership that George H. W. Bush, who was then the president, embraced this new approach as part of a national security strategy. 
A decade later, cooperative threat reduction is widely accepted. A bipartisan review commission headed by former Senator Howard Baker fully endorses the idea, and Democrats and Republicans vote year after year to finance these programs. And President Vladimir Putin and the Russian army continue to participate willingly in them. Indeed, Mr. Putin's recent firing of the conservative head of the Ministry of Atomic Energy suggests that he might be prepared to go even further to restructure the Russian nuclear complex.
Promoting nonproliferation programs in Russia, of course, directly benefits American national security. The fewer delivery systems of nuclear weapons there are in Russia, the better; the more securely and safely stored are those nuclear materials, the better. If the Bush administration is prepared to spend tens of billions of dollars on missile defense systems to protect Americans against potential threats in the future, it cannot justify cutting the already modest budget for nonproliferation programs that help diminish a real threat in existence today.
These programs are also crucial to maintaining open channels between the United States and Russia at a time when other opportunities for cooperation are disappearing. Without question, Mr. Putin's negative activities in other areas -- whether stifling the independent press or trading weapons with Iran -- will make it more difficult to have meaningful and positive relations. In fact, cuts in some assistance programs to the Russian state (though not to Russian civil society, as in programs that support the development of an independent press) may be appropriate. But reducing nonproliferation programs as a reaction to objectionable Russian behavior in other areas makes no sense and is contrary to American security interests.
Ten years after the Soviet Union's collapse, it is remarkable that the decaying Russian state has not allowed more weapons of mass destruction out of Russia and that there have not been more accidents with nuclear materials. Yet, these threats to American security must not be underestimated. We should in fact be accelerating aid to dismantle this threat, not reversing course. At a time when there appear to be growing strategic conflicts between the United States and Russia, we cannot afford to undercut the one area where there is agreement and cooperation.

HEADLINE: Bush Seeking To Modify Pact on Trade With Jordan 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
President Bush told King Abdullah II of Jordan today that enacting a free trade agreement between the United States and Jordan was one of the White House's top trade priorities. But he indicated that provisions negotiated by the Clinton administration to safeguard workers' rights and the environment might require readjustment.
 During a meeting in the Oval Office, the two leaders devoted much of their discussion to the swelling violence between the Israelis and Palestinians. A senior administration official said Mr. Bush and King Abdullah had agreed that both sides needed to scale down the cycle of violence. 
 Still, the king was visiting in part to urge the United States to remain involved in Middle East peace negotiations and to convince Israel that a military response would not lead the Palestinians to the negotiating table. 
"I look forward to working with you, sir, and with your administration to try and bring peace and stability to the Middle East," the king told the president.
Jordan, which borders Israel and the West Bank, has a population that is roughly half Palestinian. The country has long played a major role in promoting Middle East peace efforts, and American officials see the trade agreement as an important step in jump-starting the struggling economy of the region.
Trade between the two countries is tiny, in relative terms. The United States sells Jordan less than $300 million in goods each year. But the trade deal reached between Jordan and the Clinton administration, which would eliminate all tariffs on trade, is significant beyond the numbers. 
It is the first American trade initiative that included labor and environmental standards as part of the main text, putting the rights of workers and the duty of companies not to pollute on the same plane with tariffs.
King Abdullah signed the agreement at a White House ceremony last October, as the Clinton administration was coming to a close. During the presidential campaign, Al Gore praised the labor and environmental agreements in the Jordan deal, but Mr. Bush expressed reservations.
It is not without precedent for a new administration to reopen a trade agreement signed by a predecessor.
Mr. Bush's father signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, with Canada and Mexico in the closing weeks of his administration. But his successor, Bill Clinton, pursued side agreements to address concerns of labor unions and environmental groups.
In a meeting much like the one that Mr. Bush held today with King Abdullah, Mr. Clinton reassured President Carlos Salinas of Mexico in 1993 that the United States would pursue Nafta, but only after additional negotiations.
In a brief appearance with reporters today, Mr. Bush did not detail his reservations about the deal reached by Mr. Clinton. But officials indicated that the White House was concerned about the precedent that the labor and environmental agreements might have on future trade agreements. 
The officials said Robert Zoellick, Mr. Bush's trade representative, was pursuing a compromise that he hoped would get the pact through the closely divided House and Senate.
Not everybody believes that the deal struck by Mr. Clinton requires change. "This agreement is good, as is," said Mike Siegel, a spokesman for Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. "There may be some who have expressed concern, but they don't have much traction right now."
In his meeting today, the president reassured the king that he intended to reach a deal. It was the king's father, King Hussein, who died in 1999, who first pressed for more open trade with the United States.
"We look forward to working to get an agreement, one way or the other, out of our Congress, that encourages free trade with Jordan," the president said at the start of the meeting. "We will be discussing strategies as how best to achieve that objective."
In a television interview on Monday night, the king described his country's economic woes as critical. 
"For our country the priority is the economy -- getting, as I've said from day one, food on the table," the king said on PBS. "We have problems with poverty. We have problems with unemployment. If we are going to progress, if we are going to move forward on political reforms and economic reforms, we have to make the economy of paramount importance."

HEADLINE: Freezing Government 

 BODY:
President Bush described the budget he unveiled Monday as a "new way of doing business in Washington" that faithfully reflected the "compassionate conservatism" he espoused during his campaign. The budget was compassionate in one sense. It did not contain the harsh language that earlier Republican administrations and the Newt Gingrich crowd used to describe the federal role. The Bush team has obviously learned the virtues of speaking softly. Basic services will survive and no departments will be eliminated. Yet a careful reading of the fine print does little to dispel the impression that on the whole the budget's conservatism outweighs its compassion, even though there are some surprising cuts in corporate welfare in the form of budget reductions for the Export-Import Bank and for shipbuilding subsidies. But in general this is a business-friendly budget with a lean, carefully targeted approach to spending on social programs. 
 The compassion component comes in the form of increases for a few of Mr. Bush's favorite programs, including education and biomedical research. The White House asserts that over all, the education budget jumped 11 percent, the health budget 5 percent. The education budget would contain modest increases for poor children and for upgrading reading skills. The health budget provides a large boost for the National Institutes of Health, more money for community health centers and a new prescription drug benefit for the elderly. But the $153 billion over 10 years planned for prescription drugs is only about a half to a third of what most experts believe the program will ultimately require. 
 The conservatism of this budget is largely defined by the $1.6 trillion tax cut that lies at its heart -- a cut so large that little money is left over for significant new spending on discretionary social programs. These programs will total $660 billion in the next fiscal year, a rise of only 4 percent compared with an 8.6 percent increase in President Clinton's last budget year. Given inflation, this essentially freezes government at its present level.
The budget is not without some political daring. There were cuts in various farming programs that may make sense in budgetary terms but will not sit well with Midwestern Republicans. There was also a big cut in the transportation budget that may not sit well with Eastern Republicans who favor subsidies for urban mass transit. Yet the biggest and potentially most controversial cuts were in energy, natural resources and the environment.
Environmentalists will detect no compassion in the approach to their issues. A series of budget cuts reflect the administration's hostility to the land conservation programs pursued by the Clinton administration as well as its pro-business attitudes toward environmental and other regulations. They also reflect Mr. Bush's willfully one-sided approach to the nation's energy needs, which relies almost exclusively on drilling for oil and gas while ignoring conservation. Energy Department funds for research into alternative fuel sources and more efficient vehicles would drop by nearly half. Meanwhile, funding for Interior Department programs for oil, gas and coal exploration would increase by nearly 20 percent. Perversely, the budget says that some of the money for alternative-fuel research will be restored by 2004 -- but only with money earned by the government from oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Other environmental programs take comparable hits. Mr. Bush proposes to save $162 million by eliminating one of the Agriculture Department's most useful conservation initiatives, the Wetlands Reserve program. The president made good on his campaign pledge to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation program at $900 million, but the $100 million he promised to spend on saving the world's tropical forests has shrunk to $13 million.
Congress, of course, will have much to say about the ultimate shape of the budget, and votes in the Senate last week have already indicated a desire to devote considerably less to tax reduction and considerably more to social programs. But as a guide to the new administration's core approach -- moderate in tone, conservative in substance -- the new budget is revelatory.

HEADLINE: On-Site Service: Lots of Talk to Get Some Action 

BYLINE:  By CATHERINE GREENMAN 

 BODY:
AS an owner of several Gateway computers, Phil Kirschner had been pleased with the company's technical support. Mr. Kirschner, a New Yorker who does public relations work out of his home, found that when he had problems, they were usually related to software, and that he was able to get the help he needed over the phone. 
 But when he bought a new Gateway Select 950 computer last October and heard what he described as churning and clicking noises the first time he turned it on, he called technical support right away. He had purchased a three-year on-site warranty for $99, so he assumed that someone would come to his house to fix the problem. 
 Instead, Mr. Kirschner spent several hours over five days on the phone with tech support representatives. Each time he called, he said, he was instructed to test and reformat his hard drive and reinstall the drivers. 
"I had to call like eight times," Mr. Kirschner said. "All of the problems I was having were in part related to the hard drive, but they weren't willing to go on site. The tech guy would say, Go to safe mode, do this, do that, but nothing worked."
At one point, Mr. Kirschner held the phone up to the back of the computer so the technician could hear the churning sounds emanating from the hard drive. It was an absurd moment, but it paid off because it persuaded the technician to send someone. Three days later a repair person arrived at Mr. Kirschner's house with a new hard drive. 
But Mr. Kirschner said the process had taken too long. "I felt ripped off in the sense that I paid $99 for a promise of immediate repair," he said, "and I got a long wait and a lot of down time." 
On-site service agreements, which are offered by computer stores and by manufacturers that sell directly to consumers, like Dell, Gateway and Micron, offer peace of mind to computer users who worry about something going wrong. Sold for about $79 and up depending on length (generally from one to five years), the agreements promise that a support technician will come to the customer's home or office by the next business day to fix the problem. 
But even though many consumers get the quick help they need, others, like Mr. Kirschner, say that actually getting a repair person to travel to the computer can be difficult, involving hours on the phone (much of it on hold) and poorly trained technicians. The service delays can extend well beyond the next-business-day promise. 
"Next-business-day, on-site service really isn't that in most instances," said Tim Duffy, a consumer advocate in Los Angeles who publishes consumer information on his Web site (www.timduffy.com). "You have to convince them that you need the part, which can take hours on the phone. And many things, like software -- and in some cases, keyboards, monitors and mice -- are not covered in the on-site agreement at all." For example, Mr. Duffy noted, Hewlett-Packard's on-site agreement covers peripherals like keyboards, while Micron's agreement does not.
For many people, the first hurdle is diagnosing the problem with a technician over the phone. As someone who has logged many hours with technical support representatives on behalf of her clients, Sarah Williams, a computer consultant in Santa Fe, N.M., said the process had gotten much more frustrating in the last year because of what seems to be a lack of experience on the part of technicians.
"Lately, the people I'm talking to seem to be fresh out of school with no experience at all," she said. "I spend an hour going through things they read off of some script before they pass me on to a supervisor." 
PC manufacturers say troubleshooting over the phone is a necessary step in determining whether a technician needs to make a house call. In its agreement for at-home service, Dell says a technician will be dispatched if necessary after troubleshooting is done via phone.
"In order to effect a fix when we do dispatch someone on site, we have to accurately diagnose the problem on the front end," said Dan Allen, Dell's director of client-services marketing for homes and small businesses. "That's got to involve interactions with the customer." 
Jim Hobby, vice president for client care at Gateway, said the diagnostic questions asked over the phone also helped rule out problems with software or peripherals that were not installed on the system when it was sold. "Sometimes customers would like us to support things that should really be supported by another manufacturer," he said. "Often it's like looking for a needle in a haystack, but we're using tools to greatly narrow it down." 
To expedite solutions to computer problems and to reduce the time customers and technicians spend on the phone, computer companies like Gateway, Dell and Micron have designed Web-based programs that let users log on and have their problems diagnosed by the software before they call technical representatives. 
Micron's Connected Support program, for example, which has been available to consumers for the last year and a half, performs an "asset profile" on a system and automatically alerts the user about any driver updates or patches for hardware and software conflicts. Paul Desmond, a product reviews manager at Micron, said the program had reduced the number of calls to Micron's tech support staff.
Dell's Resolution Assistant, which the company started including with all its systems in August 2000, lets customers connect online with a Dell technician who can remotely discern whether the problem is a hardware failure or a conflict between the operating system and software. "Seventy to ninety percent of the time, customers should be able to go online and fix the problem themselves," Mr. Allen said. "It gets them up and running much more quickly than if we dispatched someone to the house." 
In many cases, however, these Internet- and phone-based diagnostic tools succeed only in annoying many customers with on-site agreements. Dave Gill, who worked as a tech support specialist with Gateway for five years, until last September, said he had often fielded complaints about people's expectations for on-site service. "We ran into a lot of situations where a client would call and demand on-site service," he said, "but they didn't want to do any troubleshooting first because sales had said that that's the way it would work." 
Service delays are common when a PC manufacturer hires another company to provide technical support. That was the problem encountered by Noreen Norris, a bookkeeper in San Diego, when her computer's motherboard failed in January. She first worked with Dell over the phone, trying to determine why Windows would not start on her new desktop. Ms. Norris said that Dell then arranged for a technician from BancTec, a local service center, to replace her motherboard, but that he had arrived with the wrong part. Getting the right part took several more days. "Every time I'd call," Ms. Norris said, "the guy at BancTec would complain that they were low on technicians and that they'd have to fly someone in. They'd make appointments and not keep them." 
Mr. Allen, of Dell, said that service delays usually happened because a part was not available. "If your system has a hard drive which is not available in the market, sending an on-site technician is not productive," he said. "That the technician can't come is generally not an issue for us."
Another common misunderstanding among people with on-site service agreements is that if a technician does arrive to fix a hardware problem, it is up to the customer to replace any lost data or files.
"If they repair your hard disk, your data still needs to be restored," said Christopher Muto, an independent computer consultant in New York. "I have had people who have had service calls, and they're sitting there scratching their heads wondering what to do next." 
Complaints about on-site service have surfaced on manufacturers' Web sites and at consumer complaint sites like eComplaints.com. In July 1998, Gateway paid the Federal Trade Commission $290,000 to settle a case after the agency accused Gateway of misrepresenting its refund policy and on-site warranty service in its advertisements. Gateway was prohibited from promising on-site service without disclosing the service's limitations. 
Wayne Harris, director of research investigations at the New York State Consumer Protection Board, said he did not see a lot of complaints about on-site service agreements, which made him think that PC owners were eventually getting the help they needed. "Generally the complaints we get are from consumers who have been promised something that they're not getting," he said. "In this case, they're probably getting the service but having to argue for it on the phone first, so it's probably slower than they thought it would be." 
After waiting nearly three weeks to have her motherboard replaced through her on-site agreement, Ms. Norris said she would buy her next computer from a local dealer so she could pack it up and take it in if something went wrong. "There might be pluses to having on-site warranties," she said, "but you have to have a ton of time on your hands if you want service." 

Service Tips
Before You Call: Things to Know About Guarantees
WHEN you call a manufacturer's technical support department for troubleshooting, ask a few questions to find out how much the person you are talking to knows about computers. 
"You don't want to be talking to someone who's using a book and just looking things up," said Tim Duffy, a consumer advocate in Los Angeles. If you are not satisfied that the person helping you has the necessary expertise, ask to speak with someone else. 
Here are some tips for getting the most out of a service agreement:
* Write down the names of every technician you speak with, as well as the dates and times of each call. Ask for an incident report number before you hang up because that will speed up things the next time you call. 
* If the technician tries to fix the problem over the phone, record the conversation (to insure compliance with any federal or state laws, inform the person that you are doing so). Then you can refer to the tape rather than having to call back if you forget a step.
* Be flexible in the hours you can be present for a technician to make a house call. Jim Hobby, vice president for client care at Gateway, says it is crucial that the person who uses the computer is present. 
* When you first start your computer, leave it on for 72 hours because heat is one of the biggest causes of problems with electronic equipment and you usually have full return privileges if a problem arises this early. 
* Most gold and platinum credit cards will double the warranty offered by a manufacturer for something bought with this kind of card, for a maximum extra coverage period of one year. That makes it more economical to sign up for one year of on-site service for a computer or other gadget and to double the warranty by buying it with a gold or platinum credit card, rather than signing up for two or more years of on-site service.

HEADLINE: Argentina May Peg Peso To Euro as Well as Dollar 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, April 11 

 BODY:
Argentina will overhaul a main pillar of its economic structure, the peg of the peso to the United States dollar, and bring euros into the equation, according to the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo.
 In a speech today in Paris and in several others recently, Mr. Cavallo, the architect of the "currency board" system that has kept the peso equal to $1 since April 1991, has outlined a plan to switch to a half-dollar and half-euro peg in two to three years. Eventually, the Japanese yen may be added as well. 
 "Our economic relations, commercial and financial, with Europe have more relevance each day," Mr. Cavallo said today. "For that reason the incorporation of the euro into our financial system is appropriate."
The exchange rate system is at the heart of a debate over how to revive an economy that has been mired in recession for three years. Some economists say fixed peso-dollar parity locks in high prices and wages and makes exports noncompetitive. Others say scrapping it would ignite inflation and make the national debt, most of it owed in dollars and other foreign currency, ruinously difficult to repay.
Mr. Cavallo proposed shifting away from a dollar-only peg while he was in opposition. But when he was appointed to the cabinet three weeks ago and given extraordinary powers to attack economic problems, he was at pains to say there was no question of abandoning the peg.
Some investors worry that the dollar-euro peg plan is a devaluation in disguise. At present exchange rates, linking the peso in equal parts to the two currencies would reduce its value 5.8 percent, to 94.2 American cents. 
But Mr. Cavallo has said in recent speeches that the peso would not be shifted to a new formula if doing so would devalue it and that the euro would first have to gain value.
"I hope Cavallo isn't holding his breath," said Russell Jones, chief currency strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. 
Mr. Cavallo's push for a mixed dollar-euro peg may be meant to head off a campaign led by a former president, Carlos Saul Menem, in whose cabinet Mr. Cavallo served a decade ago, to scrap the peso entirely and adopt the dollar instead, eliminating all risk of devaluation.
As preliminary steps, Mr. Cavallo's plan calls for allowing Argentines to open euro-denominated bank accounts and carry out financial transactions in euros.

HEADLINE: In a Surprise, Central Bank Sees No Need To Cut Rates 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 11 

 BODY:
In a surprising display of defiance, the European Central Bank declined to reduce interest rates today and suggested that it might not do so any time soon.
 The decision caught many investors and economists by surprise because the central bank was widely expected to reduce rates by at least a quarter-point. It came despite calls for the bank to cut rates to help fend off a global economic downturn. 
 Today's announcement reinforces the solitary position of the European Central Bank as the only major central bank that has not eased monetary policy, and it represents a calculated gamble that Europe's prospects will remain much healthier than those of the United States. 
Even more striking than the decision itself was the tough language in the announcement by the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg. 
Mr. Duisenberg said the consensus was so strong on the bank's central council that members did not bother taking a vote. He also predicted that European inflation would not decline below the bank's target of 2 percent a year for at least another 18 months.
"Upward risks to price stability have diminished, but they have not disappeared," Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference after the bank's board meeting. "The disappearance of medium-term inflation doesn't mean the European Central Bank needs to cut interest rates now."
In declining to nudge economic growth with an injection of easier money, Mr. Duisenberg brushed aside pleas from a range of European economists and political leaders as well as the head of the International Monetary Fund.
Adolf Rosenstock, an economist in London at the investment bank Nomura International, said, "The E.C.B. is taking a big gamble, and the gamble is that they are entirely wrong with respect to their expectations for growth and inflation in the euro area." 
"If they are wrong," Mr. Rosenstock said, "they will be rightly blamed for having missed the opportunity to steer the European economy to safer waters."
Other experts, though also surprised, said the economic climate in Europe was ambiguous enough to justify a hard-line approach.
Phillipe D'Arvisenet, chief economist with BNP Paribas in Paris, said that the 12-nation euro zone was still expanding by more than 2 percent a year, not much below what economists consider the region's long-term potential growth rate. And the most recent inflation data suggested that inflation was still running at 2.6 percent a year.
"Core inflation has been creeping up, gently, but creeping up nonetheless," Mr. D'Arvisenet said today.
Stefan Schneider, an economist with Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt, had been expecting a fairly big reduction in interest rates, to 4.25 percent from 4.75 percent.
"To some extent, they want to avoid the impression that they bowed to external pressure," Mr. Schneider said today. "They want to build a reputation that they are really tough cookies."
Today's decision suggested that hard-liners, led by Mr. Duisenberg and the Bundesbank in Germany, had consolidated their position on the central bank's board.
Three weeks ago, several central bankers surprised investors by hinting at a new and softer economic policy. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France and a member of the central bank board, announced that the bank was much less concerned than before about inflation and more worried about an economic slowdown.
But Mr. Duisenberg and other board members quickly began to dampen hopes of easier money, insisting that the central bank was still worried about inflation and would pursue its wait-and-see policy.
In what looked remarkably like a public chastisement, Mr. Trichet was ordered to read a statement from Mr. Duisenberg on March 30, in which the more hard-line views were reaffirmed.
Today, Mr. Duisenberg made it clear that he was not ready to reduce rates any time soon. He told reporters that the bank had "no bias" toward either raising or lowering rates, which contradicted the assumptions of most economists and central bank watchers.
"Upward risks to price stability have diminished, but they have not disappeared," Mr. Duisenberg said at today's news conference. Disputing analysts who worry that an American slowdown could drag Europe with it, Mr. Duisenberg said that growth here remained solid.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK: FURNITURE FAIR; 
In Milan, Form Follows Fashion

BYLINE:  By JULIE V. IOVINE 

DATELINE: MILAN 

 BODY:
LAST week, at the 40th annual International Milan Furniture Fair, the world's premier modern furniture exhibition, design and fashion paired off in a flamboyant tango. The trends flew like so many sparks from clicking heels -- passion shades of pink on orange, glossy metals and lean curves. Worn by a supermodel or by a divan -- it no longer matters.
 "Designers and architects have a lot to learn from fashion," said John Pawson, the London architect, who is designing a new Calvin Klein shop in Paris. "They shouldn't be so blinkered. Haven't they cottoned on that things have changed? It isn't just about making designs to last a thousand years." 
 Nowhere was fashion's pumped-up energy more evident than at an architecture exhibition by Prada, showing off projects in the works by Rem Koolhaas and Herzog & de Meuron. Visitors milled around architectural models and tables as long as Olympic pools piled with unusually treated building materials like latticed resin walls and foam shelving. Meanwhile, house music throbbed and videos of Prada's shoe collection flashed above a concrete catwalk. 
"This is the year fashion swallowed design whole," said Deyan Sudjic, editor of Domus, the Italian design magazine. "And after wanting fashion's attention for ages, design is already starting to regret it."
Even as design and fashion cozied up, the spectacle of Pucci-clad swivel chairs, rhinestone sofas and ceramic vases zippered in leather left some wondering whether the pair made a good match at all. "It's a total disaster from an intellectual point of view," said Vico Magistretti, a patriarch of Italian design. "In the 60's, we tried to design concepts because they did something that needed to be done. Now it's all styling."
The style spree has apparently not been stalled by looming economic setbacks. Financial worries were not in evidence at the six-day fair, which ended on Monday and was attended by 175,000 people, 6 percent more than last year. And Americans seem more entranced than ever with Italian contemporary design: Italian furniture imports to the United States rose 21.9 percent in 2000, with Americans spending more than $920 million, second only to Germany.
Milan saw more flash than form-making. The mood was giddy and more preoccupied than ever with the next big thing, even if it was a no-show.
But while slick surface decorations and stylized silhouettes grabbed the public's eye, the designers themselves were trying to decide how best to harness new technologies and unconventional materials like polyester films that shift between transparency and opacity, according to the angle of view, and quartz surfaces in intensely luminous colors.
One season of fabulousness will probably be the shelf life of some fashion-sensitive offerings. Pink and orange stretch plaids and blowsy pink and red roses dressed up last year's prim low-backed sofas from Edra. Massimo Morozzi, Edra's art director and blithe spirit, said the prints, new from the Op Art fabric master Ken Scott, express a "desire for ecstasy and optical illusions in order to compensate for the emotional poverty of minimalist design." Splash your living room in Edra's pinks -- just don't put them next to Cappellini's mod armchairs in vintage Emilio Pucci floral psychedelics. Suggested attire? Sunglasses.
Practicality dashed off with flair was the hallmark of furnishings by the newcomers. Jeffrey Bernett, a New York-based designer, introduced an orange felt chaise as spare as a semaphore. A white leather pillow with an inner magnet attaches to its backrest at any angle ($3,200 at B&B Italia). At the exhibition hall devoted to emerging talent looking for the big break, Tron Design of Germany adapted car seat technology to a two-person rocking cocoon equipped with a computer on a steel extension arm.
At Milan's sprawling fairgrounds, some 1,650 exhibitors showed off their latest works. But breakthroughs are usually found at the 200-odd impromptu furniture showcases scattered among palace courtyards, garages and former steelworks around the city. This year, however, that traffic-jamming citywide happening failed to produce much in the way of truly provocative design.
If the year belonged to anyone, it was Cappellini. The company, known for tapping new trends and far-flung talents, outdid itself with some 40 introductions, including sofas, kitchen sinks, shelving and light fixtures displayed in an industrial hangar far from the gold-plated shopping district along the Via Monte Napoleone. It was a tutti-frutti affair, with minimalism offered up alongside pop fashion, computer tech and amoebic forms.
The Cappellini collection included works by Erwan and Ronan Bouroullec, brothers from Brittany, who recently designed a new shop for Issey Miyake in Paris. As with their tree-house bedroom last year, the Bouroullecs are still experimenting with ideas about poetic practicality. "We don't want to make only functional pieces," said Erwan Bouroullec, pointing to a table sprouting a bowl molded from a single piece of heat-welded Corian. "This is not just a table, and we don't want to tell anyone whether it functions as sculpture in the middle of a room or as a place to toss your keys by the front door. Put it anywhere and use it your own way."
In the show's most pronounced case of fashion cross-over, Fabien Baron, a former art director of Harper's Bazaar, eagerly presented his first collection of furniture, rugs and limited-edition cast-acrylic block sculptures commissioned by Cappellini.
Graphically severe, with legs as skinny as a Vogue intern and done up in optional gray-flecked felt and anthracite leather, these furnishings would appeal to the image-conscious. Paola Antonelli, a design curator at the Museum of Modern Art, summed up the general reaction when she called the collection boring but said, "It will probably sell like hot cakes."
Buyers, manufacturers and journalists combed the city in vain for the next hot designer and must-have chair. The real stunners were raw materials up for adoption from other fields, most of which have not yet reached the production line. The Prada Foundation, a vast, vaulted space, contained, among other curiosities, a two-story section of the diamond-shape glass and steel facade bound for Herzog & de Meuron's Prada store in Tokyo. On the wall, a map outlined Prada's plans to dominate the world with boutiques.
Prada wasn't the only advocate of a new design aesthetic based on textures and transparencies. The display by Material Connexion, a New York-based clearinghouse for experimental products, was thronged with people taking notes and squeezing the gel samples. Two glass manufacturers from Barcelona, Spain, shook their heads in dismay as they read a label describing a stack of gem-toned acrylic sheets as 50 percent lighter than glass, with three times the impact resistance of safety glass. Caressing the satiny two-toned green sheets, Erika Zangger, a restaurant designer from Austria, said, "These are ideal room dividers, better than glass in every way."
There was a surprising lack of technological derring-do in the furniture design, however. (With one exception: Ron Arad's long-awaited prototype of a dining chair that folds and slides like a drawer into a table. Sheer engineering bravado, though it remains to be seen if Cassina can figure out how to produce it.)
Instead, there was a renewed appreciation for the artistry of craft, even the machine-made variety. Fernando and Humberto Campana, an architect and a lawyer from Brazil who are now designers, chose to hand-weave industrial trash -- in this case, garden-hose tubing in fluorescent pinks and purples wrapped around an O-shaped steel frame, for Edra. "I work with my hands to learn the limits of the material," said Humberto Campana, "but the shapes themselves come from my dreams."
In a bit of riveting theater, at a 16th-century church, 19 well-known designers were invited to create machine-made designs on the spot with an acrylic extruder, normally used to mix color combinations for plastics. The event was conceived by Domus and Tom Dixon, the design director at Habitat, who sees a future in instant crafts. "People love to watch other people making things," Mr. Dixon said. "It's like taking a Polaroid of the maker's ideas about design."
It was even suspenseful as Karim Rashid, a New York designer, tried to control the dribble of hot-pink acrylic noodles looping over a cardboard and wood chair mold. He also cast his own custom-made Puma sneaker, as a memorial to one stolen (or collected by a rabid fan) at a party the night before.
Even if there were no star turns, there was no shortage of creative potential. Sputnik -- a casual consortium of designers from the Americas, Japan, the Netherlands and England -- struck the pitch-perfect note when it showed prototypes not for chairs but for what the designers call "verbs about sitting." One was a large rattan floor piece resembling a lima bean with a dent. People lined up to test its gentle rock, and one bystander suggested its ideal function: to allow one to hold the lotus position while reading fashion magazines.

To the Editor:
 Your April 10 front-page account of Colombians fleeing to the United States and elsewhere as a result of increased instability did not mention a primary cause of that instability: United States drug prohibition. 
 Failed prohibitionist policies at home aimed at reducing cocaine consumption and increased financial assistance to the Colombian military to fight coca production exacerbate the conditions of the decades-old civil war in Colombia. Peace and prosperity will continue to elude the Colombian people until the United States abandons its misguided and unwinnable war on drugs.

HEADLINE: Holding Onto Harlem 

BYLINE:  By Angela Glover Blackwell; Angela Glover Blackwell is founder and president of PolicyLink, a nonprofit organization focusing on community building.

 BODY:
The story is familiar. An inner-city neighborhood, long besieged by poverty and economic abandonment, suddenly becomes fashionable because of a combination of economic growth and public investment. As more affluent, usually white, families move in, property values and rents rise. Lower-income working families, often African-American or Hispanic, are forced to leave just when their dream of a more livable neighborhood is about to become reality. Now this story is moving to Harlem, a neighborhood with unique importance to African-Americans nationwide. And this time, New York should rewrite the ending. 
 In past decades, government action drove money away from low-income neighborhoods: a sewage treatment plant on 145th Street, for example, was harmful to Harlem. Now government action should be used to channel investment in ways that let longtime residents stay and thrive. Simply auctioning off city-owned property to the highest private bidder is not enough. 
 New York doesn't have to look far for ideas that preserve economic diversity. New York City, as well as regions from the entire state of New Jersey (under court order) to several Washington, D. C., suburbs to Santa Fe, N. M., have had success with something called inclusionary zoning -- setting aside a portion of new housing, usually 15 percent to 20 percent -- for lower-income families. Developers can be required either to build affordable housing themselves or to contribute to a fund for it. Or they can be given incentives like density bonuses or looser height restrictions.
New York has also helped establish co-op buildings that limit the maximum price at which members' shares can be sold, so prices stay affordable over the years. And it could encourage cooperative leasing, with residents banding together to lease whole buildings, perhaps with options to buy.
A new idea that I believe holds enormous promise is using a community-building trust. This would be a publicly accountable entity that would acquire property in the gentrifying neighborhood by buying it, receiving it from donors or getting it from public agencies through eminent domain or tax foreclosure. Some of this real estate could be sold or leased for higher-end commercial or residential real estate development, to bring money into the neighborhood. The profit could be used to help make the new Harlem a mixed-income, diverse neighborhood.
The trust could subsidize affordable housing, offer employment training, help develop employee-owned businesses or match families' savings for home purchases, education and business financing.
A model is at work in San Diego's Market Creek Plaza, a 20-acre mixed-use commercial and cultural real estate development project. Not only will residents there have an opportunity to be owners of the development, but profits from it are being channeled into a community foundation to help train local residents for managing and running their own businesses.
With imagination and the cooperation of city and neighborhood leaders, ideas like these can change the story of gentrification not only for Harlem, but around the country.

HEADLINE: In Radio Feud, a Higher Kind of Superpower Irks Italy 

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, April 11 

 BODY:
Italians have rarely displayed much faith in institutions, whether the post office, the tax police or health inspectors. Now the country is experiencing an epidemic of mistrust, and its epicenter is in Cesano, a small north Rome suburb where many residents say that radiation from the Vatican's nearby radio transmitters causes cancer.
 "People find it hard to believe that the pope would allow something that could be harmful to people," Assunta, 25, a Cesano native who declined to give her last name, said as she pushed her toddler's stroller into a local grocery store. "Maybe the Vatican believes that the emissions are not harmful, but I think that it is convenient for the Vatican not to believe it." 
 That kind of cynicism is widespread -- which is one reason the Vatican is seeking to end the dispute over the antennas of Vatican Radio, which transmits Roman Catholic programming to five continents in 35 languages. Although the Vatican considers itself a sovereign state and not subject to Italian law, it announced on Tuesday that it would begin reducing electromagnetic emissions from the antennas in order to meet stringent Italian limits.
But the minister of the environment for Italy, Willer Bordon, set a deadline of next Tuesday for a drastic reduction in emissions from the antennas -- a forest of red-and-white towers on a stretch of Vatican property a few miles from Cesano -- by which time he would cut electricity to Vatican transmitters. Today, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato overrode Mr. Bordon, effectively extending the deadline.
The radio standoff is only the latest in a series of health scares that have traumatized Italians and prodded public officials, who are mired in a bitter election campaign, to respond even when scientific evidence is divided or inconclusive.
Italy was one of the first countries to complain officially to NATO about unusually high cancer rates among military troops who served in Bosnia. An Italian medical commission later concluded that there was no evidence linking incidents of cancer to NATO's use of depleted uranium in war zones.
Italy to date has reported 11 confirmed cases of mad cow disease, and public fears remain so high -- despite government assurances that beef is being tested carefully -- that sales and prices have plummeted, as they have across much of Western Europe.
Italians, like most Europeans, have banned imports of genetically modified foods and the use of modified grains. On Tuesday, the police seized 88 tons of soy seed at a Monsanto warehouse in northern Italy to test the seeds for genetically modified content. After 112 tons of Monsanto corn were seized from the same warehouse last month, also to be checked for genetic modification, vandals set a grain store on fire, and sent an anonymous letter to the Italian news agency accusing an American biotechnology company of "poisoning the planet."
Such battles are common in Europe, and are usually framed as a test between the traditional way of life and American economic hegemony -- globalization versus McDonalds.
Italians, however, occasionally see themselves as victimized by another kind of superpower, the Vatican. Cesano residents have long seen electromagnetic radiation from Vatican transmitters as contributing to what they say are increasing leukemia rates, though most studies do not support their accusation. 
Their fears have found a voice in Mr. Bordon, the environment minister, who issued the threat to cut off the radio's power if electromagnetic emissions were not reduced to meet Italian limits -- which are almost three times lower than most other European countries. 
Seeking to head off a collision, the Vatican's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said in a statement Tuesday night -- on Vatican Radio -- that it had decided to reduce the emissions. Mr. Bordon, who held a press conference minutes later, stood firm, saying that he needed to know how soon the Vatican would do so, or else he would cut off the electricity.
But his brinkmanship was tempered by the prime minister, who let it be known today that his government would continue to seek a negotiated settlement with the Vatican through a bilateral commission set up to resolve the issue.
And Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who has overseen the bilateral commission, complained that Mr. Bordon's threats were "inopportune" and "delegitimized" the government's negotiations. Umberto Veronesi, an oncologist who is now Italy's health minister, added his own doubts, noting that there was little evidence of a link between electromagnetic fields and cancer. He urged Italians to worry more about more proven risks, like skin cancer caused by the sun, which many worship on beaches in summer and ski slopes in winter.
The Vatican's resistance to Mr. Bordon's demands irk many Cesano residents. "The church used to torture people to make them convert to Christianity during the Inquisition, and this is a new form of inquisition," Fulvia Mari, 51, a resident, said angrily. She complained that Vatican Radio waves are so powerful that she hears broadcasts when her apartment intercom rings. "I hear broadcasts in German, English and even Latin," she said. "Who speaks Latin anymore?"
The Vatican, worried by what Dr. Navarro-Valls called "unjustified alarmism," is seeking ways to placate public fears. On Monday it announced that it would stop medium-wave broadcasts for seven hours a day, an initial concession that would not significantly dent its mission because most of the world receives Vatican Radio by shortwave radio.
"It was a gesture of good will," explained Eugenio Pacelli, an Italian lawyer who frequently represents the Vatican and is the grandnephew and namesake of Pope Pius XII. He said the Vatican's gesture was not an admission of error and likened it to the standoff between the United States and China over an American spy plane. "Even President Bush told the Chinese he 'regretted the incident,' " Mr. Pacelli said wryly. "Even though he didn't agree with their view."

HEADLINE: Biggest Drop In Prices Of Imports Since1992 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
Prices of goods imported into the United States fell more in March than in any month since December 1992 as the cost of petroleum, steel and paper declined, government figures showed today.
 The import price index dropped 1.6 percent last month after a 0.6 percent slide in February, the Labor Department said. March's decline was the third consecutive drop; import costs have not risen since September. Prices excluding oil fell 0.9 percent after a 0.8 percent decline. 
 Cheaper imports and a dollar that has risen more than 5 percent since the middle of last year have made it difficult for American companies to raise prices. That is a green light for Federal Reserve policy makers to reduce interest rates to bolster the economy.
"This is encouraging," said Richard Yamarone, senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. "It'll permit the Fed to cut rates as aggressively as they see fit. Inflation isn't even on the Fed's radar screen." 
The March decline was the largest since a 1.7 percent drop in December 1992. It pushed the import price index to its lowest level since January 2000.
Import prices were 1.5 percent lower for the 12 months ended in March, compared with a 9.2 percent increase in the 12 months ended in March 2000. Excluding petroleum, import prices were unchanged in March compared with those in the month a year earlier. For the 12 months ended in March 2000, import prices excluding petroleum were 1 percent higher.
The March decrease in the import price index was led by a 5.9 percent fall in the cost of petroleum products. The price of crude oil, which has more than doubled over the last two years, fell 5.1 percent in March after a 2.5 percent increase in February.
The import prices report is the first of three measures of inflation for March. On Thursday, the government will issue a report on prices at the wholesale level and it is expected to show tame inflation. A report on consumer prices will come next week.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
NasdaqExtends Gains, but Dow and S.& P. Give Ground

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index rose for the third consecutive session yesterday as investors bought shares of market-leading technology companies on hopes their prospects will soon start to brighten.
 Semiconductor stocks, widely seen as the leading indicator of a recovery in the broader technology market, led the advance yesterday. The shares rallied after an analyst from Salomon Smith Barney issued a report recommending the group, saying business is likely to pick up later this year. 
 Paced by gains in companies like Applied Micro Circuits, Applied Materials and Intel, the Nasdaq composite index gained 46.92 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,898.95. Since last Thursday, the Nasdaq index has risen 16 percent. Even with the gain, it remains 62 percent below the peak reached in March 2000. 
"I am not sure this is the beginning of a straight move to the upside," said Philip S. Dow, managing director of equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. "My guess is we are in a backing and filling, grinding mode. The watchword I am looking for from my analysts is that things are not getting worse." 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell even as the Nasdaq moved higher, pulled down by oil and drug company stocks. The Dow fell 89.27 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,013.47. Declines in Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson and Merck more than offset gains in Intel, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was little changed, declining 2.49 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,165.89.
Analysts said they were encouraged to see some softness in prices after the big gains recorded on Tuesday.
"I am loving today's action, because I don't want to see huge gains piled on top of one another," said William J. Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. Mr. Meehan said strength in technology and financial stocks was a sign that the market's long slide is probably over.
"We have been telling clients to avoid safe, defensive-type stocks, because we think the market has bottomed," he said. "We are seeing real buying here, not people covering their short positions."
Six stocks rose for every five that fell on the Nasdaq stock market. Losers outnumbered gainers on the New York Stock Exchange by three to two. Nearly 1.3 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board. 
The Salomon Smith Barney upgrade of the semiconductor stocks sent the Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index soaring. The index gained 44.17, or 8.5 percent, to 564.29. 
Intel rose $2.75, to $27.52. Texas Instruments was up $4.40, to $34. Applied Materials climbed $3.28, to $46.03. And Applied Micro jumped $3.01, to $19.39.
Cisco Systems was the most actively traded stock. The shares gained $1.54, to $17.40.
Bank and brokerage stocks participated in yesterday's rally, even though William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, made it plain Tuesday that the Fed was highly unlikely to cut short-term interest rates before mid-May, when its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to hold its next meeting.
"A month ago Mr. Poole's comments would have sent financials reeling," Mr. Meehan said. "They are rallying."
Morgan Stanley gained $3.01, to $57.65. Citigroup advanced 94 cents, to $46.34. J. P. Morgan Chase rose $1.44, to $44.74. And Goldman Sachs closed at $91.30, up $3.49.
Health, energy and retail stocks, which were highly sought during the meltdown in technology, were mostly lower. Johnson & Johnson fell $1.19, to $90.84. Merck slipped $1.24, to $77.15. And Pfizer declined $1, to $40.

Treasuries Are Mixed
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 9/32, to a price of 99 4/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.11 percent from 5.08 percent. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 6/32, to 96 19/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.61 percent from 5.62 percent on Tuesday.

Al Davis: A Shameless, Selfish Rebel

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
THE big court trial dragging on like an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease 20 miles down the freeway in Los Angeles is of no interest to Patricio Miranda. Let the big-city taxpayers pay the five-weeks-and-counting freight for Al Davis versus the National Football League, he says. Let others worry about the bloodsucker in silver and black, to whom Miranda's little town once handed $10 million for the privilege of being played.
 "If anything, it was a good lesson that we're too small to get involved with people like that," said Miranda, the city councilman and former mayor of Irwindale, Calif. (population: 1,100). 
 Fourteen years ago, Irwindale, a town of mostly Mexican-Americans best known for its gravel pits, gained sudden national exposure by striking a deal with the Raiders, then in Los Angeles. Davis, the self-styled James Dean of sports owners, wanted out of the aged and parking-challenged Los Angeles Coliseum. Irwindale had a plan, Davis had a price, and Patricio Miranda, then the mayor, had a problem.
"Davis wanted a $10 million good-faith payment and I called it risk money," Miranda said yesterday from his Irwindale home. "I told my city managers: 'It should be like buying a house. Put it in an escrow account and if the deal passes, he gets it. If it doesn't pass, we get it back.' "
The four councilmen didn't listen to Miranda, who voted against the payment despite being threatened with a mayoral recall. The Raiders deal eventually ran into political resistance from Los Angeles and the state capital in Sacramento and died. Irwindale was out the $10 million plus interest, in addition to several million in related costs. Not that Davis cared what became of the small town's economy. He stuffed the money deep into his pocket, put the Raiders back in the free agent market and eventually secured $64 million in upfront benefits from Oakland, the team's original home.
"I'm glad I'm on record as having voted against that payment," said Miranda, the only remaining government member from the town's Raiders fling. "But, still, losing that money hurt bad."
In 1995 Davis returned the Raiders to Oakland, where they were welcomed back like war heroes and where the old Oakland Alameda Coliseum, shared with baseball's Athletics, was remodeled for football. Less than a decade later, he is in Los Angeles County Superior Court, arguing under cross-examination yesterday that he left L.A. only because the N.F.L. undercut a sweetheart deal for a privately financed stadium in Inglewood.
He wants $1 billion in damages. He also accuses Oakland of not living up to its agreement. He wants to establish the Raiders as still holding the territorial rights to the megamarket that lost both the Raiders and the Rams. Then Davis could pursue the invalidation of his lease in Oakland, the long-troubled city from which he has apparently bled all he can.
It sounds arrogant and greed-driven almost to the point of being delusional. Then again, Davis has a pretty good track record in court against the N.F.L., which failed to block his early 1980's slithering from Oakland to L.A. He was back then a regular news media icon, the tough-talking thorn in the derriere of the clubby old rich men. He even once flirted with New York City, after Leon Hess moved his Jets to New Jersey. Hess was called a carpetbagger. Davis was encouraged to come bless us with charisma.
Questioned under oath earlier this week by his trusty lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto, it didn't take Davis long to remind the jury of the Raiders' motto, "Commitment to Excellence." Now all he needs to develop is a commitment to commitment, as a substitute for a conscience. At 71, Davis may still be a rebel but, as usual, he is fighting for a selfish and shameful cause.
Oakland must about now feel as good as Irwindale once did upon hearing Davis testify this week: "I do believe in tradition. I do believe in history. I do believe in loyalty." Mostly, he believes that his football team is no different from a hot quarterback at the end of his contract.
He thinks Los Angeles, which has not closed down without pro football, can't wait to start the bidding. Maybe he's right. Maybe there is no end to this sports team madness and extortion of taxpayers. Even Patricio Miranda wouldn't definitively rule Irwindale out of any future deal.
"I can't speak for the other council members," he said. "As for me, sure, I'd take the Raiders. But I wouldn't spend a penny on them. Let Davis pay. In the end, he gets all the profit."

HEADLINE: Raising Funds After the Fall; 
Venture Capital Exists For Realistic Prospects

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN; Daniel Altman is a staff writer for The Economist.

 BODY:
At first glance, it looks like a terrible time to start a company.
 Both the public and private markets for new equity have shrunk. Margin calls on debt-financed portfolios have chased away many badly burned investors who were still riding the high-tech bandwagon when it exploded. 
 "I would not want to be a company today raising capital, counting on the markets in the next year or so," said Jeffrey Walker, head of J. P. Morgan Chase's private equity fund.
So are most potential backers of new ventures simply holding onto their money? If that happens, after all, even lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve and a tax cut emerging from Congress may have little power to stimulate investment. The economy could be in for a long dry spell. 
But while investment in business is clearly on the wane, the fear that Washington is lacking effective tools to restart the economic engine appears to be exaggerated. There are several reasons for that.
First of all, the decline in funds for new companies largely represents a return to normalcy. In the public equity market, for instance, initial and secondary offerings, which together topped $45 billion on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange in both November 1999 and February 2000, have retreated to under $10 billion over the last few months. Yet that level would have been fairly ordinary as recently as 1998.
Second, a drop in initial public offerings does not necessarily imply significantly less future growth. A substantial portion of the money raised in the dot-com boom was thrown away on ventures that did not make money. "We thought it was nuts that two people just out of college were getting $20 million to 30 million valuations on a business plan," said James Geshwiler, who leads a private team of wealthy investors called CommonAngels.
Renewed attention to companies with more realistic prospects is likely to channel capital to more effective uses.
Finally, much of the private venture financing that helped inflate the dot-com bubble had merely migrated from other parts of the equity market. Now that most of the opportunists who rushed into venture capital are gone, experts say, the market appears to be not only smaller, but also in some ways healthier.
"We saw over the past few years a huge amount of money switching out of the more mundane area of buyout into venture," said Ray Maxwell, managing director of Invesco's London-based private equity business. Hedge funds, buyout firms and new corporate incubators with little experience in venture capital were trying to take young companies public as soon as possible, hoping for huge proceeds from initial public offerings.
Their retreat has handed the market back to veterans like Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Walker, who still have capital to invest. And "there's still a lot of money in the hands of the old-line venture firms," like Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers and New Enterprise Associates, Mr. Walker said.
Wealthy "angel" investors also continue to participate in venture financing. "Our deal flow is up 30 percent over last year," Mr. Geshwiler of CommonAngels said. "We've had more companies in due diligence, considering investments, than we've ever had before."
And as long as the funds and ideas keep flowing, monetary and fiscal policy can still influence the economy.
"Most of the Fed's influence is over the short term," said Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University who is an expert on how monetary policy affects the economy. But "to the extent the Fed can credibly stabilize the real economy, that's going to raise asset values and make it easier for firms to raise cash."
"The Fed can't perfectly control the economy," he said, "but it still has a strong ability to influence markets."
Fiscal policy has retained its ability to influence the economy as well. "Observers seem to be getting confused between what's happening in the stock market and what's happening in the economy," said Alan J. Auerbach, director of the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California at Berkeley. "I'm old enough to remember some very serious recessions we've had in the past. So far, there's no indication that we're heading in that direction."
Professor Auerbach said that targeted tax cuts and credits could help to enhance investment, but he warned that the Bush administration's current plan would do little to advance that goal. "This is a tax cut that is going toward households, not toward businesses," he said. "That in itself is not going to have an impact on demand for investment goods."
Yet in the longer term, other factors will determine the health of the economy even more than the level of taxes and interest rates.
The flow of new ideas will be crucial. Groundbreaking technologies and profitable new business models raise living standards by improving workers' productivity. The markets' tumble has helped to refocus investment on companies with truly trailblazing ideas rather than boilerplate start-ups.
"The fair-weather entrepreneurs are out of the market," Mr. Geshwiler said. "But there's still lots of room for innovation."
Matchmaking between investors and entrepreneurs is also becoming more precise and productive, as would-be backers are examining new companies more closely than ever.
Russ Henry experienced that first-hand while trying to raise money recently for Trigo, the third technology company he has helped to found. He said investors were "definitely more finicky, but definitely much more committed."
He was surprised by demands from potential investors for up-to-the-minute progress reports on pending contracts, but he found the extra scrutiny refreshing.
"The diligence process took 60 days, which was about 30 days longer than my expectation," Mr. Henry said. "We actually liked it," he added, because it got his investors "much more engaged in what we're doing."
Not all the developments on the innovation front are so positive. Mr. Geshwiler worries that the crash has scared some talented people away from the private sector. "One thing I have noticed is fewer technology people being willing to go in the market," he said.
Mr. Walker, however, does not share his trepidation. "I'm not convinced the spirit of innovation has been impaired," he said. "The spirit of copying has."
He does not miss the days of being besieged by companies seeking instant capital for, say, the Internet's 12th Web site devoted to selling pet food. "Companies came in and gave a presentation and wanted an answer in two or three hours," Mr. Walker said. "These were followers, and not great ideas."
The other factor that will determine the long-term health of the economy is saving.
The overall rate of personal saving fell to zero or even lower between July 2000 and February 2001. Now, it may be starting to move back up again. No longer able to count on gains in the stock market to generate easy wealth, millions of households are probably starting to put aside more savings that should soon show up in the official statistics.
Whether those savings will reach new businesses soon is tougher to predict. Middle-income savers will have to pay off home equity loans, auto loans and credit cards before they can start investing again. "The impact of household debt is one of the big unknowns," Professor Gertler said.
It is clear, however, that both monetary and fiscal policy could play a role in ensuring robust saving and capital accumulation in the long run.
Professor Gertler says that the Fed's best approach to ensuring a healthy outlook for economic growth is to maintain its commitment to keeping inflation low. That agenda could limit the Fed's ability to provide a short-term economic stimulus, but it would minimize long-term risks to businesses and consumers.
On the fiscal side, Professor Auerbach hoped the federal government would continue to pay off its own debt to help produce permanently lower interest rates. "It's been a very beneficial policy, and I think it would continue to be so," he said.
Ensuring lasting, favorable conditions for investment will be particularly important, since the private market's focus is returning to long-term growth opportunities rather than get-rich-quick schemes.
Mr. Walker of JPMorgan Chase said that institutional investors "are back to a more normal style of structuring and pricing of deals, similar to what we saw in the early 1990's."
Mr. Geshwiler of CommonAngels has seen the same trend in his corner of the private-equity world. "Building a company used to be a long-term proposition, and now it's a really long-term proposition," he said. "The people who we're meeting with these days are far more serious about building their business than the people we were meeting with a year ago."

HEADLINE: Tax Cut Announced for Jersey City 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, April 11 

 BODY:
Mayor Bret D. Schundler held a news conference today at City Hall to announce a tax cut for city property owners for which his opponent for governor can take some credit. 
 In announcing an amendment to the $333.7 million municipal budget that took effect last July, Mr. 
Schundler took responsibility for increasing spending by less than $1 million from the previous year, despite inflation and mandatory salary increases. He said the tax cut would amount to about 60 cents per $1,000 of assessed value. The current municipal tax rate, officials said, is $20.33 per $1,000 of assessed value. 
 "I'm happy to report that my administration has a solid plan to cut property taxes for Jersey City homeowners this year," he said. 
But the budget amendment that set up the tax cut was to incorporate $4.15 million in additional aid allocated to the city by the state under the Aid to Distressed Cities Program. The money was authorized by Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, Mr. Schundler and the City Council were told in an April 6 letter from the state's director of local government services. Mr. DiFrancesco is Mr. Schundler's opponent in the Republican primary. (The city had already been allocated $7.34 million in distressed cities aid.)
Despite the letter, Mr. Schundler said, the state had initially decided to cut its aid to Jersey City this year by about $10 million, so even with the $4.15 million, the city is getting less this year from the state. "If the state had just kept its revenue flat, we would have been able to cut taxes further," Mr. Schundler said.

HEADLINE: A New Editor Named at Wired Magazine 

 BODY:
Chris Anderson, the United States business editor of The Economist, has been named the editor of Wired magazine, which is published by Conde Nast. 
 Mr. 
Anderson will succeed Katrina Heron, Wired's editor of the last three years, on June 4. 
 At The Economist, Mr. Anderson, 39, covered technology and the economy as both a writer and an editor. Mr. Anderson said that he would probably bring more of a business approach to Wired, which has covered the Internet and technology from broad business and cultural perspectives.
"We're in the midst of a slump right now, but I believe that the underlying technology revolution will emerge from this period," he said. "But the hype of a year ago is diminished. The magazine will be a more sober, more level-headed, perhaps more pragmatic review of where the revolution is going."
Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications Inc., bought Wired magazine in 1998. The magazine's circulation has increased 8.3 percent in the last year, to 507,816, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. But advertising has dropped, as it has throughout the technology and Internet magazine sector. Wired's ad pages for March declined 41 percent, to 103 pages from 178. Revenue dropped 26 percent, to $3.7 million in the March issue from a reported $5.1 million in March 2000, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.

HEADLINE: A New Approach: Slow and Steady 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 11 

 BODY:
Among the junkyards, crushed cars and broken glass in this city's warehouse district, Walt Morton spends his days hunting for deals on computer hardware from failed dot-com companies. 
 The auctioning off of the infrastructure of the not-so-new economy is one sign that Silicon Valley is plunging into a financial abyss unparalleled for decades in this high-technology region. 
 At the same time, Mr. Morton and others like him are evidence that the entrepreneurial fervor that led to the boom is still very much alive, and that sprouts seem to be emerging from the rubble.
As he examined a pizza-box-size server computer and an auctioneer barked out prices, Mr. Morton reflected that he might well be the first sign of a new era rather than an observer of the final moments of the old one. 
"All the people I know who lost their jobs are trying to start new companies," he said. But he added that their approach this time was radically different from the gold-rush mentality of the quickly fading dot-com era: "We're part of a whole new wave of cheap start-ups." 
A former executive at America Online who is now chief executive of an Internet start-up in San Francisco, Sawhorse Partners, Mr. Morton explores several auctions each week.
"If these are cheap, enough I might buy a couple of them," he said, eyeing a stack of computers sitting in a corner of a warehouse. He estimated that the infrastructure he built for his last start-up at a cost of $200,000 would now be less than $18,000.
The shift in the market has created an unfamiliar paralysis among Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, many of whom have a dazed look as they watch previous bad investments crumble and try to figure out what the next hot investment will be. As a result, the area's venture-capital-to-entrepreneur ecosystem has abruptly stalled, at least temporarily.
While some analysts have worried about the impact that such dot-com fire sales are having on equipment makers like Cisco, Dell and Sun Microsystems, the most visible beneficiaries of the boom, many economists noted that the recycling of equipment has always been a part of the high-technology life cycle, in which most start-up companies either fail or are acquired. Employment, at this point, remains surprisingly strong.
"I think the whole dot-com layoff thing has been blown out of perspective," said Steven Levy, an economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, in Palo Alto, noting that in the last three months, the San Francisco Bay area has recorded historically low unemployment rates.
The California Employment Development Department reported this month that the state's unemployment rate dropped to 4.5 percent in February, a 32-year low. (It was 4.4 percent in December 1969.) The unemployment rate last month in Santa Clara County, which largely defines Silicon Valley, was 1.7 percent, indicating that only 17,600 people were jobless in a work force of 1,004,900. 
Even in San Francisco, which has been more dependent on e-commerce start-ups, unemployment was 3.2 percent, up from 2.6 last year. 
Mr. Morton is one sign that while the dot-com bubble has burst and expectations have been "reset" -- in the current jargon of the e-commerce neighborhood known as South of Market Street -- the start-up culture here is now deeply ingrained.
Big Storage, a South-of-Market start-up with 30 employees that largely missed the dot-com boom, turned profitable in March, two months ahead of schedule. The company, which sells Linux-based disk arrays to companies that need large data storage systems, once felt embarrassed that it was not on the public offering bandwagon but was now finding it easier to expand.
"Last year, each month I would apologize to my board of directors for not finding more business," said Big Storage's chief executive, Sam Bogach. Now, he says, missing the boom was a blessing.
Many Silicon Valley executives said the shift was away from the era of easy-money dot-com start-ups and back to a climate that more closely resembled the original Silicon Valley up-from-the-garage ethos. 
"You're no longer viewed as a loser if you have a cheap office space; you're perceived as smart," said Paul Kocher, chief executive of Cryptography Research, who is financing a small start-up to develop an e-commerce application. 
Indeed, it may be that venture capitalists, who until recently were among the biggest beneficiaries of the boom, are now the biggest victims of the downturn.
"The V.C.'s are hiding under their desks right now," said Anthony Perkins, co-author of "The Internet Bubble," a 1999 book that predicted the dot-com shake-out. 
"Most of them," Mr. Perkins said, "are facing up to the fact of whatever percentage of their deals that were stupid. They're shooting all the lame horses." 
Mr. Perkins's company, Red Herring Communications, which publishes the business and technology magazine Red Herring, had a round of layoffs not long ago, but Mr. Perkins said that when he checked recently, he discovered that all but one of the former employees had found a job -- and that the one person was not looking. 
Of 742 venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, he said, 192 were created within the last 18 months, a situation that will inevitably lead to a pruning of the venture community in the months ahead. That, in turn, will lead to a consolidation in the power and influence of venture firms like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
And if the venture capital industry is in shock, that has created a domino effect among start-up companies. 
"These guys are schizo right now," said David House, chief executive of Allegro Networks, a start-up router company in San Jose, Calif. "They've just raised their billion-dollar funds and they're scared. Now everyone wants to be the second guy to invest, not the first." 
From the point of view of the venture capitalists, the entrepreneurs have also grown more cautious. 
"We think it's a wonderful time to be a bold entrepreneur," said Jim Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners in Palo Alto, Calif. "But unfortunately we're not seeing a lot of people with those ideas. It's too bad."
The current period, Mr. Breyer said, was similar to the one venture capitalists went through in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when most people thought Microsoft had won the PC platform wars and they were only interested in incremental ideas.
Today, most executives here remain convinced that the Internet is not a fad and that it has only begun to transform the economy. But they are now grasping for specific trends, with profit potential, to seize upon. 
"There are no fads right now," said Sheldon Breiner, a longtime Silicon Valley inventor who is now an independent investor. "Six months ago it was optical switching and a year ago it was business-to-business, but now I don't know of a fad."
There are those who said that the absence of fads was a good thing and that the economy in Silicon Valley was being led back to its fundamentals in technology, where it has always excelled. 
"Two years ago you couldn't recruit anyone into the semiconductor industry," said Andrew Rappaport, a partner at August Capital, a venture firm in Menlo Park, Calif. "They all wanted to go to a dot-com. Now they're all coming back and the talent pool is growing." 
And some venture capitalists remain enthusiastic, certain that they are only one company away from the Next Big Thing. 
"We've gone from irrational exuberance to irrational pessimism," said Greg Galanos, a partner at Softbank Venture Capital in Mountain View, Calif., adding: "Have I told you about Danger Research? Wait until you see what they're doing!"

A history lesson: Don't count on stocks to lead the way out of a downturn.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; This column appears here every Thursday. Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a new collection of essays, "Unconventional Wisdom: Alternative Perspectives on the New Economy." E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com

 BODY:
NOTHING bothered me more as a viewer of the finance programs on cable TV in the 1990's than the professional analysts who said that stocks were always a good investment as long as you planned to hold them for at least five years. Stocks always rose over the long run, they argued.
 But in truth, stock prices over the last century were sometimes flat for 10 or 15 years, and occasionally even longer. In the heady 1990's, though, any Tom-Dick-or-Harry prognosticator could say that five years was the long run and get away with it. 
 The recent downturn has not yet weaned the financial markets from such overoptimism. The widespread view today is that once stocks find a bottom, they will start back on their inexorable upward march fairly quickly. Analysts now acknowledge that the gains of 25 percent a year or more won't return any time soon, but recapturing the long-term average of 7 percent a year, after inflation, is not only reasonable but even likely. At such a pace, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would again be setting records in about three years. 
A serious look at stock market history, however, suggests that this is far from a sure thing. And because the health of the economy depends so much more on high stock prices than it once did, we should be particularly concerned about the economy's ability to fend off recession without further stimulus.
The powerful consumer spending of the late 1990's was especially dependent on high stock prices -- the famed wealth effect. But the United States may be entering the reverse, a vicious circle in which falling stock prices further weaken consumer spending, and the resulting weaker economy, in turn, further weakens the stock market. 
What, then, does history truly tell us? Here is one stark fact to keep in mind. Stock prices plummeted in 1969 after the long and optimistic economic expansion of the 1960's that was similar to the 1990's in some respects. And the market did not exceed its 1969 high again, discounted for inflation, until 1992.
In other words, if you had your investments in the S.& P. 500 in 1969, it took 23 years to earn a positive real return from the movement of stocks. The "long run" can be very long indeed. 
Now, the above calculation does not include dividends. But one of the additional disturbing differences in now and 1969 is that dividend payments are on average so low today as to be almost nonexistent. The dividend yield for the S.& P. 500 at the end of 1968, when stock prices were near their highs for that run-up, was nearly 3 percent. Thus, even if stock prices fell, the average investor was at least receiving a handsome dividend. Today's average dividend yield is only about 1.2 percent, so the big gains in the future will have to come from the rising stock price itself.
The current low level of dividends, in fact, throws all historical analyses of future stock returns into doubt. But even if we set the dividend issue aside, the stock market's history is not comforting.
First, stocks on average today are still trading at relatively high multiples of their earnings. The price-earnings ratio of the S.& P. 500, based on the preceding 12 months' earnings, is currently 22.
From 1947 to 1990, the average multiple was 14. If market enthusiasm wanes further and multiples fall to the average the next five years, the earnings of the S.& P. 500 would have to rise by an unusually rapid 10 percent a year to justify current prices.
In bear markets, multiples often return to levels below their former averages. Jeremy J. Siegel, the author of "Stocks for the Long Run" (McGraw-Hill, 1997), has found that stocks, even with dividends reinvested, can make no gain after inflation for as long as 17 years. As for that so-called safe five-year period for investing in stocks, stocks have occasionally done so poorly that bonds outperformed them one of three times over that time span.
And for those who do not adequately diversify their stock portfolios, the long run provides little refuge at all.
Many investors mostly owned high-technology stocks, for example. From where it is now, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index has to increase by approximately 25 percent a year over the next five years simply to compensate for the sharp fall of the last 12 months. Anything could happen, of course. The Nasdaq rose that fast in just two years from 1998 to 2000. But even the most optimistic analysts doubt such a frenzy will be repeated.
Mr. Siegel's basic finding was that over every 30-year period since 1871, stocks produced a handsome return that was invariably greater than the return earned by investing in bonds, and over 20-year periods, stocks outperformed bonds better than 9 of 10 times.
But the Yale economist Robert Shiller, who wrote "Irrational Exuberance" (Princeton, 2000) even warns that a 20- or 30-year holding period is not necessarily risk free.
"This was the most economically successful century for the most economically successful nation of all time," he says. "It will not necessarily repeat itself."
Some argue that now is precisely the time to invest again. But if such analysis depends on faith in history alone, there is clearly good reason to be cautious.
Nothing can replace solid analysis about the future earnings prospects of individual companies as a guide to investing. A little cautious buying might make sense now, but an investor should have plenty of patience and the financial flexibility to absorb further losses.
Our policy makers should also certainly read their history more carefully. The wealth effect has become integral to the nation's economic strength. Some investors might be able to wait 5, 10 or 20 years to make up their losses, but a falling stock market these days means the economy needs some serious stoking right away.

HEADLINE: Runoff Set for Los Angeles Mayor 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 11 

 BODY:
For years political experts have talked about the day when this city's surging Latino population would shape the outcome of local elections. In Los Angeles this morning, there was an unavoidable feeling that that moment had arrived.
 In a crowded mayorial primary election on Tuesday, Antonio Villaraigosa, a high school dropout who went on to become speaker of the California Assembly, pieced together a multi-ethnic coalition to finish first, positioning himself for a runoff that could make him the city's first Hispanic mayor since 1872. 
 Because no candidate got a majority of the vote, Mr. Villaraigosa, who won 30 percent in a field of six major contenders, will now face City Attorney James K. Hahn, the son of a beloved local political family who is white but rode his strong support among blacks to take 25 percent of the vote. 
Steve Soboroff, a Republican businessman making his political debut, finished third with 21 percent, but he narrowly carried white neighborhoods in the traditionally conservative San Fernando Valley and the city's politically eclectic Westside. Those areas will be decisive in the nonpartisan runoff on June 5.
Mr. Villaraigosa's first-place showing reflected not only the growing power of Hispanic voters -- who made up one-fifth of the electorate, two and a half times their share just eight years ago -- but his early success in styling himself as a worthy heir to Tom Bradley, who was elected the first black mayor in 1973. Mr. Bradley built a path-breaking coalition of his own with black voters and white liberals, before the Hispanic population exploded. 
For a year, Mr. Hahn, a Democrat, as is Mr. Villaraigosa, had led in virtually all the polls. But his support stalled several weeks ago while Mr. Villaraigosa surged from the low double digits with endorsements from the state's Democratic Governor, Gray Davis, the local party organization, the city's main labor union umbrella group and a handful of local billionaires, many of them sensing that the time had come for a Hispanic mayor and that he had the best chance to win.
"This candidacy represents an opening up of this city to more people," Mr. Villaraigosa (pronounced VEE-yah-ray-GO-suh) said today at news conference in the Valley, which he called "ground zero" in the coming campaign. At the same time, Mr. Villaraigosa took pains to say, as he has throughout his campaign: "I'm not running to be first. I want to be mayor for the whole city."
The election was a remarkable turnabout for a city that only eight years ago, reeling from the 1992 riots and a punishing recession, chose Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a maverick multimillionaire Republican making his first run for public office, and then re-elected him overwhelmingly four years ago against token opposition. 
This year, Mr. Riordan's campaign team was split, with most of his political advisers backing Mr. Hahn, with whom the mayor has often tangled, and a group his wealthiest supporters, including Eli Broad, the city's richest citizen, supporting Mr. Villaraigosa.
Mr. Riordan's own chosen successor was Mr. Soboroff, and the two runoff candidates must now compete for his voters, as well as those of Joel Wachs, a veteran city councilman who has represented neighborhoods on the Westside and in the Valley and who finished fourth, with 11 percent of the vote. 
"The real battleground is going to be over those voters who were neither black nor Latino, especially white Jewish voters," said Raphael Sonsenshine, a political scientist at the California State University. "While Villaraigosa led among Jewish voters, he by no means has a majority yet."
For Mr. Hahn, 50, the challenge is to stop Mr. Villaraigosa's momentum and build beyond his base with black voters in South-Central Los Angeles, who fondly remember his father, the longtime County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn. A familiar, if often phlegmatic figure in the city's political world, Mr. Hahn must appeal to moderates and conservatives in the suburban Valley and Westside neighborhoods where he has run well in citywide campaigns since he was elected city controller in 1981 and city attorney in 1985. 
"I have experience where it counts, right here in my hometown," Mr. Hahn said today, in a preview of a campaign that seems certain to try to portray Mr. Villaraigosa, 48, as lacking local government experience and too liberal for a city with a long tradition of middle-of-the-road nonpartisanship in municipal politics. 
"I think most people consider themselves moderates," Mr. Hahn added. "They don't like labels like liberal or conservative. They look past labels and want ideas."
State and local term limits drove the dynamic of this year's contests. Mr. Riordan was barred form seeking a third term, and Mr. Hahn was barred from seeking re-election to his current job as the city's chief lawyer. Mr. Villaraigosa had to give up his seat in the State Assembly just two years after becoming speaker.
At the same time, demographic changes left whites a smaller share of the electorate, and black and Asian voters roughly stagnant, compared to eight years ago, while the Hispanic share of the electorate rose to about 21 percent from 8 percent in 1993, an all-time high, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls by The Los Angeles Times. Four years ago, Hispanic voters made up about 15 percent of the electorate, and most backed Mr. Riordan.
Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University's Los Angeles campus, said that Mr. Villaraigosa's candidacy "is really ushering in the new era of politics in Los Angeles."
"People have talked for a long time about the political potential of the Latino community, but it's only been in the last four to five years that we've really seen that taking place," Mr. Regalado added. "And yet it wasn't really a base for Antonio. He ran as a coalition candidate, and he spent a lot of time for the past two years reaching out to other communities and I think he knew he had to because he wasn't even a household name in the Latino community."
while Mr. Villaraigosa won a clear majority of the overall Hispanic vote, he split it with another candidate, Representative Xavier Becerra, who took just under 20 percent of the Hispanic vote to more than 60 percent for Mr. Villaraigosa, according to voter surveys. Mr. Becerra came in fifth. State Controller Kathleen Connell finished last.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: BEIJING; 
Chinese Claim a Moral Victory, Describing a Much Bigger Battle

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 11 

 BODY:
The Chinese government, claiming a moral victory, told its people today that the United States had offered "a form of apology" for the collision of an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet that cost the life of the Chinese pilot and led to the detention of the American crew.
 After more than a week of demanding that the United States offer an official apology and admit full responsibility for the incident, Chinese leaders settled for less. They accepted a letter, negotiated in English only, in which the United States told the Chinese people and the family of the lost Chinese pilot that it was "very sorry," and also said that it was "very sorry" that the crippled American aircraft had landed in China without permission. 
 But even as Beijing announced that the 24 American crew members would be released, Chinese officials implied that they had gained an apology and emphasized that "the battle is not over." They restated demands that the United States end its spy flights and explain its actions -- apparently a topic to be taken up in future talks. They also vowed to keep "investigating" the damaged aircraft, laden with advanced eavesdropping equipment, as long as necessary. 
A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi, made it clear that the plane would not be returned quickly and stressed China's position that it had a legal right to conduct a full investigation of the American spy plane and the mid-air collision, which China says the American pilot caused with a sudden swerve.
Hoping to head off a possible backlash from a Chinese public that has grown increasingly angry, officials presented today's deal as a victory for Chinese dignity and world stability, sometimes stretching words in the process. In meetings today with Communist Party organizations and newspaper, radio and television editors -- intended to shape the public discussion -- party leaders said that the United States had agreed to "a form of apology," without providing the exact language.
In those meetings and in an editorial in Thursday's People's Daily, the leaders betrayed their domestic uneasiness by exhorting citizens to "turn patriotic zeal into energy for a strong country" -- that is, to rally around President Jiang Zemin's leadership and work hard at their job or studies, rather than second-guessing the deal. 
Just how the agreement will play may not be evident for days as the specific terms become more widely known among the public. Initial reactions ranged from happiness at what some understood to be an American flinch -- one university professor excitedly called a friend to say "The Americans have apologized!" -- to deep skepticism about the leadership's resolve.
"This will add to the people's existing image of Jiang Zemin -- that he talks big but is inconsistent," said an editor of a party magazine.
Random interviews offered diverse views, with a significant group still angry at the United States and disappointed in China's leaders.
"This government is so weak," said a 20-year-old bartender, who gave only his surname, Jiao. "The United States thinks it can do anything it wants to us." A 38-year-old delivery man surnamed Wu said: "Saying you're sorry isn't good enough. Americans need to know we aren't afraid of their bullying." 
Supporting the government's decision to release the crew, a 28-year-old software developer, Mr. Zhang, said: "We want to continue developing and working together with other countries in a stable environment. Our relations with America are extremely complex." 
One party official said that the real test would come in the next few months as the United States decides what kinds of weapons to sell to Taiwan despite Chinese objections, and as Beijing's bid to play host for the 2008 Summer Olympics is decided. "That's when people will look back and either say, 'They were right,' to make this compromise, or 'That shows why they can't lead,' " she said. 
Throughout the standoff, China's leaders emphasized their desire not to destroy Chinese-American relations, which they see as vital to China's economic future. In contrast to the aftermath of the 1999 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, officials never gave permission to students who asked to demonstrate at the American Embassy. Tonight, though extra guards were at the embassy, there was no sign of protests. 
Tonight, the Chinese news media described as a victory the short English-language letter, which had been written in days of intensive talks in Beijing and Washington and was hand-delivered by Admiral Prueher to the Chinese foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan. In the agreed English version released by the American Embassy, Mr. Preuher conveyed "sincere regret" over the missing pilot and aircraft and said "we are very sorry" about the loss of the pilot.
In a nod to China's extreme sensitivity about territorial infringements -- a product of its much-resented history of invasions by colonial powers -- the ambassador's letter also said "we are very sorry" that "the entering of China's airspace and the landing did not have verbal clearance." The point had been especially important for China -- and a fairly easy one to concede by the United States because it was technically true. 
There was no official Chinese version of the letter, a deliberate tactic that allowed for politically necessary imprecision in China's domestic presentation. The embassy provided its own translation into Chinese of the letter, which revealed the complexity of precisely translating terms of contrition. 
The letter's first, general expression of "sincere regret" over the missing pilot is rendered in the embassy's Chinese version as "chengzhi de yihan," a close equivalent of the English. Then the letter asks the foreign minister to "please convey to the Chinese people and to the family of Pilot Wang Wei that we are very sorry for their loss." This time, "very sorry" is translated as "feichang wanxi," an expression of sorrowful condolences, but not one implying culpability.
The "very sorry" expressed in the letter for the unauthorized entry into Chinese airspace during the emergency landing is translated by the Americans as "feichang baoqian," which is a strong way to say "very sorry," but stops short of the acceptance of responsibility that China had demanded. 
Nowhere did the word for a full-fledged "apology" -- daoqian in Chinese -- appear, in the English version of the letter or in the Chinese translation released by the United States, apparently on its own. But in their public descriptions of the deal and letter tonight, Chinese officials and news writers tonight used other Chinese terms for "sorry" and "regret" without providing an entire, official translation of the letter, clearly hoping to emphasize how much the United States had backed down.
While there were no published claims that the United States had actually used the term "daoqian," an account of the letter by the New China News Agency translated "very sorry" twice, using another term that can imply some culpability as well as regret: "shen biao qianyi." This literally means to deeply express regrets or an apology. 
That particular usage is not used by the embassy in its own Chinese text of the letter. But in the official news agency's largely indirect account it is put in quotation marks, as though directly from the letter, and the Foreign Ministry spokesman repeatedly used this term when describing the American letter at a news conference tonight.

SINGAPORE'S GROWTH SLOWS

BYLINE:  By Wayne Arnold 

 BODY:
 Underscoring the impact of the United States slowdown on export-dependent East Asia, Singapore cut its forecast for economic growth this year by 1.5 percentage points, to a range of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent. 
First-quarter growth was at an unexpectedly low 4.6 percent annual rate, led by sluggishness in electronics manufacturing. Weak interest from bidders forced Singapore to call off plans this week to auction new cellular phone frequencies. Wayne Arnold

CONFUSION ON POTATO BAN

BYLINE:  By Anthony DePalma 

 BODY:
 Canada accused the United States of reneging at the last minute on a decision to relax a ban on imports of potatoes from Prince Edward Island, where potato wart, a rare fungus, was found in one field last fall. 
The fungus is not harmful to humans but it spreads easily and disfigures the potatoes. The agriculture minister, Lyle Vanclief, announced an easing of the ban based on a letter from American trade officials, but the American side said the letter had been misunderstood. At issue is a washing requirement that Canada says is too costly. Anthony DePalma

EMC Joins Motorola in Earnings Shortfall

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
The EMC Corporation, the leading vendor of data storage products for business, added its influential voice yesterday morning to the chorus of companies reporting that the economy both at home and in Europe has weakened further and more rapidly than anticipated this year.
 As a result of the slowdown, EMC said, it will report earnings and revenue slightly below Wall Street's expectations when it issues its quarterly figures next Thursday. The shortfall occurred despite an all-out effort at the end of the quarter by the company's famously aggressive sales force to "defy the economy" and meet projections, said Michael C. Ruettgers, EMC's chairman. 
 At the same time EMC was issuing its warning, Motorola was telling analysts in a conference call that it would lose even more money in the second quarter than the $206 million operating loss it reported Tuesday night for the first three months of the year. 
Motorola also increased by 4,000, to 26,000, the number of jobs it plans to eliminate as part of cost-cutting efforts that began late last year. It said that investments in new factories and machinery, which topped $4.1 billion last year, had been sliced to $1.4 billion this year and that a third of that had already been spent.
In an interview after the conference call, Robert L. Growney, Motorola's president and chief operating officer, said the Federal Reserve Bank should immediately cut interest rates by 1 percent to stimulate the economy. He also urged Congress to approve the Bush administration's tax-cut proposals.
When asked whether the Democratic alternative of immediate "rebates" to poor and middle-class citizens would not be a more potent lift, Mr. Growney said Motorola supported anything "that gives consumers some dollars."
The two technology bellwethers were not entirely downbeat. Motorola predicted that it would return to profitability in its cellular phone and semiconductor businesses in the second half of the year. It projected that overall demand for cell phones would climb to 425 million to 475 million units this year, an increase from the total of 410 million last year.
And EMC said that major customers were telling it that they had finished the task of reducing technology budgets to reflect the slowdown. Based on such research, EMC told Wall Street it was confident that its revenue growth would top 20 percent this year and that earnings per share would end up modestly higher than in 2000.
Investors appeared more upset with EMC's announcement. The company, which is the clear market leader in its fast-growing segment of the technology universe, said earnings per share would be 18 cents, 10 percent lower than Wall Street's consensus projections as monitored by Thomson Financial/First Call. EMC said revenue would climb 29 percent, to $2.35 billion. EMC's shares tumbled $2.19, to $32.21, on the Big Board.
The reduced expectations for the rest of the year -- EMC had been aiming for 25 percent to 35 percent revenue growth and sharply higher profits -- were welcomed by some analysts as a bullish development. "With lower guidance, they now have the leeway to attack competitors and increase market share," said James Berlino at Merrill Lynch.
But others said they feared that the company's attempt to meet the first-quarter targets had pulled forward sales that would have occurred in the current quarter, that the company was underestimating how much it would have to cut costs to fend off competitors or that it was simply too optimistic.
"You can't count on budgets staying put in this environment," said Laura Conigliaro of Goldman, Sachs, referring to EMC's confidence that its customers had settled their spending plans for the rest of the year.
Investors in Motorola appeared to have feared that the company's outlook would be even gloomier than it turned out to be. Motorola's shares held on to most of their gains from Tuesday's trading, ending yesterday down 10 cents at $12.90.
Motorola is three times the size of EMC by sales and is far more diversified. A far greater share of its business is dependent on consumer confidence, either directly, as in the cell phone segment, or indirectly, as in the case of its sales of microchips to automakers. Analysts said that Motorola's "visibility" -- Wall Street jargon for ability to project market conditions -- was especially poor and many questioned the company's projection yesterday that it would end up with modest profits for the year.
"If you are buying for the long run, Motorola's O.K.," said Edward Snyder, who follows the company for J. P. Morgan. "But the news will probably get worse before it gets better."

HEADLINE: Judge Deals Blow to Plans For Casinos 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A New York State judge dealt a major setback yesterday to a plan by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe to build a $500 million Las Vegas-style casino in the Catskills.
 The judge, Justice Joseph C. Teresi of State Supreme Court in Albany, ruled that Gov. George E. Pataki does not have the authority to sign gambling compacts with Indian tribes without first seeking approval from the State Legislature. 
 Governor Pataki, who had contended that he could unilaterally permit gambling operations by American Indian tribes, has long supported the development of Indian casinos in depressed former resort areas like the Catskills. The Mohawks and their partners, Park Place Entertainment, are seeking to develop their resort casino near Monticello, a town in Sullivan County that has fallen on hard times.
Despite the governor's support, proponents of gambling have long feared that casino projects will almost certainly fail in the Legislature, where Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader in the Senate, and many upstate Republicans have long been opposed to gambling.
The decision also undermines proposed casinos in Greene County and Niagara Falls, where political leaders had hoped that gambling would revive the local economies. But it does not affect the operations of the two American Indian casinos currently operating in the state, the Oneida tribe's Turning Stone casino in Verona, about 20 miles west of Utica, and the smaller Mohawk casino on the Akwesasne reservation near the Canadian border. 
Governor Pataki's office vowed to fight the ruling.
"We're reviewing the decision," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, "and we expect to appeal immediately."
Justice Teresi ruled that Mr. Pataki and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo before him had "crossed the line of executive power and entered into the domain of the Legislature without proper mandate or authority." He said the governor would have to obtain legislative approval before signing a gambling compact with a tribe. 
Although Indian land is considered sovereign territory and therefore is not subject to New York's prohibition of casino gambling, Justice Teresi also permanently prohibited the state from spending money to expand the Turning Stone and Akwesasne operations.
He noted that tribal gambling compacts in Kansas, Michigan, Rhode Island and New Mexico were invalidated by the highest court in each state because they lacked legislative approval.
The opponents of gambling who brought the lawsuit -- a mix of horse racing interests, Atlantic City casino operators and people who say they have moral objections to gambling -- declared victory.
"It seems to put an end to Sullivan County gambling for the near future," said Jay Goldberg, a lawyer for the antigambling groups. "The ruling affirms the power of the Legislature to speak for the people."
Donald J. Trump, for one, was jubilant. He predicted that the Legislature would be nowhere near as sympathetic to Indian casinos as the governor had been. Mr. Trump has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying against Indian casinos in New York, which might siphon patrons from his three casinos in Atlantic City.
"I think it'll be very tough to get this through the Legislature," Mr. Trump said.
Bradley S. Waterman, a lawyer for the St. Regis Mohawks, said the ruling was both "a setback and a disappointment." 
"We have some significant hurdles to negotiate," Mr. Waterman said. "Now we have one more."
Park Place executives did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment yesterday.
Only 16 days ago, the tribe had announced that it had made significant progress on its plans for a large casino and 750-room hotel at Kutsher's Resort and Country Club in Monticello, about 80 miles from New York City. The Mohawks and Park Place, the largest casino company in the world, had formally filed an application with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to transfer land to the tribe and build the casino. Governor Pataki and the federal government had not approved the new application before the justice's ruling. 
Under federal law, tribes can appeal to the Secretary of the Interior if a state refuses to permit a casino. But it is a lengthy process and the Mohawk tribal chiefs and Park Place also face lawsuits by both dissident Mohawks and the tribe's former casino partners. 
The Mohawk chiefs had rejected their longtime partners, Catskill Development, shortly after they obtained initial federal approval for a casino in Monticello a year ago. Park Place filed a new application last month for the Kutsher's location near Monticello.
The Monticello project would be the third American Indian casino in New York. Governor Cuomo approved the Oneida tribe's Turning Stone casino in the mid-1990's and signed a gambling compact with the Mohawks in 1993. Governor Pataki amended the Mohawk compact two years ago to allow video gambling machines at the reservation's casino in exchange for a state share of revenues.
But gambling opponents mounted new efforts to stop the spread of casinos, as the Mohawks' project in Monticello was nearing federal approval.
Thirteen months ago, Justice Teresi threw out two lawsuits brought by antigambling groups that accused the governor of violating the state's constitution by allowing the St. Regis Mohawks to operate a casino. Without addressing the constitutional issues, the justice ruled at that time that the suits were deficient because they did not name the Mohawks as defendants.
But last August, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled that Justice Teresi's decision to throw out the case was "harsh" and that he had abused his discretion. The court also ruled that the various antigambling groups had standing to challenge the gambling compacts.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: MIDWESTERNERS; 
A Readiness to Let Bygones Be Bygones

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 11 

 BODY:
What a difference a day makes.
 On Tuesday, before China and the United States reached an agreement to allow the release of the crew of an American spy plane, people interviewed here were angry and frustrated. 
Though few were prepared to advocate a military solution to solve the crisis, many threatened to take personal economic action by boycotting Kmart and other retailers that sell Chinese-made goods. 
Yet by breakfast this morning, among Republicans and Democrats, blue- and white-collar workers and retirees, Kansas City is letting bygones be bygones. 
"I don't think the Chinese man in the street is a warmonger," said Leonard Gorter, 69, a retired insurance agent. 
Edward Story, 75, a veteran of World War II, was equally positive, and equally willing to move on. 
"I was just numb" worrying about how the dispute would be resolved, said Mr. Story, a Republican who lives in the overwhelmingly Republican suburb of Overland Park, Kan.. 
"But one thing Bush has done is surround himself with a lot of brilliant men, and ladies. We handled it correctly.
The Chinese handled it well, too, he said. "I thought they would stall a month or two," he said. "As for the plane, you can scratch that off. The Chinese will take it apart, and we won't get anything back but the hubcaps." If it had been a Chinese plane in American territory, he said, "we'd be all over it too, like a bunch of ants."
Outside a Kmart on the north side of the Missouri River, Dave Saunders, 57, a self-employed appliance repairman, welcomed the return of the crew. Though he did not vote for George W. Bush, he praised the president. 
"I think Bush handled it as well as could be expected," he said. "I think we should get the plane back, but I don't think we should go to war over it."
He added that he would probably avoid purchasing Chinese-made goods from the Kmart behind him -- but not because of this month's dispute. 
Buying American products protects American jobs, he said. There was also the question of quality: "If it's for permanent use, I buy American made."
Around Kansas City, the nature of the American apology was a subject of debate. 
"You can't just say, 'Sorry the accident happened,' " said Pam St. Thomas, 44, of Olathe, Kan., a Kansas City suburb, who was having lunch at a mall.
At another table Margaret Fancher, 53, whose son was wounded in Desert Storm, disagreed. "To say 'I won't apologize' is ridiculous," she said before the wording of the American statement was published. "I would hope we would be more humble."
But with peace and commerce at stake, people found they could be flexible. 
On Tuesday, after President Bush expanded his expressions of regret to encompass the plane's unauthorized landing on Chinese soil, Jim Gilmore, owner of a State Farm insurance office in Overland Park, and his daughter, Lori Emerick, the office manager, had mixed feelings about apologizing.
By this morning, however, both felt Mr. Bush and China had settled on a suitable compromise. 
"We didn't apologize," Mr. Gilmore said. "It was like bumping into each other in the elevator. You say 'Sorry' or 'Excuse me.' That's basically all we did. In my view, Bush handled it just perfectly."
Ms. Emerick, 34 and an Air Force veteran, said that on Tuesday, she was prepared to join the boycott. "But no, not now," she said. 
Besides, her own household economy today is bound up with China's. "If American goods are available," she said, "I will still buy them. But half the time they're not there."

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Taiwan Arms Sales and China's W.T.O. Application Will Test a Relationship

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
Now that the Bush administration has resolved its first diplomatic test with China, an important question remains about what the episode says about the administration's still-evolving China policy and the relationship between the countries. 
 Within the next few weeks, the relationship faces two tests as the Bush administration must decide which weapons systems to sell to Taiwan and how to reignite China's stalled drive to join the World Trade Organization. 
 The release of the spy plane's crew almost certainly means that the incident will not create a permanent rift in Sino-American relations, and might even serve a positive end by reminding both sides that they stand to lose a great deal unless they begin a major push to find common ground, several American diplomats and China experts said today.
"There is no way to get away from this without some residue, mainly the public attitudes toward us in China and our public's attitude toward China," said Samuel R. Berger, who served as national security adviser under President Clinton. "But the people who believe in relations between these two countries prevailed over those who see it only in nationalistic terms, and I think that's a positive sign." 
James R. Lilley, a former United States ambassador to China, said that every recent American president, whether by accident or miscalculation, "gets himself in a terrible mess with China to start things off." 
The silver lining, he said, is that a sharp slide in relations usually prompts a frantic scramble to consult each other more, to open lines of communications and to consider each other's strategic interests. President Reagan, President Bush and President Clinton each began terms with a China crisis, and each left saying he had built a much closer relationship than the one he had at the start of their terms. 
"I think you're going to see this administration reaching out to China on North Korea, on the W.T.O., and on a range of strategic and economic issues," Mr. Lilley said. "China badly needs to be included in these efforts, and we badly need to have a strategic dialogue with China." 
The broader question for Sino-American relations is whether incidents like the spy plane episode and the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, as well as disagreements over Taiwan and human rights, are manageable rifts that distract from an otherwise solid relationship. If not, the almost seemingly endless succession of crises is likely to have a cumulative impact, like a roller coaster on which the uphill climb keeps getting longer and the downhill plunge steeper. 
"I think we should view this mainly as a diplomatic management problem," said Stapleton Roy, a longtime State Department Asia expert and former China ambassador. It is a "period in which all kinds of episodes need to be handled, and the question is whether they will be handled skillfully." 
Other experts said the latest episode is unlikely to be forgotten quickly. The involvement of American military personnel brings the strains in relations home to average American more vividly than any crisis since Tiananmen Square, which received weeks of saturation coverage by network television and made China's political instability a household concern. The tone of the relationship, at least for a time, should reflect American concerns about China's direction, these people said.
"I think our response going forward has to be quite cool," said Winston Lord, a former China ambassador and State Department official who oversaw East Asia policy during the earlier Clinton administration. "We need to make it clear to the Chinese that there's a residue of annoyance over their performance." 
Mr. Lord said the two sides should try to restore a full dialogue on international strategic issues, including nuclear issues in South Asia and stability in the Persian Gulf, but that the Bush team should not give China the impression that the two sides are back to business as usual.
In some ways, President Bush had already put China on notice that it could not expect the same sort of attentive diplomacy it received at the end of Mr. Clinton's term. Mr. Bush came to office saying he had abandoned the Clinton administration's aspiration to make China a "strategic partner." Instead, he called the nation a "strategic competitor," a term that translates harshly in Chinese. 
The change in tone was similar to vows by President Reagan and President Clinton to change the terms of the relationship with China. Mr. Reagan told the Chinese that he intended to stand firmly behind America's old friends in Taiwan, China's rival, which prompted diplomatic warring that ended only after Mr. Reagan signed the Shanghai Communique in 1982, a document in which the United States promised to phase out arms sales to the island.
Mr. Clinton came to office promising to challenge China on human rights and to link China's treatment of its own people to the extension of its trading privileges. That approach quickly backfired when the Chinese jailed several dissidents and effectively challenged the United States to withdraw its trading rights. Mr. Clinton ended up abandoning the link.
Wordplay did not cause the accident over the South China Sea. But some experts said it showed how even subtle changes in approach could strain ties.
Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president, had to corral growing anti-American sentiment in his own leadership ranks, a task made harder by the perception that the United States had downgraded China ties and taken a tougher line on a range of diplomatic issues. "The Bush administration in its early comments may have been talking to the American right, but that hardened some positions in China," Mr. Berger said.
Many other experts gave high marks to Mr. Bush and his top aides for their handling of the incident. "Judicious, careful, firm," was Mr. Lilley's review. Mr. Roy said he thought Mr. Bush managed this episode better than Mr. Clinton handled the Belgrade embassy bombing.
But the next few weeks will bring fresh tests. The most sensitive is how to handle Taiwan's annual request to buy arms. Taiwan has long hoped to purchase the Aegis missile defense system, while China has said it will consider that sale an egregious affront to its sovereignty. A decision is expected later this month.
Most China watchers had been expecting Mr. Bush to sell Taiwan several items on its weapons wish list, but not the Aegis. But one former Clinton administration official who has studied the question said the administration may now decide to sell the Aegis system as a way of demonstrating that there was no quid pro quo for the release of the American military personnel.
"I think this incident could and perhaps should up the ante on Taiwan," the official said.
Mr. Lilley said that the arms sales question threatened to send the two nations into a fresh round of crisis management. But he said the Bush administration should find a way to delay the decision until tempers cool and the new administration has a chance to study options in depth.
The Bush team had been working to restore momentum in another area of common interest: China's bid to join the World Trade Organization. Negotiations in Geneva stalled over a variety of issues, including agricultural subsidies, and some experts feel China has delayed its final accession to the trade group because it is not ready to carry out the concessions it has made to gain entry.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
China's Bonus: Attention, and Respect

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 11 

 BODY:
As the American crew members head home, the Chinese must be satisfied with the spoils of their latest run-in with the United States. The Chinese government acquired secrets from the downed spy plane, of course, but also something far more coveted: attention from the new Bush administration, and a bit of respect. 
 Ever since George W. Bush took office in January, with the promise to downgrade China's standing in America's Asia policy, Chinese ranging from ministry officials to street vendors had felt diminished and insulted. 
 Chinese consider their country an emerging power, and were pleased that the Clinton administration treated it as such. 
But the Bush administration had paid so little heed to China that it has no high-level China experts in its ranks -- a handicap last week, when the 24 Americans abruptly found themselves detained on Chinese soil. The administration lacked familiarity with Chinese politics and senior staff members experienced in negotiating with Beijing.
Now, with the spy plane incident resolved and President Bush himself calling for a "fruitful and productive relationship," many Chinese believe that the new American president is coming around.
"I think people are becoming happier with President Bush," said Xiao Gongqin, a professor of history and a social commentator at Shanghai Normal University. "He is shifting from his initial stance about China as he has learned more about our country and had more experience with it -- just as President Clinton did."
Mr. Clinton was also elected on a promise to get tough with China, but by his second term was touting a "strategic partnership," cultivating closer diplomatic and economic ties.
Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago said, "Before, from President Bush, it was just 'they're competitors,' and they deliberately excluded China people from the administration. Now channels are open and they are learning that this relationship requires a lot of attention and adaptation."
The Chinese have good reason to feel offended, many scholars say.
Most of the highest-ranking Bush foreign policy appointments are cold war veterans, more familiar with the former Soviet Union. The senior Asia advisers are specialists in Japan, Indonesia or Taiwan.
The appointee with the most China experience is Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, the American ambassador, who came to Beijing as a neophyte two years ago. While he has won high marks for his work since then, he is a holdover from the Clinton administration with just a few weeks left on the job.
"The current U.S. regime hasn't taken China seriously -- they haven't even regarded it as a player," said Anthony J. Saich, a China specialist at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
That dismissive attitude was confirmed for many Chinese by Mr. Bush's brusque initial remarks after the collision between the American spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet, in which a Chinese pilot was lost. He demanded a prompt return of the American plane and crew and later insisted there would be no apology. 
"The Americans are so willful to demand that we release the crew and return the plane," said Wu Shenyi, a driver for a Beijing company, last week. "They think we are soft persimmons. But we are not!
"I hope this time President Jiang will stiffen his spine," he said, referring to China's president, Jiang Zemin.
But Chinese analysts said the public anger was both predictable and avoidable. And that Mr. Bush's initially harsh public statements undercut President Jiang, who has promoted closer ties with the United States, and narrowed the Chinese leader's room to negotiate.
"They don't really understand China, so they don't know how to deal with it" said Xiong Zhiyong, dean of China's Foreign Affairs College. Private discussions, he said, would probably have been more effective than public accusations. "Hopefully they have learned from this -- hopefully both sides have."
But this incident has provided the Bush administration with a crash course in Chinese sensibilities.
Lesson One involved China's heightened sense of national pride and grievance, nurtured by its modern history of foreign domination.
"China has a long history of occupation by foreign powers and so nationalism is a very big force here," Professor Xiao said. "So when a foreign plane is skirting around our borders, we're sensitive -- some might say too sensitive -- about that."
Nationalism has only intensified with the waning of Communist ideology. "The Americans should know that the life of the Chinese pilot is as precious as their crew members, and he'll be forever remembered as our national hero," Zhang Wei, an office worker at Capital Normal University, said this past weekend. "I'm not calling for blood debts to be paid in blood, but the U.S. government must act in ways that cool this indignation."
Another lesson is that diplomatic solutions must allow China to maintain face, both before the outside world and its own people. American planes were spying along China's border, a Chinese pilot was dead. And many Chinese were offended that Mr. Bush had not even picked up his hotline, set up by Presidents Jiang and Clinton in 1998, to try to work things out.
They noted that after NATO warplanes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, Mr. Clinton called Mr. Jiang on the hotline -- although the latter refused to take the call.
When negotiations seemed at a standstill, many Chinese said it was obvious how to break the impasse.
"President Bush needs to send a special envoy -- someone important -- to China to deal with the crisis," a liberal foreign policy writer said. "This is not about an airplane, it's about face, and China needs a signal that it is taken seriously." 
In the last few days, with the round-the-clock negotiations and expressions of regret, Mr. Bush was giving the Chinese a bit more of what they wanted. China mattered.
"The Americans might have felt there's not reason to apologize since they feel there's been no error," said Wang Su, a university student, while acknowledging that culpability might be difficult to sort out.
"But we feel this incident occurred and we suffered a loss. So why not give the government some face with an apology?"

HEADLINE: Green Calls for Efforts to Make Brooklyn a Hub of City Business 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Mark Green called yesterday for economic incentives, including changes in zoning and tax laws, to transform downtown Brooklyn into an economic hub in New York. One of four Democrats hoping to succeed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the fall election, Mr. Green said Mr. Giuliani's economic policies had favored Manhattan and had failed to prepare the city for the emerging digital economy. 
 Mr. Green, the city's public advocate, delivered his address in Manhattan, where he lives, but he devoted much of it to ways to help Brooklyn, the city's most populous borough, saying it was best situated to become the third center of business activity in the city. 
 The 29-minute speech, which his aides described as a major economic policy address, was delivered to a small audience of students and supporters in a lecture room at Baruch College, and was largely low-key except for its attacks on Mr. Giuliani's economic policies. Mr. Green said that, New York's recent economic boom notwithstanding, City Hall had done "next to nothing" to compete for what Mr. Green called "I.T.," or information technology.
"When is a cogent, innovative, future-oriented strategy and vision for our city and region coming from City Hall?" Mr. Green asked. "There is none. Other cities are planning to attract digital firms and biofirms while we are fiddling around with stadiums and skyboxes."
He said Brooklyn could be transformed into a major business district if the city changed zoning regulations that strictly separate residential and manufacturing districts.
Mr. Green's remarks drew a rebuke from Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, Sunny Mindel. Pointing out that Mr. Green was a part of the Dinkins administration, when the city lost 340,000 jobs, Ms. Mindel said, "It's somewhat odd and unseemly that Mark Green would criticize the Giuliani administration, during which growth in New York has been consistent and outpaced the rest of the country." 
The other Democratic candidates for mayor -- Peter F. Vallone, Fernando Ferrer and Alan G. Hevesi -- also drew attention to their candidacies yesterday. Mr. Vallone, the City Council speaker, introduced legislation to require the police to disclose monthly statistics on stop-and-frisks, traffic stops, police misconduct and other activities, broken down by race and gender. 
Campaign aides to Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, criticized Bruce J. Teitelbaum, a senior political adviser to Mr. Giuliani and a supporter of Mr. Hevesi, for telling The Jewish Week, a New York newspaper, that Jewish voters should be concerned that so many Dinkins supporters were now backing Mr. Ferrer. He added that if Jewish community leaders are asked how they were treated during the Dinkins administration, "They will say, 'Not well.' "
John Del Cecato, a spokesman for Mr. Ferrer, described the remarks as "shamefully divisive and polarizing" and called on Mr. Hevesi to repudiate them. Mr. Hevesi said he "disagreed very strongly" with Mr. Teitelbaum, adding: "I think these are very unhelpful and divisive remarks and he should not have said them."

China Spy Plane Crisis Ends With Release of Americans
The United States and China resolved their standoff after President Bush approved compromise language saying the United States was "very sorry" for the loss of a Chinese pilot, and for an American spy plane's emergency landing on Chinese soil. But in a letter to Beijing, Washington accepted no responsibility for the midair collision. Twenty-one men and three women boarded a Continental Airlines plane and landed in Guam shortly after midnight Eastern time, ending 11 days in Chinese custody that began when their spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet.

HEADLINE: Is This the Budget We Want? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Freezing Government" (editorial, April 11): 
 I fail to see how President Bush's budget request limiting growth in spending for discretionary social programs to "only 4 percent" is such a problem. 
You seem to criticize the fact that under Mr. Bush's plan, the rate of growth in government spending does not outstrip inflation.
I see a problem with the fact that government spending has grown faster than the rate of economic growth and the rate of inflation during the Clinton years. Income taxes as a proportion of gross domestic product are higher now than ever. Americans are paying nearly as high a percentage of the G.D.P. in all federal taxes now as they did in 1944 at the height of World War II.
Given that situation, it seems bizarre to criticize a budget that "only" increases discretionary spending by the approximate rate of inflation.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: WASHINGTON; 
Delicate Diplomatic Dance Ends Bush's First Crisis

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
The United States and China resolved their standoff today after President Bush approved compromise language saying the United States was "very sorry" for the loss of a Chinese pilot, and for an American spy plane's emergency landing on Chinese soil. But in a letter to Beijing, Washington accepted no responsibility for the midair collision on April 1 that now seems certain to color Mr. Bush's next encounters with China.
 According to aides involved in the intense negotiations, Mr. Bush drew "red lines" around two issues: He said he would not bargain on American arms sales to Taiwan, nor agree to alter Washington's increasingly frequent aerial surveillance of China's military. Today they said he had stuck to that. 
 But it was far from clear that Mr. Bush's strategy of non-apology and limited negotiations would work until 5:40 this morning, when the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, called Mr. Bush to say China had asked for a "final copy" of the American letter and would release the crew later in the day. 
"This has been a difficult situation for both our countries," Mr. Bush said in announcing an end to the standoff. "I know that the American people join me in expressing sorrow for the loss of life of a Chinese pilot."
From early this morning, when Mr. Bush's announcement was made in a half-empty White House press room, until tonight, when he watched on television in the Air Force One conference room as the crew in Hainan boarded a plane to return to the United States, the president seemed more relieved than anything.
Back in the White House, a senior official who was deeply involved in the negotiations was watching the same image. "The strategy was to make very clear what America needed, and then to give the Chinese time to get there," he said.
But China's leaders only made the final decision, he argued, when Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell began warning -- albeit vaguely -- that Washington's broader economic and diplomatic relationship with China was at risk. "We had to let them decide whether they wanted to threaten the relationship," the official said. "They decided they didn't want to do that, and I think they came to the right decision." 
The turning point appeared to come over the weekend. On Saturday, after reviewing an early draft of a letter of regret, the Chinese asked for something stronger than "sorry" to describe American feelings about the death of the Chinese fighter pilot whose plane collided with the EC-3.
In a conference call at 1 a.m. Sunday, aides suggested trying "very sorry." Mr. Bush was informed of that formulation at Camp David, and agreed. 
But it wasn't clear for some time whether that would be acceptable to the Chinese, and it was not until 1 a.m. this morning, Washington time, that Ms. Rice was informed that Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, the American ambassador to Beijing, would be called in for a final discussion with Chinese diplomats.
Although the White House was not discussing it much, Mr. Bush had to give ground as well in the negotiations. The letter of regret was negotiated and delivered in English only. That allowed Chinese newscasters to offer their own translations of "very sorry," which sounded closer to the apology that China had demanded. 
And then there was the airplane itself. On Monday and Tuesday last week, Mr. Bush demanded the release of not only the crew, but also the plane and its equipment -- intact. The president never discussed the plane in public today, and it remains on the runway in Hainan.
One administration official said tonight that he was not sure whether it was worth recovering now, apparently meaning that the multimillion-dollar plane had been picked over by the Chinese, who have gleaned whatever intelligence they can from the hardware. (Crew members reported last week that they had deleted codes, programs and data, and destroyed some equipment, as the crippled plane was landing, according to Pentagon officials.)
Tonight the Pentagon's spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, took a stronger line on the aircraft. "That is U.S. property," he said, "and we want it back."
At a meeting to be held on Wednesday in Beijing -- a location that China insisted on -- the two governments will begin talking about the causes of the collision, ways to avoid its repetition and what the American letter calls "a plan for prompt return of the EP-3 aircraft." 
Within days Mr. Bush will have to confront another crucial issue: When to resume reconnaissance flights. 
A senior military official said the American commander in the Pacific, Adm. Dennis C. Blair, had submitted a request to the Pentagon to conduct a flight later this week. That request is now before Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and awaits approval from President Bush's national security advisers, the official said.
"His argument is, No. 1, we have a right to do it, and No. 2, that we need to do it to prevent surprises, to better understand China's military growth," the official said.
But China will also be on the alert for such flights, which have been a source of increasingly dangerous aerial confrontations for the past six months. Pentagon officials said there had been no discussion of providing the next reconnaissance plane with fighter escorts, for fear that would be considered provocative.
Sometime in the next few weeks Mr. Bush will also have to decide whether to provide advanced arms to Taiwan -- including destroyers equipped with sophisticated Aegis defense systems. That was a difficult decision two weeks ago; it is even more complex now.
Before the collision, Mr. Bush's aides had signaled to Congress that they would sell advanced Kidd-class destroyers to Taiwan, but defer a decision on the Aegis system. That would leave China some diplomatic room, the officials said, and not prompt an even faster buildup of its missile forces aimed at Taiwan.
Now, if Mr. Bush goes ahead with that decision to sell only the Kidd-class destroyers, he opens himself to accusations from conservatives that he has backed off after a bruising encounter with Beijing. "I hope he just does what he thinks is right, and doesn't just follow the compass to the right," said Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat.
Should Mr. Bush decide to sell the weapons to Taiwan, he now has an additional problem: His relationship with President Jiang Zemin of China, a world leader he has never spoken with over the telephone, much less met, could be threatened. 
"In the Chinese view, Jiang went way out there to get the crew back," said one State Department official who has argued against selling Taiwan the Aegis. "If we go ahead with the full sale now, he will feel we undercut him, to put it mildly."
There is every likelihood that the rhetorical exchanges with Beijing may heat up now that the detained Americans -- the administration never called them hostages -- are off Chinese soil.
"We'll tell them the plane, under international law and custom, is sovereign property and that they have grossly violated international law by keeping it," one military officer said. As soon as reconnaissance flights resume, a senior American diplomat predicted, "we'll be hearing a lot from the Chinese about our renewed violations of their sovereignty."
But for now Mr. Bush and his aides are concentrating on the short-term task of reuniting the crew members with their families and reassuring senior members of the House and Senate, and the American people, that there were no secret deals. 
Tonight, appearing on "Nightline" on ABC, Ms. Rice said: "I can absolutely assure the American people that the release of this crew was obtained only based on what was in this letter" and that no other issues were "placed on the table or bartered away." 
Mr. Bush was in the Oval Office by 7 a.m. today, and made the announcement in the press room that the standoff had ended just before leaving the White House at 8:30. He then took Air Force One to North Carolina, toured a technology center at a middle school and then touted his budget priorities. After his speech, Mr. Bush met in the school library with Robert and Sandra Blocher, whose son Steven is one of the 24 crew members. 
"They raised a boy who loves his country, and we owe a debt of gratitude to not only the servicemen and women, but to their parents as well," he said of the Blochers. 
As negotiations to end the standoff proceeded, the White House rejected offers of help from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, though there were plenty of conversations with former President George Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, officials say.
Another central player was General Powell, whose State Department took command of the negotiations, and who was the first to publicly use the phrases "sorry" and "sorrow," which turned out to be the diplomatic key. Reviewing the last-minute flurry of diplomacy that led to the agreement today, General Powell, who was in Paris on his way to the Balkans, said the United States had nothing to apologize for.
"With respect to 'regret,' 'sorry,' 'very sorry' -- they were related to very specific things," he said. "To the loss of the young Chinese pilot's life. The death of anyone diminishes us all in some way, and so we were expressing the fact we were 'sorry,' 'very sorry,' 'regret' the loss of his life."
The second thing that these words related to, he said, concerned the question of the American plane entering Chinese airspace. 
"We entered their airspace without permission," he said. "But the young pilot was faced with a crisis, his plane was badly damaged. He had to get on the ground. The niceties and formalities were unavailable to him at that moment." 
General Powell said the pilot did "a marvelous job" of getting the plane on the ground. "He landed without permission," he continued, "and we're very sorry -- but we're glad he did."

Nursing a Shortage

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
The nation is currently engulfed in a huge nursing shortage, which is going to get worse. The baby boomers are long since inured to the idea that when they retire, nobody is going to want to give them Social Security. But they may not have been informed that when they get old and go into a hospital, there will probably not be anybody on the ward who's authorized to dole out medication.
 "We're projecting a 400,000-nurse shortage in 20 years," said Douglas Staiger, an economics professor at Dartmouth who is co-author of a series of much-quoted articles on the future of nursing. 
 This is not the first time the United States has run low on trained health care workers. Back in the late 80's, on a flight to London, I sat next to an actress who was supporting her art by working as an Irish nurse bounty-hunter. She'd fly over to Dublin and recruit nurses for New York City hospitals, which paid her by the head.
"It's very lucrative," she told me.
Of course, that was a long time ago, when George Bush was president. The nursing shortage got so bad that hospitals were forced to raise salaries and improve working conditions. Miraculously, this caused more people to register for nursing schools, and more trained nurses to go back into the field. Soon things were so swell that the hospitals were able to put a lid on salaries and lay off staff. 
And now here we are again. But this time nobody really expects to see a rebound. "When I was a girl, everybody who did well in school went into nursing or teaching. The last 25 years is a different story," says Mary McDonald, a former nursing instructor who's now writing a book on nursing school testing.
It was only in the 19th century that respectable American women were allowed to work for pay, and their natural fields were deemed to be teaching and nursing. Women, the authority figures decreed, had an innate capacity for nurturing -- low-cost nurturing.
"To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for one half or even less the salary which men will ask," Catherine Beecher said in the 1850's. (Beecher felt so strongly that women should be confined to womanly activities and kept out of public life that she traveled all over the country, writing opinion pieces for the newspapers and testifying before Congress to make her point.) William Alcott, a physician and reformer, urged that as many women as possible be trained in nursing so they could provide free care to every American who became sick. It apparently never occurred to him that they might consider charging.
We know, in theory, that our hospitals and schools have always been staffed by cheap female labor. But we haven't really grappled with what happens to the health care and education systems when the captive pool of future teachers and nurses dries up.
Now all of a sudden the last generation that figured it was teach, nurse or maybe enter a convent is middle-aged. "The average age of a nurse in California is 47," said Jan Emerson of the California Healthcare Association. (California hospitals have empty slots for 20 percent of their nursing positions. The state has never trained nearly enough nurses to meet its own needs. It may be the sixth-largest economy in the world, but a place that exports movies and kiwi fruit and imports nurses and electricity cannot be feeling all that self-confident.) 
Nursing is being reshaped by market forces, in a society that still doesn't quite believe that the old days are over. The average salary for a nurse right now is somewhere between $40,000 and $45,000. The hospitals, in an age of tight budgets and managed care, think that's fair. But from now on, a fair salary is going to be whatever it costs to get qualified people in the profession. 
Right now hospitals try to use paraprofessionals for patient care, and save their scarce R.N.'s for supervising and handling crises. But most of the nurses went into the business to take care of patients. They're unhappy, and they're spreading the word. This is no different from the teachers, who complain that the pressure of the standardized test mania has taken all the fun out of their jobs. Management has a right to be efficient and demand results, as long as everybody remembers that the nurses of the future have a right to sign up for dentistry or accounting.

HEADLINE: Recession Coming? The Prospect Seems Less Terrorizing 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
"I HEAR, but I do not listen."
So said Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, this week as the bank ignored the chorus of pleas that it cut interest rates.
 The inaction confounded, among others, the German government, which sees its economy weakening and fears that the American slowdown will damage Europe. Before the central bank met, the majority view in financial markets was that the bank would ease credit a bit by cutting its benchmark interest rate a quarter-point. Some forecast a larger reduction. Both groups were wrong. 
 What should we make of Mr. Duisenberg? One interpretation is that he is determined to get a reputation for toughness for the bank and that public pressure from politicians makes him that much less willing to lower rates.
The other is that he thinks all the fuss is overstated. Perhaps he recalls the panic in financial markets in 1998 after the Russian devaluation and default. The widely expected worldwide recession never appeared. So far the economic data in Europe, unlike here, does not show that a sharp slowdown has arrived.
The sense that the American slowdown may not turn out to be that big a deal also seems to be spreading here. The National Bureau of Economic Research, which certifies recessions, says it sees no need to even discuss whether one began late last year. Optimists hope that the inventory correction is nearing an end.
In corporate America, there is hope even as companies cut back. "The current period that we are managing through is challenging, but it is temporary," said Timothy Koogle, the soon-to-be-replaced chief executive of Yahoo, which is firing 12 percent of its employees.
Yahoo's stock rose. So did shares of Motorola, which said this quarter looks worse than the last one, when it had its first loss in 15 years. Things can't get much worse, the market seems to be saying, so this is a good time to buy.
The stock market usually hits bottom long before recessions end, and often before the bureau discovers they have begun, so there may be something to that. Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, says large technology stocks may rebound after their huge declines. "The precipitous declines after bubbles burst always end with the bubble stocks still expensive," he said. They then get cheap over a longer period, punctuated by rallies that eventually fade. That could be happening now.
But even if the stock market does not resume its slide, this is likely to be a summer of negative headlines for the economy, with consumers cutting back amid rising unemployment. New unemployment claims are running more than 40 percent ahead of levels a year ago, the first such increase since 1991, in the midst of recession.
The coming economic woes will be felt most by companies that rely on consumer spending. The fall in retail sales in March will not be the last such decline.
The slowdown will end, perhaps having earned the title of recession and perhaps not, but the revival is not going to be an impressive one. Much of the boom was bubble-related, and working off those excesses will take time. 
The comfortable belief that America's problems will end soon, and that they will do so little damage internationally that there is no need for the European Central Bank to act, sounds awfully complacent.
Mr. Duisenberg may not be hard of hearing. But Europe may soon wish he had been a better listener.

HEADLINE: In Peru Trial, Ex-Associate Contradicts New Yorker 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 12 

 BODY:
If they were once lovers, they are not saying. But the destinies of Lori Berenson and Pacifico Castrellon were very much entwined this week in the terrorism trial that will decide Ms. Berenson's fate. 
 Seven years ago, as a former M.I.T. student with a passion for radical politics, Ms. Berenson met Mr. Castrellon, a middle-aged Panamanian painter and architect, in Panama City. They traveled together to Ecuador and then to Peru, sharing hotel rooms along the way. 
 Finally, in Lima, they rented a large house eventually used as a terrorist base for a plot by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement to take the entire Congress hostage. When Peru's police discovered the conspiracy, the two were arrested. After a gun battle at the house that left two guerrillas and a policeman dead, they were sent to jail for long prison terms.
This week Ms. Berenson, a 31-year-old New Yorker, and Mr. Castrellon, now 54, met again in a jailhouse courtroom, with him the principal prosecution witness against her in a retrial that could sentence her to 20 years as a terrorist collaborator. Given a life sentence in 1996 by a secret military court that did not allow her lawyer to cross-examine witnesses, she was granted a new trial late last year, after years of pressure from the United States.
During most of Mr. Castrellon's first two days of testimony, Ms. Berenson sat calmly, almost expressionless, as he spoke into a microphone some 10 feet away.
While she has testified that they shared the rent for the house, he said their rent, food and a shared car were paid for by the terrorists.
As Ms. Berenson tells it, she and Mr. Castrellon met and decided to travel together while she was a tourist in Panama.
Mr. Castrellon says he was down on his luck and unemployed when a Panamanian leftist activist told him about some people who wanted to meet him and offer him work for a "socioeconomic study."
He says he then met Ms. Berenson, who traveled with him to Quito, Ecuador, and introduced him to a man who called himself Carlos but was actually Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, the top Tupac Amaru military commander.
Mr. Castrellon, who hopes that his own future retrial will reduce his sentence, painted a picture of Ms. Berenson as a go-between for Mr. Cerpa. He also says he was suspicious about the presence of 18 men who occupied the fourth floor of the rented Lima house with Ms. Berenson's consent. She says she did not know that the people living one floor above her bedroom were terrorists.
The only consequential interchange between Ms. Berenson and Mr. Castrellon was an exchange of smiles when he told the prosecutor and three judges that he found nothing unusual in having shared hotel rooms with her even though they were not lovers. He described their relationship as one of "friendship and work," although he later said it cooled around the time he moved from his fourth-floor bedroom to a tiny room beside the garage.
Jose Sandoval, Ms. Berenson's lawyer, disputed Mr. Castrellon's account, saying, "He is seeking to free himself of all responsibility." 
In her testimony, Ms. Berenson said she had never known the real names of the terrorists, or that the woman she hired as a photographer was really married to Mr. Cerpa. Ms. Berenson says she repeatedly went to Congress to do interviews for two magazines, but the prosecution says she was using her press credentials as a cover to case the building.
Investigators say they have a drawing of the congressional seating arrangement scrawled by Ms. Berenson, but she disputes its authenticity.
Mr. Castrellon, who spends much of his time in prison painting and is to continue testifying next week, is expected to repeat an allegation he made to the police five years ago that Ms. Berenson served food to the rebels on the fourth floor, where she says she did not venture.
Many parts of Mr. Castrellon's story appear vulnerable to cross-examination.
He describes himself as an innocent man duped by the terrorists, never active in politics and unaware of the plot to attack Congress.
Yet the rebels rented him a separate apartment, where he drew detailed street maps of the area around the Congress and began building a cardboard model of the Congress building. 
Mr. Castrellon says he eventually discovered he was among guerrillas but feared retribution against his family if he fled.
"I don't believe he was fooled," said Mr. Sandoval. "Castrellon is lying in many ways."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fall, Stirring Rate Hopes 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12 

 BODY:
Prices paid to producers edged down in March, the Labor Department said today, in a report seen as a further inducement for Federal Reserve policy makers to keep lowering interest rates.
 The report, the Producer Price Index, measuring prices paid to businesses for goods like clothing and gasoline, declined 0.1 percent last month, reflecting lower energy prices. 
It was the first decrease since a 0.1 percent drop last August. 
 Excluding food and energy costs, the so-called core index rose 0.1 percent, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. 
The statistics "were good news," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New York, "so there is no inflationary problem." 
Energy prices at the producer level fell 2.6 percent in March after gaining 1.4 percent a month earlier. It was the biggest decline since a 3.5 percent decline in April 2000. Food prices, though, rose 1.1 percent in March after gaining 0.6 percent in February.
The tame readings of inflation reinforced the views of a substantial number of economists and analysts who expect the Fed to cut the benchmark short-term lending rate again.

PERSON: Richard Evans Schultes 

HEADLINE: Richard E. Schultes, 86, Dies; Trailblazing Authority on Hallucinogenic Plants 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN KANDELL 

 BODY:
Richard Evans Schultes, a swashbuckling scientist and influential Harvard University educator who was widely considered the preeminent authority on hallucinogenic and medicinal plants, died on Tuesday in Boston. He was 86 and lived in Waltham, a Boston suburb.
 Dr. Schultes (pronounced SHULL-tees) was often called the father of ethnobotany, the field that studies the relationship between native cultures and their use of plants. Over decades of research, mainly in Colombia's Amazon region, he documented the use of more than 2,000 medicinal plants among Indians of a dozen tribes, many of whom had never seen a white man before. 
 "I do not believe in hostile Indians," Dr. Schultes was quoted as saying in a 1992 article about him in The New Yorker by E. J. Kahn Jr. "All that is required to bring out their gentlemanliness is reciprocal gentlemanliness." 
Tall, muscular, wearing a pith helmet, he hiked and paddled through Amazonia for months at a time. He collected more than 24,000 plant specimens. More than 120 species bear his name, as does a 2.2 million-acre tract of protected rain forest in Colombia, Sector Schultes, which the government there set aside in 1986. 
"The last of the great plant explorers in the Victorian tradition," was the way one of his former students, Wade Davis, described him in his 1985 best-selling book, "The Serpent and the Rainbow" (Simon & Schuster).
But more than a real-life Indiana Jones, Dr. Schultes was a pioneering conservationist who raised alarms in the 1960's -- long before environmentalism became a worldwide concern -- that the rain forests and their native cultures were in danger of disappearing under the onslaught of modern industry and agriculture. He reminded his Harvard students that more than 90 tribes had become extinct in Brazil alone over the first three-quarters of the 20th century.
"He believed ours would be the last generation fortunate enough to be able to live and work among these tribes as he had," wrote one of Dr. Schultes's disciples, Mark J. Plotkin, in "Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice," (Viking, 1993), "to experience their traditional way of life firsthand, and to record their vast ethnobotanical knowledge before the plant species -- or the people who used them -- succumbed to the march of progress." 
Dr. Schultes's research into plants that produced hallucinogens like peyote and ayahuasca made some of his books cult favorites among youthful drug experimenters in the 1960's. His findings also influenced cultural icons like Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs and Carlos Castaneda, writers who considered hallucinogens as the gateways to self-discovery. 
Dr. Schultes disdained these self-appointed prophets of an inner reality. He scathingly dismissed Timothy Leary, the drug guru of the 1960's who also taught at Harvard, for being so little versed in hallucinogenic species that he misspelled the Latin names of the plants. 
According to a 1996 article in The Los Angeles Times, when Mr. Burroughs once described a psychedelic trip as an earth-shaking metaphysical experience, Dr. Schultes's response was, "That's funny, Bill, all I saw was colors."
Dr. Schultes may have contributed to the psychedelic era with his ethnobotanical discoveries, but to him these were the sacred plants of Indians that should be studied for their medicinal value. He was in many ways a throwback to an earlier epoch of scientific research. He had no interest in publicity or self-promotion. Rather than confine himself to a narrow specialty, he was a generalist who crisscrossed several scientific disciplines.
Dr. Schultes taught more by personal example than by the use of forceful intellect. His lecture room resembled an ethnographic museum, with huge maps of Amazonia, native dance costumes, demon masks, opium pipes, dried specimens of medicinal and hallucinogenic plants, and a blowgun for poison-tipped darts, whose use he sometimes gingerly demonstrated in class. 
His former student, Dr. Plotkin, recalled a lecture in which the professor showed slides of masked dancers in the Amazon under the influence of a hallucinogenic potion. Referring to himself, Dr. Schultes told the class: "The one on the left has a Harvard degree. Next slide please."
Richard Evans Schultes traced his fascination with the South American rain forests to the fantasies evoked while he was bedridden as a child. He was born on Jan. 12, 1915, in Boston, where his father was a plumber and his mother was a homemaker. Confined to his room for months with a stomach ailment when he was about 5 years old, he listened enraptured to excerpts read to him by his parents from "Notes of a Botanist on the Amazon and the Andes," a travel diary kept by the 19th century British naturalist Richard Spruce. The impression left by those passages was so powerful that the boy decided to follow in Spruce's footsteps.
Receiving a full scholarship to Harvard, Mr. Schultes wrote an undergraduate paper on the mind-altering properties of peyote, based on research he undertook with Kiowa Indians in Oklahoma who ingested the hallucinogen in ceremonies to commune with their ancestors. For his doctoral thesis, also at Harvard, he chose the plants used by the Indians of Oaxaca, a southern state of Mexico. In his research there, he came across a species of morning glory seeds that contained a natural form of LSD.
In 1941, Dr. Schultes traveled to the Colombian Amazon, where he would spend most of his field research, and an area Spruce had studied. At first, Dr. Schultes concentrated on plants that produced curare. This substance, used by Indians as a fast-dissipating poison to hunt prey, also proved to be vital as a muscle-relaxant during major surgery in hospitals. The professor identified more than 70 plant species from which the Indians extracted curare.
Dr. Schultes was deep in the Colombian rain forest when news of Pearl Harbor reached him more than a week after the Japanese attack. He immediately made his way back to Bogota, the Colombian capital, and visited the United States Embassy to enlist in the armed forces. But the United States government decided his World War II services would be much more valuable as a botanist doing research on natural rubber, particularly since the Japanese occupied the Malayan plantations that accounted for much of the world's rubber supplies. 
Dr. Schultes soon became the leading expert in the field, collecting and studying more than 3,500 specimens of Hevea, the tree family that produces the latex from which rubber is made. 
Throughout the 1940's and until the early 1950's, Dr. Schultes lived almost continuously in the South American rain forests, with only brief visits to the United States. On his journeys through the tropics, he traveled lightly. He navigated scores of tributaries of the Amazon River, using an aluminum canoe that he could handle himself, though he usually hired Indians as paddlers and guides. 
His supplies included a single change of clothing, a camera and film, a hammock and blanket and a machete and clippers for plant collecting. For food, he carried only cans of instant coffee and Boston baked beans, preferring to rely on food offered by his Indian hosts. This included the ground manioc roots that were their staple, fish, wild game, insect grubs, fruit and chicha, a drink made from fruits chewed and fermented by spittle. 
His medicine kit consisted of vitamins, antibiotics and morphine -- in case he broke a limb and had to be transported for days before he could receive proper treatment.
To collect and preserve plant specimens, Dr. Schultes devised a method field researchers still use today. He soaked his plants in formaldehyde diluted with water and then pressed them between newspaper sheets. "On a good day, out in the forest, Schultes would collect 20 or 30 specimens that he thought merited further attention," Mr. Kahn wrote in The New Yorker. "Along a riverbank, where foraging was easier, he sometimes bagged 80 or 90."
Often Dr. Schultes would consult local Indian shamans about the properties of these species. A number of these medicinal plants now carry his name, including, among many others, Pouroma schultesii, a bark whose ashes are used to treat ulcers, Piper schultesii, a stem brewed as a tea to relieve tubercular coughs, and Hiraea schultesii, leaves whose soakings are used to cure conjunctivitis. 
Dr. Schultes asserted that contrary to popular conceptions, Indian shamans were eager to share their medical secrets with outsiders. But "time is running out," he warned in a 1994 article in the journal The Sciences, asserting, "The Indians' botanical knowledge is disappearing even faster than the plants themselves."
In 1953, Dr. Schultes moved back to the United States as a professor and botanical researcher and curator at Harvard. Six years later, he married Dorothy Crawford McNeil, an opera soprano who performed in Europe and the United States. His wife survives him, as do their three children, Richard Evans Schultes II, a corporate executive; Alexandra Ames Schultes Wilson, a physician; and her twin, Neil Parker Schultes, a molecular geneticist.
Dr. Schultes, who retired from Harvard in 1985, published 10 books and more than 450 scientific articles. For 18 years, beginning in 1962, he edited the scientific journal Economic Botany, and over much of the same period, he served as an active member of the editorial boards of Horticulture, Social Pharmacology, the Journal of Latin American Folklore and other publications. 
Among numerous awards, he received the 1992 gold medal of the Linnean Society of London, which is often equated to a Nobel Prize for botany.

HEADLINE: Confidence Of Consumers Shows Decline 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The American consumer, a pillar of strength through the economic turmoil of early 2001, is looking shaky.
 Americans spent less money at retail stores last month than they did in February, and in recent weeks they have turned still more pessimistic about the economy, according to two reports released yesterday. In addition, initial claims for unemployment benefits reached their highest level last week in five years, the Labor Department said yesterday. 
 The new data increase the chances that the economy is headed toward a recession because they suggest that consumers, who have been more willing to spend money than businesses in recent months, are pulling back as layoffs rise and stock prices remain far below last year's levels. 
Still, none of the reports were so weak as to indicate that a recession was now inevitable, most economists said.
In March, retail sales fell 0.2 percent from February's level, the Census Bureau said yesterday. Spending in the first quarter remained fairly strong, increasing 4.5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2000, but nearly all of that gain came in January.
"We're decelerating very quickly," said Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "There really isn't much, if any momentum."
In fact, consumers have grown more worried this month about the nation's economic health, according to a preliminary survey released by the University of Michigan. The survey's index of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in eight years. 
Through November, those polled continued to say that the economy's condition then was strong, even as they predicted rough times in the months ahead. Since late last year, though, people have also become concerned about the present, and most of this month's declining optimism reflected worries about the economy today.
The preliminary April confidence index, which is based on a telephone survey of about 300 people, was 87.8, down from a reading of 91.5 in March and 108.3 in July 2000. The University of Michigan will release a final result for April once it completes 200 additional interviews, recalculating the index based on their responses.
The worries cut across income levels, said Richard T. Curtin, the director of consumer surveys at the university. Reflecting the drop in stock prices, one-third of families with annual household income above $50,000 report being worse off financially than a year ago. And largely because of a decline in overtime hours, one-fifth of all families said their income had recently fallen.
"All of this leads me to the conclusion that we're going to have very slow growth in consumer spending over the next year," Mr. Curtin said.
As the economy has slowed, people have also become less confident in government officials and in the Federal Reserve. Since November, the percentage of people who said they had favorable views of government attempts to combat unemployment and inflation has fallen to 23 percent from 48 percent. 
For now, President Bush's plan to cut taxes is having little effect on people's attitudes; when asked what could change economic conditions, fewer than 1 percent listed a tax cut as a favorable near-term development, Mr. Curtin said.
Still, most economists continue to predict moderate growth for the rest of the year, although some say a recession is inevitable. The optimists note that the job market, consumer confidence and retail sales all remain stronger than they have in other recent slumps, even if the measures have weakened in the last six months. If consumers continue to spend at the rate they did in the first quarter, companies will be able to sell much of their excess inventory in the coming months and begin to increase production again later this year, the economists said.
That is the chain of events the Fed is trying to cause by lowering interest rates, and investors seemed to express their confidence in the economy yesterday as major stock indexes rose.
But last month's retail sales indicated that a mild downturn is not as likely as it seemed in January, when consumers returned to stores in large numbers after a weak holiday shopping season. 
Sears, Roebuck & Company said yesterday that sales for the five weeks that ended on Saturday fell 5.3 percent, compared with the period a year earlier. In a statement, the Sears chief executive, Alan J. Lacy, blamed the economy as well as cold weather in March, which depressed sales of lawn furniture and spring clothing.
According to the Census Bureau's report, sales fell at hardware stores, clothing stores and supermarkets last month, while those at restaurants and drugstores increased. People spent less money at gas stations in March than they had in February, with a drop in gas prices causing virtually all the decline.
A separate government report showed further signs of weakness in the labor market. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to 392,000, up 2.3 percent from the week before and 7.4 percent from two weeks ago, the Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: Dow Jones and Times Co. to Cut Work Forces 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Dow Jones & Company said yesterday that it had trimmed its work force about 3 percent, and The New York Times Company announced that it would reduce its staff as both companies turn to job cuts to cope with the profit squeeze caused by a steep falloff in advertising and the increasing cost of paper.
 Dow Jones, parent of The Wall Street Journal and other news operations, said it had laid off 202 employees and had eliminated 300 other vacant positions over the last few months, bringing its work force down to about 8,300 from 8,574 on Dec. 31. 
 The Times Company said it planned an unspecified number of buyouts and raised the possibility of layoffs.
The Dow Jones announcement came as the company reported that its net income declined to $6.2 million in the first quarter, compared with $88.7 million in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue declined 17 percent, to $459.9 million from $550.8 million. 
Excluding one-time charges for the job cuts and other items, Dow Jones reported earnings of $14.7 million, or 17 cents a share, down from $79.2 million, or 88 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts expected the company to earn 18 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
A few hours after Dow Jones reported its results, executives of the Times Company announced that they would offer buyouts to an unspecified number of employees by summer. They also raised the possibility of layoffs if the buyouts did not produce the desired saving.
In a news release, Russell T. Lewis, the chief executive of the Times Company, said the reduction in jobs "will be accomplished, where possible, through a voluntary buyout program." But, he added, "it will also include layoffs in certain areas where the size of a business unit or other factors make the buyout program impractical."
Besides The New York Times, the company publishes The Boston Globe, The Worcester Telegram & Gazette in Massachusetts and 14 other newspapers. As of Dec. 31, the Times Company had about 14,000 jobs.
Barry F. Lipton, president of the Newspaper Guild of New York, which represents news and commercial employees at The Times, said yesterday that he was concerned about a lack of "thorough" consultation on the buyouts.
"I think there was a general expectation that because of the economy, there would be a consideration of belt-tightening," he said. "What we find most unsettling is the manner in which it was done, without any kind of thorough consultation with the guild. We don't have any specifics -- what areas are going to be affected, how many people."
Catherine Mathis, a company spokeswoman, said, "We complied with our contractual obligation to provide the guild with advance notification of our plan for a voluntary buyout."
Newspaper companies have suffered a severe drop in advertising, and its effect has been magnified by comparisons with the record heights reached little more than a year ago. At that time, fledgling dot-com companies were spending millions of dollars in venture capitalists' and investors' money on advertising to raise their profiles. Last spring and summer, those dollars began drying up as the stock market slumped and investor enthusiasm for Internet companies cooled rapidly.
Earlier this year, the Times Company's Internet unit laid off 69 people, or 17 percent of its work force, having become one of the first divisions to experience the steep decline in advertising.
Over the last three months, newspapers have been hit increasingly hard. "Obviously, the advertising valley is deeper and wider than executives thought when they were doing budgeting late last year," said Kevin R. Gruneich, an analyst at the securities firm of Bear, Stearns. "The reaction to that tends to try to adjust to it somewhat by cost control." Labor is the main cost for newspaper companies, representing about half of their total costs.
Douglas M. Arthur, a newspaper analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said, "What one can say conclusively is that the start to the second quarter looks almost worse than the first quarter."
Shares of Dow Jones rose $1.59 yesterday, to $51.71, while those of the Times Company rose 62 cents, to $41.34, on a day when the Standard & Poor's newspaper index rose 1.27 percent.
The sharpest advertising declines at The Wall Street Journal were in technology and financial advertising, the same categories that had lifted its performance to records a year earlier. The volume of technology advertising was down 43 percent, according to Richard F. Zannino, the company's chief financial officer. Financial advertising volume was off nearly 50 percent, he told analysts during a morning conference call.
The company lowered its earnings projections for the second quarter to 50 to 60 cents a share from 77 cents, the average estimate from analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.
The Times Company is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on Monday.

HEADLINE: Behind Kozmo's Demise: Thin Profit Margins 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Sometimes, profits are not enough.
 That is what Kozmo, the pioneering online delivery company that was supposed to be New York's first big hit during the dot-com boom, learned this week when its investors pulled the plug. The company announced late Wednesday that it would have to shut down its operations in nine cities and lay off its remaining 1,100 employees because investors would not ante up the money to complete a merger that would have kept the company in business. 
 Kozmo, which was started by a young entrepreneur in his East Village apartment three years ago and grew into a company of more than 3,300 employees, earned profits in its largest markets in December. It was the first time that Kozmo, which delivered goods ordered on the Internet to consumers in less than an hour, had ever earned profits. 
It remains unclear whether the overall company earned operating profits that month. But executives said that if a planned merger with a delivery outfit in the Los Angeles area, PDQuick, had gone through, the new company would have become more profitable by cutting back to the six most successful markets.
Investors have said that for dot-coms, the pursuit of profits is the holy grail. But just a profit would not have been enough in this case.
In many ways, Kozmo's executives did find a way to make online delivery work, albeit too late. After the Nasdaq's sharp fall in April 2000 dried up the public markets, Kozmo reduced costs through layoffs and increased revenues by adding items that had margins higher than the delivery of videotapes and 16-ounce Cokes. It added a delivery charge and began selling products like DVD players, which had a higher profit margin. Kozmo also branched out to offline sales, for which it mailed consumers a catalog.
In New York, for example, the company made an operating profit of $200,000 in December on revenues of $2 million, in contrast to last June, when it had an operating loss of $2.5 million on revenues of $800,000. 
But the ultimate problem came down to basic economics.
Backers of Kozmo invested almost $280 million in the company because they were convinced that it would revolutionize the way people shopped and would earn them large returns on their investments. But their experience with Kozmo showed them that although the online delivery business has potential for profits, it is not likely to ever generate the high profits that they anticipated.
That realization made putting more money into Kozmo out of the question, said Michael Drapkin, the founder and principal of the Drapkin Technology Corporation, an e-commerce consulting firm and the author of "Three Clicks Away: Advice from the Trenches of E-Commerce" (John Wiley & Sons: 2001). "The whole thing about same-day delivery is that they run ultraefficient operations on paper-thin margins," he said. "Even if you could corner the entire market, you could never get enough to be able to get a return on an investment of $280 million."
Dot-coms once did not have to worry about this because they could wait for a suitor to buy them or an initial public offering under which they could sell their stock. But since the Nasdaq's sharp decline a year ago, both of those options disappeared. 
"I don't think you can go from being an idea to wanting to be a global company in three years," Alice O'Rourke, a former venture capitalist who is now executive director of the New York New Media Association, said of Kozmo. "You can't make a company grow too fast, just like you can't make a human grow too fast."
Within New York's Internet industry, there was deep disappointment over Kozmo's failure, given the fact that Flatiron Partners, Softbank and other backers announced in January that they would put $25 million more into the company.
Kozmo officials say that their recent financial success and the growth of their customer base to 400,000 from 150,000 in the last year show that online delivery can work. They contend Kozmo's problems were the result of spending too much money during the dot-com boom. Instead, they say, the company could have focused on fewer cities and carved out a smaller niche more appropriate for the service's inherently small profit margins.

HEADLINE: Some Assembly Is Required; 
Tons of Movable Props Make the New York Auto Show

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
New York City should be the very last place for a colossal automobile show. 
 After all, only 37 percent of residents are registered drivers. Furthermore, a brand-new car in the city is often shunned as thief candy. And it sometimes seems as if the populace places the highest value on the indestructible clunker, capable of surviving the brutalist ritual of alternate-side-of-the-street parking. Not to mention the festival of door-dinging in city garages. 
 So then, why is the New York International Automobile Show the most popular of all annual shows at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center? And why, after it opens today at 1 p.m., does it expect to attract a record 1.2 million visitors during its 10-day run? 
"The people of New York are coming out to dream," said John Davis, the host of the public television series "MotorWeek" and a keen observer of the last 18 New York automobile extravaganzas. "This show is about fantasizing." 
Despite the downturn in the economy, automakers have not pulled back from the show as much as they were expected to. In fact, they have imported as much tonnage (5.5 million pounds of exhibits) and as many cars (960), as they did last year, said Candida Romanelli, the director of the show, which is in its 101st year. 
While the goody bags are a bit lighter this year, there is still an abundance of sparkle because, in seasons of economic difficulty, the automakers feel obliged to pump money into the show to hype excitement, analysts say. Beyond this, the companies see the necessity of presenting a wow-filled show in the city that has the world's "greatest conflation of media," as Mr. Davis put it. 
This is why Adam Muhleisen has been toiling at all hours to put the show together in recent days, along with more than 2,500 other workers, including 650 carpenters, 400 riggers and crate movers, 150 electricians and 100 cleaners. 
"Being a New Yorker, I'm not a car owner," said Mr. Muhleisen, a Brooklyn carpenter who was wiping dust off the plexiglass Jaguar exhibit case he had just finished installing. "But I love to come back and see the show after helping build it. New Yorkers all yearn for a car." 
And most of them are doubtless unaware of the massive effort that enables them to kick the tires of three floors full of vehicles. "It's like building a small city," said Ms. Romanelli, who has presided over the show during the last decade for the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. 
Although the New York event kicks off late for the new-car introduction cycle (the year begins in October at the Miami auto show), this year New York features more than 20 world and North American car debuts, including Jaguar's sleek new X-Type line and Chrysler's retro-camp PT Cruiser Convertible. 
In the end, many of the 80 exhibitors will spend more than $1 million on their presentations. 
"This is our Super Bowl," said John F. O'Connell Jr., chief operating officer of the Freeman Decorating Company of Dallas, the automobile show's construction contractor, which installs the exhibits, including cars and trucks weighing 2,000 to 3,000 pounds. 
To Mr. O'Connell, the show "is a choreographed dance," he said, adding, "You can't make a mistake, because everything is timed for the next arrival." 
It is also unusual in that, unlike most of the shows at Javits, the presentation is a "hybrid," a trade show that is also open to the public. (Admission costs $9 for adults and $3 for children under 12.)
Yesterday, Subaru attracted a herd of hundreds of reporters and analysts to the unveiling of its 2002 Outback H6-3.0 VDC Sedan, "with its three-liter horizontally opposed, six-cylinder engine," a Subaru manager said eagerly.
Other preview visitors wandered the "exhibitry" and considered the effect of recent headlines about the poor performance of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in five-mile-per-hour crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 
"Safety concerns are coming forth, but consumers aren't necessarily listening to them," said Eileen Kiely, a credit analyst with Goldman, Sachs. "If that were so, everyone would buy a Volvo." 
During the week leading up to the show, trailer-truck deliveries were arriving and exhibit cars were queuing up to be positioned. "In a way, this is too big a show for Javits, and there aren't enough loading docks," said Ms. Romanelli, who said that she could fill another floor with exhibits if Javits only had one. 
Her years of cajoling finally spurred the Javits Center to create a seven-foot-wide sliding door in a front lobby to permit the loading of sport utility vehicles into the North Concourse exhibition area. 
The auto show is a place where some assembly is required. "It's like Christmas every time you open up a crate, seeing what they've shipped," Mr. Muhleisen said. "Of course, sometimes they forget a few things. So we've learned to build around that. Or to do without it." 
Late on Tuesday evening, the Javits Center was a carefully orchestrated bedlam. Sport utility vehicles were being positioned on painted fiberglass mud tracks. The halls were alive with the burr of power tools and the thrum of gas-driven forklifts. Crews balanced on ladders as they rigged what they called curtainry above the new-car "componentry."
Drivers of 65 forklifts were maneuvering crates weighing up to 32,000 pounds. "This is intricate work, we're not just throwing our weight around," said Patrick Lombardi, a forklift driver. "We are aware that these are million-dollar exhibits. You don't drop things."
Other workers were hanging car bodies from steel bolts, like the Audi Le Mans racers dangling from a steel latticework in the southwest corner of the center. (A show secret: cars hung on the walls are often just light shells, with those heavy engines and transmissions removed.) 
Through the years there have been few outright set-up disasters, although crates have been dropped, cars have tumbled off loading ramps and not a few turntables have halted in mid-gyration. And yes, it is true that, a few years ago, a Porsche was stolen during the exhibit move-out. (The perpetrator was arrested a few blocks away when he got into a fender-bender.) 
Back at this year's show, an exhibit gang was trying to position a sleek silver gray and black Volvo Adventure Concept Car. It was one of 26 such concept vehicles in the show: one-of-a-kind prototypes built to gauge consumer interest. They may or may not actually be built. (The New Beetle and the PT Cruiser started out as auto-show concept cars.) 
Suddenly nine sweating workers began manhandling the Volvo "pusher," as some concept cars are called, since they can lack engines and offer limited steering. 
The crew oomphed the car up the ramp from a loading dock near 12th Avenue, lurched it to a halt at the unfinished plywood platform of the Volkswagen exhibit, made a right, then did a hard left at the unfinished Audi pavilion. 
"This wheel hardly turns at all," said Stefan Hagberg, the Volvo technician who was the driver. After one final heave the car was in place on the platform. 
"Moving a concept vehicle is always very touchy," said Michael Thoresen, a vice president at Exhibit Works, a Michigan display company working for Jaguar. "You're pushing this vehicle through a construction area, and you don't want to let it hit anything -- or let anything hit it." 
Then one of Mr. Thoresen's workers ventured a complaint about the automobile show: it's too successful. "The show is here too long," said Mr. Muhleisen with a smile, explaining that he gets paid only for putting things up or tearing things down. "We like turnover."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Juniper's Profit Rises, but It Warns on Revenue

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 12 

 BODY:
Juniper Networks, a rapidly growing maker of Internet communications equipment, reported first-quarter earnings today that matched Wall Street expectations, despite reduced spending by its largest customers.
 Juniper said it managed to avoid the sharp sales declines of many competitors, include Cisco Systems, by gaining new customers. 
 Revenue increased sharply, to $332.1 million from $63.9 million in the first quarter of 2000. 
Juniper's shares rose 18 percent on the news, up $7.62 to $50.38.
But the company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., acknowledged that the reduced budgets of telecommunications companies and Internet service providers would cut into its growth soon.
Juniper cut its revenue forecast for the year to a range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion, nearly double the 2000 revenue but down from its earlier prediction of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. It said it expected to earn 90 cents to $1 a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had forecast earnings of $1.05 a share and revenue of $1.6 billion.
"Our customers have shortened their buying horizon," said Marcel Gani, Juniper's chief financial officer, in a conference call, "and are reluctant to purchase more than they need in the short term." 
For the quarter, earnings excluding special charges totaled $85.4 million, or 25 cents a share. The results were in line with the analysts' consensus forecast and far exceeded earnings a year earlier of $10.5 million, or 3 cents a share. Including amortization of good will and other items, earnings were $58.6 million, or 17 cents a share.
Scott Kriens, the chairman and chief executive, compared the quarter's performance to shooting par in golf while playing in a driving rain.
"Should the weather clear and the skies brighten, our results will improve," Mr. Kriens said in an interview. "But the important thing is that our business must be run successfully regardless of the weather."
Stephen Kamman, an analyst with CIBC World Markets, said Juniper's stock was still attractive. Mr. Kamman, who raised his recommendation on the shares to strong buy from buy, said increasing Internet traffic would soon force service providers and telecommunications companies to improve their infrastructure, regardless of the economy.
"With the products Juniper makes," he said, "there's only so long the carriers can hold their breath. Then they're going to have to go back to Juniper."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs; 
One Nation, 3 Lessons

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
So what are the lessons from this latest China-U.S. crisis? They are: (1) When dealing with China, carry a big stick and a big dictionary. (2) This is an inherently unstable relationship. (3) Get used to it -- it's going to be this way for a long time.
 Let's start with Lesson 2, because it's the crux of the matter. We learn from this incident that the U.S.-China relationship has within it two highly stabilizing and two highly destabilizing elements, and the future will be shaped by the balance between them. 
 The two stabilizing elements are China's economic dependence on U.S. trade, technology transfers and the American market, and China's more general, but steady, integration into the world. When China's foreign minister declared that China was releasing the U.S. surveillance plane's crew for "humanitarian reasons," I burst out laughing. One thing the Chinese are expert at is calculating their interests. And they had clearly calculated that dragging this affair on another day could imperil China's entry into the World Trade Organization, its $100 billion in trade with the U.S., its application to be host to the 2008 Summer Olympics, its 54,000 students studying in America, etc. etc. 
These things matter. They matter to a regime whose Communist ideology is largely defunct and whose only basis of legitimacy is its ability to keep incomes rising. And they matter deeply to the people of China, who see themselves as a rising power and want to be accepted as such. The more China is integrated with the global economy and international rules-based systems like the W.T.O., the more these will be a source of restraint on the regime.
But they are not foolproof, because these stabilizing elements in the relationship are counterbalanced by two highly destabilizing ones: the authoritarian character of the Chinese regime, and China's rising popular nationalism and unquenchable aspiration to absorb Taiwan into one China.
Authoritarian regimes, having little legitimacy, can almost never admit a mistake. That's why you need a big stick and big dictionary when dealing with them. The idea that a slow-moving, propeller-driven surveillance plane, flying on autopilot, rammed into a Chinese fighter jet is ludicrous. But since China's leaders lacked the self-confidence to admit this, the Bush team wisely found a way to apologize without really apologizing.
The same tools need to be applied to Taiwan. Taiwan's character -- the fact that it is a country that has built itself in America's image, economically and politically -- mandates that we defend it. We cannot shirk that responsibility. But Taiwan's history and geography mandate that Taiwan find a way to accommodate with mainland China -- without sacrificing its de facto independence or character. China has actually shown a lot of flexibility in proposing different formulas lately, and Taiwan needs to respond. Pass the dictionary.
We need to keep our eyes on the prize here, folks. Those voices in the U.S. now calling for America to "stick it to China" and to "teach them a lesson" sound as silly as the China People's Daily hectoring America. China is a unique problem. It represents one-fifth of humanity. It threatens us as much by its weaknesses as by its strengths. We may be doomed to a cold war with China, but it is not something we should court. 
A cold war with Russia, a country that made tractors that were more valuable as scrap steel and TV's that blew up when you turned them on, was one thing. A cold war with one-fifth of humanity, with an economy growing at 10 percent a year, is another. At the same time, trying to collapse the Chinese regime overnight would produce a degree of chaos among one-fifth of the world's inhabitants that would affect everything from the air we breathe to the cost of the clothes we wear to the value of our currency.
Our strategy toward China needs to remain exactly as it was: Build bridges to China everywhere possible, because they have clearly become a source of restraint on the regime; and draw red lines everywhere necessary, because China's rising nationalism and insecure leadership can produce irrational behavior that overrides all other interests. Do this, and hope that over time China continues, as it slowly has been, becoming a more open, legalized, pluralistic society, with a government more responsive, and less threatening, to its people and neighbors. Lurching to any other extremes with China would be utterly, utterly foolhardy.

HEADLINE: Global Conspiracy on Construction Bids Defrauded U.S. 

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
A group of international construction companies defrauded the American government out of tens of millions of dollars earmarked for Egyptian water projects undertaken as part of the Camp David peace accords, according to government officials and court documents.
 One participant in the wide-ranging conspiracy, a unit of ABB Ltd., the Swiss engineering giant, pleaded guilty yesterday to its role in the scheme, agreeing to pay $63 million in fines and restitution. 
 The conspiracy, which lasted more than seven years, involved the rigging of contract bids submitted in the late 1980's and early 1990's to the United States Agency for International Development, which was financing Egyptian water projects that resulted from the Middle East peace accords reached during the Carter administration.
Contracts were supposed to be awarded through competitive bidding. But the construction companies subverted the process through payments of bribes and kickbacks to other possible bidders, fraudulent billings to the government and the laundering of cash through Swiss bank accounts, court records in related cases show. 
The conspirators included at least six international construction companies, which collectively referred to themselves as the Frankfurt Group, according to people briefed on the case. At the time of the bidding, the companies were either American or American subsidiaries of European concerns. The name of the group came from the fact that some of the largest companies were based in Frankfurt.
The investigation of the conspiracy began almost six years ago, after a top financial officer at one company noticed a series of improper wire transfers and other transactions. That executive then brought those matters to the attention of the Justice Department, which has been investigating ever since.
According to court records, companies involved in the conspiracy were able to obtain profits of as much as 60 percent on the Egyptian water projects -- a return that would be almost certainly impossible to obtain under competitive bidding. Indeed, some of the companies went to great lengths to hide their profits, charging fictitious expenses from related companies to decrease the returns shown on their books.
All told, about a dozen contracts have been awarded under the program, totaling more than $1 billion. To date, three contracts have been found to involve fraud, and the others remain under investigation.
The investigation has already resulted in two other guilty pleas, entered last fall by other construction companies. But until yesterday the full scope and implications of the criminal investigation were not publicly known.
In the plea entered yesterday in Federal District Court in Birmingham, Ala., ABB Middle East and Africa Participations A.G., a Milan-based subsidiary of the engineering company, admitted to taking part in a conspiracy to rig the bid for a project known as Contract 29. The original participant in the conspiracy was SAE Sadelmi USA, another ABB subsidiary, which was based in North Brunswick, N.J., and later became part of the Milan subsidiary.
Under the terms of the illegal agreement, the ABB unit met with other potential bidders on Contract 29 and agreed to pay them $3.4 million to submit inflated bids for the project. The ABB unit was then able to inflate its own bid on the project, knowing the offer would still beat other submissions. The value of the awarded contract, which was to pay for building a wastewater treatment plant in Abu Rawash, Egypt, was about $135 million.
"Although the construction work that is the subject of this case was performed on foreign shores, the U.S. government paid the bill and the U.S. taxpayers were the victims of the scheme," John M. Nannes, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said in a statement.
An ABB spokesman, William Kelly, said the company had been cooperating with investigators since 1996, and first learned that it was a target of the inquiry last fall. He said the crimes were conducted by a small group of employees, all of whom have since left the company for reasons unrelated to the case.
"We deplore and deeply regret the behavior that led to these charges," Mr. Kelly said. "It stands in sharp contrast to the high standard of business ethics practiced by the great majority of ABB employees." He added that in the year since the bid rigging occurred, ABB has expanded internal compliance programs "to let employees at all levels know that ABB has zero tolerance for illegal or unethical business behavior." 
According to court records in related civil cases, the $3.4 million payment was made to an unincorporated joint venture formed by Bill Harbert International Construction, based in Birmingham, and the J. A. Jones Construction Company, a Charlotte, N.C., subsidiary of Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt.
Philipp Holzman pleaded guilty to a criminal complaint filed under seal last August. A spokesman for Harbert did not return a telephone call.
According to court filings by the government in related cases, the Jones-Harbert venture was at the center of other bid-rigging efforts involving the Egyptian water projects. For example, American International Contractors Inc., a construction company based in Arlington, Va., and owned by the Archirodon Group of Geneva, pleaded guilty last September to accepting payments in exchange for a commitment not to bid on a project known as Contract 20A. That contract was awarded to the Jones-Harbert joint venture, court records show.
Indeed, irregularities in Contract 20A led to the discovery of the broader bid-rigging scheme. The irregularities were first discovered by Richard F. Miller, who worked first as a controller and then as treasurer of Jones from 1986 though 1996.
During the course of his work, Mr. Miller discovered a series of improper transactions involving the joint venture with Harbert, and pieced together that a bid-rigging scheme had been used in Contract 20A, a $107 million sewer project in Cairo.
Among the evidence eventually discovered by Mr. Miller, according to court records from a federal whistle-blower suit he filed, were wire transfers for $3.35 million from the joint venture to a related company for fictitious "preconstruction costs."
The most complex transaction, according to the court records, was a bogus "sale-leaseback" arrangement involving a Jones-related company called Sabbia. Under the terms of the deal, Sabbia was to purchase the construction equipment for the project, then lease it back to the joint venture.
Yet while $14.4 million in lease payments were sent to Sabbia, the $4 million to purchase the equipment was never paid by that company. Instead, according to court records and lawyers involved in the case, that money remained in a Swiss bank account and was used as a fund to disburse payments to other co-conspirators.
"This was an example of a transaction that was done to reduce the apparent profitability of Contract 20A," said Robert Bell, a lawyer from Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering who is representing Mr. Miller in his whistle-blower suit. "If you skim almost $15 million off the top, it's easier to make it look like the joint venture wasn't making all that much money."

 BODY:
I.R.S. Has Ceased Pursuit Of Many Tax Delinquents
The Internal Revenue Service, its staff shrunken by a sixth and its mission shifted to customer service, has virtually stopped pursuing more than one million tax delinquents and sharply cut other enforcement action.
 More than a third of the three million Americans who are behind on their taxes have had their cases sent to an inactive file since the I.R.S. decided in June 1999 not to try to collect their debts. The decision effectively wrote off $2.5 billion in taxes owed last year by 668,018 taxpayers. In 1998, just 98 taxpayers had their cases sent to the inactive file. Page A1. 

G.E. Posts 16% Increase in Profit
General Electric, buoyed by strong sales of gas turbines and medical systems, said that its first-quarter earnings rose 16 percent compared with results in the period a year earlier. The profit from operations, which matched analysts' estimates, was $3.02 billion, or 30 cents a share, up from $2.59 billion, or 26 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose less than 2 percent, to $30.49 billion. Shares of G.E. rose $1.43, to $44.70. C3.

Recall of Chocolate Egg Is Urged
Two consumer groups said that a chocolate covered plastic egg called Megga Surprize posed a choking hazard to children and asked the Consumer Product Safety Commission to recall the product. C5.

I.B.M. to Introduce Chips Today
I.B.M. plans to announce today the availability of a new family of microchips intended to reduce sharply the size, power requirements and cost of components in Internet appliances and portable electronic devices. C4.

Hope of a Rate Cut Lifts Stocks
Stocks rose as investors bid up shares on hopes of an interest rate cut. The Nasdaq composite index rose 62.48 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,961.43. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 113.47 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,126.94. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, gained 17.61 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,183.50. C5.

Juniper Profit Meets Expectations
Juniper Networks, a rapidly growing maker of Internet communications equipment, reported first-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street expectations despite reduced spending by its largest customers. C4.

Medical Privacy Rules to Take Effect
President Bush announced that sweeping rules to protect the privacy of medical records would take effect on Saturday. But he said the rules, issued by President Bill Clinton, could later be revised to address "legitimate concerns" of the health care industry. A1.

The Bush administration has decided to keep rules set by the Clinton administration requiring more efficient clothes washers and water heaters. But it is still reviewing a rule that would raise the minimum efficiency of central air-conditioners by 30 percent. A14.

Investors Call for Changes at B.T.
Shareholders in British Telecommunications argue that its bureaucracy, a legacy from its days as a state-owned monopoly, prevents it from seizing opportunities. With B.T.'s stock down about 45 percent in the last 12 months, British investors are calling for a management shake-up. Analysts are making lists of potential successors to Sir Peter Bonfield, above, as chief executive and to Sir Iain Vallance as chairman. World Business, Section W.

For Kozmo, Profits Weren't Enough
Even though Kozmo, the online delivery company that was supposed to be New York's first big hit during the dot-com boom, earned some profits, its investors still pulled the plug. The company said late Wednesday that it would shut down its operations in nine cities and lay off its remaining 1,100 employees. B7.

Markets Closed for Good Friday
Financial markets in the United States and many other countries will be closed for Good Friday. They will reopen on Monday.

HEADLINE: Donation May Keep Schools Open 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York confirmed yesterday that an unnamed benefactor had offered a donation of $150 million that might save six financially failing parish elementary schools. 
 The Rev. Kenneth J. Smith of the Church of St. Bernard, on West 14th Street in Manhattan, announced the potential gift on Wednesday night at a meeting with parents about how to balance that parish school's budget. 
 The spokesman for the archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling, said last night that the potential donor repeated his offer in a telephone conversation yesterday with a priest at the archdiocesan headquarters on First Avenue.
Mr. Zwilling said discussions of the gift were preliminary. "We don't know what we are dealing with yet," he said. "Obviously, if somebody were going to donate $150 million, that would be very, very significant." 
He added, "We don't know exactly what this person is proposing or how it would play itself out." 
Parents at St. Bernard/St. Xavier School said Father Smith's announcement of the gift would prompt extra prayers this Easter weekend. "He wants us all to pray that it is going to work out," said John McGoldrick, one of the parents who cheered and applauded the news. 
Still, the gift may not keep the schools from closing. The archdiocese has set April 24 as the deadline for submitting plans for how the schools, all operating with sizable deficits, can become financially self-sufficient. Church leaders specifically directed that those plans focus not on fund-raising but on increasing enrollment and tuition. 
"Remember, the archdiocese is asking us for students," said the Rev. Theodore C. Parker of All Saints Church in East Harlem, home to one of the six schools. "They are not asking us for money. Now money, of course, goes along with students, but they want students to fill the school buildings."
The gift, he said, would be wonderful, but "I don't know if that would automatically mean that our schools would stay open." 
Mr. Zwilling said church leaders were looking forward to the business plans. "We believe in the creativity and resourcefulness of our people and are anxious to see what they come up with," he said. 
If Cardinal Edward M. Egan is willing to spare any of the schools, he has not made it easy. Some pastors said they were not called in to discuss their schools' problems until the second week of March. The announcement of schools marked for closing was made on March 29. And the four weeks that priests were given to draw up their business plans included Holy Week, when schools are closed and pastors have heavy ceremonial responsibilities. 
At the six parishes, priests said the last two weeks had been a nonstop flurry of meetings with parents, accountants and potential donors. 
At St. Ann's School in Nyack, the pastor, the Rev. Robert P. Henry, said he was preparing a business plan that would demonstrate that a consistent increase in enrollment in the last five years would continue. He also said parents had agreed to an increase in tuition, to $2,200 a year from $2,000.
Yesterday, on Holy Thursday, the principal of All Saints School and other staff members were hard at work, Father Parker said. "This has just been a horrible time," he said. "I think it's extreme pressure upon us." 
Father Smith of St. Bernard said he had been working nonstop. "I haven't slept since I got notification," he said after Wednesday night's meeting. 
But he said he recognized the need for cuts and the pressure on Cardinal Egan. "The Archdiocese of New York is in serious economic difficulties," he said. "He was left with tremendous debt." He added: "I feel very sorry for the archbishop. I would not want to be in his shoes." 
Father Smith would not provide further details yesterday. 
The other schools are Mount Carmel/Holy Rosary, in Harlem; St. John and St. Joachim, in Beacon; and St. Peter's, in Rosendale. 
Cardinal Egan, who succeeded the late Cardinal John J. O'Connor last June, has said severe cuts will be necessary. Several priests said they believed that some parishes would also have to close. Father Parker said he feared that his would be one.

HEADLINE: Parents Explain Resounding Rejection of Privatization at 5 Schools 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
In the days after parents overwhelmingly defeated efforts by Edison Schools Inc., a private company, to take over five failing New York public schools, many educational policy makers and politicians called the rebuff illogical and self-destructive.
Why, they asked, would parents preserve a public school with abysmal test scores, or refuse free computers to improve their children's academic progress?
 Interviews with dozens of parents at the five schools last week suggested a surprising and complex set of answers. 
 Some parents said they did not know the schools were in trouble; in fact, their performance was so low they were on the state's list of failing schools. Others said that while they knew the schools were failing, they felt powerless to do anything to improve them. Some said they liked their children's relationships with the teachers. Still others attributed the problems to the many immigrants in the school rather than the instruction. Nearly all said they were afraid that their children would be used as guinea pigs in a business experiment. 
"I had no idea this school was failing," said Rosa Rosario, whose son John, 8, is a third grader at Public School 161 in central Harlem, one of the schools considered for privatization and the one where the opposition was strongest. She said that her daughter Natalie, 13, graduated from the school and had done well. "If it was such a bad school, my daughter would not have been able to go to Frederick Douglass Academy, one of the best middle schools in the city."
John Perez, 31, whose daughter Jalisia, 8, is a third grader at P.S. 161, said the Edison proposal to take over the school gave him the motivation to get more involved in school affairs. He had always wanted to know that he had support in any effort to improve the school, and that if he did not have it, "then I wasn't going to fight at all," he said. "But this year, there was a group that was always with me: my family. We decided to fight together, and we won."
While most parents did not vote, 80 percent of those who did voted to reject Edison. For Edison to win the contract, parents of more than 50 percent of the students at a school had to vote in favor of converting to charter status.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a vocal advocate of privatization, said parents were shortchanging their children by rejecting the proposal and said they were victims of a misinformation campaign. 
Most of the parents interviewed had children at P.S. 161, which in many ways is characteristic of all five schools. The other four schools were P.S. 66 in Crotona Park East, the Bronx; Middle School 246 in Flatbush, Brooklyn; M.S. 320 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn; and Intermediate School 111 in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
The teachers' union and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, a small but vocal group with a strong presence in Flatbush and Bushwick, led a fierce campaign against Edison, saying the company wanted to make a profit from the city's children. Various city and state politicians and community leaders also lobbied against Edison. They saw privatization as a threat to their power over community school boards and the hiring of aides and administrators, who often play important roles on their campaigns.
Now parents like Mr. Perez are saying they plan to take a role in the schools, making decisions about textbooks and spending plans even though they have no experience in running schools. 
Before the Edison proposal, many said, they were too busy to notice how badly the schools were doing. Some of the parents are single mothers, struggling to make ends meet. Others are illegal immigrants and hence afraid to play a prominent public role lest their status be revealed.
P.S. 161, a squat four-story building on a bustling commercial and residential street in central Harlem, has a student body that is largely black and Hispanic; 6 percent are recent immigrants from the Dominican Republic.
One challenge facing P.S. 161, as well as at least two of the other schools, is the rapid turnover of students. Some students live in homeless shelters, or move often because their parents cannot afford to stay in one place long enough to pay the rent. The turnover undercuts continuity, a significant problem at a time when schools are judged based on their standardized test scores.
Until two years ago, the five schools had a problem with the turnover of personnel. But since their low performance placed them in a special category known as the Chancellor's District, they have been staffed with certified teachers and new principals who are committed to staying for a specified period. Class sizes were reduced, and scripted curriculums for teachers were adopted. Those changes were cited by those who said the school was starting to improve.
Edison faced its strongest opposition from P.S. 161, which did not even have a proper Parent Teacher Association before the privatization plan arose. Now, Mr. Perez, 31, a party planner, has helped parents form a P.T.A. and a committee to help overhaul their school, he said. 
Only about 20 percent of the students at P.S. 161 met city and state standards in reading and mathematics, making it among the lowest-rated schools in the city. The percentage of students meeting city and state standards in English rose to 20.4 percent last year from 16.3 percent in 1999. In mathematics, however, the percentage of students meeting state and city standards fell to 20 percent from 24 percent.
Standing outside the school on a crisp spring day as the carnival-like music of an ice cream truck drifted through the air, Elizabeth Rodriguez, 27, an unemployed mother of four children, professed her support for the school: it had, she said, improved her daughter's reading. She voted against Edison because she had heard that the company planned to bus low-performing and bilingual students out to Brooklyn schools, she said. That, like rumors that tuition would be charged at the new charter schools, was not true. 
Ms. Rodriguez, who worked at a McDonald's until she gave birth to her son Nicholas, now 2 months old, said her daughter Amanda Zapata, 10, a fourth grader, has made great strides in reading during her three years at P.S. 161. Previously, she had been enrolled at P.S. 129 several blocks away and had made little progress there.
"She's gone from reading at a kindergarten level to reading at her grade level," Ms. Rodriguez said. "They did a lot of damage to her at the other school. They held her back and did not encourage her. That's not happening here."

GRANTS TO CLEAN UP LAND

BYLINE:  By Steve Strunsky 

 BODY:
 New Jersey has awarded $764,031 to five cities and towns so that they can investigate, clean up and reuse so-called brownfields -- useless, abandoned and polluted sites -- officials announced yesterday. 
The sites include a former hazardous waste storage site in Jersey City where chemicals may have been discharged and an abandoned house in Lower Township in Cape May County that may have leaked oil. The money comes from the Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Fund, administered jointly by the Department of Environmental Protection and the Economic Development Authority. The grants are awarded to municipalities that have acquired such sites, determined the cleanup costs and tried to develop them. Other recipients are Kearny, Perth Amboy and Rahway. Steve Strunsky

Hope of Rate Cut Leads Shares Up, Ending a Strong Week

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors gave a positive spin to a batch of disquieting economic reports yesterday, bidding stocks solidly higher as hopes rose for another cut in interest rates. The advance gave the Nasdaq composite index a four-day winning streak and its best week so far this year.
 The market recovered from moderate losses earlier in the session. Analysts attributed its resilience to optimism that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates for a fourth time this year when it meets May 15. 
 "There are no inflationary pressures like a year ago," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons. "They do think it leaves the door open for a rate cut."
The Nasdaq rose 62.48, or 3.3 percent, to 1,961.43, the first time since early September that the index has risen four consecutive days. With the markets closed for Good Friday, the gain meant the Nasdaq ended the week up 241.06 points, or 14 percent, its best weekly percentage gain since it rose 18.9 percent in the five-day week ended June 2.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 113.47 points, or 1.1 percent, at 10,126.94. For the week, the Dow gained 335.85 points, or 3.43 percent. And the market's broadest measure, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, rose 17.61 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,183.50, ending the week with a gain of 55.07 points, or 4.9 percent.
As the day began, the nation's biggest retailers reported generally weak results for March, stemming from unusually cold weather and the slumping economy.
Sears, Roebuck & Company said its lackluster sales would cause it to miss first-quarter earnings projections.
And Wal-Mart Stores said its results came in at the low end of expectations and that it might also miss first-quarter estimates.
Sears managed to move up 10 cents, to $34.75, but Wal-Mart dropped 53 cents, to $49.70, and Federated Department Stores fell 24 cents, to $41.41.
The Commerce Department also issued retail sales figures for March that were weaker than expected. And the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance last week climbed to its highest level in five years, further evidence of the weakening labor market.
Investors were initially troubled by the spate of weak economic numbers, but the Labor Department's report of a 0.1 percent drop in wholesale prices last month raised hopes for a further reduction in interest rates.
The decline indicated that inflation, another of the Fed's concerns, remained under control.
"Ironically, today's economic reports were all weaker than had been forecast and, indeed, showed outright declines," said Carol Stone, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, "suggesting the economy is weak and that the Fed may well ease rates further to try to support the economy."
Technology stocks, which helped power the Nasdaq's advance, were mostly higher, shaking off earlier earnings concerns.
Juniper Networks, a maker of high-speed Internet routing gear, rose $7.62, to $50.38, after meeting analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations but issuing a second-quarter outlook below analysts' forecasts.
Yahoo was up $1.10 at $16.96. On Wednesday, the company beat Wall Street's sharply reduced first-quarter earnings forecasts, but also said it was cutting its work force by 12 percent. --------------------
