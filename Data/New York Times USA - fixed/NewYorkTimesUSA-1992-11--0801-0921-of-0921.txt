HEADLINE: No Toll Increases Without Electronic Scanners

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The announced intention of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority to increase bridge and tunnel tolls (news article, Nov. 17) seems to defy economics. Planners who seek to discourage commuters from driving, seem baffled that frequent toll increases have done little to induce people onto mass transit. 
 The vast majority of commuters drive because of the absence of efficient public transport that will meet their needs. Ineffective planning has left us with a transit system that does not meet our needs. I cite the thousands of people who drive from Queens to the Bronx and the lack of commuter buses on these routes. I cite local bus routes that do not synchronize their schedules with commuter rail lines they can easily serve. I cite countless instances where the costs of motoring, tolls and parking are endured not for pleasure, or even choice, but of necessity.
Perhaps, this time, with clean air regulations about to force action throughout the region, the time has come for a quid pro quo: no toll increases to be approved unless the authority and all toll-collection agencies install electronic scanners that permit toll accounts to be debited without impeding the flow of traffic.
The motoring public is forced to wait in long, time-wasting lines, while vehicles spew pollution into the atmosphere. The bridge and tunnel agency must take the lead to temper its planned toll increase with technology to speed traffic through its facilities.

HEADLINE: Doubled Sales;
With That Hair, Barbie Is Looking Like a Billion

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Barbie doll in all her variations will breach the $1 billion sales mark this year, in no small measure because of the popularity of Totally Hair Barbie, the nation's fifth-best-selling toy.
Mattel Inc., which was preoccupied with financial problems in the early 1980's, has more than doubled sales of its perennial favorite since 1987, when Barbie sales were $430 million. 
 John W. Amerman, chairman and chief executive, said today that the company expected record revenue and profits this year, in part because sales of low-price toys have resisted the recession. The company, which will sell 65 million dolls this year, earned $118 million on sales of $1.65 billion in 1991.
Besides the $12 Totally Hair Barbie, projected to sell eight million units, Mattel says it is having trouble keeping in stock Li'l Miss Magic Jewels, priced at $30; Baby Rollerblade, selling for $35, and Gak, a compound that is a cross between Silly Putty and Play-Doh and costs $3.
Mattel items based on characters from Disney's "Aladdin" movie are also disappearing fast.
At the nation's toy stores this month, top sellers are Teenage Mutant Ninja Mutations, California Roller Baby, Nerf bow and arrow sets, and Treasure Trolls, according to The Toy Book's What's Hot List. Rollerblade Barbie is ranked No. 8 and Mattel's Baby Rollerblade is No. 12.
These same toys are expected to remain best-sellers through the holiday season for the $13 billion-a-year industry, said Maria Ramos, editor of the trade magazine.

HEADLINE: Immigration Reform Holds Key to Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is a striking omission in "How to Lift the Poor" (news analysis, Nov. 10), your overview of the Clinton Administration's agenda to aid those in need: immigration reform. Over the last decade, the United States has received the largest number of immigrants in our history -- close to 10 million people. In the recessionary year 1991, more than 1.8 million people were granted permanent resident status -- also the highest number in our history.
More than one-third of the annual growth in the labor force comes from this collective source (that is, legal immigrants, illegal immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers and foreign nationals who are legally permitted to be employed as nonimmigrant workers). The preponderance of the immigrant flow has been into urban areas, especially to central cities. 
 This human infusion has been disproportionately characterized by people who are unskilled, poorly educated and often not English-speaking. Not only have many such immigrants added to the magnitude of the country's poverty population, but they have also contributed, through increased competition, to a worsening of employment and income experiences for needy citizens.
What sense does it make to have an inflexible immigration policy that admits record numbers of people who must find jobs to survive without any regard to the state of the domestic economy? What is the justification for a policy that admits (or permits in the case of illegal immigration) mass entry of people whose human capital attributes most closely match those of citizens who are themselves experiencing the highest incidences of poverty and unemployment?
What is the logic of a policy that annually pours hundreds of thousands of such people into the central cities, which are already overburdened with chronic shortages of jobs, training opportunities, health services and affordable housing?
Immigration reform is not a panacea. But unless our immigration policy is changed, any urban programs are doomed to failure that seek to raise the rewards of working for the urban poor; to reduce the magnitude of adult illiteracy; to improve the quality and retention power of urban school systems -- to name only a few laudable goals.
Immigration reform, the omitted option among the urban reforms that you describe as being under discussion, would be the least costly to implement and the quickest to produce beneficial results. Moreover, such action would greatly improve the prospects for other elements of the proposed urban agenda to make a difference in the quality of life in our cities.1

HEADLINE: Innovative Program in California Aids Those With Outdated Skills

SERIES: Finding What Works -- Fourth article of a series: Retraining Programs

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif.

 BODY:
For almost four years, Mark H. Johnson was a chemical technician for a microfilm company, doing skilled work that paid him a good salary of $30,000 a year. But the company's three shifts were cut to two, and he was on the third. Soon he landed another skilled job paying $27,000, as a high-speed packaging mechanic. But a year and a half later production was cut, and with it Mr. Johnson.
So about five years ago, Mr. Johnson joined the ranks of the underemployed, settling for a series of low-wage jobs because his talents were no longer valued enough to assure him a secure and well-paid position. 
 But now, at 37 years of age, Mr. Johnson has found the right job: machining, a vital craft for manufacturing industries. What rescued him was an innovative retraining program that the State of California offers to tens of thousands of workers each year.
About one million experienced workers nationwide are laid off every year as the economy undergoes a fundamental restructuring and finds itself needing employees with more sophisticated skills. President-elect Bill Clinton has made job creation and training central elements of his plans for economic growth. Among those needing retraining and new jobs are workers with outdated skills like Mr. Johnson.
 
Success in California
 If the nation is to stand up to international competition, experts say, the economy needs more skilled workers. But, they add, most state and Federal programs intended to help those with waning skills are small or ineffective.
California seems to be an exception, as Mr. Johnson and 150,000 other workers have found over the 10 years since the state Legislature established the retraining program.
In 1990, Mr. Johnson went to work for McNeal Enterprises, a thriving machining shop of 25 employees in this recession-worn Silicon Valley town. He started at $8 an hour. Now he makes $11, or $22,000 a year, and he can aspire to $46,000, the salary of McNeal's top machinist.
Machinists make pieces of machines and whole machines that make machines. They fashion the models of industry's new products, along with the tools and molds to produce them. On the job, Mr. Johnson shapes fist-sized chunks of clear plastic into the core components of medical devices, like blood analysis instruments used in testing for AIDS.
"It's good work," he said. "It's clean work. It makes you think. You work with numbers all the time. Degrees. Circumferences. All kinds of numbers. You're actually creating something. You look at a blueprint and make it into what the blueprint calls for."
 
Help for the Skilled
 The California Legislature created the Employment Training Panel for experienced workers like Mr. Johnson, not the chronically unemployed or the unskilled youth that other programs help with more basic training.
Some other states, like New York, Illinois, Maryland, Delaware and Alaska, have retraining agencies, but they are much smaller and less comprehensive. Just this year, New Jersey started a program intended to approach the scope of California's. And through the Job Training Partnership Act, the Federal Government also tries to retrain laid-off workers. But California has achieved the most impressive results, experts say.
The program starts with a hard-nosed assumption that reverses the wisdom of the 1970's and early 80's. It does not try to turn middle-aged blast furnace operators into advanced computer programmers. Some people like Mr. Johnson are taught completely new skills, but only after passing aptitude tests. More often, the program tries to beef up the workers' existing skills long before they lose their jobs.
"Interestingly, the most effective training is for people who are working," said Anthony P. Carnivale, chief economist of the American Society for Training and Development, an organization of training professionals.
 
The Overview
Skills Change With Economy
 As the American economy evolves, there is widespread agreement that if Government wants to create more employment opportunities for everyone, it must do a better job of retraining experienced workers whose skills have grown less valuable. Unlike the old days, when an auto or steel worker knew his abilities would be needed through his working life, now few businesses stand still, and Americans who do not master new skills are at the mercy of foreigners who do.
"We have a rapidly changing economy where workers' skills have been getting out of date," said Evelyn Ganzglass, director of employment and social policy studies at the National Governors Association.
A result is the erosion of the standard of living that Mr. Clinton repeatedly mentioned in his campaign. Workplace skills are not the only problem. Inattentive corporate management, Federal economic policy and the general weakness of the economy affect the nation's competitiveness, too. But the huge deficit in foreign trade is in large part a measure of the deficit in workplace skills. By learning new skills, employees raise their productivity, which means they produce more and better goods and services without working harder.
"We want to step in to train people to be more productive while they are working," Ms. Ganzglass said. "That's our big aim, and the kind of training that works best."
 
Training for 50 Million
 Of 117 million working Americans, it is hard to say how many need retraining, though certainly the one million employees whom waning industries let go each year ought to be counted. Mr. Carnivale also estimates that 50 million workers still on the job need additional training. In factories, machine operators need to master computerized equipment, and office workers need to learn the ever-expanding abilities of their computers.
Government now does little to meet those needs. The largest Federal program, the Job Training Partnership Act, falls well short, experts say, offering no training for employed workers who do not face imminent layoffs and reaching only 30 percent of the one million people who do lose their jobs to plant closings and permanent layoffs each year. For those, it pays for a range of subsidized training programs, job counseling and unemployment benefits.
Assessing the program's performance is difficult. The General Accounting Office found that 71 percent of the workers who entered one part of it in 1990 were in new jobs 90 days later, earning an average of $8.64 an hour. But it could not ascertain how that compared with the pay in their former jobs.
Bob Cook, a public policy analyst in Boston, said the Federal program is most effective when administrators get involved in a company before a plant closes. But Linda G. Morra, director for education and employment issues at the accounting office, said the programs usually do not reach workers until three or four months after they lose their jobs.
 
California
Innovative Project With Possibilities
 It is hard to gauge the extent to which California's program helps the economy. The state is in a deep recession; unemployment stands at 9.4 percent. Nonetheless, in giving people new skills -- about 50,000 are now in retraining programs -- the state may be helping lay the ground for a robust recovery.
Advocates say the California program is an obvious model for the Federal job training program that Mr. Clinton says he will propose. And it does seem to be consistent with the President-elect's promises to go easy on taxpayers and the budget deficit. To pay for its program, California skims off a tenth of one percent of the unemployment insurance premiums that employers pay to support workers who lose their jobs.
The program works, experts say, because of the discipline the state imposes on the companies and training schools that receive its subsidies. The state training panel requires that each trainee land a job using his new skills and hold that job at least 90 days. If not, the state takes back all the money it paid to train him -- even if the trainee dies during the course. Studies show that about 70 percent of the participants fulfill the state's requirements.
"Start bending that rule, and where do you stop?" asked Gerald Geismar, the panel's executive director. The Federal Government sets performance goals for its programs, too, but none are as rigorous.
Cheryl Strecher, president of a consulting firm in Los Angeles that studied the program for the California Legislature, said, "We came to feel that this is the kind of program the Government should be doing more of."
 
Better Results
 Graduates of the California retraining projects do better than those in Federal programs. Richard W. Moore, a professor at California State University at Northridge, followed 46,946 workers who took part in state-financed retraining projects that ended between mid-1989 and mid-1990.
Among workers who retrained while still on the job, he found that those using their new skills a year later were earning an average of $28,538, or $3,897 more than they had before. And the formerly unemployed workers were earning an average of $19,358 a year, or $8,263 more than they had in their previous jobs.
Still, Professor Moore and Ms. Strecher say there is room for improvement. They say the training panel should be more of a tool of industrial policy, to guide the state's growth. Instead, they say the panel sometimes bends to pressure from local legislators trying just to keep people on the job.
In addition, employers who try to take part are ensnared with so much red tape that in 9 of the last 10 years, the panel has been unable to spend all of its annual budget, currently about $97 million.
Some analysts also suspect that some well-off companies are given aid, even though they probably have the resources to retrain their own workers. Indeed, Mr. Geismar says, "We don't look into financial performance." But he said a company does have to meet its performance guidelines and show a need to protect or save jobs through retraining.
Besides, he said, the money -- the unemployment insurance the companies pay -- is theirs anyway, not the taxpayers'. Barbara Hanscom, head of the panel's San Mateo regional office, also contended that intervening early, before a company is on the ropes, averts bigger spending later.
 
FMC Corporation
Seeking New Skill After Cold War
 If not for the California training program, the Ground Systems Division of the FMC Corporation would be a bleaker place. A large and diversified company, FMC makes Army tanks like Bradley Fighting Vehicles and M113's. But the tank business in the post-cold-war era is sinking fast.
From a peak employment of 7,000 in the mid-1980's, the division has shrunk to 3,000. In two more years, it expects to stop makingtanks altogether, abandoning most of the plant's blue-collar workers and many of its engineers.
Ted Krekelberg, a 36-year-old mechanical engineer earning $40,000 a year, is nervous about the future of the industry, which is not surprising given his experience at FMC.
He had been helping to design a common chassis that would serve a variety of armed vehicles. But the Army abandoned it in early October. He was then reassigned to work on a lightweight tank that could be dropped from airplanes. He has helped make six of them, and the next step would be an order for 300 more. But he knows that order may never come. So Mr. Krekelberg has begun thinking of other work.
"My objective is to get out of defense systems," he said.
 
Hopes for Retraining
 That hope hinges on the training he has been receiving for more than a year, as part of the Employment Training Panel, which is spending $2.5 million to retrain workers at FMC. The company says it is spending $12 million of its own, and through the Job Training Partnership Act, the Federal Government is providing $1.5 million more for related programs.
Mr. Krekelberg is learning computer-aided design, known as CAD. It lets him plot his design for a tank's component into a computer, then allows him to see how the component looks in three dimensions and how it fits in relation to the designs of other components. Everyone helping to design the tank can see instantly how their work affects that of other designers.
"There is a major requirement for CAD skills in the commercial sector," Mr. Krekelberg said. "The jobs are out there."
He reaches into the desk drawer where he keeps a sheaf of help-wanted advertisements. One is for an engineering job that would require him to pay for his health insurance and his pension. In addition, the job could end in a couple of years. But it would pay between $80,000 and $100,000 a year.
That might interest him, he said, and with his new training he believes he could become a strong candidate.
 
Solectron Corporation
Training Workers For Better Results
 Sales of the Solectron Corporation, near Santa Clara in Milpitas, have soared right through the recession, from $93 million in 1986 to $407 million in the 1992 fiscal year, and its profits have climbed even more. State-subsidized retraining is a good part of the reason, executives there say. Without it, they might have had to lay off some workers.
Solectron's 3,500 employees assemble printed circuit boards, which are sold to firms like I.B.M. and Apple.
In 1986, as the quality of its products slipped, Solectron suffered a $3.2 million loss and ordered a large layoff. Management decided that to survive, the company needed a more reliable production system, known as statistical process control. To learn it, the workers would need special training.
"We used to have a buddy system," said Richard W. Allen, the company's director of quality assurance. "You would sit with someone and watch what they were doing. That's how you would learn what to do." But as the complexity of the boards increased, employees were not able to do the job properly. "We could have hired other people," he said. "Instead we chose to train our own."
Toward that end, the state provided $1.4 million to subsidize a two-year training project for about 600 employees. That project has been completed, and with $650,000 more, the company is training another 600. The subsidy is less this time because the training panel expects the company to assume all its training costs eventually.
At work stations along the production lines, computers continually sample the work and print out their measurements so operators can see instantly when something has gone awry. They can then adjust the machinery to prevent mass production of defective boards.
Anna Ramos, 55, a graduate of the introductory course, sits at the end of a line that makes boards for computer tape drives. She is a quality inspector.
"I inspect for soldering, the height of parts, the values of the parts," she said, seeming confident of her contribution to Solectron.
A chart near her testing bench shows why. In early July, it says, when the company began producing the tape-drive boards, 8,000 parts per million were defective. By Aug. 4, the rate had dropped to 378.
 
Machining School
Out of Work, But Optimistic
 Workers who lose their jobs are the hardest to help. Living on only their unemployment benefits, typically half their former pay, most of them spend their days looking for another job, leaving them with little time for retraining classes.
But about 1,000 apply each year for the four-month courses at Mr. Johnson's alma mater, the training center of the National Tooling and Machining Association in Santa Clara. Bert H. Shuster, the executive director, says about 100 are accepted.
The current class is a cross-section of the state's unemployed. Some are young, but most are skilled older workers. John Coyle, 52, was laid off from one engineering job that paid $56,000 a year and then from another paying $45,000. John Kovalski, 46, was a technical support manager paid $52,000 until he was laid off. And Nancy Nielson, 41, earned about $30,000 as a survey map maker and structural designer in the now-moribund construction industry.
Now all of them see machining as their best hope for jobs paying more than the minimum wage. Mr. Kovalski expects that in four or five years, he will be be earning up to $14 an hour, just over half his former earnings. Still, as a machinist, at least he expects to survive recessions.
"Middle management is not a good place to be," he said.
For all these students, California's retraining program could pay off. "We're in a desperate situation," says Bob L. McNeal, Mark Johnson's boss and president of McNeal Enterprises. "There's not enough young ones. I just ran an ad for a machinist-plastics fabricator. I ran it for 14 days. I had 66 applicants. Eleven I felt I could talk to. Two were qualified. I hired one."

GRAPHIC: Photos: As the nation's economy changes, workers need new skills for different types of jobs. Mark H. Johnson, who lost two lucrative positions when production slowdowns forced layoffs, was rescued from a subsequent string of unskilled jobs through California's retraining program. He learned machining and now works in Santa Clara.; Ted Krekelberg hopes retraining can get him out of the depressed business of designing tanks. He is learning computer-aided design, which allows him to see how a component looks in three dimensions and how it fits in with other components.

HEADLINE: GATT Pact Is Sought By Year-End

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 26

 BODY:
After being deadlocked for almost a year by disagreements over agriculture, world trade negotiations resumed today in Geneva, with representatives of 108 nations aiming to conclude a new trade liberalization package before the end of this year.
The way was opened for an early conclusion of the global trade accord when the United States and the European Community settled their longstanding dispute over farming subsidies last week. France has denounced the deal but could not block resumption of the global talks. 
 These trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, are widely viewed as a key to reviving economic growth, particularly in the industrialized world. They have been going on since September 1986 under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Missed Deadlines
 Although negotiators have missed several previous deadlines, Arthur Dunkel, GATT's director-general, said today that he was encouraged enough to propose achieving "a successful political conclusion" by the end of this year. The 108-nation Trade Negotiating Committee approved the target date.
"We're going to do everything we can to get agreement within the deadline set by Dunkel," Rufus Yerxa, the Deputy United States Trade Representative, said after this morning's session. "You can count on full U.S. participation."
The talks cover 15 areas not tackled in previous GATT "rounds," including services, textiles, intellectual property and industry, as well as agriculture. Economists believe an agreement to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers could add $200 billion a year to world trade by 2002.
While progress has been achieved in many areas and a draft final accord has long existed, the talks ground to a halt because the 12-nation European Community refused to bend to demands by the United States and other leading food producers to cut its subsidies to farmers and food exports.
Then, earlier this month, a new breakdown in farm talks and an American threat of punitive sanctions against some European Community exports suddenly raised the specter of a trade war. Last week, the community backed off and accepted a 21 percent reduction in its subsidized food exports.
France, which is Europe's largest food exporter, promptly rejected the farm-trade agreement worked out by the community's executive commission with Washington. Unable to veto the pact, France has now warned its European partners that it will veto any final GATT accord harmful to its interests.
But since the community is represented in trade bargaining by its executive commission and takes its decisions as a bloc, France's lonely stance is likely to have little impact on the GATT talks. Many trade experts also question whether France would veto a GATT package that would benefit many nonfarming sectors of its economy.
 
'3-Dimensional Chess Game'
 In his statement restarting the global talks, Mr. Dunkel emphasized that different aspects of the Uruguay Round were interlinked, a reference to the fact that concessions in one area could be exchanged for concessions in another area. "Nothing is final until everything is settled," he noted.
Above all, he has called for "intensive, nonstop" negotiations to settle outstanding differences over market access for goods and over liberalization of services. The procedure is immensely complex because bilateral and multilateral deals must be worked out simultaneously.
"It's a bit like a three-dimensional chess game involving 108 governments," one GATT official explained. "And you have to remember that everyone complains all the time. Governments never say they are happy when they extract an advantage. That would not be good bargaining. But in the end, it's all a matter of give and take."
 
Fast-Track Approval
 Mr. Dunkel aims to achieve broad agreement on the so-called Final Act of the Uruguay Round by the end of this year, but he acknowledged that it might not be possible to work out each country's schedule for removing specific barriers within that time.
GATT officials said that while the year-end deadline for a political agreement had a symbolic ring about it, failure to meet it would in fact bring serious new complications, not least to plans to obtain ratification of the package by the United States Congress.
They noted that authority to seek Congressional ratification by the so-called fast-track procedure -- under which Congress can accept or reject the accord, but cannot offer amendments -- ends on June 1. But Congress must also be allowed 90 days for reflection, which means any GATT accord must be ready by March 1.

HEADLINE: Somalia Aid Workers Split on Troops

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Nov. 26

 BODY:
With the popping of gunfire a daily occurrence, Mogadishu is always a jumpy city, but the disquiet was aggravated this afternoon by reports that United States troops might be coming and by fears of the effects of such intervention.
Aid workers were clearly divided over whether military intervention would help relief shipments reach starving Somalis, or ignite further chaos and bloodshed in a country plundered by clan warfare and withered by famine. 
 Peter Stocker, head of the International Red Cross operation here, said United Nations peacekeeping troops should be increased only in coordination with the warring clan leaders.
"If that isn't done, the United Nations would not attain its objective of building up confidence for possible political dialogue," he said.
 
A Possible Reversal
 Many officials and workers said they feared an unwelcome outside force would unite Somali factions. The result, they said, could be a shooting war between the United Nations and unified Somali forces or the kind of indiscriminate killings that characterized the clan war between November and February.
The appearance today of armed trucks, jeeps and a tank with mounted artillery at the headquarters of the International Medical Corps, an American agency, signaled the opposition of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, the most recalcitrant Somali leader, relief officials here said.
The offer of troops, made Wednesday by President Bush, came as clan fighters and greedy gunmen stepped up attacks on the relief agencies struggling to feed nearly 2 million hungry Somalis.
The United States would most likely use Air Force planes to transport troops to Somalia and deploy 2,000 marines off the coast, a senior Administration official said today.
 
Food Just Offshore
 The rise in violence here, including the shelling Tuesday of a United Nations ship with 10,000 tons of wheat as it tried to enter port, has rapidly depleted stocks across the famine zone, aid officials said.
The International Red Cross said today that it had cut rations to one-quarter at its 300 kitchens in Mogadishu, serving only 523 calories' worth of rice, oil and beans, the equivalent of a small bar of chocolate.
Even at this level, only three days' food remained in Red Cross warehouses in Mogadishu. With the airport closed because of violence, aid workers could foresee no clear way of getting sizable quantities of food.
At the same time, two ships with 3,500 tons of rice each waited offshore, as they have for days. The United Nations ship carrying wheat was diverted to Mombasa, Kenya.
A senior United States official said that as food deliveries by plane and ship increased in the last month, a higher proportion was looted.
 
Looting Rate Doubles
 The official, Andrew S. Natsios, the aid coordinator for the Agency for International Development, who has been directing the United States program in Somalia, said 80 percent of the donated food was "being looted or used as protection money," up from about 40 percent in mid-October.
"Either the United Nations has to reconsider the tactics on security, or the entire relief operation should be closed down," Mr. Natsios said Wednesday in a telephone interview from the United States. "You can't tolerate 80 percent of the food being stolen. It's an outrage."
He said food stolen at gunpoint was being exchanged in neighboring Ethiopia for weapons. "The relief food should not be a treasury to buy more guns," he said, speaking shortly before Washington's offer of troops became public.
The reference to protection money underlined one of the more bizarre aspects of the famine: the security arrangements among the relief agencies, which hire private gunmen to protect their houses, warehouses and convoys of food. The hired guns, usually paid in food and cash, have often turned on agency personnel or looted the food they are supposed to guard.
 
500 Wary Pakistanis
 So far, only 500 United Nations troops have arrived to guard food convoys; three months ago, the Security Council approved a contingent of 3,500.
The initial force, from Pakistan, arrived in early October, but only slightly more than 100 have been deployed, at the main airport. The other 3,000, from Canada, Belgium, Egypt and Nigeria, are to be sent to other areas.
So far, General Aidid has prevented the Pakistani troops from being stationed at the port, the main entry point for food, United Nations officials said.
 
'You're Going to Get Shot'
 But Mr. Natsios was also referring to the limited mandate assigned to United Nations troops so far. Mr. Natsios said he understood the Pakistanis had only side arms and were more concerned with protecting themselves than with protecting food convoys.
"You attack a relief shipment and you're going to get shot," should be the message and method of United Nations troops, he said.

THE LAND
 
Somalia, a nation of more than 4.5 millikon people ion the eastern edge of the Horn of Africa, has been torn byfierce clan fighting since President Mohammed Siad Barre was ousted last year.
 
THE WAR
 
The two main militia leaders are Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, a Soviet-trained military officer who lays claim to being the rightful leader of Somalia, and Mohammed Ali Mahdi, a mild-mannered hotelier who goes by the title Interim President of Somalia. They conspired in January 1991 to oust President Siad Barre, then later had a falling-out and fought a war earlier this year that virutally destroyed Mogadishu and closed the capital's port.
 
THE FAMINE
 
More than two milion Somalis have been forced off their lands by the warring militias, who have prevented farmers from planting crops and killed much of the nation's livestock. Aid officials say as many one-third of the Somalis, or even more, may die in the next six months without food, yet aid officials estimate that 80 percent of the food that is sent is being stolen.

HEADLINE: In Swank Shops, Lebanon Seeks the Gougers

BYLINE: By IHSAN A. HIJAZI

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Lebanese involved in business were shaken this week after Government inspectors backed by police escorts raided and closed a number of exclusive stores in the capital, accusing them of defrauding the public.
The raids were videotaped and shown on television. Stunned shopkeepers with their jaws dropping and their eyes staring in surprise were reprimanded by police officers for failing to show proper invoices for their merchandise and for overpricing. 
 The raids were one of numerous measures used recently by the authorities in their attempt to inject discipline in a country used to the anarchy of 15 years of civil war.
In another part of the campaign, traffic violators were given a 24-hour warning in the form of a communique from the traffic department, after which tow trucks went into action removing double parked cars. Traffic violation fees are doubled if not paid in 10 days.
"The next mission is to clear side walks from car vendors," promised a senior traffic official.
Pedestrians can no longer use pavements because squatters selling used cars imported from Germany and the United States have taken them over.
People stealing electricity by stretching wires from their houses to power cables on the streets have been fined. "The next time they do this they will have no electricity at all," warned John Lyon, the new director of the state power grid. Mr. Lyon sent teams of collectors to thousands of homes to collect unpaid power bills.
Fouad Siniora, minister of state for finance, said: "We are determined to collect all that is due to the treasury. Not one cent will be allowed to go unpaid."
Throughout the civil war, very few Lebanese paid income tax. Now businesses have received notices to prepare their books and have them ready for inspection by tax officials.
After the army took over law and order duties when all militias were disarmed and dissolved in March 1990, troops seized public buildings and offices occupied by gunmen.
"No security violations or plundering of public property will be tolerated in the future," the army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, said.
President Elias Hrawi told the troops in an independence day speech this week: "Destroy any one who may try to challenge you."
The day of the raids on the stores, President Hrawi warned "greedy merchants" that they will no longer be allowed "to suck the blood of the people." He said he was one of the citizens complaining about runaway inflation.
Airing his views in a television interview to mark the halfway point of his six-year term, the President said there was no justification for the cost of living to remain so high when the value of the Lebanese currency has appreciated by nearly 30 percent in relation to the United States dollar and other currencies. "Prices should fall by the same proportion," he demanded.
They did not. The main public complaint has been that when the Lebanese pound rate depreciated against the dollar, shops raised prices. But when the reverse happens, the price does not come down.
The formation of a new Cabinet last month under a billionaire, Rafik al-Hariri, has injected confidence in the economy, and sent Lebanese converting their holdings in dollars and other foreign currency into Lebanese pounds.
In a laissez-faire society, Lebanese businessmen are free to do what they like. But President Hrawi warned them this time that if they do not stop their greed, the Government would interfere and apply what he called "guided economy." Information Minister Michel Samaha was quick, however, to point out that the President did not mean that Lebanon would end its traditional policy of free enterprise.
The raids on the shops were supervised by a department in the Ministry of Economy for the protection of consumers. Among the stores affected were Beirut's two most exclusive super markets, Mandarine and Goodies. The owners were allowed to reopen their doors after pleading with Economy Minister Hagob Demarjian.

HEADLINE: Blockaded Iraqi Kurds Face Fearsome Winter

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

DATELINE: DOHUK, Iraq, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Soft, wet snow has begun to fall over northern Iraq, laying a mantle over the desolate steppe and signaling the start what may well be one of the most difficult periods for the Iraqi Kurds since they were freed from the grip of Saddam Hussein's Government 18 months ago.
The Kurds, crippled by a 15-month-old blockade by Baghdad that has left them bereft of kerosene for heating, food and basic supplies, will depend on the $200 million in relief assistance, including $43 million from the United States Agency for International Development and $20 million from the European Community, that is just beginning to be trucked into the north. 
 The United Nations hopes to deliver at least nine million gallons of kerosene by the end of December and 13,000 tons of food. But its officials in northern Iraq fear that the program, hastily planned and beginning only now, may not be enough to avert disaster.
"We are way behind," a United Nations official said, "and we have grossly underestimated what the Kurds will need. Even if we had enough to hand out, which we do not, I do not think we could get it distributed in time."
The 4 million Kurds live in a security zone set up by the allied forces following an abortive rebellion just after the Persian Gulf war. The zone, which runs roughly along Iraq's 36th parallel, was created to convince 1.5 million Kurdish refugees in Turkey and Iran that it was safe to return home. It is monitored by a small team of military observers in the border town of Zakho and frequent flights by warplanes based in Turkey.
The withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the north and Baghdad's decision to impose a strict embargo, refusing even to pay pensions or forward letters, speeded the Kurds' decision to form their own government this summer.
But the de facto Kurdish state, with meager revenues and few resources, has presided over a steady deterioration in living standards.
Roads and bridges are crumbling into disuse. There are frequent power outages. Gasoline can be bought only on the black market. And with a host of materials from window panes to spare parts for machines now unavailable, printing shops, mills, bakeries and garages have all had to shut down, swelling the ranks of the unemployed.
Prices for basic items like kerosene have risen more than 100 times what they were before the Iraqi blockade.
"We are grateful for what the United Nations is doing," said Massoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, one of the two main Kurdish factions, "but what they are providing is little and will not solve the problems we face. The U.N. and international agencies should, in addition to relief, help us with some long-term development projects."
At least 8,000 families live in tents; tens of thousands will huddle in gutted buildings with only thin plastic sheeting covering the empty window frames.
The Kurds have chopped down most trees around the urban centers, with many families even digging out the roots, to stockpile fuel for the winter.
Families that have subsisted on vegetables for months now watch in horror as prices spiral upward and the volume in the markets decline, leaving only cans of imported goods that are priced beyond their reach.
"As we get closer to winter, we are beginning to see increasing numbers of children who have some degree of malnutrition," said Dr. Ghayat al-Din Obeid Ala, the general director of health for Dohuk Province. "Every day there is less and less to eat."
Fatima Ibrahim stood on a small concrete landing outside the one-room hovel where she lives with her husband and five children. For several weeks her family has survived on a cold porridge of chick peas and tomatoes while her husband scrounges for odd jobs.
But jobs are as scarce as food, and he usually returns with no earnings and cold feet.
Inside the room, two of Mrs. Ibrahim's young sons, wrapped in tattered gray blankets, lay on the floor, racked by high fevers. One was so sick he could no longer walk.
"It is the winter that scares us the most," she said. "Before we could at least exist, but now we do not see a way out."

The Economy
Productivity has grown sharply in the last 18 months, a sign that the recovery is likely to endure. The average American worker now turns out more than $28 in goods and services an hour, the highest ever and nearly a dollar above the amount in the spring of 1991, when the recession hit bottom. [Page D9.]
Hesitancy over the economy is the dominant mood in Reading, Pa., which was surveyed for the eighth time since the onset of the recession in 1990 as representative of the Northeast economy. Although the election of Bill Clinton brought a temporary surge in consumer activity, Reading's business community is unsure whether a true economic rebound will occur. [D9.] 
 The American weapons industry has entered a phase of consolidation forced by declining Pentagon spending. It is expected that by 2000, less than half of the current contractors will remain independent or leaders in their fields. But some say that is positive because it reduces overcapacity. [D12.]
 
International
Nomura Securities will pay nearly $200 million to compensate customers for losses on bonds that it had promised would never fall in value. The world's largest brokerage said its brokers sold $390 million of bonds that plummeted in value when the American real estate market declined. [D9.]
World trade negotiations resumed in Geneva after being deadlocked for almost a year by disagreements over agriculture. The way was opened for an early conclusion of the global trade accord when the United States and the European Community settled their longstanding dispute over farming subsidies last week. [D9.]
OPEC appeared near deadlock and oil prices tumbled as the organization struggled to reconcile competing demands to sell more oil within an output ceiling low enough to push prices higher. World oil prices, down 10 percent since mid-October, plunged to a seven-month low in European markets. [D10.]
 
Companies
Digital Equipment is preparing to accelerate its layoffs before the end of the year. People inside the company said that by Dec. 7, at least 7,500 more employees, and perhaps 8,800, would be laid off worldwide, many in New England. [D10.]
The F.C.C. is agonizing over what to do about the raunchy remarks of Howard Stern, the New York disk jockey who, with his employer, the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, is struggling with regulators over "indecent" programming. [D14.]
 
Markets
The Global Settlement Fund is a novel 24-hour money transfer system that might someday be used by all kinds of businesses for sending payments to one another. While securities and currencies are traded 24 hours a day in London, New York and Tokyo, there had been no way for traders to send or receive payments outside of business hours in their local market. [D12.]
The dollar inched up in overseas dealings thinned by the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Treasury bonds rose slightly in London, where stocks also advanced. [D12.]

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Per Worker Is Growing

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The nation's productivity has seen a much-needed growth spurt over the last 18 months, a compelling sign that the economic recovery is likely to endure.
After slipping for two years, productivity of American workers has been rising at a solid 2.6 percent annual rate. Indeed, since the economy is believed to have grown during the summer at a faster rate than previously thought, productivity probably surged more than 3.5 percent in the third quarter. 
 Higher productivity means that the average American worker -- still the most efficient in the world -- now turns out more than $28 worth of goods and services an hour. The figure, adjusted for inflation, is the highest ever and nearly $1 above the level in the spring of 1991 when the recession finally hit bottom.
 
Done Without Adding Jobs
 The productivity rebound has been so strong that it means all the additional output of the United States economy in the recovery so far has been achieved without adding any jobs or work hours. Since the spring of 1991, annual output has grown by $150 billion.
The fact that businesses can produce more with the same or fewer people is painful for those who are unemployed, and it poses a challenge for the new Clinton Administration, which has promised to create more jobs. But it is also a crucial sign of improving economic health.
Whether the recent rebound in output per worker hour signals a permanent turnaround in the nation's long-run productivity prospects remains to be seen. In the meantime, though, the pickup to date is a compelling sign that the economic expansion is developing staying power.
 
A 'Classic' Signal
 Productivity typically spurts early in recoveries, as companies better utilize employees who, because of soft sales, were not laid off but who were also not working flat out. It is also during this period that companies typically are too cautious to hire new help.
"It's a classic recovery signal," said Lawrence H. Kudlow, an economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
Productivity gains are holding down the price of services to consumers and businesses. They are also keeping labor costs flat, making businesses more competitive. And most significantly, rising productivity has pushed up corporate profits, despite so-so sales; that means companies will eventually be able to hire more workers and investment in new equipment.
The gains in productivity appear to be far more widespread than during the early part of the 1980's expansion. A rough calculation using published Government data suggests that the services sector of the economy -- broadly defined to include construction as well as banking, fast-food restaurants and retail stores -- may have contributed as much as two-thirds of the rise in productivity in the last 18 months.
Throughout the 1980's, by contrast, productivity did not grow at all for the service sector, considered as a whole.
"I see tremendous changes taking place in some service industries," said Martin N. Baily, a productivity expert at the University of Maryland, citing a wave of restructuring in industries like banking, retailing and railroads.
The big question is whether productivity will continue to increase or will slacken when the economy fully recovers from the recession.
"We see a lot of layoffs going on, a lot of restructuring," said Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School at Harvard and the author of several books on productivity. "Maybe this is the kick-in-the-pants productivity needs, and this is a sustainable. Or maybe companies are just very pessimistic about the recovery."
Productivity's contribution to long-term economic well-being would be hard to exaggerate. Over a matter of decades, productivity growth determines how fast living standards can rise and how quickly the economy as a whole can expand.
Workers, ultimately, can only consume as much as they produce. That's why increasing the sluggish growth of productivity -- on average, less than 1 percent a year in the last two decades -- was at the heart of the economic programs put forth by Ronald Reagan's supply-side theorists and now by President-elect Bill Clinton's public-investment gurus.
Thanks to the power of compounding, seemingly small differences in productivity growth rates, if they persist long enough, have dramatic consequences for long-term growth in living standards.
The difference between 0.8 percent, the trend in the past 20 years, and the average rate for the past century, 1.7 percent, is huge. If productivity is growing close to 2 percent, living standards double every 35 years. If growth is closer to 1 percent, it takes 70 years.
Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, is among those predicting a permanent shift toward faster productivity growth. "On the basis of the striking improvement in productivity growth in the last year, I'd say we're heading back toward a long-term productivity growth trend of 1.7 or 1.8 percent," he said.
Productivity optimists like Mr. Roach argue that as inflation is gradually squeezed out of the economy, service companies are finding it harder to pass on cost increases to customers.
Foreign competition is also affecting services, both directly and indirectly -- as more and more companies from abroad enter the American market and, probably more importantly, as American manufacturers insist on higher quality at lower cost. Moreover, the greater competition created by deregulation is forcing consolidation and automation in everything from airlines to banking.
"A lot of the downsizing we're seeing will endure," Mr. Roach said.
But productivity pessimists take the opposite view, arguing that nothing fundamental, like the pace of technological innovation, has changed. All that is happening, they contend, is that companies are correcting the excesses -- overoptimistic hiring and sloppy management -- that crop up when times are good for a long time, as they were in the 1980's.
The recent productivity growth "is nothing to cheer about," said Robert H. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. "It's going to grow faster than normal because it has a lot of catching up to do."
 
What Both Sides Want
 Most economists remain on the fence, pointing out that only time can settle this debate. "Based on my long experience watching these numbers," said Mr. Dean at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "I hesitate to say that a trend that's lasted five or six quarters will last even one or two more."
Regardless of their views, the optimists and pessimists alike want the incoming administration to press ahead with growth-oriented policies aimed at improving the skills of the work force and boosting both public and private investment in everything from roads to research and development.
"We shouldn't rest on our laurels," said Stanley Fischer, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist. "Productivity is growing very fast. But a revival in living standards really depends on some revival of investment."

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
United in Love for Homemade Songs

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: SHARON, Conn.

 BODY:
SO you're a respected research chemist who lives with precise equations and predictable reactions. And your daughter Caroline, the graduate student, comes home one day with a blue-jeaned fellow carrying a guitar and a weathered look like those country singers who've clearly lived a full life, maybe two, before 40. Turns out this guy is an itinerant folk singer who's temporarily unemployed. (Aren't they all?)
Daddy, says your beloved daughter, I'd like you to meet Sandy Paton, my husband. 
 How do you do, Mr. Pa ---- Your what?!
Apparently, that consenting chemist, Reuben Swenson, knew a little about human chemistry, too, in 1957 when Sandy and Caroline were united in love for each other and for the homemade ballads, ditties and laments of everyday life that say so much in song about the society that spawns them.
Caroline Swenson had never been part of the bubblegum-chewing, Fabian-worshipping crowd anyway. In fact, she was supposed to be taking ski lessons when a friend dragged her to an evening of folk songs in Berkeley where Sandy Paton hadn't planned on being either. But even hitchikers need a few dollars now and then.
So there he was singing the Riddle Song and nodding, as always, to the audience to join the refrain when he hears this lovely voice in the second row coming from a knockout brunette in a dirndl and peasant blouse. (Remember, this is pre-60's.)
He's trying to think of a good pickup line when she strides up and says, "Would you teach me that unusual version of the Riddle Song?"
"Come on back to my friend's house," he suggests. (Is this column beginning to sound like a folk song?) Three days later he asks for her hand. One week more and he hires a band. Now, 35 years after their wedding and thousands of recordings and sing-alongs in theaters, church basements, classrooms, coffee shops and kitchens across the country, Sandy and Caroline Paton have been named Connecticut's official State Troubadours for 1993.
To match the official salary, there are no official duties. It's just a yearlong honor bestowed by the legislature recognizing two lifelong singers of folk songs for, well, folks.
"We appreciate it," said Caroline, who's 60 years old. "Maybe we'll get more bookings." They sang yesterday for Thanksgiving diners at the nearby Interlaken Inn and appear tomorrow evening at West Hartford's First Church of Christ Congregational (the basement, of course).
After the 1960's folk scare when the Kingston Trio and other awfully clean groups in pressed pants and striped shirts took folk songs to unprecedented heights of slick, packaged popularity that shocked traditionalists, folk music has returned to a comfortable obscurity and a presumed purity.
Being a folk singer is not your standard 9 to 5 job, unless you mean 9 P.M. to 5 A.M. when the crowd, the guitar and the wine are good. The Patons are folk singers with a cordless phone, their own 800-number (836-0901) and a label (Folk Legacy) with more than 100 recordings available from their 19th-century carriage-house near here.
And there's more to the Patons' 1,000-song repertory than those mind-numbing choruses of Michael Rowed the Boat Ashore that Peace Corps volunteers have carried to every corner of the globe.
Let's face it, more folk music was written in the barn than the parlor. It was intended for private porch performances at a time the country's isolated pockets of population made their own entertainment or did without, not for a wired era of widespread enjoyment when global satellites simultaneously televise recordings with warning labels.
Folk songs tell of brave heroes, pure maidens, sadness and glee. But like some of Shakespeare's lilting literary licentiousness, old-fashioned folk music, despite its often jaunty rhythms, can also be violent (spouses murdering one another), immoral (doing deals with the devil) and euphemistic, even for its day. It doesn't, for instance, take Madonna to suggest that, in original versions, more may have been going on in Dinah's kitchen than someone strumming on an old banjo.
But that's what fascinates the Patons (no, not that -- the revealing changes in lyrics over generations). "There's no end to the world's folk songs," said the 63-year-old Mr. Paton, who has spent decades combing rural America and the British Isles for them, then tracing their evolving themes and lyrics. "And every folk song is always alive, always changing, as singers adapt them for different times and audiences."
The Patons adjust songs and performances for specific audiences, even adding their own lyrics. Last summer, one spectator tried to request her favorite old folk song but couldn't remember the title. She sang a verse.
"I know it," said Mr. Paton. "I wrote it."

HEADLINE: Beekeepers Face a Myriad Of Challenges

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
Members of the Empire State Honey Producers wanted to sweeten their morning oatmeal during a recent conference here. So Fred Thompson dashed out the restaurant door and returned with a jar of honey.
If the beekeepers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut could only solve the rest of their problems with such ease. Experts and beekeepers at the conference said the industry is facing some of the toughest challenges in recent memory. 
 Beekeepers are battling insects, black bears, diseases, honey exports from China and other problems.
Eight years ago, the biggest challenge beekeepers faced was a disease called American Foulbrood, a bacterial infection that can be controlled with antibiotics.
Now they are faced with even larger disease and pest problems, including the infestation of two types of mites that have destroyed large portions of the bee populations in the three states.
 
Number of Colonies Declines
 "From about 1984 through 1992, we have lost about a third of our bees," said Robert Mungari, director of the Division of Plant Industry for the New York State Department of Agriculture. Between 1985 and 1986, Mr. Mungari estimated, New York State had about 120,000 bee colonies. "We estimate that we are now down to around 80,000 colonies due to the honeybee tracheal mite," he said.
Beekeepers must also protect their bees from bears, which love to devour hives full of honey. Robert Morse, a professor of agriculture at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., has encouraged New York beekeepers to fight to retain a provision in the state law that allows beekeepers to shoot bears that are in the process of destroying hives.
Beekeepers in Connecticut are not allowed to shoot the bears, said Carol Lemmon, Deputy State Entomologist for the Department of Agriculture in Connecticut, so some have turned to electric fences to keep bears away from the hives.
Bear damage to hives in New Jersey has been limited to the area north of Trenton, said Walt Wilson, an apiary inspector for the state. Beekeepers in New Jersey also use electric fences, since the state prohibits the shooting of bears.
But economics may pose an even bigger threat to beekeeping.
According to a recent industry study conducted at the College of Agriculture at Cornell University, more than 16 percent of the nation's beekeepers have costs that exceed their incomes.
Federal subsidies for beekeepers -- which began in 1954 to provide adequate pollination for agricultural crops by maintaining a viable beekeeping industry -- have been increased in the face of competition from China, which has grown increasingly stiff as honey exporters in different provinces have begun competing with each other, Dr. Morse said. But those subsidies, along with other Federal agricultural supports, have come under attack from some members of Congress, and beekeepers fear they may lack the political clout to protect their interests.
Despite all the problems, though, the beekeepers stay in business because beekeepers love what they're doing. Ms. Lemmon has four hives she maintains as a hobby. "You become very attached to your hives and your bees," she said. "They are almost like pets."

HEADLINE: Uncertainty and Hope on Main Street

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa., Nov. 26

 BODY:
For George S. Reppert, general manager of Kachel Ford near here, the election of Bill Clinton three weeks ago removed one uncertainty and replaced it with another.
Even if not everyone in Berks County, which George Bush narrowly carried, is pleased with the election's outcome, "at last we have somebody," Mr. Reppert said. 
 But now Mr. Reppert and legions of other area business people must decide as they plan for 1993 whether to bet that the modest upturn in consumer activity since the election will produce a full-fledged rebound in sales and profits.
 
 
Sense of Hesitancy
 "There was a certain upsurge," said Mr. Reppert, describing a flurry of showroom traffic and sales in the week or so after Nov. 3. But activity has since died down, adding a sense of hesitancy to Mr. Reppert's outlook.
Indeed, hesitancy is the dominant mood in this southeastern Pennsylvania city and the surrounding area of Berks County, which was surveyed for the eighth time since the onset of the recession in 1990 as representative of the Northeast's economy.
At Kachel Ford, in suburban Shillington, the hesitancy takes the form of holding up plans to invest $60,000 in a new computer system and $40,000 for shop equipment because of uncertainties over new tax credits for business investments promised by the incoming Clinton Administration. Mr. Clinton listed the tax credits as a priority, and they seem likely to meet relatively little opposition in Congress.
"We're waiting to find out what's happening," Mr. Reppert said as he sat in his showroom near a 1925 Model T that his wife's grandfather sold in his first year as a franchisee. Decades later, the dealership repurchased the car and restored it. "We don't want to make a dumb investment and miss it by a week or a month," Mr. Reppert added, referring to the effective date of any new investment tax credits.
Mr. Clinton has proposed providing tax breaks to companies that buy a certain amount of business equipment. Economists say such investment tax credits will help stimulate the economy and create jobs. But it is undecided how much equipment companies will have to buy to qualify for the credits or when the credits will take effect.
There are, of course, already signs of a measurable pickup in the Reading area's economy. Louis F. Lauer, manager of the Pennsylvania State Job Service office on Cherry Street, said his caseload of unemployment claims runs just over 5,000 these days, down from about 8,000 in early summer and 6,500 in February.
"The openings are coming in a little better," Mr. Lauer observed, pointing to the seasonal increases at Godiva Chocolate and other employers in the county's prodigious candy business. He also cited a handful of plant expansions, like the one at Sweet Street Desserts, a fast-growing specialty food operation.
And Metropolitan Edison, the dominant electric utility, finds industrial sales of electricity, adjusted for weather, running 2.7 percent ahead of the 1991 pace so far this year. And for October alone, commercial and residential demand is running ahead of the year-to-date average. Industrial power, a gauge of manufacturing activity, fell 2 percent in 1991.
There are even some companies, like the Morgan Corporation, a builder of truck bodies hard by the Morgantown interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, that are enjoying particularly strong rebounds in sales.
Donald Griffin, executive vice president, said business had jumped some 50 percent this year, bouncing back from a poor 1991 after Ryder, Hertz Penske and other fleet owners found themselves unable to defer buying new equipment any longer.
"Everybody tried to postpone capital appropriations," said Mr. Griffin, whose headquarters plant here turns out up to half of Ryder's East Coast fleet. "Then they started getting eaten alive with maintenance expenses."
But even as the company prepares to recall 30 remaining laid-off workers for the peak winter-spring production cycle, Mr. Griffin frets that the bulk of the company's recovery has probably already occurred.
This could be somewhat ominous, since Morgan's business, according to Mr. Griffin, tends to move up or down before the economy at large.
With its myriad outlet and traditional malls, four Kmart stores, three Wal-Mart outlets, a new "designer outlet center" and other national chains, Berks County is one of the most dense per-capita sales territories on earth. But for the county's retailers, the mood is hardly sanguine, despite hopes for an improved 1992 holiday season.
Charles R. Thamarus, manager of Joseph's Clothier on Penn Street in Reading's downtown, said business perked up in October but that November had so far been "spotty," trailing the year-earlier period and providing little incentive to build inventories.
Fern Schmehl, who with her husband Daniel runs the Iron Horse Hobby House, reports no improvement in a business that has been dismal all year and has historically thrived in hard times.
"We should be very busy with the trains right now," Mrs. Schmehl said. With more apparent hope than expectations, she added, "I'm waiting for Clinton to turn the economy around."
 
 
Sign of the Times
 One sobering sign of consumer sentiment over the last several weeks is the relative lack of interest among students at generally affluent Governor Mifflin High School in signing up for the annual Easter break trip to Europe.
In recent years, long lines formed on the first day of school to obtain one of the coveted 54 places reserved for juniors and seniors. But over several weeks this fall, the trip leader, Michael T. Kostzewa, was able to round up only 34 students despite opening the trip to 10th-graders.
"I definitely think it's related to the economy," said Mr. Kostzewa, a social studies teacher, adding that putting a few Eastern European cities on the itinerary for the first time may also have slightly diminished the appeal. "They don't seem to want to spend the money."
The nine-day trip in early April will cost $1,400, up about $75 from last spring.
But the Berks County economy, like any other, is a swirl of crosscurrents and seemingly contradictory signals that make it nearly impossible to gauge the present condition precisely, much less project the future.
Such crosscurrents have swept over individual businesses like the Singer Equipment Company, a $25 million-a-year supplier to the food service industry.
Orders to outfit new restaurants are "very, very dead," said Henry D. Singer, president of the family-owned company, whose core market extends about 100 miles from Reading. Spending at restaurants by the elderly, by middle-income workers and by those on expense accounts has fallen substantially and remains depressed, the owner of a local chain of restaurants recently told Mr. Singer.
 
 
'Wave of Optimism'
 On the other hand, Singer Equipment is enjoying brisk sales for new or renovated eating facilities in places like retirement communities, country clubs, fast-food operations, hospitals, bars, churches, schools and caterers.
"There is a definite wave of optimism, not the dark and gloomy atmosphere like there was in the first quarter" of 1992, Mr. Singer said.
But profit margins are being squeezed ferociously -- "The greatest pressure we've ever seen," he said -- and banks are still largely unwilling to finance new ventures, notoriously risky in the restaurant business.
Mr. Singer, like Mr. Reppert, the manager of the Ford dealership, hopes to benefit soon from new business investment credits that in the past have proved "great impetus" for his customers to place orders. But for the present, there is the hesitancy.
"Some of them have told us that if it happens, they certainly will upgrade their equipment," he said, "but they're holding off to see what's going to happen."

GRAPHIC: Photos: While much of the business prospects for 1993 seems shrouded in hesitancy in the area around Reading, Pa., the Morgan Corporation, a builder of truck bodies, has experienced a strong rebound in sales. But management still frets, fearing that the bulk of its recovery has already occurred; George S. Reppert, general manager of Kachel Ford, finds economic comfort in the fact that the election is over, "At last we have somebody." (Photographs by Sal DiMarco Jr. for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: A Fund-Shifting System That's Open All Night

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Global Settlement Fund may sound like a common money market fund, but behind that bland title is a novel 24-hour money transfer system that might some day be used by all kinds of businesses for sending payments to one another.
While securities and currencies are traded 24 hours a day in London, New York and Tokyo, there has not been any way for traders to send or receive payments outside of business hours in their local market. 
 The Bankers Trust Company, creator and manager of the new fund, began offering it earlier this month to members of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The exchange, whose 87 members include most of the nation's leading banks and securities firms, recently changed its rules so members can satisfy daily margin calls by sending the fund's shares to the exchange rather than cash or Treasury bills.
 
 
A 24-Hour Cash Exchange
 Shares in the fund are the equivalent of money that can be transferred instantly to another shareholder, 24 hours a day, without a transaction fee.
The fund invests only in Treasury securities. Shares may only be bought by corporations and institutions that have the required computer connections with the fund's control room in New York. The minimum purchase is $100,000.
The rapidity of payment and round-the-clock access was important to the Chicago Merc, which started nighttime trading of futures contracts in June. The exchange had been seeking a way to collect margin during hours that the banking system and Federal Reserve were closed.
"Right now, there are a lot of people on the sidelines waiting to see it work," said Robin B. Perlin, vice president of cash management at the Chicago Research and Trading Group, a Chicago Merc member firm that has decided to buy shares in the fund. "Hopefully, all the exchanges are going to approve the fund, which will give us a lot more flexibility to move funds between our accounts."
 
Designs Beyond Traders
 Bankers Trust, which spent five years developing Global Settlement and obtaining the necessary approvals from banking and securities regulators, has grander visions for the fund than just a back-office tool for securities firms and futures traders.
Eileen Bedell, the company's director of global settlement services, expects the fund to appeal to corporations that are tired of paying bank fees, which average about $7 for every money transfer, and the uncertainty of not knowing exactly when those transfers will occur.
There are no transaction fees when Global Settlement Fund shares change hands, and the fund's projected expenses of about 65-hundredths of one percentage point of assets are about average for other money market funds. Like other funds, Global Settlement will pay interest to shareholders depending on the interest rates the fund earns on its investments.
 
Expands on Fed's Role
 Currently, a corporation transfers large amounts of money by telling its bank to send money to a particular account at another bank. The sending bank instructs the Federal Reserve, operator of the electronic payment system known as the Fed wire, to transfer money from its reserve account at the Fed to another bank which also maintains a reserve account at the Fed. The Fed charges for each transaction, and the banks pass that cost on to their customers.
That system has worked well enough to handle 65 million transactions worth $192 billion last year, up from 4.3 million transactions and $7.2 billion in 1970. But the Fed system, like the payment systems in other financial centers like London and Tokyo, operates only during the business hours of its local market.
Ms. Bedell of Bankers Trust said the Chicago Options Clearing Corporation would soon consider a rule to allow its members to use the fund.
She also expects similar Bankers Trust funds for Japanese yen and British pounds to commence operations soon. When the yen and pound funds become available, shareholders should be able to trade foreign exchange at any time by advertising their desire on an electronic bulletin board, and negotiating a trade with a shareholder in a fund denominated in another currency.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Bright Outlook For Reinsurers

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
WITH hurricanes, a typhoon and a riot, this has not been a great year for the insurance industry. So, as the claims stemming from all these troubles weigh down insurers and reinsurers, who would pick now to take one of these companies public?
Try Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the New York buyout firm that purchased the American Re Corporation two months ago in a $1.4 billion buyout. The timing of the offering of 24 percent of the reinsurance company, which essentially acts as an insurer for insurance companies, is not as irrational as it might appear. Indeed, Kohlberg, Kravis may be muttering thanks for the natural disasters, because they seem to have improved the prospects for higher profits. 
 The planned offering, which is expected to raise about $301 million, marks the fastest Kohlberg, Kravis has ever gone to the public markets with any company it has purchased. Usually, the firm's practice is to take a company private using a little equity and lots of debt, spend years investing in it and improving its value, and then sell a portion back to the public at a huge profit. That is how the firm scored home runs with Duracell International and Motel 6, among others.
But by turning to the public markets about two months after buying American Re from the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, Kohlberg, Kravis is taking advantage of a window of profitability opened in the wake of Hurricane Andrew and other recent catastrophes.
The reason? The fallout from the disasters has resulted in the biggest shake-up in the reinsurance industry in more than five years, leading many analysts to predict that the industry, which has been suffering through a long recession, is poised for explosive growth.
American Re said just that in the offering documents it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. The company noted that several factors, including the impact on the industry of Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, the Los Angeles riots and a typhoon in Guam, "may favorably influence property and casualty pricing, as well as reinsurance buying trends, in the future."
For proof, just look at the stock prices of other reinsurance companies, which have been booming in the last three months. Shares in the General Re Corporation, for example, have climbed about 25 percent since August, closing on Wednesday at $111 a share, up $2.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The boom stems from the heavy disaster-related claims that have hit the insurance and reinsurance industries. This year, claims for damages from various catastrophes have reached $17 billion, according to Gary Kerney, the director of catastrophe services for Property Claims Services, which monitors the totals for insurance claims.
This has had an impact on pricing, the strength of competition in the reinsurance industry and the number of customers and the volume of business they demand.
"The losses will do what we refer to as harden the market," said Frank Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America in Washington. "It will cause some of the soft pricing that has existed for several years to be dropped. So these catastrophes have an almost counterintuitive effect on values."
But the price increases are coming too late for some in the industry. A number of reinsurers, battered by heavy losses, have begun to trim their sails, essentially ceding part of their business to stronger competitors. For example, the Scandia Group Insurance Company recently announced plans to cut back on its volume of reinsurance business, and other companies have tried unsuccessfully to sell their reinsurers outright.
That means that some business is up for grabs. And considering that reinsurers tend to retain their clients for a long time, any new business gained in this difficult year means stronger profits in years when the claims go back to normal levels.
The disasters have also shaken up the insurance companies that are the reinsurers' customers, industry experts said. In recent years, as insurance companies have been faced with numerous losses in their real estate and junk bond investments, some have decreased their costs by doing without reinsurance. Essentially, the companies decided they could assume more risk for a time until their financial picture looked better.
In the wake of the catastrophes, however, this attitude is changing. More and more insurers are actively searching out reinsurance to help lighten the risk load for fear of another big disaster.
 With all of those factors converging, the Kohlberg, Kravis decision to make a public offering opens up an opportunity for American Re: the ability to write more policies. Under insurance company rules, companies can write policies in direct proportion to their leverage. That means that the higher the debt, the fewer policies that can be issued.
So, with this public offering -- which the S.E.C. document says will decrease the reinsurer's debt to $875 million, from $1.1 billion, -- Kohlberg, Kravis is essentially getting out of the way to let one of its properties catch what experts predict could be a tidal wave of business.

J. F. K.
Reckless Youth
By Nigel Hamilton
Illustrated. 898 pages. Random House. $30.
The outline of John Fitzgerald Kennedy's early years is well known to most Americans: the love-hate relationship with his domineering father, Joseph P. Kennedy; the privileged childhood in Boston and New York; the years of academic promise at Harvard; the harrowing survival of the sinking of PT 109 during World War II, and the successful run for Congress in 1946. 
 Now, in "Reckless Youth," the first installment of a projected three-volume biography, the British biographer Nigel Hamilton tries to fill in the specifics of that outline. Despite the author's credentials (Mr. Hamilton's life of Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery won the Whitbread Award in 1981), "J. F. K" often reads like a trashy novel, one of those epic family sagas peopled with villains and heroes, and animated by stark, primordial emotions. The writing is frequently sensationalistic ("Kennedy then entered Swanson's suite at the Hotel Poinciana and raped her," he writes of Joseph P. Kennedy's first night with Gloria Swanson); the insights into the familial psychology of the Kennedys are crudely and superficially Freudian.
What overcomes these highly noticeable flaws is the sheer accumulation of detail Mr. Hamilton has amassed: his minute, often day-by-day chronicle of young Kennedy's life is based on 2,000 interviews and access to previously unpublished documents, and it slowly but steadily steamrollers over the reader's doubts.
As depicted by Mr. Hamilton, Jack Kennedy emerges as a charismatic but conflicted young man, physically hampered by a frail physique and emotionally crippled by his childhood in a dysfunctional family, a childhood that would leave him detached, wary of intimacy and unable to form lasting attachments to women.
His mother, Rose, comes across, in Mr. Hamilton's telling, as a chilly, remote woman, obsessed with the Roman Catholic Church, personal hygiene and designer clothing, and incapable of giving her children the affection they craved. Her husband is painted in even darker colors: in this volume, he resembles a malevolent movie Godfather, or the nefarious character played by John Huston in "Chinatown."
Using adjectives like "ignoble," "ruthless" and "odious" and nouns like "coward" and "blackmailer" to describe him, Mr. Hamilton dwells, at length, on Joseph Kennedy's manipulation of the stock market, his promiscuity, and his obsession with money and power. Mr. Hamilton's account of the elder Kennedy's advocacy of appeasement of Nazi Germany -- while serving as the United States Ambassador to Britain -- is thoroughly damning, as is his depiction of Joseph Kennedy's frequent use of payoffs and bribes. He also contends that Joseph Kennedy retained private detectives to keep tabs on his children, and that he frequently propositioned his daughters' friends. At one point, Mr. Hamilton goes so far as to compare the elder Kennedy to Stalin, noting that they "even shared the same first name."
It is the young Jack Kennedy's herculean efforts to come to terms with this daunting father that form the dramatic focus of "J. F. K.," as well as the impetus behind the fledgling politician's eventual drive toward worldly achievement.
In his earliest years, Jack's pursuit of his father's approval tended to take the form of competition with his older brother, Joe, whose untimely death in a World War II flying mission would later lead to Jack's assumption of the family's dynastic ambitions. Whereas Joe Jr., Mr. Hamilton reports, dutifully conformed to his parent's wishes -- he was neat, orderly and responsible, and later slavishly echoed his father's most reprehensible political views -- Jack was more inclined to stand politely apart. As a teen-ager, Jack was sloppy and careless, relying upon his easy charm and wit to ingratiate himself with others; and while he eagerly emulated his father's hectic pursuit of women, he was more cautious when it came to embracing his ideological stands.
Although Jack, like his father, began by espousing a doctrine of defeatism -- an unsigned editorial he wrote for The Harvard Crimson in the fall of 1939 naively expressed the hope that Hitler could be made to disarm -- Mr. Hamilton argues that he gradually came to realize the dangers of isolationism and became an interventionist before Pearl Harbor.
"While his elder brother merely parroted their father," Mr. Hamilton writes, "Jack's political grappling was his own, and all the more moving because, symbolized in his struggle to confront the underlying issues facing Western democracy and his own country in the 'fog of war,' there was too the age-old struggle of a son seeking to emerge from his father's shadow."
That shadow, of course, would be difficult to escape. According to Mr. Hamilton, Joseph Kennedy helped squash Jack's affair with the Danish journalist Inga Arvad (who seems to have been the first woman to capture Jack's heart); he helped Jack secure a PT boat assignment, despite his sickly physique, and he spent an estimated $250,000 to $500,000 to try to buy Jack's election to Congress (although many observers believed Jack could have won on his natural political gifts alone).
In the end, Mr. Hamilton argues, Jack Kennedy's contentious relationship with his father shaped not only his ambitions, but also his deepest beliefs. "It would be fanciful to suggest that young Jack Kennedy's political philosophy was rooted in his servility at home," he writes. "Yet to ignore the parallel would be to miss the key to Jack's political heart."
Although he had led a sheltered life of privilege, although he had never had any firsthand experience of economic hardship or political oppression, Mr. Hamilton writes, Jack Kennedy "had experienced oppression of another kind, in the tyrannical, Stalinesque figure of a father he both loved and resented." The result, glimpsed years later in his concern with civil rights and his ardent opposition to the brutalities of the Soviet regime abroad, was "the one moral crusade that stirred his soul: the defense of freedom."

HEADLINE: Immigration Reform Holds Key to Economy;
Easy to Get In

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is deeply alarming. Hordes of illegal immigrants are flooding New York City. The Immigration and Naturalization Service may even be collaborating, for a man from Java boasted to me that upon arriving at Kennedy Airport an official simply told him to "keep moving." A Mexican youth also informed me that he had come all the way from Mexico City by train without a ticket and was never once challenged by either a conductor or border guards.
The quiescence of unions is also extraordinary. Several months ago The Atlantic published a fine article on the impact of illegal immigration upon Los Angeles, "Black vs. Brown." The writer reported that the black hospital workers' union had been smashed, with the former employees replaced by Mexican illegals. 
 Mexico has adequate reasons for encouraging flight. The Mexico City population, 7 million in 1970, is now 20 million and will reach 28 million by the end of the decade. The city's water supply and waste disposal are both already inadequate.
What will be the impact, in a few years, of a half-million and more illegal and illiterate immigrants on our battered city?

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
At Columbia Law School, an uncommon ebullience and evangelism at the top.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
For as long as anyone can remember, Columbia Law School has been regarded as a very prestigious, very dull and very unpleasant place to be. Students are happy to get in, happy to get out and say they went there and unhappy about almost everything in between. Then the school named Lance Liebman as dean.
Mr. Liebman, 51 years old, has been at Columbia's helm for barely a year, hardly enough time to change an institution's personality. Indeed, maybe no law school can ever be fun, least of all one in New York to which people often repair only after rejections from Cambridge, New Haven or Palo Alto, sites of what are generally rated as the nation's three top schools. 
 But under Mr. Liebman, a weary refugee from war-torn Harvard, something unprecedented has come to Morningside Heights: joie de vivre. Surely no one -- not Harlan Fiske Stone, not Charles Evans Hughes, not any of the other deans whose portraits hang grimly on the office walls -- can have approached the job with as much energy and ebullience.
Mr. Liebman gossips with elan, has a goofy and infectious laugh and exhibits a sense of humor worthy of Calvin Trillin's second cousin. He drops names aplenty, but naturally and inoffensively. Law professors, judges, journalists, politicians -- Mr. Liebman knows them all, either from his days in P.S. 89 in Elmhurst, Queens, or as chairman of the Yale Daily News, president of the Harvard Law Review, law clerk to Justice Byron R. White or adviser to Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York. His Rolodex must rival that of Bill Clinton -- whom, miraculously, he has never managed to meet, at least not yet.
In contrast to his predecessor, Barbara Black, whose only visibility during her six-year tenure came when her appointment as Columbia's first female dean was announced, Mr. Liebman is suddenly ubiquitous. He evangelizes endlessly for Columbia, whether before groups of Federal judges on the shores of Lake George or over lunches with Columbia graduates at New York's 30 largest law firms, with barristers in London or with bengoshi in Tokyo.
The Liebman administration can already point to several achievements: some new and unorthodox faculty appointments; increased fund-raising among alumni; a requirement that students perform 40 hours of public-service work in their last two years and participate in an experimental program on professional responsibility. Mr. Liebman has also begun the latest and most ambitious plan to renovate the school's congenitally uncongenial building, the late architect Wallace K. Harrison's curse on generations of Columbia law students.
Many graduates consider the building so dreadful that it should be razed, that renovations should begin at ground zero. But even with his formidable fund-raising skills, Mr. Liebman views this option as unrealistic under current economic conditions. Instead, there are plans to fix up the entrance and build a student lounge -- in Mr. Liebman's words, "a place with a glass roof and a cappuccino machine."
At the same time, his goals include getting students out of the awful building more often. Even though New York is the capital of the American legal community, Mr. Liebman complained, Columbia has historically turned its back on -- or its nose up at -- the place. Another aim is to expand career options, so the school stops sending so many of its own to the large law firms, only to watch them leave disillusioned a few years later.
For all his efforts to seem solemn and speak like a dean -- "It could hurt Columbia Law School if I said something stupid," he explained -- Mr. Liebman is a naturally extroverted, exuberant sort. At least part of his enthusiasm may really be just relief over his daring escape from Harvard Law School, where he spent 24 years.
Nothing pleases Mr. Liebman so much as contrasting his old institution with his new one. He brandished a copy of Robert Clark's recent letter to Harvard alumni, in which the Harvard dean described sit-ins in faculty offices, apologized for the "thoughtless and cruel" parody of a murdered law professor's work published last year by the Harvard Law Review, and announced the creation of a panel intended to create a stronger sense of community at the school.
By contrast, in his letter to Columbia alumni Mr. Liebman recounted how "grand" his first year had been. Judging from it, the greatest crisis he faced came last June, when the Latin word for "dean" was misspelled on all 350 diplomas.
Mr. Liebman was passed over for the Harvard deanship in 1989. It was perhaps his first professional setback, and, as it turned out, a great professional break, for it left him available when Columbia came calling.
Some people find New York cold and brutal, but Mr. Liebman is finding it positively placid. "Only someone coming from Harvard Law School," he said, "would view New York as a haven of civility."

HEADLINE: Help the U.N. Arm for Peace

 BODY:
When warring clans cause starvation in Somalia or Serbia invades Bosnia and threatens Kosovo, the American impulse is to call in the United Nations, not send in the Marines. But the U.N. has no military forces -- except those its members are willing to provide ad hoc. And it has no standing capacity to transport or pay them.
The U.N.'s ability to promote peace needs to be strengthened by placing standing forces, and funds, at its disposal. And it needs a capacity to act before wars break out, through preventive deployments. 
 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is seeking just such a capability. But the U.S. has been slow to respond. Indeed, the Pentagon shudders at the thought of placing personnel under a U.N. command.
Now an independent commission offers four sensible recommendations on how the U.S. might organize itself to provide American military muscle to U.N. missions:
 Establish a new U.S. military command to plan for and train troops for U.N. operations.
 Have the Pentagon designate one or two U.S.-based brigades for such contingencies.
 Shift funding for U.N. peacekeeping operations from the State Department's budget to the Pentagon's.
 Put two high-ranking officials, an Under Secretary of State and an Under Secretary of Defense, in charge of America's involvement in U.N. and other international peacekeeping and peacemaking operations.
The study commission, co-sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Institute for International Economics, consisted of 30 distinguished former Federal officials of both parties. They know the territory; they also have the right idea.
By giving strong backing to these proposals, President-elect Clinton could help himself, and the world, by making it easier to arm the U.N. to intervene in places like Kosovo before conflict turns to war.

HEADLINE: More Cuts Expected Soon at Digital

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAYNARD, Mass., Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation is preparing to accelerate its layoffs before the end of the year, as the company attempts to rebound from billions of dollars in losses.
While a Digital spokeswoman would not confirm the exact number of layoffs that are planned, people inside Digital said this week that by Dec. 7, at least 7,500 and perhaps closer to 8,800 more employees would be laid off worldwide, with a significant percentage of those being cut in Massachusetts and New Hampshire where more than half of the company's American employees live and work. 
 Digital, the nation's second-largest computer maker, currently employs a total of 108,500 in the United States and abroad.
 
'It's Painful'
 Robert B. Palmer, Digital's president and chief executive, told stockholders at the company's annual meeting in November that the company would be aggressively cutting costs and increasing the number of layoffs to get its costs in line. The company laid off 5,300 last quarter.
But while Mr. Palmer instructed company managers to accelerate the cutting, many had been hesitant to comply. With the deadline looming, thousands of employees are expected to get termination notices in the next week or so.
"It's painful," one Digital manager said. "But Palmer has been telling the managers that either 20,000 to 30,000 people feel the pain, or 110,000 people will feel the pain."
Digital employs more than 26,000 workers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and more layoffs are likely to depress the region's economy further. In the middle- and upper-middle-class communities between Routes 128 and 495 that are dotted with Digital plants and offices, this holiday season is filled with a sense of anguish.
"We have a number of families with more than one member working at Digital," said Pastor Richard Leavitt of the Boxborough, Mass., United Church of Christ. "The constant anxiety about being laid off is taking a tremendous toll on people's lives."
 
'Dreadful to Watch'
 Don Johnson, town manager in Acton, Mass., where many Digital employees live, said, "When Digital is hurting, business is hurting and the town is hurting."
Once a haven for lifetime employment, Digital, like I.B.M., is trying to survive the current industry slump with cuts and organizational changes. The inner turmoil at Digital has never been higher. "People are terrified," one employee said. Even those who manage to survive this round know more layoffs will almost certainly follow.
"It's absolutely dreadful to watch what is happening at Digital," said David Smith, a consultant at the International Data Corporation. He noted that much of the turmoil was being caused by the way some departments are handling the cutbacks.
"Some are very humane and others are awful," he said.
 
Deep Uncertainty
 Mr. Smith said cuts have been ordered across the board, but in some groups, employees simply do not know who is going and who is staying. Some are being told that parts of their group might be salvaged if another group takes them in. But such vague promises only heighten the anxiety.
In addition, Mr. Smith said, rumors abound that Digital's generous severance package will be cut sharply or altogether after this round of layoffs. "People don't know whether they want to stay or go now," he said.
The layoffs were not unexpected. Digital has already pared more than 25,000 employees over the last two and a half years through early-retirement incentives, layoffs and attrition. But that has not been nearly enough, in light of the stagnating economy and Digital's own problems selling its computer systems. Analysts say Digital needs to slim down to the size of the Hewlett-Packard Corporation, a competitor with similar revenues but nearly 20,000 fewer employees.
 
'Exodus of Software Engineers'
 Mr. Palmer acknowledged in an interview in October that 25,000 more layoffs were likely over the next two years. At the end of the fiscal first quarter, Sept. 30, the company had $1.3 billion in reserve to cover the costs of the cutbacks. Digital is also in the midst of a sweeping restructuring, with many departments being consolidated down to 8 to 10 business units and countless projects being cut.
At Mr. Palmer's behest, significant cutbacks are being made in the company's $1.8 billion engineering budget, particularly in the software development area. "They are expecting an exodus of software engineers from Spitbrook and Nashua," said Terry Shannon, a consultant with Gander Resources, referring to Digital sites in New Hampshire. He said Digital was apparently abandoning many development projects for its VAX computer and VMS software product lines.
George Colony, a consultant with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., has watched the company cut costs before. "It feels different this time," he said, "because they are no longer cutting the fat, the nonperformers; they are cutting into the muscle.
"But this is Palmer's charter. This is what the board told him to do. It's a General Motors-type of situation: they've got to cut deep, hard and fast."

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

 Higher Guaranteed Interest
Q Now that returns on many certificates of deposit have fallen to the 3 percent level, where can investors get a better rate of interest but still get a guaranteed return of their money?
 
WILL BRIDGER, HILTON HEAD, S.C.
Treasury bills are short-term Government securities that often yield as much as or more than most short-term certificates of deposit. William K. Joseph, a senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers, said: "They are safer than any bank C.D.'s and free from state and local taxes. But if you sell a bill before maturity, there is the potential for either gain or loss." 
 Treasury obligations of one to five years are also competitive with C.D. rates and should be considered as alternatives, Mr. Joseph noted. "In addition, you can purchase more than $100,000 worth of Treasuries without being concerned about Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Finally the Government will hold your Treasury securities for you at no charge," he said.
Banks and brokerage firms usually charge a small fee to purchase Treasury securities for their customers. But you can get them without any commission at a Federal Reserve bank or branch.
 
Guardian for Children
Q When our children were young, my wife and I designated a guardian in our wills to manage our estates on their behalf. Now the children are moving into their 20's and we wonder if a guardian is still needed?
 
HOYT SPELMAN 3d, MANHATTAN
A Many people name a guardian in their wills for their minor children, just as you did. Tricia Bonner, a partner in the New York law firm of Thacher Proffitt & Wood, said: "If the children are adults at the time of your death -- in New York State, the age of majority is 18 -- the guardianship provision has no effect. Therefore it is not necessary to write a new will or codicil to revoke that provision. Once a child becomes an adult, he or she would have full control over any inheritance unless you take legal steps to prevent it, such as creating a trust."
 
Tax on Fund's Dividends
Q If you invest in a mutual fund and your dividends are automatically reinvested, must you pay income tax on the dividends each year or only when you sell the shares?
 
LEONARD KRESCH, SEARINGTON, L.I.
A You pay income tax on the dividends only once. "You must pay income taxes on these dividends each year, whether they are withdrawn or automatically reinvested, because the income is available to you," said Jacob S. Dreyer, chief economist of the Investment Company Institute. "From a Tax Code point of view, automatic reinvestment is equivalent to withdrawing the dividends and investing them again."
However, when mutual fund shares are sold, investors may incur a capital gain or a capital loss, depending on whether the sales price is above or below the cost of acquisition. "You have to pay taxes on capital gains, unless you have other losses elsewhere that can be used to offset the gains on the mutual fund shares," he added.

HEADLINE: Shoppers Fill Stores, but Many Are Just Looking

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Glenda Harry arrived at the A & S Plaza in Manhattan yesterday at 8:30 A.M. But she hadn't come to do her Christmas shopping; she came to sign up for a contest to win $1,000, sponsored by the mall's operator, the Simon Management Company.
On the day after Thanksgiving, the busiest shopping day of the year, consumers thronged shopping areas from Herald Square in New York to State Street in Chicago to Union Square in San Francisco. Although many were just looking, strolling through stores, checking prices and searching for gift ideas and good deals, retailers were delighted and relieved by the turnout. 
 The period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is crucial to retailers. Many stores make as much as 40 percent of their annual sales and 50 percent of profits during those 20-odd days.
 
Much Window Shopping
 Retailers said that the holiday-shopping crowds were bigger than they had been in the last two or three years and that shoppers seemed to be spending more than in the past. But most retailers will not total up the actual sales figures until Sunday or Monday.
In spite of retailers' threats that lean inventories will lead to early sellouts of popular items this year, few people seemed in any rush yesterday to buy gifts. The number of people toting shopping bags was only a fraction of the number who turned out to window- shop. And many of those who were buying were doing so at discount stores or at sales.
Despite recent signs of an economy edging upward, many shoppers said they would still be spending less on gifts this year, placing strict limits on their purchases, as they have in recent years, or buying household necessities instead of frivolities.
"Things are so tight these days you have to cut back," said Miss Harry, an accountant. "I have a job, I have my health, I have strength. But I have a lot of friends who are out of work with trouble putting food on the table, and that makes me think twice about spending a lot of money."
Not everyone, of course, is cautious. Some people questioned yesterday said they would spend about as much as they did last year, and a few even said they would spend more. And some retailers said they saw increased sales of higher-priced merchandise and more buying with credit cards.
Pat Doyle finished her Christmas shopping at 11 A.M. yesterday. Standing outside the newly renovated Marshall Field's flagship on State Street in Chicago, she estimated that she had spent 20 percent more this year. "I don't like shopping with crowds, so I started three weeks ago," she said.
She said the state of the economy was not an issue for her. "My husband owns his own company, and he has done well this year," Mrs. Doyle said.
Most retailers believe sales will increase this holiday season anywhere from 4 to 6 percent, compared with little more than 1 percent last year, but all are quick to hedge their projections because consumers have fooled them so many times over the last two years. Although sales surged in late September and October, no one is quite sure that the buoyancy will continue through the holiday season. Sales also picked up steam in January and February before stalling out in the spring and summer.
 
'Started With a Bang'>
 Merchants took heart yesterday, though, as they described the season's kickoff, with notes of enthusiasm creeping into their voices for the first time in two years.
"It started with a bang," said Ken Dardis, the operational vice president for Home Depot's stores in the Northeast. "Today was an absolute zoo; by 9 o'clock, the stores were just rocking."
Clark Johnson, the president and chief executive of Pier 1 Imports, a specialty store chain selling housewares, said sales yesterday might exceed last year's day-after-Thanksgiving sales by 15 percent. He said the average sale would also be somewhat higher than last year because shoppers were buying more expensive merchandise.
The co-chairman of R. H. Macy & Company, Myron E. Ullman 3d, said in a telephone interview from the Macy's store at Roosevelt Field on Long Island that shoppers were using the Macy's charge card to make purchases more than any time in recent memory. "We saw the uptick start in October and it has continued, which means consumers think things are likely to get somewhat better," he said.
Mr. Ullman said strong sales of more expensive pots and pans, knives, china and crystal also indicated better consumer confidence levels. Macy has planned on flat sales this holiday season, but Mr. Ullman said the company was "cautiously optimistic" that it would exceed its own projections.
Thomas Shea, district manager of the Kmart stores on Long Island and in the boroughs of New York City, interpreted heavy sales of higher-priced merchandise like 14-carat jewelry and compact disk players as a sign of more optimism among consumers.
He has a less orthodox method of measuring his customers' mood: "When customers aren't feeling good about things, they'll pick an item up and throw it down so that by the end of the day, the store looks like a cyclone hit it," Mr. Shea said. "The stores I've been in today didn't get so wrecked. It'll be an easy recovery job tonight."
Retail consultants and analysts predict that off-price stores like Men's Wearhouse and discounters will get the lion's share of business this holiday season because shoppers are so sensitive to prices. Tactical Retail Solutions, a retail consulting firm, has estimated that discounters like Wal-Mart and Target will see a 6 percent increase, while off-price outlets will see as much as a 7 percent increase in their business. In contrast, the company projects that specialty stores that sell apparel may see only a 1 percent sales increase and department stores a 2 percent gain.
 
Pattern in Detroit
 Foot traffic in the malls around Detroit yesterday morning and early afternoon reflected that pattern. The Somerset Collection, a cluster of 70 stores like Barney's, Tiffany & Company, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus in the Detroit suburb of Troy, had fewer shoppers a couple of hours after it opened than it does on a normal weekday. Parking was available as close as four spaces away from the main entrance.
But at a Kmart store in Troy, shoppers were lined up outside before the 7 A.M. opening time, and by 7:15 the large parking lot was half full of cars.
Five minutes after the opening, Lloyd Wold sailed out pushing a cart filled with a 20-inch General Electric color television set he bought for $199 during a sale that was on between 7 to 11 A.M. He and his wife, Pat, used a credit card to pay for the television set because they could not afford to spend cash on such a large purchase.
"We just don't have that kind of money," Mrs. Wold said. "Just buying food is hard."
Union Square in San Francisco had a somewhat better experience than the Somerset mall in Troy. By 9 A.M. bright red Macy's bags were bobbing about the square, and shoppers queued up at F.A.O. Schwarz and Gump's, a specialty store stocked with pricey Oriental tchotchkes, fine jewelry and other exotic gifts.
Asked what people are buying this year, Becky Stein, the general manager at F.A.O. Schwarz, grabbed a three-foot-tall stuffed gorilla by a furry brow. "Big and inexpensive," she said. "We're selling lots of these."
 
Christmas Gift Budget
 Bruce and Mindy Walker ventured into San Francisco from nearby Richmond for a special holiday shopping spree. Although the shops and stores that line Union Square are far from inexpensive, Mrs. Walker said she would hold to a budget of $500 to $600 for Christmas gifts, about the same as she spent last year. "We're not going lavish," she vowed.
The Walkers said they planned to buy practical gifts like kitchen utensils and socks. "We just wanted to see how the other half lives," Mr. Walker said.
Merchants have gone all out this year to emphasize their low prices. Large inserts in newspapers touted Thanksgiving sales, television commercials hawked "holiday specials" and display tables and racks were crowned with signs heralding lower-than-normal prices.
And shoppers will turn out for a bargain. Pat Timm, a payroll clerk from Roseville, Mich., rolled into the Oakland Mall near Detroit in a wheelchair, undaunted by the casts that encased her legs after recent surgery.
 
Not Charging This Year
 "I don't miss a day-after-Thanksgiving sale," she said. "They've got these specials that they don't have at any other time."
She said she would spend less this year because she was insecure about her job. "I usually charge the purchases, but not this year," Mrs. Timm said. "I'm going to spend cash because I don't want to get into trouble."
While most shoppers at the start of this holiday season seemed to feel more secure, if not optimistic, about their prospects, several told the now-familiar, heart-wrenching stories of lives wrecked by the realignments shaking the economy. Santa Claus will not arrive in every home this year.
Vivian Martin, a data processor who lost her job in August, headed for Marshall Field's in Chicago because the retailer was handing out coupons worth 10 percent off items that were previously discounted 20 and 30 percent. Her husband, Preston, is also unemployed, and the toys and clothes she bought for her 4-year-old son cost less than $100.
"My husband and I haven't budgeted anything for gifts for one another," Mrs. Martin said. "If we do, it will be something small, pretty insignificant."

HEADLINE: U.S. PLAN TO GUARD CONVOYS IS BACKED BY SOMALI GENERAL

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Nov. 27

 BODY:
In an uncharacteristically conciliatory gesture, the leader of one of the principal factions in the fighting in Somalia said today that he welcomed an American initiative to send thousands of troops to protect food convoys for the starving.
The faction leader, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, who in the last year has sent his fighters across central and southern Somalia and who had threatened to send United Nations troops home in body bags, said at a news conference here that he viewed the American move as "constructive." 
 At the same time, he said, "military intervention will not solve the problem." He emphasized the economic and political benefits that he said would accrue from an American presence in a country devastated by clan warfare and a famine that relief officials estimated has killed 300,000 people since January 1991, when the Government of Mohammed Siad Barre was toppled.
 
'We Will Protect Them'
 The main obstacle to improving the appalling plight of nearly two million hungry Somalis has been the looting by clan gangs, many of them led by General Aidid's men, of food destined for the starving.
If General Aidid does not challenge the American military, United Nations and other officials here said the task of opening the port and airport of Mogadishu for food deliveries and protecting convoys would be made much simpler.
They said that if the general did not resist, 5,000 rather than tens of thousands of troops would be sufficient to do the job.
[The size and composition of the force envisioned by Washington remained unclear, Bush Administration officials said. Also undetermined was whether the United Nations and the United States' allies would subscribe to the plan, which would place the Somali operation firmly under American control. Page 6.]
Stephen Tomlin, the field director of the International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based agency, said General Aidid's chief financier, Osman Ato, came to Mr. Tomlin's Mogadishu house this morning to tell him that the general and his advisers had been up all night debating the issue of the American troops.
"He said, 'Please reassure your colleagues in the non-governmental organizations not to be concerned, we will protect them,' " Mr. Tomlin recounted. "And he asked me to get a message to Ambassador Peter de Vos in Washington, who has been covering Somalia, to say that the general welcomed the Americans."
 
High Regard for Americans
 The nearly 400 foreign aid workers in Somalia, who have been striving under treacherous security conditions to feed the starving, appeared relieved that General Aidid went out of his way to pledge their safety. There had been fears among some workers that they might become targets of even more violence if the American troops were deployed against the general's will.
The reaction from the Aidid camp was interpreted by foreign officials and Somalis as a sign of his growing military and political weaknesses within the changing clan alliances in Somalia. Last month his forces were defeated at an important rural base, Bardera, and he appears about to lose control of a major coastal city, Kismayu.
They feared that General Aidid was becoming isolated as his alliances fell apart and that he probably looked at the Americans, whom he is said to hold in high regard, as his salvation.
Officials here said that General Aidid, who at best might have several thousand fighters armed with machine guns and some artillery, had no chance of obstructing the tens of thousands of well-equipped troops that the Bush Administration said might be sent to Somalia.
 
Fluctuating Death Rate
 A United Nations official said that a senior figure in General Aidid's group reacted to the American plan by saying: "We had better swim with the tide. We have no chance against 20,000 to 30,000 troops."
The White House decision to offer American soldiers to lead a beefed-up United Nations contingent was based in part on the premise that the death rate from starvation among Somalis was going up again, Administration officials said on Thursday.
But senior relief officials who have worked in Somalia throughout the crisis said the number of deaths had dropped, from thousands a day in May, June, July, August and September to hundreds a day.
That was because so many weak people had already died but also because, despite obstruction by looters, the relief effort of the last month had made a difference.
 
Corn Fields and High Hopes
 In Baidoa, the death rate reached a high of more than 300 a day in September. But it had dropped to fewer than 100 a day this month, Mr. Stocker said.
In Bardera, the death rate soared to more than 200 a day in September as thousands of destitute people struggled into the town from the countryside. The death rate went down in early October but soared again to more than 200 after General Aidid fled the city and aid workers evacuated. But two weeks ago, the daily death toll had dropped to just around 100 a day after a new airlift started, according to the Red Cross.
Mr. Stocker said the Red Cross feeds about 1.5 million Somalis every day at 900 kitchens. He disputed a contention by Andrew S. Natsios, the relief coordinator of the United States Agency for International Development, that there were many hidden deaths in areas not reached by aid agencies. Mr. Stocker said that Mr. Natsios's estimate that 80 percent of the donated food in the last month was looted or paid in protection money was overstated.
Like Mr. Stocker, Mr. Tomlin said the death rates were lower.
 
Breakdown in Security
 There was "hope in Somalia," he said. "There's corn high in the fields from Baidoa to the lower Shabelle Valley."
But at the same time, Mr. Tomlin said, an increase in attacks on food convoys and the closing of the Mogadishu port because of fighting had diminished the improvements.
"If something is not done by bringing troops we would lose the gains we have made so far," Mr. Tomlin said.
Mr. Tomlin said a breakdown in security was the main reason an ambitious plan by the United Nations to deliver 100,000 tons of food in 100 days had fallen miserably short.
 
Precarious Pakistani Troops
 "It is now Day 45 of the 100-day plan, and to date, 9,263 metric tons have come through the port of Mogadishu and nothing through the port of Kismayu," he said. "Much of this did not reach the intended recipients."
The plan to airlift 15,000 metric tons was progressing more successfully, he said.
What many aid and United Nations officials here do not understand is why Washington did not prod the United Nations to sharpen its flailing military operation in Mogadishu before making the quantum leap of committing large numbers of American troops.
The 500 Pakistani troops sent by the United Nations in early October to secure the airport, port and goods out of the capital had little hope of success, United Nations officials said.
The troops were too few, their equipment inadequate and they were so underfinanced that their commander, Gen. Imtiaz Shaheen, had to beg aid agencies of the United Nations, rather than the military arm, for money to help supply them, the official said. The troops, based near the airport, have become so vulnerable that snipers fired at their tents this week, a United Nations official said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Glancing Over His Shoulder, Clinton Watches Perot Tide

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Just as Ross Perot managed to reshape the 1992 Presidential campaign merely by hovering around its edges, his shadow is now influencing the emerging strategy of the Clinton Administration.
Mr. Perot is back in Texas, quiet for the moment, and the potential power of his backers, who are reorganizing themselves, is still uncertain. But aides to President-elect Bill Clinton are acutely aware that one in five voters chose Mr. Perot, whose backers have already warned that they intend to lobby the Clinton White House for their programs. 
 With that in mind, Mr. Clinton's team is tailoring parts of its public relations and governing strategy to win those voters.
"I can't believe I am talking about 1996 before Governor Clinton has even been inaugurated," said his communications director, George Stephanopoulos, "but assuming that 1996 will be a two-person race, then the Perot voters will be central to that election. They have to be part of our thinking. They will be the difference between winning and losing."
Considering that Mr. Clinton got 43 percent of the vote, Mr. Bush 39 percent and Mr. Perot 19 percent, said David Wilhelm, director of political affairs for Mr. Clinton's transition team, "it is an important political objective of ours to reach out to those folks in the coming months."
Reaching them, though, may not be so easy, because Clinton and Perot advisers have very different views about how to attract the Perot constituency: the hard-core followers who are trying to create a political organization as well as the millions of sympathizers whose political affiliation and future involvement are uncertain.
Clinton aides say that to transform those voters into Clinton supporters in four years, the President-elect will use a variety of Perot-style techniques, from town hall meetings to toll-free phone numbers, to appeal to their appreciation for unmediated, direct contact with decision makers.
At the same time, the aides say, Mr. Clinton will heavily stress issues that appeal to the hunger of Perot voters to "clean up the mess" in Washington -- matters like overhauling campaign finance laws and limiting special-interest lobbying.
Mr. Clinton wants to adopt some of these techniques and tackle some of these issues for his own reasons, partly to get around the news media and partly because the issues are ones he cares about. But they are being given added attention because of the Perot factor, aides say.
While Mr. Clinton intends to focus on reducing the deficit and national debt, Mr. Perot's primary issues, he is still open to the possibility of increasing the deficit in the short term to stimulate the economy and seems uncertain about how quickly and deeply he intends to cut the national debt.
But the Clinton team believes that for Perot voters these issues are symbols of the mess in Washington. They say they can avoid taking them on immediately, provided they convey a sense that they are energetically and effectively addressing national problems like health care, job growth or welfare.
 
Dispute on U.S. Debt
 Mr. Perot was not available over the long holiday weekend to discuss the Clinton plan. But his supporters strongly disagree with the President-elect's advisers. The Perot supporters argue that the $4 trillion national debt and the soaring deficit are not just symbols of government in gridlock; they view those problems almost theologically -- like elements of a looming apocalypse that could undermine the foundations of the republic if not immediately addressed.
"You can't pay them off just by going after lobbyists or the Japanese," said James Squires, Mr. Perot's former spokesman. "You have to go after the deficit and debt. If you look at the Perot coalition you find that it contained people from the far left and far right. They were a political zoo representing every trend. We found that the one thing, the only thing, that they could all agree on was dealing now with the debt and the deficit. Trying to attract them with anything else will be folly."
Mr. Squires said Mr. Perot's followers were organizing themselves into a formal political movement, "United We Stand," which will have a full-time staff and dues-paying members. Its first order of business, he said, will be to help Mr. Clinton get the Congress to make tough choices.
If there is not "a legitimate effort at fair-shared sacrifice to deal with the debt and the deficit," Mr. Squires said, Mr. Perot and United We Stand will try to influence the 1994 Congressional elections by backing candidates who share those priorities.
Which is why Clinton aides say that they are interested not only in appealing to the Perot voters as future Democrats but also, in the short run, in harnessing their energy for Mr. Clinton's own agenda.
"These people are alienated and angry," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "But they are not apathetic. The question is, How do you take the negative energy that motivated their vote for Perot and turn it into positive energy to help you govern?"
Mr. Clinton has not made up his mind about how soon and how aggressively to tackle deficit reduction; the question is whether the other policies he intends to offer will really attract the Perot following.
"I am of the view that Perot's specific policies were not that important," argued Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's chief pollster. "Deficit reduction was symbolic for cleaning up the mess in Washington. That is why I don't think you have to take a Perot platform and simply graft it to President-elect Clinton's. He has a lot of room to maneuver -- as long as he is maneuvering forward and giving a sense that he is addressing and solving problems with a coherent plan and focus."
Clinton aides hope to convey that momentum through both style and substance.
"In terms of communications," Mr. Wilhelm said, "we have instituted within the transition operation a public outreach department, and a big part of that is to consciously reach out to Perot voters, and all voters who have not always felt that they have had access to the administration or the political process."
Clinton aides say one policy issue the President-elect has been stressing is overhauling campaign finance laws. That emphasis is based in part on the assumption that one of Mr. Perot's most evocative appeals was his complaint that decision-making in Washington had been hijacked by special-interest groups and lobbyists, who own the politicians.
Campaigning in Georgia for Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., who was defeated in a runoff on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton said, "People who come to work in my Administration are going to have to sign an agreement not to go to work for other interests and lobby their Government and make a profit out of their public service."
 
Nature of the Protest
 Another substantive appeal to the Perot vote, Clinton aides say, is simply getting something done -- anything -- that begins to improve the economy and gives a sense that the Congress-White House stalemate is being loosened.
"The Perot vote," Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "was as much about ending gridlock in Washington and simply getting action and reforming the system, as about any specific issue, such as deficit reduction."
Maybe, but maybe not, said John White, who had been the issues coordinator for Mr. Perot's campaign and who later went to work for Mr. Clinton.
"The Perot voters are people who are very skeptical and hard to convince," Mr. White said. "I don't mean this as criticism, but they tended to be a little naive. These are people who were attracted to simple solutions, and that is why the Perot thing worked. Appealing to them with anything other than black and white solutions for the debt and deficit is not going to be easy."

The Economy
Consumers thronged to stores and malls on the first day of the crucial shopping season between Thanksgiving and Christmas. But despite the large crowds, there was a sense that people were not rushing to buy gifts. And many of those who did buy were doing business at discount stores or picking up items on sale. [Page 1.]
Americans' personal income grew 1 percent in October, the fastest rise in 10 months, and consumer spending posted a healthy gain of 0.7 percent. Analysts cautioned, however, that the figures overstated the rise because of a number of one-time factors. [33.]
 
Markets
Investors poured money into stock mutual funds in November, and the industry's net cash inflow in 1992 is likely to be its highest ever. Figures show that October was reasonably good for stock funds but the worst month in nearly two years for bond funds. [33.]
Stock prices moved higher, as Wall Street ended a week of solid gains. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.94 points, to 3,282.20, a gain of 54.84 for the week. A number of indexes that measure the broader market hit record highs. [33.]
Treasury bond prices fell in reaction to the unexpectedly strong rises in personal income and spending. But analysts cautioned that the thinness of post-holiday trading made for volatile prices, which may not indicate long-term market trends. [41.]
The dollar ended firmer in a quiet session, helped by both technical factors and fresh signs of economic strength. [42.]
Copper futures prices bounded higher. The value of copper often moves up with improvements in the economy.[42.]
 
International
Japan's Government said it would not relax its ban on rice imports. But then it sent a subtle signal to its rice farmers that protectionism that could harm the nation's trading relationships may not be sustainable. Japan's ban on rice imports could become an obstacle to a new global trading treaty. [33.]
OPEC reached a new production accord that provides for a cut in total output of perhaps 400,000 barrels daily, or about 2 percent. Oil prices are expected to inch a bit higher. The deal reflects the production of 12 members, as Ecuador withdrew from OPEC. [34.]
 
Companies
British Airways was given clearance by the European Community executive commission for its proposed purchase of a 49.9 percent stake in the small French regional carrier TAT. The British carrier agreed to conditions meant to assure that competition is not reduced by the linkup. [35.]
A former investment banker was acquitted of conspiracy and fraud charges arising out of the marathon Guinness fraud trial. The case against Lord Spens was one of several stemming from the 1986 takeover of a Scotch whisky company, Distillers, by the brewing giant Guinness. [35.]
The Dabah family filed petitions under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The family is the largest shareholder in Gitano, although the clothing company itself was not involved in the bankruptcy filings. [35.]
The civil war in Yugoslavia has forced an end to production of the humble Yugo automobile, costing tens of thousands of jobs. Now the factory makes little more than rifles and pistols. [35.]
 
Your Money
Certain prosperous couples should use life insurance to insure that their heirs will have enough liquidity to pay estate taxes. This approach is particularly recommended for couples with estates in the range of $2 million to $3 million. [31.]
Monthly brokerage statements usually lack numbers that let an investor see instantly whether each security is a winner or a loser or that show the total cost of maintaining the account. [31.]
Medical bills should be scrutinized carefully. One report said that as many as 95 percent of hospital bills contained errors. [32.]

HEADLINE: Clinton Chats With Reagan, Then Heads Out to the Mall

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 27

 BODY:
In a gesture of good manners that was also good politics, President-elect Bill Clinton came here today to drink coffee and chat with a man he spent the last year depicting as the founding father of just about everything wrong with America.
Mr. Clinton's visit with former President Ronald Reagan opened a four-day vacation trip to Southern California by the President-elect, his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, who will all spend the weekend at the Summerland house of the television producers Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. But it also set the tone for a day that Mr. Clinton's aides described as devoted to courtesy calls but that doubled as state-of-the-Presidential-art politicking. 
 After the meeting with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Clinton went on a publicity-minded mall hop that was remarkable even by the standards of suburban Southern California, the land that raised indoor shopping to the level of life style.
At the Glendale Galleria, a huge mall about 6 miles north of Los Angeles, tens of thousands of screaming, cheering people jammed two floors, leaving only a narrow corridor for Mr. Clinton and his entourage. The President-elect was equipped with a wireless microphone that broadcast on the mall's public address system the snippets of conversations he had with those who managed to squirm their way to the front of the rope lines.
 
Forgiving the Original Sinner
 Only a matter of weeks ago, candidate Clinton was denouncing Mr. Reagan as the architect of "failed trickle-down economics," the proponent of plutocratic politics and the original sinner of the Decade of Greed.
Today, all was sunshine and no hard feelings between the once and future Presidents, who met for more than an hour in Mr. Reagan's 34th-floor offices in the spectacular Century City skyscraper where the movie "Die Hard," the Bruce Willis thriller, was filmed.
As the two men posed for the cameras before their private meeting, Mr. Reagan handed his successor a jar of red, white and blue jelly beans, saying his "history with jelly beans" had "prevented me from becoming a cigarette addict."
"I substituted these," Mr. Reagan said, "and I just thought that -- patriotic colors and all -- that maybe you might like to have them."
"Thank you," Mr. Clinton said, throwing back his head in laughter. "What a wonderful gift. I love it. I'll need it."
 
No Argument Here
 Afterwards, Mr. Clinton recounted the highlights of a conversation notable for its avoidance of the unpleasantries of the past. Indeed, an uninformed listener might easily have assumed from the description that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Reagan were of one mind on practically everything.
"We talked about the line item veto, which as you know he likes a lot, and he was glad that I was supporting it," Mr. Clinton said. "We talked about some ways to restrain Government spending in areas where I want to hold it down."
Mr. Reagan, Mr. Clinton recounted, "said that he hoped I'd have more cooperation from Congress than he did, and he thought I might. And I said I was working on it hard."
On the potentially embarrassing subject of the economy, the words "trickle down" and "tax and spend" apparently went unsaid. Instead, the two men found common ground in agreeing that the deficit ought to be brought down, Mr. Clinton said.
The talk ended on a rather poignant discussion of the prison of the Presidency.
"He said that he thought Hillary and Chelsea and I should make ample use of Camp David," Mr. Clinton said. "He said that it's about the only place where you can really walk freely, you know, and be alone, virtually unencumbered. He said, 'It will help you keep your peace of mind.' "
The Clinton camp was insistent in depicting the informal Presidential meeting as motivated solely by Mr. Clinton's desire to be polite and to pick up a few pointers from Mr. Reagan.
Bruce Lindsey, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, said the call on Mr. Reagan "was not calculated for political gain," but he acknowledged that such gain might be forthcoming.
"I would hope Reagan supporters and Republicans would be glad that Governor Clinton felt it was worthwhile to consult with President Reagan," he said.
 
Meet and Greet at the Mall
 For the third time since the election, Mr. Clinton returned to a favorite mode of campaigning, what his aides call "a meet and greet," in which Mr. Clinton, surrounded by cameras, moves among a crowd, touching, talking and listening.
The President-elect made a very public plunge today, spending more than an hour walking in the Glendale Galleria. Although billed by Mr. Lindsey as a way for the President-elect to "remain in touch with people" through personal conversations, the eventwas indistinguishable from a campaign rally; his local supporters had been encouraged to attend.
The President-elect's stroll was to a degree far more than had been expected and to a degree almost frightening. By the time Mr. Clinton arrived at the mall at 2:30 P.M., at least 30,000 people were waiting, lined up 30 deep along the rope lines set up along the route where he would walk from store to store.
As Mr. Clinton made his way through the mall, the screaming crowd surged forward in great waves. The noise was deafening, the pandemonium not far from the point where control is lost.
Mr. Clinton's bodyguards were clearly worried, and made an impromptu effort to ferret out anyone who might have a gun. As the President-elect approached each fresh section of the crowd, a line of Secret Service agents and police officers preceded him, yelling to the people, "Show us your hands! Show us your hands!" and waggling their own in the air in example. The crowd, obliging, waved hands and wiggled fingers.
"I've been here since 9 o'clock this morning, and I'm not going to leave, come hell or high water, till I see him," said Mary Ann Pokorny, as she pushed her slight weight back against the crush 20 deep behind her. "I voted for him, so it's my right to see him."

HEADLINE: Serbia Copes With Its Own Refugees

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
In the sad and ever growing annals of refugee experience, the scene was somewhat unusual.
Six Serbians -- a bank employee, a lawyer, a businessman and their wives -- expelled by invading Croats from the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, sat in the living room of a small but warm apartment here the other evening watching TV and drinking tea. 
 While the place is crowded, it is a kind of home nevertheless -- instead of a bleak refugee camp with naked light bulbs and rows of iron beds.
"I've got nothing against any ethnic groups" said the apartment owner, Vlada Kovacevic. "These are all relatives staying with me now. But before they came I had strangers, including Croats and Muslims."
Serbia is a country in disgrace these days, accused of fomenting an ethnic civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and cut off from normal world contact by an economic blockade.
 
Absorbed 600,000 Refugees
 But it has taken in some 600,000 of the more than two million refugees the Balkan civil war has created so far, with more coming in at a rate of 500 to 2,000 a day. Moreover, Serbia has lodged 96 percent of all these refugees with families in their private homes -- a development almost without precedent, relief officials say.
Most but not all are Serbs fleeing the "ethnic cleansing" carried out against them by Muslims and Croats. But these days a sizeable number of Serbian refugees are coming from so-called "liberated" Serbian areas of Bosnia.
The Serbian Commissioner for Refugees, Dobrica Vulovic, said: "Of course it helps that most of the refugees are Serbs and usually have relatives living somewhere here. But we've benefited from plenty of disinterested generosity with people giving accommodation to refugees off the street."
What rankles Mr. Vulovic and other Serbian officials, though, is that while Serbia plays host to about a quarter of all refugees, it gets only about 14 percent of the aid Western countries are donating to help care for them.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees tries to take an even-handed approach in aid to each country in the area according to the scale of the refugee crisis it faces.
The biggest beneficiary is Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, which is estimated to have more than 1.3 million refugees or needy people, followed by Croatia with more than 600,000. Serbia comes next and is expected to receive about $80 million in United Nations assistance between November and next March.
The United States and the European Community are denying Serbia the additional aid that they are giving for Balkan refugees. Western diplomats here say public opinion would not stand for giving aid to refugees living relatively safely in the country held responsible for the tragedy in preference to those experiencing far greater hardships in Bosnia itself.
Serbian officials see this as just another example of the Western world's bias against them and its failure to understand the Balkan conflict.
"Since we are always blamed for every evil here we get no help," says Belgrade's Mayor, Slobadank Gruden, with unconcealed bitterness. "But refugees are always refugees."
Commissioner Vulovic says he has some 545,000 registered refugees but estimates that there are an additional 120,000 unregistered ones.
The government can no longer afford to offer them financial assistance. But they get food and medicine from the United Nations and other aid agencies.
As the exodus from Bosnia continues, Serbian officials find that the public's generosity is drying up. And they are now being forced to fall back on more traditional methods of caring for them -- bleak refugee centers in sport centers, disused army barracks and summer recreation camps.
"Often the host family thought the refugees would only be with them a few weeks but now it's seven or eight months and tempers get frayed," Mrs. Gruden explains. "Then everybody is getting poorer as a result of sanctions. Factories are closing and salaries are being cut. So it's becoming a bigger economic strain to help other people."
With the winter coming on and the fighting continuing, Commissioner Vulovic is bracing for a further big influx as conditions in Bosnia get worse. "We expect at least 200,000 this winter," he said. "But if Sarajevo falls it could be more." He said that in the besieged Muslim town of Travnik, there are already believed to be nearly 50,000 refugees seeking shelter.

HEADLINE: Some Legal Experts See Intolerance as H.I.V. and Sex Are Linked to Crime

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The prospect of dying in a Louisiana prison made Salvadore Gamberella's hands shake and his voice tremble. He is only 28 years old, and at most his crime will cost him 20 years in jail.
But it will likely be a life sentence nonetheless. Mr. Gamberella has H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and is not expected to live out the term. Last week Mr. Gamberella, an unemployed shipyard welder with a troubled past, became the first person to be prosecuted and convicted under Louisiana's five-year-old criminal AIDS law. 
 It took the State District Court jury in Houma, La., only 12 minutes to find Mr. Gamberella guilty of putting his former girlfriend, Darla Trosclair, at risk. Ms. Trosclair has tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus. Did Mr. Gamberella tell the 18-year-old woman, the valedictorian of her high school class, he was infected? It was his word against hers, and the jury believed Ms. Trosclair, who said he did not tell her.
 
Rise in Prosecutions
 To Mr. Gamberella, free on bond in his trailer at the edge of Houma, the jury's quick decision was grim new evidence of his outcast status in the coastal city of about 35,000 residents. But it was also a sign of what experts say is a new, harsher wave in society's response to the AIDS epidemic.
In the last year, there has been a surge of prosecutions involving people with H.I.V., said Lawrence Gostin, executive director of the American Society of Law, Medicine and Ethics, and head of the United States AIDS Litigation Project. Mr. Gostin said about 20 convictions had been logged around the country since the epidemic started.
The man who prosecuted Mr. Gamberella, Steven Callahan, the Terrebonne Parish assistant district attorney, says the case tells people with H.I.V. "they have to be more responsible about their sexual behavior."
But others wonder. Many of these cases, particularly those resulting from criminal AIDS laws like the one here, trouble legal experts who say they reflect a new intolerance, demonize people with AIDS and may even discourage people from seeking to learn whether they are infected with the virus. To know, these experts say, is to leave oneself open to prosecution.
Most criminal AIDS cases are still brought under existing laws. One such case ended on Wednesday in Portland, Ore., with the conviction of an H.I.V.-infected man who was charged with attempted murder for having unprotected sex with a 17-year-old girl.
Half the states now have specific laws similar to Louisiana's, which makes it a crime when a person who knows he has the AIDS virus does not inform his sex partner. The law here, with its penalty of 10 years at hard labor and a fine of $5,000, is one of the toughest in the country.
The law is "motivated by punitive or retributive motivations, not what's good for public health," said Mr. Gostin, who is also a professor of health law at Harvard University.
Until now, prosecutors have had trouble winning AIDS cases brought under the existing criminal laws. There have been about 300 cases, Mr. Gostin said, and in many it has been difficult to prove that one person intended to harm another.
The case in Oregon involved Alberto Gonzalez, 28, who was on probation after pleading no contest in a similar case last October. The teen-age girl in the current case has tested negative for H.I.V., but the woman in the earlier case has developed AIDS. A third woman who had unprotected sex with Mr. Gonzalez died of AIDS.
 
Proof of Intent to Harm
 While the prosecution was able to obtain a conviction of Mr. Gonzalez, the jury was split 10 to 2, with one juror, speaking on condition of anonymity, saying they had great difficulty determining whether he intentionally tried to pass the virus. Juries in Oregon do not have to be unanimous to convict on attempted murder charges.
As a result of the difficulties facing prosecutors in obtaining convictions under conventional law, legislatures got tougher, passing laws specifically for AIDS cases.
Under laws like Louisiana's, no proof of intent to harm is necessary. The state needs to show only that one person knew of the infection and did not tell the partner. That was the essence of the case against Mr. Gamberella.
In an interview last week, Mr. Gamberella readily admitted to his past: a prison term on a burglary conviction, marriage to a prostitute, intravenous drug use. Mr. Gamberella insisted that after he had met Ms. Trosclair he told her that he feared he might be infected with H.I.V..
According to court records and Mr. Gamberella, he met Ms. Trosclair at a blessing of the fleet ceremony in Chauvin, La., in the spring of 1989. They became friends. Because of his record, Mr. Gamberella had a difficult time finding a job, and in June 1989 he tried to earn some cash by selling his blood at a blood bank.
Through the blood bank he found out he had the virus that causes AIDS and, he says, told Ms. Trosclair. Several months later, they began having sex. A brief the American Civil Liberties Union filed on behalf of Mr. Gamberella said the couple regularly used a condom during sex.
On one occasion, though, they did not use a condom, and on that occasion Mr. Gamberella told Ms. Trosclair that they should stop, according to the brief. But Ms. Trosclair, the brief said, "told Mr. Gamberella she did not want to stop." It added, "She said that if he was going to die she wanted to 'die with him.' "
Ms. Trosclair's account is different from Mr. Gamberella's. In testimony in Houma last week, Ms. Trosclair said that Mr. Gamberella never told her that he was infected, even early in 1990, when she discovered that she was pregnant. Mr. Gamberella now faces a second count of violating the AIDS law for exposing the child. The son is 2 years old and has tested negative for H.I.V. Ms. Trosclair said she did not find out she was infected with the virus until early this year.
Ms. Trosclair refuses to discuss the case with reporters.
While no trial date has yet been set for Mr. Gamberella in the case involving the child, a challenge to the Louisiana law is set to be heard in State District Court on Tuesday. The civil liberties union, which is representing Mr. Gamberella, says it will argue that the law, with its pivotal reliance on the word "intentionally," is unconstitutionally vague. The law, according to a brief the group filed in the constitutionality case, fails to define exactly what must be intended, simply having sex or inflicting criminal harm.
The civil liberties union also says the law does not specify that the accused must be aware of his or her condition.
"I really do see this law as unworthy of our society," said Denise LeBoeuf, a civil liberties union lawyer who is representing Mr. Gamberella. "There is a natural fear response that we can fight AIDS by fighting people with AIDS. We can't."

HEADLINE: Time Warner Holds Talks

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Time Warner's magazines unit and the American Express Company are in talks about possible business deals, a Time spokesman said yesterday. But he declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that American Express's magazine publishing operations may be put into a joint venture with Time Warner.
Quoting unidentified executives from both companies, The Journal said they were near an agreement for Time Warner's magazine unit to operate the joint venture through its Time Inc. Ventures. 
 The magazines include American Express's Travel & Leisure, Food & Wine and Departures.
A Time spokesman said the companies were "having discussions on a variety of topics." American Express executives were not available for comment.
American Express has been experiencing sluggish revenue growth in its core credit card business because of the weak economy. For the latest quarter, the travel, financial and information services company reported a net loss of $205 million, against a profit of $31 million in the third quarter of 1991. It closed one magazine, New York Woman, earlier this year.
Time Warner, the world's largest media company, has been seeking business alliances to cope with the heavy debt taken on when Time bought Warner Communications Inc. for $14 billion in 1989.

Copper Prices Move Higher On Bullish Economic News

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Copper futures prices bounded higher yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York in reaction to this week's bullish economic news.
The value of copper, an industrial metal, often moves in unison with improvements in the economic climate. 
 The Government reported fresh evidence yesterday of a recovery, as Americans' incomes rose 1 percent in October and spending climbed seven-tenths of a percent. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported a surprisingly strong 3.9 percent increase in the third-quarter gross domestic product.
Fred Demler, metals analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said the encouraging economic data this week and production problems in Russia all contributed to the rally in copper. Also supporting it were rumors of production problems at a Chilean copper refinery and of demand from China and Japan, traders said.
The actively traded March copper contract rose 2.50 cents, to 99.60 cents a pound.
Chicago grain and livestock futures markets were open yesterday, but trading volume was light as many traders took off the day after Thanksgiving.
Chicago Mercantile Exchange cattle futures closed lower as traders realized that a snowstorm that sped through the Great Plains on Wednesday probably had not harmed the cattle herds there.
December live cattle closed down 0.1 cent at 76.35 cents a pound.
New York energy futures markets were closed yesterday for a long Thanksgiving weekend, delaying until Monday any market reaction to OPEC's announcement of a production ceiling. Traders said they expected Nymex crude oil prices to remain fairly steady on OPEC's action. The group set an output ceiling of 24.582 million barrels a day.
In London, January Brent crude futures rose 22 cents, to $18.97 a barrel.
"It is not something that is going to drive up the price by $3 per barrel, but it will reduce the risk of a major drop in prices," said Gerry Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
The OPEC cap is about 400,000 barrels less than what Western economists had estimated as OPEC's recent output.

HEADLINE: Fire Destroys 4 Businesses In Queens

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
The first fire that struck the squat brick shopping center in Queens last May caused more fear than damage in the vegetarian restaurant Abhay Mehta and his family opened two years ago. The second fire, early yesterday morning, devastated it.
The fire, which began at 4:20 A.M. and quickly went to four alarms, tore through the small shopping center on Broadway at 43d Avenue in Elmhurst, destroying four businesses, , including Mr. Mehta's restaurant, Jhupdi, and a vacant storefront. Fire officials said the blaze, which broke out two doors away from Mr. Mehta's restaurant, was suspicious because it began in the same place as the fire in May. 
 "What could be the purpose?" Mr. Mehta said, as he stood in the center's parking lot yesterday, sorting through the broken glass and charred remains of the restaurant.
The fire, which burned out of control for more than three hours, swept through a shopping center as ethnically diverse as the neighborhood around it. In addition to Jhupdi, the fire gutted the Restaurante Las Palmas, Singas Famous Pizza, and Anna Bhandar Indo-Pakistani Groceries. The center's anchor supermarket, Key Food, suffered smoke damage.
 
Economic Impact Concerns
 Dan Andrews, a spokesman for Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, said her office was concerned that fire could have a harsh economic impact in the neighborhood, where thousands of new immigrants have moved in the last decade. Scores of ethnic shops, bodegas and restaurants have opened despite the recession that has left many stores vacant in other parts of the city.
Worried that the owners of the stores destroyed in the fire would face an arduous struggle rebuilding, Mr. Andrews said, officials in the Borough President's office of economic development had already begun looking into ways to assist them, possibly arranging low-interest lows.
More than 180 firefighters from 38 fire companies fought the blaze, which appeared to have begun in the basement beneath Las Palmas and Singas Famous Pizza, bringing it under control at 7:38 yesterday morning. No one was injured, officials said.
A Fire Department spokesman, Robert Broderick, said that fire marshals were still investigating the blaze and that they had no suspects. Mr. Mehta, who emigrated from Bombay in 1988, said he and five relatives had pooled their resources to open Jhupdi two years ago.
 
Insurance, Yes. But Enough?
 As they slowly redecorated, hoping to recreate the ambiance of an Indian village, they encountered resistance from the city's inspectors, who objected to the straw huts they wanted to build inside. The flame-retardant straw was the only thing that did not burn yesterday.
As workers cleaned debris from the sidewalk and hammered plywood over the storefronts, Mr. Mehta, who is 27 years old, said he had insurance but probably not enough.
"The atmosphere inside was so good," he said, picking up a charred, soaked newspaper clipping of a favorable review. "It was a lot of work, eight months. The insurance doesn't cover the work we did."

In Place of Yugos, AK-47's and Pistols

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The humble Yugo automobile meant money and jobs for this town in the center of Serbia. But the civil war has forced an end to production, costing tens of thousands of jobs.
Now the factory makes little more than rifles and pistols. 
 "We had our chance, but we missed it," said Rodoljub Micic, the plant's general director. "Our worry now is what to do with thousands unemployed. They could start a social revolution."
Factory workers cried with joy when the first shipment of Yugo cars, the pride of Yugoslavia's state-run industry, left for the United States in 1985. Now, hopes of prosperity based on the 55-horsepower compact are gone.
 
 
30,000 Laid Off
 "So many people are out on the streets without work in Kragujevac," said Dragica Petrovic, who used to work on the production line. "How are we going to survive?"
As the country has disintegrated in civil war, car production at the Red Flag factory in this town of about 150,000 people 60 miles south of Belgrade has all but ceased.
Management has laid off 30,000 of 49,000 employees. Of the remaining workers, 2,000 are using leftover parts to assemble the last 5,000 Yugos for the domestic market.
The rest are producing AK-47 assault rifles, Magnum-type revolvers and other large-caliber pistols popular on the war fronts in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina and elsewhere in war-torn Yugoslavia.
The 100-year-old Red Flag arms factory is the biggest in the Balkans; car production began there only in the mid-1950's.
 
 
'Deal of the Century'
 Under a contract touted in Yugoslavia as "the deal of the century," the plant started exporting Yugos to the United States in July 1985, making them the first cars from a Communist country on the American market. Yugos were also exported to Britain, Greece, Spain and Egypt, but the United States was the largest market.
Sales in the United States peaked at 49,000 in 1988 before plunging. Although the no-frills Yugo was inexpensive -- it began selling for $3,999 -- the car had recurring technical problems.
In the first quarter of 1992, Yugo America Inc., based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., sold only 1,400 cars. Yugo America filed for bankruptcy in April and is no longer operating. One of the founders of Yugo America was Lawrence S. Eagleburger, Acting Secretary of State and a former Ambassador to Yugoslavia.
Sanctions were imposed by the United Nations last May on Serbia and Montenegro -- the two remaining Yugoslav republics -- to punish Serbia for fomenting war, first in Croatia and now in Bosnia. Yugoslavia's economy had already been crippled by mismanagement and the burden of financing military campaigns, but the sanctions created a crisis. About 500,000 workers have lost their jobs since May, and it is expected the plant will be closed.
 
 
'We Cried With Joy'
 "I remember, we cried with joy when the first Yugo left our factory for America," Ms. Petrovic said. "Now, many of us are crying because tomorrow we may not have bread to eat." She lost her job in August and receives about $50 a month in welfare.
The huge assembly lines are virtually deserted now as thousands of Yugos without parts stand idle, rusting on a parking lot.
"Success requires the effort of all, while only one person is sufficient for failure," reads a large red banner still hanging in the main factory. Many of the jobless workers consider that one person sufficient for failure to be Serbia's nationalist President, Slobodan Milosevic, who is widely blamed for the violent breakup of Yugoslavia.
"If he was not here, Yugoslavia would be together now," said Zoran Stojkovic, an auto worker discharged early this year. "We would be selling our cars in the other republics and maybe America. And there would be no sanctions."
"Now, the factory is producing only machine guns, which kill our former brothers," he added, sipping a plum brandy in the smoky Srbija restaurant.

HEADLINE: With a Big Claim, a Tiny Tribe Seeks Aid

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 25

 BODY:
In the beginning there were rocks and rivers, forests and meadows, cornfields and leaping deer. Now there is downtown Bridgeport, and the Golden Hill Paugussetts, an Indian tribe based here, want it back.
In a class-action suit filed earlier this month in Federal District Court, the 100-member tribe asserted its ownership of 88 acres that include much of this city's core, encompassing City Hall, the main post office and the Hi-Ho shopping mall. Citing violations of agreements made in the 18th century, first with the British and then with the Americans, tribal leaders have proposed a settlement that includes $750 million, 80 acres of land, support for the tribe's efforts to become recognized by the Federal Government as an official tribe and state permission to operate a casino. 
 It is a tall order, especially for an economically beleaguered city and state, but one that tribal leaders say they are entitled to after a history of poor treatment. "This is based on the value of the land," said Aurelius H. Piper Jr., the tribe's 47-year-old council chief, who is also known as Quiet Hawk. "I want the whole thing, all of it," he added. "Any white man in this country with a billion-dollar claim would be as hard-nosed as I am."
Some have wondered why anyone would want anything in downtown Bridgeport, an aging industrial city that tried to declare bankruptcy last year. Others have scoffed at the tribe's claim, suggesting that its real goal is simply to open a casino of its own. Another Connecticut tribe, the Mashantucket Pequots, opened a successful casino near Ledyard in February. Various parties, including Las Vegas developers like Steven A. Wynn, have proposed building casinos in Bridgeport as well.
But regaining its land has been a tribal priority for generations, Mr. Piper said. "It's something that has passed down, leader to leader," he said. "We have continuously gone after our property, but we haven't had the money to finish it. The tribe is very poor and small." Besides Bridgeport, the tribe is considering staking claims to other land it inhabited before Europeans arrived, in Orange, Stratford, Milford and Trumbull.
The Golden Hill Paugussetts have existed "since time immemorial," according to the lawsuit, and now occupy two reservations in Connecticut. One, covering about 107 acres in Colchester, was bought with a Federal Housing and Urban Development grant in the 1970's, Mr. Piper said. The other, only a quarter-acre, is in Trumbull. Mr. Piper's brother, known as Moonface Bear and a tribal leader himself, lives on the Colchester reservation; his father, Aurelius Sr., whose Indian name is Big Eagle, lives on the Trumbull property.
Mr. Piper said he had tried to negotiate with city officials but got nowhere, which forced him to file the suit. A lawyer for the city, Mark Anastasi, refused to comment on the case because it is pending. Legal experts said that in settlements of Indian claims, the bulk of the awards are usually paid by the Federal Government, although state and local governments are required to contribute.
The tribe contends that agreements between its ancestors and the British Crown, as well as the fledgling American Government, were violated. English colonists arrived in the area of what is now Bridgeport, where the Paugussetts were concentrated, in the 1630's. To resolve a dispute over property that arose in 1658, the tribe agreed to accept an 80-acre reservation in Bridgeport, which became known as the Golden Hill Reservation, the lawsuit states.
But by 1760, the reservation had been nibbled away by more and more settlers, prompting an investigation by a committee of the colony's Assembly, said Bernard Wishnia, a Roseland, N.J., lawyer who is representing the Paugussetts. The investigation, completed in 1765, found in favor of the Indians but allowed the settlers to keep 68 acres, giving the Indians two lots totaling 20 acres along with some corn and a pile of blankets. The entire 88-acre tract is the subject of the suit.
Most of the land subsequently was taken from the Indians by local officials, according to the suit, even though Federal law specified that that could not be done without the consent of Congress. "The Tribe therefore retains the title and right of possession to the said land," the suit states. Among the several pages of defendants are dozens of individual and corporate property owners, as well as Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the United States of America and Mayor Joseph Ganim of Bridgeport.
The points raised in the suit and proposed settlement highlight some of the complex issues facing Indian tribes, which often include social problems like alcoholism and unemployment in disproportionate numbers. Raising enough money to sustain even a small tribe is difficult; hence tribes turn to bingo or casinos to draw big spenders. Certain Federal education and health programs are available specifically for Indians and not for other ethnic or racial groups.
 
Certification Process
 But to be entitled to such benefits, tribes must go through a Federal certification process with criteria that many of them find demeaning as well as difficult to satisfy. Tribes must prove, among other things, that they have had a long, continuous history; that they have maintained a "contemporary community," and that the tribal government has exercised continuous authority over its members. The Golden Hill Paugussetts have been trying to gain Federal recognition since 1982.
The certification process "creates an expectation that modern-day tribes, who have never received any kind of Federal support and in many cases have been actively suppressed, must show the same sorts of characteristics as tribes that have had land set aside for them and received other kinds of support," said Henry Sockbeson, a senior lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund in Washington. Tribes most often fail the community aspect of the test, he said, because many of their members are scattered across a wide area and have little contact with each other.
Only one case of a tribe's seeking to prove its status has ever gone before a jury, Mr. Sockbeson said. That involved the Mashpees, a tribe in Massachusetts, during the 1970's, and the tribe lost.
Other tribes have been successful in winning Federal recognition. Among them are the Mashantucket Pequots, based near Ledyard, in the eastern part of the state, and the Penobscots, the Maine tribe to which Mr. Sockbeson belongs.
Dale T. White, a Boulder, Colo., specialist in Indian law who is representing the Golden Hill Paugussetts in their recognition bid, said he is optimistic that the tribe will succeed. After all, he noted, the tribe has been recognized by Connecticut since the middle of the 17th century, and is listed in various documents. But Mr. Piper, whose mother was black, said he is repelled by the whole process. "It's insulting, condescending and racist," he said. "I have to prove that I'm an Indian, and yet they can decide whether I am an Indian or not."
And he faces resistance not only from the Government, but from other tribes as well, he said. "The more people who are federally recognized, the smaller the pie for everyone else," he said. "There are good ol' boy politics inside the tribes, too. I can understand it, but I don't necessarily agree with it."

HEADLINE: Artist of the Possible;
Brenda Bacon, in Trenton Vortex

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Like everyone else involved in restructuring New Jersey's health care system for the uninsured, Brenda Bacon, who as Chief of Management and Planning for the State of New Jersey was one of its chief architects, is not happy with the new plan, which goes to a vote in the Legislature on Monday.
"This is the best package that can be accomplished, given all the circumstances," she said in an interview in the cabinet room just off the Governor's office this week. "We had to deal with the Federal court decision, we had to deal with a Legislature that is totally tax averse and we had to deal with a crisis in how health care is delivered in this state and this country. We can all sit down and design a perfect system on paper, but it isn't going to be reality." 
 The sweeping health care package is "fast tracked," scheduled to go to the floor of both houses of the Legislature on Monday, with the outcome uncertain. The plan, which Gov. Jim Florio concedes is "not everybody's first choice" but which he says he will sign into law if nobody comes up with something better in the time remaining, would create a new health care financing system by tapping the state's $2.4 billion unemployment compensation fund.
 
Court Ruling
 A new system must be developed because a Federal court last May decided in a civil suit brought by 14 labor unions that the state's method of financing health care for the uninsured was unconstitutional. That program, called the Uncompensated Care Trust Fund, set up in 1980, raised its money, amounting to $644 million last year, by adding 19 percent to every hospital bill. The money was used to pay for health care for the indigent and the uninsured.
The court's ruling meant that the state had to come up with a new way to pay for that care, and the Governor and the Legislature agreed to produce a new plan by Nov. 30. They have been arguing about how to do it since the ruling in May and they came up with the compromise plan only last week.
Tapping into the unemployment fund directly is illegal, so the plan, devised by the Republican majority in the Legislature, does it by indirection, cutting the unemployment tax while creating a new health care tax that would raise an equivalent sum. If the $2.4 billion unemployment fund dips below $1.5 billion, a new tax on employers, six-tenths of 1 percent of their payrolls, would kick in.
The plan is intended to avoid the immediate imposition of a new tax, which the Republican leaders consider politically unacceptable. The Republicans won large majorities in both houses of the Legislature in November 1991 by campaigning against taxes imposed two years ago by Governor Florio and the Democrats who then controlled the Legislature.
 
At the Vortex
 Reality in Trenton is harsh these days. Fiscal crisis is a perpetual state of affairs; the stubborn Republican majority, in total control of the the Legislature, is at sword's point with an equally stubborn Democratic Governor, and the list of problem areas -- from welfare to education to automobile insurance to health care -- is mounting. At the vortex is Ms. Bacon, who is both a longtime friend and aide of Mr. Florio and the third-ranking member of his administration. She is also a friend of long standing and a former business partner of the No. 2 man, Joseph C. Salema, the Governor's Chief of Staff. "Oh, yes," says Ms. Bacon, who is 42 years old, "I remember the Governor when he looked like Bruce Springsteen."
And Jim Florio in 1974 was a boyish, new member of the House of Representatives. He met Brenda Bacon, then in her 20's and carving out a career in health care after an early start as a social worker, when they attended meetings aimed at finding ways to provide affordable health care for everyone. After two decades of hard work and intensive study, Ms. Bacon and the Governor concede, that is still the elusive goal.
"Brenda and I go back a long way," the Governor said, "back to the days of the Health Services Agency," a Federal program in which both were involved. "The people doing it were mostly health care professionals, and I was very impressed, not only with Brenda's knowledge but with the respect she commanded from the professionals."
 
'We Share a Philosophy'
 She has been an adviser to the Governor in Washington and Trenton, on and off, ever since. When Mr. Florio took office as Governor in January 1990 after 16 years in Congress, she was one of his first appointees."
"We share a philosophy that the object of government policy is the public interest," the Governor said. "All too frequently," he added, "you have academics who can't manage or people who can manage but who have not thought through policy. She does both."
As the chief shaper of both policy and administration, Ms. Bacon meets daily with the Governor and four days a week with key members of the cabinet and the Chief of Staff.
"Brenda is smart, likable, but she is tough as nails," said Assemblyman Wayne R. Bryant of Camden, the deputy minority leader. Mr. Bryant held the seat on the Camden County Board of Freeholders to which -- at his urging and that of Mr. Florio -- Ms. Bacon was appointed for a year before being elected to a two-year term in the early 1980's.
"I was only the second minority member of the Camden County Freeholders," said Mr. Bryant, "and the black community said they should continue to have a voice. We had never had a black woman on the board. Brenda was the first, and she was elected to a second term."
Despite her reputation for relentless and passionate advocacy for the things that she and the Governor believe in, she maintains a cheerful delight in human foibles and laughs as easily as she argues.
 
'Lucky to Have Her'
 State Senator C. Louis Bassano of Union, the chairman of the Senate Health Committee and the chief sponsor and Republican negotiator on the health care plan, recalls telling Ms. Bacon when the negotiations ended how tough she is. "I meant it as a compliment," he said, "and I think she took it that way. She is tough, she is a good negotiator and I don't always agree with her, but the Governor is lucky to have her. She understands health care, knows it well."
"When it got too intense," he added, "she would just say, 'I've had enough; I'm leaving.' "
Ms. Bacon concedes that she walked out of a few meetings to cool off. "These were not nice meetings," she explained. "There are many things we negotiated out of the bill." But she always came back, because, she said, one cannot just walk away.
If the warring camps had not worked together, she said, "On Nov. 30, you were going to have hundreds of thousands of people who were not going to have medical care, a hospital system where hundreds of people were laid off, bond defaults and all sorts of horrible things.
"So where maybe $600 million is not enough to solve the urban hospital problem, zero dollars is a lot worse."

HEADLINE: Japanese Officially Reaffirm Support of Rice Import Ban

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Japan's Government said today that the nation would fight to maintain its ban on the import of rice, a stance that may threaten to disrupt world trade talks.
But after the official position was stated, Japan's Foreign Minister seemed to leave the door open for a compromise, sending a subtle signal to the country's rice farmers that protectionism that could harm Japan's trading relationships may not be sustainable. 
 With the United States and the European Community's having reached an agreement, however tenuous, on agricultural subsidies, Japan's ban on rice imports could become an obstacle to a new global trading treaty. Despite France's opposition to the farm accord and a possible French veto of a global trade pact, negotiators agreed in Geneva on Thursday to resume the long-stalled Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with the goal of reaching a basic treaty by the end of the year.
Japanese Cabinet ministers held a special meeting today to discuss the nation's negotiating position, and they reaffirmed Japan's opposition to rice imports.
But at a news conference immediately after the meeting, Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe seemed to suggest that Japan might have to compromise. "I wonder if we can stick to our policy of not importing even a grain of rice," he said.
The statement, as well as other seemingly conflicting remarks by officials earlier in the week, reflected to some extent the divisions in the Government. While the Agriculture Ministry seems firmly opposed to rice imports, the Foreign Affairs Ministry is more interested in seeing that the rice issue does not ruin Japan's standing in the world or relations with trading partners.
The International Trade and Industry Ministry and big business groups here are also said to believe that the rice issue should not be allowed to touch off a trade war that would harm Japan's exports of cars, computer chips and camcorders -- products that represent far bigger sectors of the economy than rice farming.
 
Protecting a Staple
 Japanese officials argue that the nation needs to ban imports to protect Japanese rice farmers from being forced out of business by less expensive foreign products and to assure that the nation remains self-sufficient in its staple food.
Farmers and the powerful agricultural cooperatives are important supporters of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. With a big political scandal and the economic recession already undermining its support, the party cannot afford to alienate farmers.
To some analysts, what has been happening here is elaborate political theater. Politicians are maintaining a strong stance in opposition to imports while occasionally sending up trial balloons hinting a compromise, thus preparing the nation for a decision that might be needed to facilitate the GATT talks. If a market opening occurs, these analysts say, politicians will be able to say they put up a good fight but were forced to give in to foreign pressure.
 
A Tariff Proposal
 Last year, Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of GATT, proposed replacing import bans with tariffs that would be relaxed gradually. Mr. Dunkel has urged that there be no exceptions.
Japanese officials say that Japan, which is already the largest food importer in the world, deserves an exception for rice. South Korea also wants to keep a ban on rice imports, and other nations are expected to seek specific exceptions.
"We will actively seek international understanding for the difficult problems that Japan faces," Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata said today, according to the Kyodo news agency. The Agriculture Minister, Masami Tanabu, said he might visit the United States and Europe to discuss Japan's position.
 
May Be Acceptable
 Still, reports have appeared here that Japan might accept a tariff plan, providing the tariff is made higher and longer lasting than under Mr. Dunkel's proposal.
Asked about this today, Foreign Minister Watanabe said that while Japan opposed the tariff plan, it might end up in a "fight over the conditions of 'tariffication.' " While the Foreign Ministry said Mr. Watanabe was speaking as an individual, his comments were interpreted by the news media here as a sign that the Government was not completely closed to a tariff on rice.
Under Mr. Dunkel's proposal imported rice might start, for example, with a tariff in Japan as high as 700 percent, declining over six years to a level as low as 450 percent. The proposal also called for Japan to allow 3 percent of its rice market to be served by imports initially, rising to 5 percent in six years.
Mr. Dunkel has argued that such high tariffs will merely substitute one form of protection for another. But Japanese officials worry that once tariffs are in place, there will be international pressure to reduce them.
The United States has called on Japan to accept the tariff plan. Some newspapers here have also been calling for a liberalization on imports.

HEADLINE: Bonds Drop as 2 Indicators Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday after the Government reported an unexpected rise in the nation's personal income and spending.
The Treasury's main 30-year bond fell 21/32 point, or $6.56 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, grew to 7.59 percent, from 7.53 percent after a shortened session on Wednesday. No trading took place Thursday. 
 Bond prices opened slightly higher but began falling at midmorning after the Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal income shot up 1 percent in October, the largest gain in 10 months. Personal spending rose a strong seven-tenths of 1 percent, pushed higher by a number of special factors.
 
Strength Ahead
 The market had been expecting rises of about five-tenths of 1 percent in personal income and six-tenths of a percent in consumption.
The income and spending figures were the second signal this week that the economy is rebounding. They follow a report on Wednesday that the nation's gross domestic product rose at a surprisingly robust annual rate of 3.9 percent in the third quarter.
The two numbers together suggest that "strength is likely to continue into the fourth quarter," said Ram Bhagavatula, chief financial economist at Citicorp Securities Markets.
Bullish economic figures usually send bond prices lower because they signal that inflation, which erodes the value of long-term investments, might heat up. They also make the Federal Reserve less likely to lower interest rates.
 
'We'll Probably See a Rally'
 But the thinness of yesterday's post-holiday trading made for volatile prices that did not necessarily indicate long-term market trends, Mr. Bhagavatula said.
For one thing, inflation is running at a comfortable 2.5 to 3 percent, which should not be enough to disturb bond prices long term, he said.
In addition, the economist pointed out, the percentage of manufacturing capacity currently in use was 78.5 percent in October. "Until that rate gets up to 85 percent, there is little cause for concern," he said. "My nagging suspicion is that Monday we'll probably see a rally."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term maturities fell 5/32 to 15/32 point and intermediate maturities fell 17/32 point, the Telerate financial data service reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all Treasury issues outstanding with maturities of a year or longer, fell 5.22, to 1,242.33.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose 1 basis point, or hundredth percentage point, to 3.24 percent; on six-month bills it rose 3 basis points, to 3.46 percent. The discount rate on one-year bills rose 5 basis points, to 3.64 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose to 3 3/8 percent, from 3 1/4 percent late Wednesday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 97 1/8, unchanged from Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was 6.4 percent, also unchanged.

HEADLINE: The Hard Fact of Life Of a School's Closing

 BODY:
The sermon was appropriate for the season: try to find something to be thankful for.
But as the upper school students at St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's School filed out of their daily chapel service on a gray Manhattan day, few of them could identify that something. 
 The school's Board of Trustees announced this month that the upper school, which now has only 45 students, will close at the end of the school year. The cost of maintaining faculty, classrooms and activities for so few students, many of whom are on partial or full scholarships, has become a drain on the thriving lower classes. But as the older students face leaving their tiny community of friends and teachers, many of them feel anger and betrayal, or sadness.
 
'Cried for Two Days'
 "When I first heard I was so upset," Amanda Nazario, a 10th grader, said. "I cried for two days."
Amanda, 14 years old, came to St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's last year as a ninth grader. She said the atmosphere just seemed "ideal." Her mother called the school "a little piece of heaven for the kids."
In a city that boasts the largest group of independent schools in the country, St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's is a paradigm of both the educational genre and the economic problems such schools have faced in the last five years.
It was founded as a kindergarten in 1950 in a Morningside Heights brownstone by the Reverend Mother Ruth, an Episcopal nun who named it after her college at the University of Toronto, St. Hilda's. The school grew a grade a year, with students taught primarily by the nuns in the Community of the Holy Spirit, which Mother Ruth also founded.
 
A School Grows
 The school grew to include nursery through high school students, as well as boys. When the institution moved into a beige brick building on 114th Street near the Hudson River, it acquired a second name, that of St. Hugh, whom Mother Ruth chose as a patron saint for her male students.
Slowly, economic pressures and fewer nuns teaching for a small stipend (there are none at the school this year) have meant sharp increases in tuition and equally sharp decreases in the upper school's enrollment.
In the 1970's, when tuition was about $1,000 a year, 150 students attended the high school. In the mid-1980's, with tuition at $3,000, the school had around 100 upper schoolers. Now, with base high school tuition around $10,000, the upper school has lost 10 students in the last year. There are 211 students in the lower grades.
But Rick Fernandez, one of six seniors, said he did not consider the size of the classes to be a limitation. "We are not six cookie-cutter people," said Rick, who is 17. "We are really different from each other, but our personalities mesh."
"What we like about the school is the smallness," said Martha Bagnall, 14, who has been at St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's since nursery school. "So for it to be closed because of its size is even harder."
 
Racially Diverse
 Martha also likes the racial diversity of the school, which belies its size. Her group of 10th-grade friends consists of Amanda, who is half Puerto Rican and half Dutch, and "one Caucasian, one black, two Dominicans and Jennifer." "She's Mandarin," Martha said.
Jennifer Chen, 16, has attended St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's since fourth grade, when her family moved to the United States from Taiwan. "I learned to speak English here," she said. "I feel really attached to this place. I can't picture myself anyplace else."
But the group has begun to look elsewhere, aided by a school fair, which administrators hastily assembled last week.
"None of them match up to St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's," Amanda said of the other schools she has visited. "They pale in comparison to the education I'm receiving here."
The students remain angry and somewhat defiant, albeit in a tame fashion. Some asked permission to wear bluejeans (forbidden in the dress code) as a form of protest. More practically, several of the 10th graders called schools that end in the eighth grade to recruit students for next fall.
 
Learning About Power
 In many ways, the last month has provided an important, if not a pleasant, lesson. "I never knew there was a board of trustees that could make these decisions without asking us," Martha said. "Their picture was always at the front of the yearbook, but I didn't know they had that kind of power."
Of course, going to such a high school is bound to be different, though the students insist none of the differences are bad. The newspaper, The Courant, is not published, but posted on a bulletin board article by article. Few bother going to dances. And fielding sports teams gets harder and harder.
For instance, the boy's soccer team won the league championship last year, but almost could not play this year. Although 13 of the 19 high school boys agreed to play, that left little room for injury, and teachers had to forbid students who were hurt from playing.
As Lynne M. Allen, the headmistress, explained, in a phrase that may describe the entire controversy over closing and not just the soccer team, "Sensibility always comes up against adolescent enthusiasm."

HEADLINE: Income, Spending Up Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Americans' personal income grew at its fastest clip in 10 months during October, and consumer spending posted a healthy gain, the Government reported yesterday.
The Commerce Department said incomes grew 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $5.13 trillion, in October, the biggest gain since December 1991, when incomes rose 1.2 percent. The gain last month followed a half-point increase during September. 
 Consumer spending rose seven-tenths of a percent in October, or three-tenths of a percent after inflation. That followed a gain of nine-tenths of a percent in September.
 
A Skewed Perspective
 Analysts said the October income figures overstated the rise, and that recent gains in consumption could not be expected to continue at more than a moderate rate until the economy started generating new jobs.
Much of the October gain in income stemmed from special nonrecurring circumstances, including a rebound in Hawaiian rental incomes after Hurricane Iniki, retirement incentive payments to Postal Service employees, and payments to auto workers. Excluding these one-time factors, income rose just four-tenths of a percentage point.
"None of the growth in income is coming from job growth; it is all due to special factors," said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "And you are not going to get any meaningful income growth until you get some sort of upward trajectory to job growth."
Gains in personal income include wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends and interest.
Private sector wages and salaries rose six-tenths of a percent in October, to an annual rate of $2.94 billion, after falling one-tenth of a percent in September. The gain had been expected, largely because workers put in longer hours.
Similarly, analysts said the rise in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, would be difficult to sustain unless more jobs were created.
"Consumption had a good third quarter and is starting off the fourth at a fairly high level," said James O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan. "But from what we already know from auto sales and retail store surveys, it looks like spending slowed in November. And if consumption is to stay strong, income has to pick up, which means employment has to pick up."
Despite the caveats, analysts said the higher consumption is likely to translate into a brighter Christmas selling season for retailers.
"The point I have tried to make about Christmas is that the increases we have seen in consumer spending make a good Christmas season almost inevitable when compared to a year ago," Mr. McKelvey said. "But while modest, single-digit gains may sound good to retailers, they don't signal a real spending boom."
During October at least, Americans did not pay for current consumption out of savings.
The Commerce Department said the personal savings rate, which shows savings as a percentage of disposable income, rose to 4.7 percent in October from 4.4 percent a month earlier. Despite the improvement, Mr. O'Sullivan said the savings rate is a full half-point lower than it was six months ago.
The income and consumption numbers are the latest in a series of figures suggesting the economy is showing signs of life. Most recently, earlier this week, the Government revised upward its estimate of third-quarter growth in the gross domestic product, to 3.9 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2.7 percent. The new figure represents the best growth rate in nearly four years.
But many analysts say the stronger third-quarter growth represents merely a shift from activity that otherwise would have taken place in the current quarter. A good indication of whether the momentum is being sustained comes next Friday, when the Labor Department is expected to issue the November employment report.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Quiet Trading; Gold Prices Also Advance

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended firmer yesterday in a quiet session, helped by technical factors and fresh signs of an improving economy.
The dollar found some support in personal income and spending figures. "The numbers were fairly good, but a holiday market was not willing to take the dollar up," said Hugh Walsh, assistant vice president at ABN/AMRO. 
 Many dealers extended the Thanksgiving holiday, and activity was extremely light, dealers said.
Gold prices ended higher. On the Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $334 an ounce, up 50 cents from Wednesday. A late quote from the Republic National Bank said gold closed up 75 cents at $334.60.
The dollar rose overnight, but failed to puncture technical resistance at 1.6080 marks. Dealers said the dollar's repeated failure at that level lent credence to reports the Bundesbank was selling the United States currency for marks, building its reserves for future intervention to support the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The Bundesbank deputy president, Hans Tietmeyer, said he saw no reason for the Irish pound or Danish crown to be devalued. But many dealers see a devaluation as inevitable now that Irish elections are over.
Dealers said the Bundesbank's decision at its fortnightly council meeting to hold interest rates steady weighed on the dollar. Mr. Tietmeyer's remarks that German interest rates were "not so high" also were viewed as an indication German rates would not be coming down soon.
"It appears now that Germany will just stick to its guns," said Belal Khan, senior customer dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
He said the dollar's close below 1.60 marks, a key technical level, could portend further losses next week. The dollar was at 1.5985 marks in late New York trade, up from 1.5880 on Wednesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at at 124.20 yen, up from 123.60 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it rose to 124.40 yen. In late trade in New York, the dollar was at 124.45 yen, up from 123.75 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound softened to $1.5090, from $1.5249 on Wednesday. It edged higher, to $1.5105, in New York.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday rates, included: 1.4400 Swiss francs, up from 1.4270; 5.4275 French francs, up from 5.3820, and 1,394 Italian lire, up from 1,375.

HEADLINE: HOW THEY DO IT;
Mrs. Halvorsen Finds Lasting Benefits in an Unexpected Job Loss

 BODY:
Donna Halvorsen, a 42-year-old systems analysts, had worked for I.B.M. for 22 years when the company closed its Franklin Lakes, N.J. office and eliminated her job. She was offered a buyout or a job in Connecticut. Rather than uproot her family -- her husband, Drew, and 3-year-old son Jason -- she chose the buyout. Her main concern was the loss of benefits, because her husband, an oil-refinery pipe designer, is self-employed.
 After careful study of the 49-page buyout summary, which offered a variety of options, she came away with a generous severance package, including long-term insurance and a substantial sum of money to offset the loss of income. 
 After losing her job in July, she found a silver lining: She has more time with her son, and a change to develop a hobby designing fabric-covered picture frames (like the ones at right) into a small business.
 
AFTER THE BUYOUT
Benefits (many); losses (a few)
 
INSURANCE
 Group medical, dental and life insurance coverage continues at no cost except deductibles until 1999.
 
SEVERANCE
 One week's pay for every six months worked: $711 x 44 = $31,284
 Unused vacation pay: $1,000
 
401(k)
 Funds invested in 401(k) while at I.B.M. remain intact.
 
DISABILITY
 Coverage ended when she left I.B.M. She can purchase a disability policy for $60 a month if her business venture succeeds (if she earns a steady income for six months).
 
EASING HER CASH FLOW
 She now uses dividends of a life insurance policy, previously reinvested in the policy, to pay its monthly premiums ($145) and those of her husband's disability polices ($267).
 
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
 Because her job was eliminated by I.B.M., she may be eligible for unemployment compensation. Her case is pending; if approved, she will receive $308 a week for 13 weeks.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
With Sadness in His Eyes, Toon Bids Farewell

BYLINE: By AL HARVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Nov. 27

 BODY:
Coach Bruce Coslet of the Jets called it a sad occasion and a happy occasion. So did Jane Toon, the wife of Al Toon, the Jets' wide receiver, who retired from pro football today at the age of 29.
The force behind Toon's decision stemmed from the concussion he received after being hit by Broncos linebacker Michael Brooks in the Jets' loss in Denver almost three weeks ago. What clinched the decision was the consensus among a half-dozen doctors, after a battery of tests, that Toon, who has had five concussions in the last six seasons, should not risk another blow to the head. 
 "You go to a doctor and get an opinion and you go to more than one doctor and get more than one opinion," Toon explained, misty eyed, during a news conference at Weeb Ewbank Hall at the Jets' training center. "You get multiple opinions. If all are the same, or concur with the decision, you have to rely on it."
 
'Didn't Think I'd Cry'
 Toon's retirement ended an eight-year career in which he set Jets records for receptions in a season (93) and in consecutive games (101). He finished second to Don Maynard in receptions for a career with 517 and third to Maynard and Wesley Walker in receiving yardage (6,605).
"I didn't think I'd cry but it's been a big part of my life," said Toon of the years he spent in New York after the Jets made him their first-round draft choice, out of Wisconsin, in 1985. Three times he was voted to the Pro Bowl team; no other Jets player made it that often during Toon's eight years.
"Al is is the consummate team player," said Coslet, who was hired before the 1990 season. "Right out of the box I made him team captain. You could just see the leadership qualities he had oozing from him the very first day.
"It's sad because one of the great players in the N.F.L. is retiring, and it's a happy occasion because he's O.K. and there's no harm to his life."
 
New Contract in February
 Toon led the Jets in receptions for six straight years through last season, and signed a new $4.1 million contract through the 1994 season last February. The Jets are planning to pay him in full for the remainder of this year, approximately $1.4 million, plus the $65,000 required by the league as a career-ending-injury settlement.
He had 31 catches for 311 yards and 2 touchdowns this year, third best on the team.
When asked to recall the highlight of his career, Toon went back to 1988, the season in which the 5-yard touchdown pass he caught with only 37 seconds to play in the season-ending game with the Giants knocked the Giants out of the playoffs.
But Toon cited a bigger personal highlight.
"I remember being in the hospital the night my son, Nicholas, was born," said Toon, who also has two daughters, Kirby, aged 2, and Molly Elizabeth, born last May. "I got very little sleep that night and then went and caught 13 passes against Indianapolis.
"My biggest regret? Not being able to finish like I want to."
At Wisconsin, Toon set school career records for receptions (127), yardage 2,055 and touchdowns (19). Toon, who made the dean's list his last four semesters, has a degree in economics and obtained a Wisconsin real estate license in the off season. He plans to stay on Long Island until the end of the season and then return to his home in Madison, Wis., and devote full time to business.
When asked who had made the final decision to retire, Toon's wife, Jane, said: "Oh, he takes care of things like that pretty much by himself. This is about as emotional as I've ever seen him get.
"For the first couple of days it was like any other concussion, but when the condition hung on and got worse over a time, that's when we knew, when we suspected something different. I'm happy he's in one piece. I'm sad to be leaving my friends."
Chris Burkett, the wide receiver who usually entered games to replace Toon, said he had no idea his teammate would retire so soon.
"I talk to Al every day," he said. "We're more friends off the field than anything else, and when we talk we basically don't talk football too much. From what I know it was a decision that had to be made and I have to be supportive of him, because he's not just a football player on this team. He's my friend."
Dale Dawkins, who replaced Toon on the roster after Toon was put on injured reserve, said:
"I was one of the guys who was inspired by him. After my first game I called him when I got back. I talked to him about 10 minutes, told him what I did on my first play, and all he did was just support me and was happy."
 
Hidden Value
 Chip Myers, the receivers' coach, discussed one of Toon's talents that never showed up in the statistics of the 6-foot-4-inch, 204-pound player.
"The biggest problem I have with Al Toon is he tried to do everything too perfectly," Myers said. "You don't ask wide receivers to block ordinarily, but we asked him to block because we were going to get the running game cranked up. And he's one of the best blockers that every played the game. I mean he just doesn't miss. Ever.
"He knew what to do as far as catching the ball and running with it. He's a potential big play on every down, but the funny thing was he never really believed he could block like he did."

HEADLINE: ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
It's Time to Create Financial Options

BYLINE: By Malcolm Moran

 BODY:
Early this evening, as a national cable-television audience watches, Marshall Faulk, the gifted running back from San Diego State, might or might not be able to push his sprained knee in a meeting with Miami and a transcontinental Heisman challenge against Hurricane quarterback Gino Torretta.
Faulk might or might not become the first sophomore to win a Heisman Trophy, and he might or might not eventually leave school unnecessarily early for the financial security professional football can bring. 
 In a game that manufactures uncertainty and pain, there is this much that the people who care about Marshall Faulk can count on: Ready or not, he has already been pushed into the marketplace despite an archaic system that treats athletes as waifs who must be protected against the evils of commercialism while their universities cut their deals.
And Faulk, because of the unreasonable restrictions imposed by those outdated rules, could soon become the kind of academic statistic that Dick Schultz and the reformers within the National Collegiate Athletic Association have been working to reduce.
Why is it, in the marketplace of the 1990's, that an admired Olympic competitor can build the security of a trust fund while pursuing an athletic goal while a college student must take a vow of poverty? Why must talented college athletes with the highest profiles -- particularly those like Faulk, from difficult economic backgrounds -- face a choice between continuing their educations and developing some financial stability?
Defenders of the system point to free college educations and the opportunities they provide as more than fair compensation. This might have made sense before the recent explosion of sports marketing. Athletes in big-time football and basketball programs occupy a place where Olympic-caliber athletes once found themselves. It is not a good place. There is more than enough evidence in campus bookstores, arena souvenir stands and neighborhood malls.
Small children at Notre Dame football games wrap themselves in official mesh jerseys with the No. 6, which just happens to belong to Jerome Bettis, a powerful and personable fullback.
A souvenir stand at the Palace of Auburn Hills, where a capacity crowd recently watched Michigan's basketball team play an exhibition game, displayed Detroit Piston items next to Michigan souvenirs. An Isiah Thomas jersey cost $39. A blue Michigan shirt with the yellow No. 44, which is worn by Chris Webber, the most famous of the sophomore starters known as the Fab Five, was listed at $65. A similar shirt, through mail order, is even more expensive.
Last summer, a walk through a mall in the Midwest included a pass through a sports memorabilia store with autographed pictures and items: Mickey Mantle. Muhammad Ali. Sandy Koufax. Nolan Ryan. Jose Canseco. The Fab Five. An autographed basketball, which included the signatures of the five Michigan freshmen who reached last year's N.C.A.A. championship game, was selling for $300.
Where does the money go?
This is not about getting rich. If a college athlete is more interested in becoming wealthy than earning a degree, that's fine. Goodbye, good luck, and get a good agent. This is about the attainment of a reasonable piece of the pie.
The N.C.A.A.'s Presidents Commission has taken an aggressive approach to pushing through changes that give athletes a better chance to earn meaningful degrees. Insurance policies available through the N.C.A.A. now protect valuable commodities from the economic damage of a career-threatening injury.
A next step could reduce the influence of the sleaze factor and the flesh peddlers, and establish a carefully regulated system that puts the money -- at long last -- atop the table.
If an athlete wishes to go beyond tuition, room and board, he or she can approach a marketing representative of the university. The question that is already asked in too many clandestine conversations -- what can you do for me? -- could become an acceptable part of the recruiting process. Proposals can be made. The marketplace can be analyzed. A paper trail would account for every dime.
And here are the rules: The athlete must be academically eligible. The amount of the athletic scholarship would be repaid and placed in a general scholarship fund, available to all students.
Any additional income would fall into two categories: living expenses for the athlete and his immediate family, with the remainder divided between the university and a trust fund that would not become available to the athlete until all eligibility has been completed.
The alternative is obvious. College teams will continue to lose their biggest attractions prematurely, and nervous athletes will leave still semesters away from attaining degrees.
Or the environment could become nasty. After the player protests this football season at South Carolina, Memphis State, Oklahoma and Morgan State, how long will it take for athletes to challenge a system that directs the profits to everyone but them?
P.S. The schools could make more money, too. That ought to get someone's attention.

HEADLINE: Haitian Refugees: Don't Panic. Plan.

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's promise to ease the Bush Administration's punitive policies toward Haitian refugees has raised excessive expectations in Haiti and excessive fears here. All the President-elect proposes is to return to traditional interpretations of international practice and U.S. law, assuring Haitians who claim political persecution a fair hearing.
That's only decency, not reckless generosity. The new Administration is not about to open America's doors to every Haitian seeking a better life. It merely intends to abandon the Bush policy of turning back Haitian boats on the high seas without giving their occupants a chance to demonstrate legitimate claims to asylum. 
 The new approach will burden American facilities and resources. But with prompt planning, the load can be managed. Departures from Haiti are up already and could soar even before Inauguration Day if the Supreme Court strikes down President Bush's authorization of pre-emptive interceptions.
Clinton spokesmen talk of carrying out asylum interviews in other countries or on shipboard. That seems unrealistic. No other countries in the region have been willing to admit large numbers of Haitians, even temporarily. Coast Guard and Navy ships can't accommodate large groups awaiting processing for long periods. That leaves American bases like the one at Guantanamo Bay, supplemented by scattered-site facilities on the U.S. mainland.
Without a major change in Haiti's political situation, applicants could number 100,000 or more. Judging from interviews at Guantanamo earlier this year, only about a third will pass initial screening. Most of these will eventually qualify for something called Temporary Protected Status -- revocable in theory should repression in Haiti ease.
Diplomatic efforts to restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide, deposed as President 14 months ago, are now stalemated. A regional economic embargo has been too porous to exert real pressure. And the Organization of American States has hesitated to apply tougher measures.
That leaves scope for a Clinton Administration to increase diplomatic pressure on the Haitian military, the real power behind Prime Minister Marc Bazin. It could lean on European and other allies to join the hemisphere's embargo. It could use the Navy and Coast Guard to tighten enforcement. And it could restrict the travel and economic privileges of close collaborators with the Haitian dictatorship when they come to the United States.
None of this is guaranteed to produce quick results, given the bitterness of the Haitian quarrel and the reluctance on all sides to compromise. Meanwhile, it's time to begin preparing for the inevitable increase in refugees.

HEADLINE: Without Plumbing, Villages In Alaska Face Health Crisis

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KOTLIK, Alaska

 BODY:
This tiny fishing village on the Bering Sea offers most of the conveniences of modern American life. People here can get the Disney Channel on cable television, dial out on touch-tone phones, and rent "Wayne's World" at a local store.
But the one technology they lack is creating one of the nation's most poignant public health problems. 
 They do not have toilets.
 
Disease and Resentment
 Permafrost and poor soils make sewage systems extremely expensive. So natives here and in many Alaskan villages must haul drinking water in barrels and go to the bathroom in buckets.
The combination of primitive technology, a growing population and a Government policy that encouraged Alaskan Indians to consolidate into villages has produced a major sewage and water crisis. It is causing outbreaks of disease, deepening racial resentments and underscoring the shortcomings of the United States' health system, which brings modern miracles to some of its people while leaving others to want for the simplest care.
"The most basic components of health care are clean water and adequate sanitation," said Dr. Donn Kruse, medical director of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation in Bethel, which serves 48 villages in western Alaska. "We send Peace Corps volunteers to solve these problems around the world, but we haven't solved them here."
State officials say that only about half of the approximately 200 villages in Alaska have flush toilets and running water inside natives' homes. And with tight budgets in both Washington and Juneau, no one expects the situation to change soon.
But one fact of life, in Kotlik and many other villages, has not escaped local notice: the white people in town, about a dozen teachers, have expensive, fully modern systems, paid for by the Federal Government. Their housing, built by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to attract teachers to the village, has heated pipes that pump in running water and whisk away the sewage to a specially built lagoon.
Water and sewer problems did not afflict previous generations of natives, most of whom lived in small nomadic groups and did not settle in sufficient numbers for sewage to accumulate. The introduction of a cash economy and Government schools brought a consolidation of these groups into villages. Now the villages are undergoing a population explosion, and no one knows where to put the sewage.
In the last decade, the 500 residents of Kotlik have experienced epidemics that seemed to have leapt from the pages of Exodus. First a wave of boils swept over town, raising sores the size of silver dollars.
Then came an outbreak of viral meningitis, causing about 1 person in 10 to be flown to the nearest hospital, 200 miles away, while officials worried it would sweep the state. And this summer in nearby Hooper Bay, the contamination of a public well left one person dead and hundreds ill.
The conditions in Kotlik have made sanitation a civic fixation, with people here aspiring to toilets the way other communities dream of landing a Madonna concert or a professional football team.
No one feels the shame and frustration more than Joe Uisok, the hapless sanitation worker who empties the village's raw sewage bins. His work brings him coughs, colds, stinking clothes and snickers from the townspeople, who have so little public money they hold charity bingo games to help pay his salary. "And," he complained "there's no health insurance if I get sick."
 
Created by Government
 Kotlik is largely a Government creation. Until a generation ago, the Yupik Eskimo people who inhabit this pond-dappled delta of the Yukon River 475 miles west of Anchorage, lived in small clans and moved among favorite hunting and fishing spots.
Now most Kotlik residents live in trim wooden houses and shop in stores that brim with the offerings of American life, from boxes of Triscuits to tapes of Garth Brooks. There are no roads, but tiny planes arrive several times a day from Bethel, the delta's hub. Many families still hunt and fish, but unemployment, food stamps and neediness run high.
A major change began in the 1960's, when the Federal Government required native children to attend school, quickening the consolidation of subsistence outposts into a burgeoning villages. Until 1962, Kotlik was home to only a handful of Yupiks, one of the five major groups of natives who were living in Alaska before settlers arrived from Russia and the United States. The opening of a school that year brought in Yupik families from nearby Pastolik, Chaneliak, Hamilton and Bill Moore's Slew.
As a public-health story, the move to villages, which occurred at different times across the state, is mostly a tale of success, since it brought better housing and nutrition. For instance, Dr. Kruse said, the life expectancy of a Yupik male has grown to 67 years today from 47 years in 1960.
But Dr. Kruse calls sanitation a major piece of unfinished business in village life, a villainous circumstance without a clear villain.
"The problem with water and sewer is that there's nothing that could be called a moderate-price fix," Dr. Kruse said. "We either have to spend a fortune or accept third world living conditions."
The costs are driven by climate and isolation. Permafrost keeps the ground frozen year-round in some villages and a high water table and poor soils also make underground piping impractical. So the pipes must run above ground, wrapped in thick insulation and heated by wires. With snow usually on the ground for nine months a year, the building season is short. And supplies must be shipped by plane or barge.
Most of the teachers say they could not live under the conditions their students endure.
"If I didn't have sewerage and water, I'd be gone," said Richard Nathan, a white teacher who has taught in Kotlik for 14 years.
It is hard for people accustomed to modern plumbing to understand what living without it can mean. Several years ago, Mr. Nathan's high school class sent a letter to every member of Congress, to the President and to other political leaders. "We are living in conditions that are as bad or worse than many of the migrant labor camps of the 60's," they wrote. No one answered.
Last year, Rita Okitkun, 15 years old, traveled to Washington as part of a student tour and met with members of the state's Congressional delegation. She said her plea for modern sanitation fell on deaf ears. "We don't mean nothing because we're just these Yupik people out in the middle of nowhere," she said.
State officials say the situation in Kotlik is not unusual. "There are places more primitive than Kotlik, if you can believe that," said Keith Kelton, director of facilities construction at the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
The Anchorage Daily News recently estimated that state and Federal programs have already spent $1.3 billion to modernize sanitation in the villages, which are home to about 45,000 Alaskan natives.
The Federal Government estimates it would cost another $1 billion to put modern plumbing in every village. But the state, strapped by declining oil revenues, spends only about $25 million a year to upgrade systems, and various Federal programs contribute approximately $40 million more.
And construction is just the beginning, since maintenance ussually runs about $100 per month per household, which few village families can afford. Plus the systems require a technical expertise that many villages lack. Stories of squandered sanitation money abound in rural Alaska. In Mountain Village, for instance, a $2 million water system froze in the first winter, bringing a $750,000 repair bill, Dr. Kruse said.
 
Lack of Expertise
 In Kotlik, Joseph Mike, the utilities manager, is the first to announce his modest qualifications for monitoring the single public well that provides the village's drinking water. "I didn't even finish the sixth grade," he said apologetically.
A notice from state officials posted near Mr. Mike's office warns that the town water "may be contaminated" and urges residents to boil it. But Mr. Mike was paying it no more attention than anyone else. "I don't know -- too much chlorine or something," he said, when asked about the warning.
The dangers of malfunctioning systems were tragically illustrated this summer in Hooper Bay, which appears to have produced the nation's first death from a fluoride overdose in drinking water. The exact causes of the poisoning are being sorted out in a $3 million lawsuit by the victim's family. But it appears that both faulty equipment and untrained operators were to blame.
The mechanical problem was a broken pump that sent the well's fluoride to a level 40 times the Federal limit. But a report by the state epidemiologist states that health officials in Bethel had spotted the rising fluoride level three weeks earlier and had ordered the well shut down, apparently to no avail.
The report makes a point of noting that the well operator had no formal training and that the village had had no government administrator for the previous year.
 
Speedway of Contamination
 Kotlik, like much of rural Alaska, muddles along with what is delicately known as the honey-bucket system. Residents use five-gallon buckets lined with plastic bags and topped with a toilet seat. The bags are then tied, lifted and carried to one of the 27 large vats that Mr. Uisok hauls to a lined lagoon.
A central washing complex provides treated water, which many residents haul home in barrels, though others, recoiling from the chlorine, prefer rain water. The complex also contains a $2.50 sauna, 75-cent showers and a couple of public toilets that empty into the teachers' lagoon.
The problem with sewage buckets and water barrels is that they combine to form a speedway of contamination, whisking disease from one household to another. Buckets slop. Bags break. Children track waste across floors, furniture, counters and utensils. Dirty hands get dipped in water barrels. And once a barrel is contaminated, it stays that way.
During the boil outbreak in 1985, Federal investigators came all the way from Atlanta, to try to isolate the site of infection. "But the germ was everywhere they looked -- in the sauna, in people's bedding, in their noses," Dr. Kruse said.
Diarrhea and impetigo are chronic, with the table always set for something more serious. In June 1990, residents were still emptying their honey buckets into wooden bunkers, which overflowed with the spring thaw. Suddenly one person after another succumbed to violent headaches, vomiting and high fevers.
 
A Harsh Job
 Forty-nine people were flown to the hospital in Bethel, where they were found to have viral meningitis, and Dr. Kruse said dozens more had the symptoms and stayed in Kotlik. State officials geared up for 1,500 cases, but an informal quarantine halted the spread.
After the outbreak, Kotlik got a $50,000 Federal grant to switch from bunkers to the 27 plastic vats that line the wooden walkways, awaiting Mr. Uisok. He pulls them onto a trailer, drives an all-terrain vehicle to the edge of town and backs to the edge of a lined lagoon. He removes the lids, takes aim and tilts. The plastic bags splash out with frightening imprecision.
"I threw up when I first started," Mr. Uisok said.
The job is so messy that Mr. Uisok wears a rain suit. His daily path can be tracked by a trail of decontaminating lime, which marks his mishaps like so much fingerprinting dust. Despite temperatures that can reach 10 degrees below, he prefers to work in winter, he said, when his haul "pops out like an icicle."
It is not duty that drives Mr. Uisok, who is 24 years old, but economic necessity. He moved to Kotlik from a neighboring village when he got married, and he now has four children. He said there are no other jobs in town.
Behind his back, the villagers call Mr. Uisok the "anuk man," employing a unflattering Yupik term for sewage. Mr. Uisok insists he is worth more than the $10 an hour he gets, and he resents having to pay for the daily sauna and shower he takes after work.
But Kotlik recently rejected a proposed sales-tax increase, by a vote of 55 to 21. So the village must rely on donations from charity bingo games, held four times a week, to meet Mr. Uisok's current wage.
 A caption with a picture accompanying the article in some editions, showing children playing in a flooded street, misidentified the town shown. It was Bethel, not Kotlik.

 MATTI GOLAN, a former editor at two Israeli newspapers, wastes no time shooting his target between the eyes: American Jews, he says right away in "With Friends Like You," are more of an enemy to Israel than Yassir Arafat.
How's that again?
No, Mr. Golan says, he is not in rhetorical overdrive. At least with Mr. Arafat he knows where he stands. Not so with American Jewry -- "my enemy brother."
As far as he is concerned, Jews in the United States undermine his country insidiously, most of all by refusing to emigrate to Israel, thereby depriving it of energy and know-how that it sorely needs. The fact is, Mr. Golan argues, Israelis and American Jews are separate peoples who happen to share a religion but whose relationship is based on bad faith and hypocrisy. How can they be real partners, he asks bitterly, when one of them sends 18-year-olds off to college while the other waves goodbye, perhaps forever, to sons setting off for military duty in Gaza?
Ably translated by Hillel Halkin, this slender volume, which could have been even more slender with tighter editing, is hardly the first indictment by an Israeli of American Jews. But its attacks are so unsparing -- and often so uncomfortably on the mark -- that there will be squirming in the chairs at Hadassah chapters all across the United States. Maybe that is good. Mr. Golan gets a few things off his chest that should be heard, even if they are sometimes overstated.
His technique is an imaginary conversation between two middle-aged Jews, an Israeli named Israel and an American named Judah. Israel, being an Israeli, swiftly dispenses with the notion that they like each other. "I get on your nerves," he tells Judah. "Honestly, isn't that what you say about me when you're alone with your friends? That I'm arrogant? Aggressive? Loudmouthed?"
As for the American, Israel complains, he thinks that writing a fat check to the United Jewish Appeal somehow gives him the right to tell Israelis how to run their affairs. Sure, Judah says he only has Israel's best interests at heart. But his own interests matter even more. What he really craves is a country that makes him look better to gentiles: oh, for the Jewish Camelot of six-day wars and Entebbe raids, not this place worn down by an endless Palestinian uprising and horrible images of Israeli soldiers breaking the bones of Arab children.
Actually, the bloom slipped off the Israeli rose for American Jews well before the intifada, Israel says. It started with the 1973 war, when the Jewish state's vaunted heroes were caught flat-footed. Then Arabs sent oil prices soaring. Global terrorism and other dislocations became ways of life. In no time, he maintains, an unflinchingly pro-Israel stand fell out of fashion.
But what about the hundreds of millions of dollars that American Jews give each year to Israel? Big deal, Israel shrugs.
For starters, the money amounts to an insurance premium, paid by overseas Jews who look upon Israel mostly as a potential haven should the Cossacks turn up at the door again. Besides, Israel argues, the sums are not all that vast. Much of the cash goes to Jewish institutions in the United States, with the state of Israel (and sometimes even the Holocaust) used by fund-raisers as a hook. It is a lot easier, after all, to get a donation from someone who thinks he is helping the embattled Jewish state, not buying bedpans for the local hospital.
"You've made us your clowns, your vaudeville act," Israel rails. And the worst part is that the Israelis themselves have become willing accomplices, performing handstands to milk the American "money machine" and to win expense-paid fund-raising trips to the United States so that they can briefly escape daily lunacies back home.
Some readers will dismiss Mr. Golan as an over-the-top crank. Indeed, he is not always fair: he gives the back of his hand, for example, to Jewish lobbyists who help assure the United States military and economic aid -- $3 billion every year -- on which Israel is hopelessly hooked.
But the author responds that the lobbying would be superfluous if American Jews would only emigrate to Israel in waves instead of rivulets. Israel would be so strengthened, he says, that it would not need all that help from Washington. As a bonus, he argues, emigration might even rescue American Judaism, which is threatened not by anti-Semitism but by a rampant secularism that has produced a menacing intermarriage rate of 50 percent.
The way things are going, Mr. Golan's Israel warns, "I am now too tired and weak to preserve Israel and you are too comfortable and well padded to be able to preserve your Judaism." It does not sound as though he expects much to improve soon.

 BODY:
During the flu epidemic of 1918, according to medical lore, victims were struck down almost in midstride. Four women in a bridge group played cards together until 11 o'clock in the evening. By the next morning three of them were dead. One man got on a streetcar feeling well enough to go to work, rode six blocks and died. During the single month of October, influenza killed 196,000 people in this country -- more than twice as many as would die of AIDS during the first 10 years of that epidemic. By the end of the winter of 1918-19, two billion people around the world had come down with influenza, and between 20 million and 40 million had died.
The flu outbreak of 1918 was "the most devastating epidemic that we have ever had in history," says John R. La Montagne, chief of infectious diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. "And it happened in this century. No one really knows why it occurred, but there's every expectation that if it occurred once, it can occur again." The 1918 influenza pandemic killed as many people in a single year as died in the four-year Black Death, the bubonic plague that ravaged Europe from 1347 to 1351. 
 We like to believe such plunder is an ancient relic; whatever was killing people so ruthlessly in 1918 must be something we can treat by now. Modern medicine has given us an influenza vaccine, an anti-influenza drug (amantadine) and plenty of antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections. But in the face of a virus that kills so rapidly, all the antiviral drugs in the physician's armamentarium would be impotent. If a strain similar to the 1918 variant were to emerge today -- a strain that, last time around, killed literally overnight -- some experts believe that even modern medicine would be helpless to prevent many related deaths.
THE EXISTENCE OF the influenza vaccine -- not to mention that pervasive phrase "just the flu," conveying as it does a certain harmless inevitability -- may give us a sense of false security when it comes to the possibility of a pandemic outbreak of influenza. (A pandemic is an international epidemic, with disease occurring at a higher-than-expected rate on several continents at once.) In fact, the flu vaccine must be reformulated each year to keep pace with the newest variants of this fast-mutating virus, and in the case of an unanticipated outbreak it would take so long to manufacture and distribute an appropriate vaccine that thousands might die waiting.
More stable viruses, like smallpox and polio, are relatively easy to control with an effective one-time vaccine. Not influenza. Because the virus mutates so frequently, the flu vaccine must be concocted anew each year, based on scientists' best guess of what surface proteins will determine the nature of the next season's outbreak. Once they forecast the probable composition of the virus, scientists choose the appropriate antigens to make their vaccine. They must know by mid-February of any year which antigens to include in the following winter's formulations, if they hope to insure production of adequate amounts of vaccine for delivery by the start of the flu season in December.
In developing a flu vaccine, researchers have managed (so far) to outsmart their foe. They have succeeded by turning the virus's own best weapon against it. Unlike almost all other emerging viruses -- viruses, like the one that causes AIDS, that turn up in a new species or in a new geographic location (box, page 55) -- the influenza virus has mastered and become dependent on just one terrific trick: the speed with which it evolves. The laboratory strains developed for the influenza vaccine, the ones that can stop an epidemic in its tracks, have capitalized on the virus's notorious ability to recombine. But it is this very trait that makes any vaccine against this fast-mutating virus so frustratingly short-lived.
The recipe for making the flu vaccine is simple. Take the current year's variant of the influenza virus, throw it into a stew with a strain of virus that leads to rapid proliferation (a strain known as PR-8) and let the virus do what it does best: incorporate the fast-growing strain into its own genes and start replicating it. From there, it's an easy matter to take those plentiful viruses and attenuate them for a flu vaccine.
But the scientists who must determine what virus will cause the next year's illness run a high chance of being wrong. Some observers have put the odds of success at no better than 50-50. Even when they are right, the vaccine lasts only as long as that year's strain. By the next flu season, the fickle virus is almost certain to be wearing a new protein coat, a disguise sufficient to slip right past whatever antibodies were formed in response to the previous year's shot.
BECAUSE MUTATION IS SUCH A crucial factor in the virus's reproductive strategy, any discussion of influenza must include a discussion of how the virus itself changes from one strain to the next. The mutations that lead to major changes in viral surface antigens -- changes that create the pandemic strains of influenza -- are quite rare. Pandemic strains have occurred just three times in this century: in 1918, the year of the so-called Spanish flu; in 1957, when a new strain called the Asian flu emerged, and in 1968, when a third strain was introduced, known as the Hong Kong flu.
Compared with the Spanish flu pandemic, the more recent outbreaks were extraordinarily mild. When the Asian flu first emerged, the attack rate was the expected 25 percent, but the mortality rate was relatively low; about 70,000 Americans died. With the Hong Kong flu, there were just 28,000 deaths. This lower mortality rate could be traced to the fact that of the two major antigens on the virus's surface, the Asian flu and Hong Kong flu differed in only one. This meant that most people had at least partial immunity to the new 1968 virus, which might have tempered its effects.
The explanation for the influenza virus's mutability lies in the arrangement of its genes. Because its genetic material is packaged in the form of RNA -- rather than the more common DNA, which converts to RNA before reproducing, allowing for an intermediate "proofreading" step -- random mutations during replication are relatively common and are passed on intact to the virus's offspring. This kind of random mutation, which occurs during gene replication, is much more common among RNA viruses than scientists once believed. John J. Holland of the University of California at San Diego recently calculated that mutation in the flu virus occurs at a million times the rate at which mutation occurs in human beings. At this rate, Holland concluded, it takes just 12 to 15 weeks to change a flu virus's genetic arrangement by a significant degree.
The new form of the virus differs in ways that may be minor, but it nevertheless renders ineffective the antibodies formed in response to an old influenza infection. It is as though the virus took off its purple coat and put on a red one of the same cut and cloth; the body can recognize the new virus as familiar, but the differences mean that its antipurple techniques will no longer quite be enough. This change is known as antigenic drift.
Thus someone who receives a flu shot in 1992 will have little immunological memory for the slightly changed influenza virus encountered in 1994. (Natural immunity, the result of an actual bout of influenza, produces a more robust antibody response, which usually lasts longer than vaccine-induced immunity, although it, too, is finite.)
In the vast majority of mutations, there is no functional effect on the influenza virus itself. Either the new mutant virus continues producing its proteins unimpaired -- and therefore responds to the same antibodies as its parent -- or it dies. But sometimes, probably as rarely as 1 percent of the time, the new influenza virus survives, is antigenically unique and is still capable of infecting human cells. As this virus multiplies, it has the potential to become the following year's strain of flu virus.
More significant is another kind of antigenic change that also occurs as a result of the virus's genetic structure. The flu virus has what is known as a segmented genome, a weakly bound string of genes with clefts between each of eight segments. Each viral gene is responsible for the manufacture of one or two distinct viral proteins. The segments are physically connected, but only loosely so; they easily come apart and rearrange with other viral segments if different influenza viruses are nearby. The insertion of new segments from different viruses, especially from viruses of animal (rather than human) origin, leads to the process of genetic "reassortment."
The resulting "reassortants," if they involve genes that code for proteins in the virus's surface antigens, can lead to major changes in the influenza virus's configuration -- a process that is known as antigenic shift. Antigenic shift goes far beyond antigenic drift. Instead of replacing a purple coat with a similar red one, it is more like putting on a white tunic, green scarf and spangly orange cloak.
For genetic reassortment to occur, a cell must be simultaneously infected with more than one influenza virus of more than one animal strain. Such co-infection does not readily occur in human beings, even though they are susceptible to swine as well as to human influenza, but it happens often in what are known as the reservoir animals. These animals, primarily ducks and other birds and swine, can be infected with influenza from any source -- human, avian or mammalian -- without getting sick.
Inside a reservoir animal's intestines, viruses flutter about as though they are in the hands of a master card shuffler, moving places randomly and falling back in line in random new combinations. Fortunately for us, though genetic reassortment itself happens frequently, the creation of a new reassortant capable of infecting human beings is quite rare. But when such a human-infecting reassortant does emerge -- part human, part bird or pig -- the potential for a new influenza pandemic has arrived.
OF ALL THE RESHUFFLING OF gene segments that goes on in the guts of pigs or ducks, only once in every 10 to 40 years does a new virus emerge that can rage through a human population. Most reassortants are not viable, but a hybrid virus that is viable (and is capable of infecting a human cell) is so radically different from any previous influenza virus that it can infect large populations quickly and cause serious complications.
Pandemic influenza has historically originated in China -- even the misnamed Spanish flu of 1918 had Asian origins -- primarily because the country has so many ducks. Wild ducks are the predominant reservoir for influenza. Waterfowl are welcome in China; they prey on many of the pests that would otherwise plague rice crops. Indeed, by some estimates, China has more ducks than it has people. On Chinese farms, ducks live close to people and close to many of the other farm animals that are also influenza reservoirs; the ducks are as likely to be infected with human influenza as with avian. These co-infections provide the ideal medium for genetic reassortment. More trouble erupts on farms where ducks and chickens are raised in proximity to pigs, another common practice in China. A pig that is co-infected with influenza from different species can serve as a mixing vessel for the creation of entirely new strains.
"This is startling information," says Stephen S. Morse, an assistant professor of virology at the Rockefeller University in New York. Morse helped popularize the notion that integrated pig-duck farming is responsible for the reassortment of new pandemic influenza strains by inviting one of the theory's leading proponents, Robert G. Webster of the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, to speak at a 1989 conference he organized on the subject of emerging viruses. "Influenza has always been described as the classic example of viral evolution at work, and scientists have long believed that new epidemics are caused by mutations in the virus," Morse says. "Although this may be true of the smaller annual or biennial epidemics we frequently experience, it is apparently not true of the influenza viruses that cause pandemics." What makes it so startling, in other words, is that it postulates that influenza, long thought to be the most dramatic example of random mutation in all of virology, is as subject to the actions of human beings as any other virus.
Ducks have other habits, besides a tendency toward co-infection, that also make them the primary source of pandemic influenza strains. They are perfectly suited to spreading the reassortants around. During their seasonal migrations, ducks can fly enormous distances, spreading their contaminated feces across large expanses of countryside. And they take in water not only by mouth but also through the cloaca, so that as they swim they are simultaneously drinking and ingesting pond water tainted with their own or other ducks' virus-filled excrement and excreting more virus into the water. "If you could eliminate all the horses, swine and ducks in the world, you could eliminate pandemic influenza," says Edwin D. Kilbourne, professor of microbiology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and a national authority on influenza.
The adoption of certain new farming techniques in the developing world increases the odds that another such strain will soon emerge. Pigs, ducks and chickens live side by side on many Asian farms, especially those engaged in fish farming. Widely promoted as an energy-efficient way to generate high yields of protein foods, fish farming involves feeding hen feces to pigs and fertilizing fish ponds -- where ducks also swim and drink -- with fresh pig manure. Some virologists, especially in Europe, worry about the prime opportunities for genetic reassortment that this agricultural method provides. As scientists from Wales and Germany recently wrote about fish farming, the result may well be the creation of "a considerable potential human health hazard" by bringing together the two reservoirs of influenza viruses. (Eating the fish is not thought to be a flu hazard, since fish are not reservoirs for human influenza virus.)
FOR A SHORT WHILE, influenza researchers believed that pandemics occurred every 11 years. This theory -- developed in the late 1970's when it looked as though the next pandemic, in the form of swine flu, was on its way -- was based on a cycle of three large-scale outbreaks: 1946, 1957 and 1968. Only now do we realize, in retrospect, that the 1946 outbreak represented not a totally new antigenic shift, but a higher-than-expected incidence of an old influenza.
Though the 11-year truism has gripped the public imagination and captured the fancy of a few scientists as well, "it's misinterpretation of old data, generated before the origins of epidemics became clear, or before sequence analysis on the virus genome was possible," says Brian Murphy, chief of the respiratory virus laboratory at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
We now know, thanks to sequence analysis, that the 1946 virus was the same strain that had been in existence since 1918 -- a strain called H1N1. The H stands for hemagglutinin, the N for neuraminidase; these are the two antigens of the influenza virus. It is against them that antibodies are formed during a primary infection.
Just as the 1946 virus was the same H1N1 type that caused the 1918 epidemic, so also, it turns out, was the so-called Russian flu of 1977. When the virus from that year's outbreak was examined genetically, not only did it prove to be another H1N1 variety, but it also was genetically identical to a type of influenza virus that had last been seen in the early 1950's, more than 25 years before. "You can anticipate certain rates of change in each gene per year, even if the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase stay the same," Murphy says. "But this virus looked as if it was in a genetically frozen state."
Many virologists now believe that it was literally just that: an influenza virus from the 1950's, stored in a laboratory freezer at a research facility in China, somehow got released into the environment in 1977. The accidentally unfrozen virus has since continued to circulate and to alter its genome gradually from year to year, the way it would be expected to. Now two different influenza types coexist: one dating from the 1977 Russian flu epidemic (type H1N1) and the other from the 1968 Hong Kong flu epidemic (type H3N2). Some years one predominates, some years the other does.
Only three hemagglutinin types and three neuraminidase types seem to be capable of infecting human beings. (These are hemagglutinin types H1, H2 and H3, and neuraminidase types N1, N2 and N8.) But there are many other antigen types circulating, a total of 14 H types and nine N types; most of them are limited to avian or swine influenza. Recent research has indicated, though, that at least one antigen previously thought unable to infect humans -- hemagglutinin type 7 -- can infect monkey cells in the laboratory. This raises the possibility that more antigens than we realize may be capable of causing pandemic influenza. The only reason we have not seen it happen is that the right reassortant has not yet emerged.
While the 11-year cycle may be a myth, there are good grounds for suspecting that influenza does emerge in a cycle of some kind -- one that suggests that the next pandemic may be caused by an H1 surface antigen. The three H types that infect human beings seem to take turns, in order, as the pandemic strains change. H1 seems always to beget H2, H2 to beget H3, H3 to beget H1 again. It seems to work this way even retrospectively, when scientists try to extrapolate, from the blood of older individuals, what type of antigens were responsible for pre-1918 pandemics. In the mid-1970's, researchers analyzed the antibodies still circulating in the bloodstreams of very old people who had been exposed to influenza pandemics in the late 19th century. They found that people in their 90's still had antibodies to H2N2 -- the probable cause of a pandemic from the mid-1800's -- and those in their 70's and 80's had antibodies to a different variety -- H3N2, the probable cause of the pandemic of 1890. (Another clue about the strain responsible for earlier epidemics was the fact that in 1968, when the H3N2 Hong Kong flu emerged, people over age 78 -- who had been children during the 1890 pandemic -- had lower mortality and morbidity rates than people who were 10 or 15 years younger.) If the H types really do cycle in this way, the next one in line to emerge is type H1.
In evaluating the mutability of the influenza virus, it seems logical, almost inevitable, to wonder why it mutates as often as it does. But another question, just as pertinent, would be this: Why do pandemic strains arise so rarely? The big antigenic shifts, after all, are not that common; 40 years passed between the Spanish flu and the 1957 Asian flu, and more than 20 years have passed since the H3N2 Hong Kong strain emerged in 1968. It is probably a lucky stroke for people that new influenza chimeras are highly vulnerable to die off when they hit the atmosphere. Otherwise, every time a new influenza recombinant emerged from the guts of ducks, we might have trouble indeed.
INFLUENZA experts thought they saw big-league trouble coming in February 1976, when a few cases of severe swine flu broke out among young military recruits in Fort Dix, N.J. One of them, Pvt. David Lewis, 19, died. Of 19 patients whose specimens were sent to the Centers for Disease Control for virus typing, Lewis and four others were shown to be infected with the same H1N1 influenza virus as was responsible for the 1918 pandemic. This got many public-health officials into gear, hoping to use modern technology, namely vaccination, to head off a disaster of the magnitude of 1918.
The large-scale effort to manufacture and distribute enough vaccine for everyone in the country showed that millions of doses of high-quality vaccine could be made in a matter of three or four months. But the swine-flu pandemic never materialized. In retrospect, some critics now say 40 million Americans were vaccinated for nothing. In fact, the only real illness to result from the swine flu adventure was caused by the vaccine: about one thousand people developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, a serious paralytic disease that could be traced directly to an immunological response to the inoculation. Still, Edwin Kilbourne -- an early and consistent advocate of mass immunization -- says that, based on what was known at the time, the Government acted rationally and prudently. Scientists thought they had encountered the same influenza strain that caused the devastation of 1918, and they thought they had a tool available to help avert hundreds of thousands of deaths. "Better a vaccine without an epidemic," Kilbourne says today, "than an epidemic without a vaccine."
In hindsight, those involved in the decision-making realize that major variants of influenza virus in a few individuals do not necessarily signal the start of a new pandemic. Some variants prove easily transmitted; most, like the Fort Dix strain, will die out after a few passages through human hosts. "Early detection of a new virus therefore may not be adequate evidence on which to undertake mass immunization," Kilbourne wrote in a 1979 article called "Swine Flu: The Virus That Vanished." "But it is, I believe, a signal at least to produce vaccine to hold in readiness."
The swine-flu experience may have uncovered a hidden hazard of surveillance: by looking too hard, you might actually turn up something that you cannot interpret. When influenza broke out at Fort Dix, an aggressive young public-health director, a man trained by Kilbourne, was called in to identify the responsible strain. He had learned his lessons well: even after he examined the first several samples of respiratory tract washings and found nothing but the expected H3N2 virus, he continued to look at more. "If he had not got 18 or 19 throat washings, if he had stopped at 2 or 3, then on a probability basis he would have decided the epidemic was caused by H3N2 influenza, and nothing would have happened," says Kilbourne now. "No action would have been taken, because no threat would have been perceived."
Such active surveillance continues to this day. The C.D.C. recruits 160 internists around the country every year as "sentinel physicians"; they send a weekly postcard to the headquarters in Atlanta to let Government officials know how many patients nationwide are complaining of flulike symptoms. A subset of these doctors also sends sputum samples to a central Government laboratory, which types the influenza virus and phones in the results to the C.D.C. More elaborate scouting has involved annual expeditions to the countryside of China at the start of every Chinese flu season. Because influenza strains usually emerge from China, these expeditions have often paid off. In late 1987, for instance, a C.D.C. trip to China yielded samples of a new influenza strain cultured at the Shanghai Hygiene and Anti-Epidemic Center. Antigens from that strain, named A/Shanghai/11/87, were incorporated into the American vaccine administered in 1988.
LONG A SUBJECT of intensive, worldwide surveillance, influenza could offer a blueprint for how other such systems can stay one step ahead of a variety of emerging viruses. But the blueprint would come with a checkered history; with influenza, surveillance has been only of limited success. The virus changes so frequently, and so unpredictably, that the clear-cut clinical benefit of surveillance -- an accurate vaccine developed in a timely manner -- is often out of reach. "I am an optimist by nature, but I'm not too optimistic about what surveillance systems can do if they're trying to keep track of many viruses, especially new ones," says Kilbourne. "Influenza watchers, focused on only a single disease, are aware of the lag between discovery of change and implementation of control, and know that only the probability -- not the nature -- of change can be predicted. Surveillance for the unknown will be even more difficult and will demand a level of clinical and laboratory competence not widely available in the third world or, for that matter, anywhere else."
Thoughts about surveillance are the inevitable next step when virologists start asking themselves, "What can we do to stop it?" With very few antiviral drugs at their disposal, and with only a handful of vaccines, virologists must feel the way bacteriologists did a century ago: they know what causes human suffering, but they are relatively helpless to prevent it. The next wave in biology, the desired end result of analyzing how viruses emerge, will be characterized by the scientists fighting back.
The cyclical emergence of pandemic influenza offers the opportunity to implement some of the predictive, and possibly preventive, strategies that scientists want to use to head off more exotic viral threats. Influenza has characteristics of many other emerging viruses that make it amenable to "viral traffic control": animal reservoirs that can be monitored for signs of increasing infection; a vaccine that can be tailor-made and administered far more efficiently than it currently is; physicians in far-flung communities who can be enlisted to serve as bellwethers for new viruses, and close contact with public-health officials internationally -- especially, in this case, in China.
This is not simply a dress rehearsal for some bigger, more important disease; pandemic influenza will be, almost without a doubt, a major plague when it emerges, probably in the next several years. The nature of the surface antigens of the current predominant strain of influenza has not changed appreciably since 1968. If history is any guide, we can probably expect a major alteration of those antigens -- one big enough to lead to a worldwide outbreak of severe flu -- before the century turns.
 
 
 
VIRUSES IN UNEXPECTED PLACES
 FIRST THE CATTLE STARTED going wild and dying. A dairy farmer in southern England offered the earliest reports, in 1986, of cows exhibiting weird behavior: agitation, fearfulness, aggression and eventually the inability to stand. Within months, it became clear that some infection was ravaging the herds of Great Britain and threatening the safety of the nation's meat supply.
But what truly captured the attention of the British people -- even more than the eventual loss of thousands of cattle to infection or slaughter -- was the death in Bristol of a Siamese cat in the spring of 1990; soon two more cat deaths were confirmed. Before they died, the cats had gone crazy just the way the cows had. They became aggressive or extremely withdrawn, highly agitated or abnormally limp. Here was a disease with no respect for species boundaries. Could human cases be far behind?
By the time the cats died, the London tabloids were proclaiming "mad cow disease" the next great scourge. Hysteria notwithstanding, that prophecy has turned out to have a ring of truth. At last count, more than five years after the disease was first detected, it had led to the death of tens of thousands of cattle. And it had spread not only to cats but also to antelopes, an Arabian oryx and other residents of the London Zoo. So far, no cases have been reported in humans.
The disorder is thought to be caused by a strange "slow" virus, one that grows unnoticed in the nervous system for years. Ominously, the virus persists in the environment too. An American scientist who buried a pot of virus-laden soil in his backyard in Maryland recently dug it up after three years -- and found that the virus was still infectious.
Mad-cow disease is an example of the ways in which human actions -- in this case, a single change in a manufacturing process that changed the purity of cattle feed -- can create breeding grounds for new viruses. The pattern occurs again and again in the development of what are now known as "emerging viruses," of which the most notorious is the one that causes AIDS.
Viral emergence was until recently thought to be a rare event and one that could be accounted for by mutations -- bizarre, totally unpredictable changes in a virus's genetic arrangement. But as scientists began to look systematically at how and why viruses emerge, they were surprised to find how rare it was that mutations were responsible. Much more important in terms of the emergence of new viruses was human behavior.
Every decision made anywhere in any sphere of life -- environmental, political, demographic, economic, military -- carries with it implications about disease that reverberate halfway around the world. When the Aswan High Dam was built in Egypt, the new body of still water allowed mosquitoes to thrive, and the viruses they carried became a new threat. When used tires were shipped from Japan to Texas, mosquitoes hitched a ride in the wet rims; because the mosquitoes carry viruses never before seen by Texans, their presence was a new threat to public health. And when the city borders of Seoul were pushed farther into the countryside, urban Koreans were exposed to a virus that rats had been carrying for centuries -- and many contracted a raging hemorrhagic fever that kills at least 10 percent of its victims.
In the 1960's and 1970's, neither public-health officials nor scientists realized that "progress" could have such consequences. With a hubris worthy of the best Greek tragedy, Westerners thought they were nearly invincible, at least as far as infectious disease was concerned. They thought they could interfere with ecosystems, and ship goods and people around the world, with little regard for the effect not only on the balance of nature, but also on their own health.
Scientists at the time tended to see infectious diseases as a series of problems to conquer, ticking off victories like notches on a gun belt. Through science, we had conquered polio, eliminated smallpox, created vaccines for most childhood diseases, and devised "miracle drugs" -- antibiotics -- for whatever infections managed to slip through the vaccine safety net. "The war against diseases has been won," declared the United States surgeon general, William H. Stewart, in 1969. And Sir F. Macfarlane Burnet, the Australian virologist who shared a Nobel Prize for his hypothesis of acquired immunological tolerance -- which paved the way for organ transplantation -- offered a similar notion in the introduction to his textbook's third edition. Remarking on how much had changed since the original version of "Natural History of Infectious Disease" was published more than 20 years earlier, Burnet wrote in 1962 that the late 20th century would be witness to "the virtual elimination of infectious disease as a significant factor in social life." To write about infectious disease, he said, "is almost to write of something that has passed into history."
AIDS offered the most obvious proof that victory over infectious disease had been declared prematurely. The minuscule human immunodeficiency virus, made of little more than a few strands of pure genetic material, showed us just how mortal we are. It showed us how difficult it is to anticipate new pathogens before they already have us in their grip. And it showed us -- in one more frontal assault on our collective hubris -- that in the natural order of things, we human beings seem to be quite tangential.
The AIDS virus has managed to persist and thrive, multiplying today in an estimated 10 million people around the world, despite the fact that it eventually kills a huge percentage of its human hosts. Its lethality is of no consequence to the virus, as long as it infects a new host before its old host dies -- something that is all but assured by the virus's long latent period of 10 years or more. Viewed this way, as a host species that helps in the perpetuation of a parasite organism, human beings begin to look like little more than, as a British biologist puts it, "colonies of viruses."
Richard M. Krause has been preaching this gospel for more than two decades. And preaching is the apt term; with his Ohio twang and slicked-back white hair, Krause looks and sounds like a Midwestern evangelist. But for many years, even though he spoke from positions of authority -- including, for eight of those years, as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a branch of the National Institutes of Health -- Krause found his audiences either skeptical or uninterested. It took the tragedy of AIDS to get folks to listen.
"A major dislocation in the social structure -- love, hate, peace, war, urbanization, overpopulation, economic depression, people having so much leisure they sleep with five different people a night -- whatever it is that puts a stress on the ecological system, can alter the equilibrium between man and microbes," Krause says. "Such great dislocations can lead to plagues and epidemics, more often than not caused by microbes that already reside right on our doorstep."

HEADLINE: FOOD;
Deeper Dish

BYLINE: By Molly O'Neill

 BODY:
FOR YEARS IT HAS BEEN impossible to utter the word "casserole" in polite company. It evokes tuna and noodles, macaroni and cheese, green beans and cream of mushroom soup -- all gooey and bound in perpetuity. Underneath these culinary cliches lurks the good mother of the 50's. The one who sought to be thrifty, efficient and creative in her nurturing, the one who wound up locked in Ozzie and Harriet land, unable to move past the canvas of a Corning Ware dish, the palette of a can of Campbell's soup, the mushy dominion of which she was queen.
"I hate casseroles," announced a 7-year-old at a family dinner several years ago, training beams of hatred toward the grandmother who had created a quaint collage of ground beef, red beans and rice. The health fanatics at the table zealously fell on the subject of girth and fat in casseroles. The epicures delivered sniffs and sneers. The grandmother looked as crushed as the layer of Fritos that topped her creative casserole. 
 "It's good for you," she said. Her tone wasn't convincing, but the casserole disappeared anyway. The standard bake-and-serve meal may be dowdy and nutritionally incorrect, but it remains as irresistible as a mother who will never understand, but keeps trying.
Besides, going back to the origin of casseroles, it's easy to reclaim the integrity and simplicity of the dish.
The American Heritage Dictionary defines "casserole" as 1.a. "a dish, usually of earthenware, glass or cast iron, in which food is both baked and served" and b. "food prepared and served in such a dish." Therein lies the pathos of the modern casserole: the culinary concept began as much more than a container and the food it held, but somehow it became limited to that. Putting a casserole in the center of your table became tantamount to putting fuzzy dice on your rear-view mirror.
The original word, after all, was derived from the French term for saucepan, which itself had been derived from the Old Provencal word "cassa" and the medieval Latin "cattia," both of which meant ladle, and seemed to connote a common pot into which everyone dipped. The notion blossomed into French cassoulets and Italian lasagnas, Spanish paellas and potpies from the British Isles, all humble dishes, but dishes of the heart.
"Inspired by immigrant Italians, Greeks, Mexicans and Hungarians," wrote Richard J. Hooker in "Food and Drink in America," (Bobbs-Merrill, 1981), the New World seized casseroles in the late 19th century. "As economical dishes, casseroles were welcomed during the depression of the 1890's, the scarcities of World War I, the inflation that followed, and the Great Depression of the 1930's," wrote Hooker.
Smaller home kitchens, less domestic help, lightweight, affordable oven-weight dishes and canned foods all contributed to the rise of the casserole in America. The dish was a collage of leftovers and convenience products, a lightning rod for a mother's creativity. Twenty percent of the finalists of the 35 Pillsbury Bake-Offs held since 1949 have been casseroles; only dessert outstrips the casserole category.
Community cookbooks generally give the dishes their very own chapter. Casseroles have such mass appeal that the Campbell Soup Company, itself the creator of the most popular casserole adhesive (cream of mushroom soup), emphasizes through a company spokeswoman that cream of chicken, celery, broccoli and cheddar cheese soups also have great casserole potential, and recently issued "Campbell's Fabulous One-Dish Recipes," a booklet to inspire the casserole maker in us all.
But casseroles remain as ridiculed as they are easy to make and comforting to eat. In "The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste," Jane and Michael Stern wrote: "Anchoring the low end of the culinary hierarchy, with no hope of upward mobility, is the tuna casserole, a dish of such unmitigated cloddishness that no one concerned about his reputation as an epicure would dare admit to eating it."
And yet who can resist the urge to combine the leavings of a holiday meal into one simple dish? Who escapes the hankering for something humble and soul-warming on the evenings at home during the big-party, big-eating season? Who ever tires of reclaiming a form that got lost and misunderstood? Thriftiness and convenience went slightly awry in the modern kitchen, but the casserole form offers more than its limited 50's function. By updating its content, the casserole can become as healthful and compelling as the classic one-pot dishes that make epicures' hearts go pitter-patter. Something that everyone around a table can dip into, a rare shared reality, the function that form forgot in the land of Ozzie and Harriet.
 
WILD MUSHROOM LASAGNA
 
 3 ounces dried cepes
 2 quarts water
 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
 2 onions, peeled and minced
 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
 1 pound fresh cepes or shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and coarsely chopped
 1 pound fresh domestic mushrooms, stemmed and coarsely chopped
 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves
 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste
 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, plus more to taste
 2 cups part-skim-milk ricotta
 1 tablespoon minced fresh sage leaves
 12 lasagna noodles, parboiled
 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan.
1. Combine dried cepes and water in a saucepan. Simmer gently over medium heat until reduced to 4 cups, about 1 hour. Drain cepes, reserving liquid. Set aside 1 3/4 cups of the cepes broth. Place remaining broth in saucepan over medium-high heat and reduce to 1 cup. Coarsely chop drained cepes. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet. Add the onions and garlic and cook over medium-low heat until soft, about 7 minutes. Place half of the onions in a medium bowl and set aside.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of the unreduced cepes broth and half of the fresh mushrooms to the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high and saute until mushrooms release their liquid, about 6 minutes. Transfer mushroom mixture to a bowl. Repeat with 2 tablespoons broth and remaining mushrooms.
4. Add all mushrooms, including cepes, to the skillet. Stir in remaining unreduced cepes broth. Simmer 15 minutes. Stir in thyme, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir ricotta, sage and remaining salt into reserved onions. Brush the inside of a 12-by-7 1/2 baking dish with the remaining oil. Cover the bottom with a layer of lasagna noodles, trimming to fit as necessary. Spread half the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Cover with half of the mushroom mixture. Repeat the layers. Sprinkle the top with remaining Parmesan. Pour the reduced cepes broth over all. Cover with foil. Bake until tender, about 1 hour.
Yield: Six servings.

BYLINE: By Carrie Donovan

 BODY:
RALPH LAUREN CALLS HIS LOOK "bohemian." Perry Ellis's designer, Marc Jacobs, has been influenced by the disheveled "grunge" look fancied by hot Seattle rock groups. The rest of New York's garment industry seems universally smitten by a desire to loosen up.
As a result, next season's marketplace is flooded with soft, romantic, revealing and often quite unrealistic clothes. These breezy, ultrafeminine new fashions imply a radical change in the way women will dress for workaday life. Yet the intensity with which this new fashion attitude has taken hold -- even in such a tough economic climate -- shows that manufacturers think customers are ready for change. But are they? Most likely, women will ease a few of these softer pieces into their existing wardrobes. Still, when change is in the air, politically and socially, fashion reflects it. 
 Of all the American designers, Ralph Lauren is the one who got it most right. By stretching his natural instinct for deliciously feminine dresses, separates and accessories -- softening his tailored pants suits, nipping in jackets, narrowing shoulders, and widening slouchy pants -- Lauren captured the new mood while still producing wearable clothes.
DONNA KARAN'S collection was singular in its sophisticated yet languid look. Pants suits swayed with bell-bottom legs, and long, linear jackets seemed shoulderless. They had deep decolletes, weeping collars and floppy sleeves. Because Karan has done it, many women will be swept along with the look.
Isaac Mizrahi showed simultaneously zany and sensible clothes. There were the de rigeur floppy-legged pants suits, but also those softly tailored in synthetic fabrics that are pliable yet sharp. It was a great collection for women in transition from old style to new thinking.
Marc Jacobs for the Perry Ellis Company put together a zippy, witty, amusing show. Looking at the separate components hanging on the racks was even better. Each was a spiffy, well-done piece that could be worn separately or together to sum up the new look. Anna Sui's designs followed the same romantic hippie-crossed-with-grunge theme, but often seemed heavy-handed. Still, her little print "granny dresses" should be a smash with adventuresome young women and are the right price.
After absorbing the shock of the way Calvin Klein's models looked (matted hair with moist moon-pale makeup), it was impossible not to appreciate the beauty of his whisper-weight designs. They were layered to create a fragile yet powerful expression of the new feminine look.
Even dressmakers to the executive women of America, like Louis Dell'Olio of the Ann Klein Company, caught the new spirit. Dell'Olio layered smooth, close-fitting separates. They were mild and wearable versions of the new look. However, his crocheted Spider-Woman evening sheath requires a walk on the wild side -- like so much of this spring's fashion.

Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Transition

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
OUT WITH THE old! In with the new! That's the message we're getting from the American language about the Presidential succession.
What was the old word used to denote that awkward 11-week period between Election Day and Inauguration Day -- when the person serving as President is not re-elected? 
 Interregnum was the grand old word. It signified the interval between the reigns of kings when a country had no sovereign. It's true that interregnum didn't quite fit American government: we don't have a king, or in Latin, rex, and the old President does not leave office until a few minutes before the new one takes the inaugural oath. But most people were aware that, in the American context, it meant "the period between Presidencies."
Forget it. The new word is transition. Not strictly new -- Clark Clifford was said to have been in charge of the transition between the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations -- but never before given such official status. I'm not fighting the change; rooted in the Latin for "going over," transition is perfectly respectable, but someone should put in a moment's silent respect for interregnum, which after the Carter defeat was briefly known as the "interreaganum."
That's not the only noticeable linguistic change in Washington. Back in the Kennedy years, we had a foe: "Let the word go forth," the young President said at his inaugural, "to friend and foe alike." Those were the days when it was O.K. to acknowledge an enemy; indeed, Lyndon Johnson minced no words about the characterization of those ranged against the free world. Nixon speech writers, eschewing confrontation, preferred the word adversary, except when North Vietnamese intransigence caused the President to write in the harsh word enemy.
In his first formal statement as President-elect, Bill Clinton evoked the memory of John F. Kennedy and brought back the indeterminate foe: "I urge America's friends and foes alike to recognize, as I do, that America has only one President at a time." Covering all bases, as he seems eager to do, Governor Clinton followed up with the softer word: "The greatest mistake any adversary  could make would be to doubt America's resolve during this period of transition." (No interregnum.)
Now to the most striking vocabulary change of all. Remember the cocoon, that protective coating of Secret Service agents, granite-faced White House police, surrounding sycophants, chauffeurs who never stop for red lights and the aura of unapproachable power that separates the Man from the people who chose him?
Forget cocoon, unless you're collecting butterflies. The sometimes invisible but always palpable barrier is now called the bubble. "Will we see you in the streets of Washington a lot jogging?" a reporter asked the President-elect at his first post-election news conference, adding: "Are you frustrated by the bubble?" Mr. Clinton was not puzzled at the usage; he knew only too well what the bubble meant, and said he hoped to "maintain some greater level of ongoing personal contact with folks than is typically the case."
A few days before, Adam Nagourney in USA Today cited an earlier use of the word by the President-elect. "As long ago as August, Clinton was complaining about the barriers between a President and the public -- he called it 'the bubble.' And he has frequently talked with friends about how to burst out of that."
Ross Perot was fond of the metaphor, too, applying it to President Bush frequently. "Everybody out there except the White House knows the recession is here," he told the lively Larry King in late October, "and if you lived in that insulated bubble they've created for the President, you wouldn't know it either."
The transition from cocoon to bubble was noted in The Los Angeles Times by Kenneth Turan, its film critic, who described an air of unreality hanging over the Bush campaign due "in considerable part to the bubble-like, enviably efficient security cocoon the President must travel in to ensure his physical safety."
I suspect, though I have no citation handy to prove it, that the recent use of bubble in this sense was rooted in the name for the transparent shield used to protect Presidents riding in open cars; it was widely noted, for example, that President Kennedy had scorned the available plastic bubble before his fatal motorcade in Dallas in 1963.
The military picked up the figure of speech. "The trick is to spot the Backfires [bombers] before they get within missile shooting range," a naval officer was quoted as saying in Business Week in 1982, "and force them to come within a carrier fleet's protective 'bubble.' "
It has also been used in a slightly different sense by students of Edward Hall's studies in proxemics, more generally called "personal space." This is defined as "the zone around an individual into which other persons may not trespass." This self-imposed zone, Charles J. Holahan writes in "Environmental Psychology," "has been compared to a bubble surrounding the individual, creating an invisible boundary between the person and potential intruders." The person blowing the bubble of personal space around himself can vary its scope, depending on his hermithood or the relationship he has with different friends and family.
The most profound definition of its current political sense was offered by a Washington Post reporter, David Maraniss, on the last day of the 1992 campaign. "The bubble is what surrounds the traveling road show of any Presidential campaign," he wrote. "It includes the candidate, the staff, the press, the plane, the bus and all the electronic gear of the 20th-century hustle . . . yet it is not so much a tangible phenomenon as a metaphysical one, a way of looking at things, at once cynical and cosy . . . where you find both the real story and yet an utterly false one, a speed-blurred picture of a very large country."
The words, they are a-changin', and the interregnum isn't even over yet. (I know it's a transition, but the old ways die hard.)

HEADLINE: How Brokers Make Do In the Sluggish Market

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
CHARLES DARWIN called it natural selection. For Herbert Spencer, it was the survival of the fittest. But whatever one terms it, it's what has been happening in recent years to brokers and sales agents as the downturn in the real estate market has both diminished their numbers and required those who have remained to adopt different strategies, or variations of old ones, to stay alive.
Many companies, large and small, have gone out of business; those that remain have cut back dramatically on spending for advertising and promotion. Emphasis has been placed more and more on specialization, on the international market, on relocations and foreclosures, on referrals and on doing everything possible to increase contact with those who might provide them. 
 The need to share properties in a diminishing marketplace has led to a sharp rise in co-brokering and the increasing influence of the listings broker. The focus is on service.
"When the market was so hot, there was enough business -- in fact, there was an overflow -- there was room for new people to come in and do quite well," said Hall Willkie, senior vice president of Brown, Harris, Stevens in Manhattan. "But as the market contracted, many people dropped out. The situation didn't leave room for anybody who wasn't a seasoned professional, who didn't have the necessary experience combined with a large referral network."
Paul Stehnach, the sales manager of Prudential/Rita Cohen Realty in White Plains, put it this way: "This is no longer the part-time housewife business. These are full-time professionals who work in real estate."
Statistics tell part of the story. The number of licensed brokers and sales people in Connecticut plummeted from 3,765 on July 1, 1986, to 24,654 as of July 15, 1992, according to the National Association of Real Estate License Law Officials. New Jersey also saw a decrease, from 82,000 in July 1986 to 79,901 in June 1992, according to association figures. And in New York, the Department of State reports a decline from 129,234 in July 1986 to 126,839 in October 1992.
ONE of those who fled is Roz Costin of Bedminster, N.J., a sales agent for six years -- the last four of them with Coldwell Banker in Chatham, N.J. -- who now has her own business creating and selling wreaths, baskets, floral arrangements and other items.
"I was just getting frustrated being in the office every day and having nothing come to fruition," Ms. Costin said.
She entered the business in 1984, when the market was thriving, and "made a lot of sales and a lot of money," she said. While she was selling real estate, she began creating wreaths and baskets as closing gifts. In 1990, with the real estate market becalmed, she left. Now she successfully sells her crafts to stores, private customers -- and realtors.
Not only are there fewer people, but there are fewer companies. "It was quite a bloodbath," said Clark Halstead, managing partner of the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan brokerage. The casualty list in Manhattan alone of brokerages that no longer operate here or were absorbed into other companies includes the huge M.J. Raynes residential branch, Sulzberger-Rolfe, Pogue-Simone, Hahn & Gifford Realty, Cross & Brown Residential, Kenneth Ives, the Rachmani Corporation, Weichert Manhattan, Schlott Realtors, B.J. Gottesman and Lyons & Associates.
Five years ago, a broker would get a listing and advertise in a newspaper in the hope of pulling in a buyer. Today, that same broker more than likely gets a listing and then offers it to every broker around, one of whom eventually brings in the buyer and shares the commission.
Barbara Corcoran, head of the large Corcoran Group in Manhattan, said that the number of co-brokered deals at her company had increased from just under 30 percent in 1988 to 82 percent this year. "All the brokers have learned to share, because everyone is desperate in a recession," Ms. Corcoran said.
As soon as the downturn hit, said Jody LaMonte, a vice president at Corcoran: "I took myself right out of the buyers' market and I put myself into the sellers' market. I stopped looking for buyers and started promoting the product itself. I would collect the brokers and bring them to the product, and outside brokers would find the buyers."
Promotion, Ms. LaMonte said, was the key. "What happened," she said, "was that there was such a collection of inventory that was not being moved. Someone attempting to sell a nine-room apartment was one of a multitude of people with nine-room apartments. But if they gave it to me, I would dress it up and present it with a marketing plan -- color photos, brochures -- and get many brokers in the field actively trying to sell it. And for me, in the end, even if it took time, it still guaranteed that the property would be sold and that I would be a participant in the sale."
Co-brokering, of course, means a lower commission income, already down because prices have fallen about 35 percent in Manhattan over the last four years, according to Ms. Corcoran. The standard 6 percent is shared in a co-brokered deal, with half going to the listings broker and half to the agent who finds the buyer. In addition, about 50 percent of a broker's commission goes to the brokerage concern -- though high-productivity brokers can often keep as much as 65 percent. (Even in today's market, though, a top-flight, experienced residential broker with good contacts can earn $200,000 a year or more.)
Ms. LaMonte said that the reduced commission was compensated for by increased volume. And with the need for higher volume, ech sales person is making more deals.
"In 1988 my top sales people made seven or eight deals a year," Ms. Corcoran said. "Last year, it was 11 or 12 deals. More deals to earn less."
Much more work is required to close those deals, and even to get the business in the first place. Customers are increasingly sophisticated, and there aren't as many of them. Referrals from satisfied customers, always highly important, have become even more so. "I tell my sales people that they have to promote themselves, they have to develop relationships," said Peter Helie, president and chief operating officer of William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford, Conn. "I tell them to get involved in organizations where they can develop those relationships: the United Way, church organizations, clubs, the arts, fund raising for the American Cancer Society. And in addition to business, they can get personal enjoyment out of what doing those things."
Specialization is the key, Mr. Helie and other real estate people say. Two areas of specialization that continue to be important, Mr. Helie said, are relocation and foreclosures. "We have a full-time person who does nothing but call on businesses to see if he can help with employees," he said. "And we have a full-time person who does nothing but call on banks."
But because of the recession, the relocation business in many areas is not what it once was. "It was a good percentage of my business for a long time," said Rita Cohen, head of Prudential/Rita Cohen Realty in White Plains. "But there's less of it now. Not as many companies are coming into the area because Westchester is considered too expensive. United Parcel Service and J.C. Penney, for instance, moved out and went South."
Evelyn Atanas, owner of Atanas Realty in Williston Park, L.I., said that the relocation business was also down in her area. "Transfers have helped business in hard times," Ms. Atanas said, "but not as many people and businesses are coming to Long Island as used to."
And, Ms. Cohen said, there is danger in foreclosures, because a foreclosed house is almost always sold for much less than what a similar house in the same area usually brings. "Foreclosures can give you business," she said, "but if things aren't handled properly they can hurt values."
Another area of specialization, especially in difficult times, is rentals. "We increased the number of rentals," said Mr. Willkie of Brown, Harris, Stevens. "We set up a rental department and concentrated on it. In the past, we had so many sales we didn't bother with rentals. But these days, some people who are hesitant to buy in this market decide to rent."
Mr. Halstead also started a rental division, which he said now accounts for 10 to 20 percent of his revenues. (He also opened a foreclosure department that he said had brought in new business.)
Yet another area is foreign sales. "There is always a foreign market in New York," said Carrie Chiang, director of international operations and a vice president of the Corcoran Group. But even that market has changed because of the downturn. "There are two types of buyers," Ms. Chiang said, "and five or six years ago you had both kinds of buyers. At the height of the market, some people were buying because they needed to buy for one reason or another. Right now it's people who are business-minded, who buy blocs to rent out to get net income because it's better than the 3-4 percent interest you get for your money in the bank. In New York, if you know the right product you can get 6-7 percent profit."
Franchising is another possibility. Ms. Cohen of Prudential/Rita Cohen said that for her becoming a franchisee was a major way of dealing with the downturn. Many brokers disagree on the value of becoming a franchise of a larger company, but Ms. Cohen said that the positives greatly outweighed the negatives for her.
"I am not a joiner," she said. "But when Prudential contacted me and asked me if I wanted to be a franchisee I realized that there was strength in numbers. I have a smaller firm with the advantages of a larger firm." She said that franchising allowed her to participate in cooperative advertising and to offer many additional services to customers that she could not have provided on her own, including discounts on moving.
High on just about everyone's list of changes was the need to find different and more creative ways of advertising their properties, including direct mail and the use of color photography.
"We looked for new marketing ideas, different ways of finding buyers, different avenues of advertising," said Mr. Willkie of Brown, Harris, Stevens. "We increased contacts with brokers around the country, around the world. We did more display advertising, we designed more brochures."
Alan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, the giant Manhattan brokerage and management firm, said that his company had become "very aggressive in our marketing."
"Advertising is often the first thing cut," Mr. Rogers said. "But we've increased our advertising every year. What it comes down to is that in a tough market you have to be prepared to advertise in an aggressive fashion, more aggressively than in a boom market. That's what people are looking for -- they want to see their property advertised, exposed in every way possible."
Douglas Elliman, which has expanded substantially in the downturn, largely through the acquisition of Cross & Brown and Sulzberger-Rolfe, twice a year publishes and distributes 50,000 copies of a 32-page glossy magazine called Treasury of Fine Homes, a listing of residences in every price range. It has also recently put out 50,000 copies of a similar color brochure called the Folio of Fine Homes, which includes properties that go for under $500,000.
Sharon E. Baum, vice president and director of exclusive marketing for the Corcoran Group, said she often tailored her advertising to the product. "If we think it's a property that might appeal to someone in the music industry," Ms. Baum said, "we will advertise not in The Wall Street Journal but in the Hollywood Reporter or Variety. And if we think that an apartment near a hospital might appeal to a doctor at that hospital we might try to see if we can get in and post a notice in the doctors' lounge."
Everything -- from finding the buyer to getting a mortgage from a bank -- is just that much harder.
"I'VE never been in a market where buyers were more educated," Ms. Baum said. "They know the impact of maintenance, the ratio of maintenance to purchase price, the cost of a new kitchen or bathroom. They are very savvy. They want to make an intelligent purchase."
And so personal service has become what counts -- in every area. "You have to hold their hand," said Ms. Atanas of Atanas Realty, "take them everywhere, show them what the town has to offer, show them the schools, introduce them to the principals, sit in on the classes, spend a great deal of time with them."
And sometimes real estate people have to take the concept of personal service one step further.
"Not long ago I had an exclusive listing," Ms. Atanas said, "a terrible house in a prime location. The house was in very bad condition. A couple had lived there for maybe 40 years, and I don't think anyone had ever dusted or cleaned it. A nice young couple saw it and immediately said they wanted it. The house was sold as is, and we went to contract.
"The couple applied to two banks for a mortgage. One of the banks sent a brand new appraiser who started hitting the ceiling above her in the basement with a screwdriver. And suddenly the whole kitchen above collapsed. So of course the bank wouldn't give us a mortgage. The only way to get one was to replace the entire floor. And the house also needed new light fixtures, a new garage door and new stoops."
So, Ms. Atanas continued, she and the couple obtained permission from the attorneys and, together with the father of the young man, went to the house one night and started work. "We put up the new garage door," she said. "We repaired the stoops. We put in the light fixtures. We put in the floor. I had never put down a ceramic floor. What do I know from putting down a ceramic floor?"
A few years ago, Ms. Atanas said, none of it would have been necessary. "But we did a great job," she said. "The house is gorgeous. And we got the mortgage."
And she got the sale.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Retailer's Recession Strategy;
Opportunity Drives Kmart's Expansion

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
LAST spring, the Kmart Corporation went looking for 15 acres or so in suburban Detroit on which to build a 108,000-square-foot Pace Warehouse Club. What it found instead was 35 acres in nearby Utica, Mich., at a major highway intersection a quarter mile west of a big regional mall.
Seems the persistent real estate slump had killed the developer's plans for an office complex. The space was going cheap and Kmart's lender was willing to use Kmart's commitment to lease any buildings that went up as collateral for financing the developer. 
 It was too good to pass up, but what to do with 35 acres?
Sports Authority, Kmart's sporting goods unit, added a Utica store to its plans. Office Max, the company's office supplies store, opened a store on the site, even though it had a fairly new one a couple of miles away.
A Kmart is going up there as well, even though there are four Kmarts within eight miles of the site. And now Borders Book Shops, which Kmart acquired in October, is talking about putting up its third store in the Detroit area, in Utica.
"This whole project came together because the price of real estate was coming down," said Charles J. Miller, director of real estate for Kmart's specialty retail group. "You've got to find ways to take advantage of opportunities when they come up."
That has been particularly true in the New York area, where Kmart, which is based in Troy, Mich., has gobbled up numerous buildings once occupied by other retailers. Similarly, the Caldor Corporation recently outbid Bradlees Inc. for some closed Alexander's stores in the New York metropolitan region.
Indeed, the countrywide real estate downturn has been a mixed blessing for discounters. It has made buildings and land available in markets that they had little opportunity to penetrate before.
But in Kmart's case, it has wrought havoc with the $35 billion retailer's carefully thought-out expansion plans. In February 1990, Kmart announced a $3 billion renewal and expansion program that involves a study of the more than 2,400 Kmart stores -- not to mention the hundreds of specialty stores the company owns -- to see whether they should be moved, refurbished or closed. The program also laid out an orderly plan for moving into new markets.
But now Kmart's real estate people are combing the country, looking for previously owned buildings -- P.O.B.'s in trade jargon -- that they can buy or lease to help them get into a market. And if the space turns up in the wrong shape, or a couple years before a store was planned, well, that's just too bad.
"It's silly to delay if you can jump in now and grab a market," said Richard Lawhorne, a Kmart regional manager.
Kmart is not the only large discounter looking for bargain spaces and good locations. Caldor and Bradlees both have been aggressively expanding across the country. And Wal-Mart seems to be everywere.
Still, Kmart, with its stable of specialty stores, is in the best position to take advantage of spaces and buildings that, at first blush, would seem unsuitable. It also has the money to form joint ventures with developers who otherwise might not be able to finance a new shopping center.
All told, Kmart is a prime illustration of how a deep-pocketed company can let opportunities drive its strategy.
"Sometimes you have to be creative to make the space work, but you've got to take advantage of existing viable real estate," said Joseph E. Antonini, Kmart's chairman.
Indeed, Kmart and its specialty offspring are showing up in some unlikely places.
Kmart opened a Pace warehouse in an office building in Natick, a suburb of Boston, even though it had to gut the interior and build a two-level parking deck. Its new Honolulu Kmart is in an old Dole cannery. Sports Authority and Office Max are sharing a former industrial building in Paramus, N.J., even though customers have to walk around the building to get from one store to the other.
It is even making forays into its own turf. For example, it just found out about a 40-acre site in Connecticut that is just three and a half miles from a profitable Kmart store. If it makes a deal for the site, it may close the existing Kmart and open a new one, plus several specialty stores, in the new location.
And it is virtually saturating the greater New York area.
Until recently, Long Island was not high on Kmart's expansion list. The demographics were enticing but there were problems with distribution, too few appropriate buildings or vacant space and rents that were far too rich for the few spaces there were.
But then Kmart found out about a couple of defunct Times Square Stores in Babylon and Levittown that were well-suited for Kmarts. There was also a 200,000-square-foot Times Square Store in Sayville that was too big (a prototype Kmart store is about 110,000 square feet). The location was good, though, so the company built a Kmart, and sopped up the extra space with a Sports Authority, an Office Max and a Basset Book Store.
Since then, the company has built a Kmart at another Times Square Store in Middle Village, L.I., and is negotiating for land at eight other Long Island sites. It is also looking in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.
"THERE was no grand plan to go into Long Island, but once we were there it made sense to expand our presence in the area," said Charles E. Lotzar, Kmart's director of special projects. "So you could say our whole New York expansion was driven by the availability of the Times Square Stores."
Kmart has made many compromises to make some of its new stores work. It has shoehorned parking lots onto land-poor sites and has made do with inconvenient entrances and with some industrial buildings not designed for stores.
Occasionally, it has even violated what had once been a cardinal rule of discount operations: All wares should be displayed on one floor to encourage optimum impulse buying as customers wander through the merchandise to the checkout counter. Indeed, some retail experts say that one thing that drove E.J. Korvette's out of business was its preponderance of multilevel stores.
Kmart clearly disagrees. in late October it opened a 144,000-square-foot-store in Fresh Meadows, Queens, in a building that for years housed Bloomingdale's. The location was ideal; the store itself was not. It was in rundown shape, the stock room was far from the unloading docks and its selling space was spread over two floors.
Still, Kmart has forged ahead, as it previously had with two other two-level stores, in an old Jordan Marsh building in Southbury, Conn., and in a former Grandway in Elmwood Park, N.J.
"Would we prefer adjacencies? Sure," said Mr. Lawhorne, the regional manager. "But these are great locations."
That sort of flexibility is reassuring to New York City officials, many of whom are concerned about the steady stream of shoppers driving to Secaucus and other bargain shopping sites in New Jersey. The Department of City Planning is pushing to have several manufacturing areas in the boroughs rezoned for retailing, in hope of attracting large discount operations.
"Kmart is exactly the kind of operation we want to lure to areas that have not historically had retailing," said Rosina K. Abramson, the department's executive director.
Of course, New York and other cities are wooing other discounters as well. So competition promises to be heady for the best sites.
"Every discounter is looking everywhere in the United States, battling on each other's ground," said Carleton Myers, president of Factory Outlet Consultants in Burke, Va.
That doesn't surprise Susan Merdinger, president of the brokerage Jean-Marc Levet & Partners. "There are lots of bargains out there and no one should be surprised when discount chains pursue them," she said.
But there is more going on here than bargain-hunting. Now more than ever, the discounters need new stores in prime locations. One reason, said Terry Dunham, publisher of Value Retail News, is the growing number of factory outlets, which draw customers from many miles away because they sell items even cheaper than discounters.
"The only advantage the discounters have over the outlets is convenience," Mr. Dunham said. "So they will fight for any facility at a prime location and if they can get a good price on it, more's the better."

HEADLINE: New Corporate Credo Addresses Society's Ills


BYLINE: In one of the city's poorer neighborhoods, the Rev. Clyde Joyner, pastor of St. Peter's Baptist Church, is closer to the problems of crime, unemployment, drugs and the homeless. Like the sparkling chrome and glass of the People's Bank building downtown, Mr. Joyner's small one-story white church serves as a beacon for a smaller community -- those Bridgeport residents who are struggling to keep their families together.
By KATHLEEN SALUK FAILLAFROM the top of downtown Bridgeport's tallest building, where People's Bank established its corporate headquarters in 1989 at a time when most businesses were leaving, its president, David E. A. Carson, has an unobstructed view of the state's largest city. The bird's-eye view does little to distance him, however, from the problems that plague Bridgeport. Nor would Mr. Carson want it that way.

 BODY:
 On the surface, there is little to connect the two men. But in reality, they are part of a movement among business people who recognize that society's problems cannot be solved by government alone.
All across America, corporations are finding themselves increasingly coming to the aid the nation's social welfare and educational systems. In Connecticut, more and more businesses, large and small, are reaching out to their communities, providing help in a variety of ways. From direct financing for early-childhood health care to restructuring school curriculums, corporations are taking on a role traditionally entrusted to government.
While there is no overall figure available on how much money is being spent in community outreach programs, it is evident that momentum is gaining throughout the state. Employers like Aetna, Champion International, Travelers and Xerox have steadily increased their commitment to programs that not only help their employees with such services as day care but also improve the quality of life in the community. For example, the Aetna Foundation, with fewer dollars to spend this year because of business conditions, has redirected its efforts from housing to health care for young children.
In September, it announced a $1 million grant to the Hartford Childhood Immunization Project, which plans to increase the immunization rate of Hartford's children against preventable diseases, like whooping cough, measels, polio and diphtheria.
In Bridgeport, the president of People's Bank is a graduate of the University of Michigan School of Business, who is on a first-name basis with politicians and business leaders alike. Mr. Joyner, a minister for 32 years and founder of St. Peter's, has worked at several blue-collar jobs. He has been employed as a mechanic by the Aquarion Company since 1969, when it was known as the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company.
 
Government Forced to Scale Back
 Differences aside, Mr. Carson and Mr. Joyner are painfully aware of the social and economic changes taking place in Connecticut, and Bridgeport in particular. They recognize that government has been forced to scale back and, in many cases, no longer meet the needs of the families, particularly the children. Education budgets are being slashed at a time when the school system is under critical review. Students, unprepared to meet the needs of the work place, continue to graduate from schools. And the ranks of the unemployed are increasing, adding further to the state's social ills.
More importantly, they know that Connecticut cannot stand alone in addressing these needs without help from the business community. Individually, they are urging businesses to make a commitment by taking a more active role in the problems of their communities.
The Acting Commissioner of the State Commission on Children, Elaine Zimmerman, said that simple cost-effective programs, like improved health care and day care, could do much toward assuring that students would succeed in school. The commissioner said that for every dollar invested in young children, the state would save an average of $4.75 per taxpayer in terms of the expense of more costly problems like illness, school dropouts, welfare dependency and teen-age pregnancy.
Mr. Carson is serving as chairman of a business advisory committee for Kids Count, the commission's early-childhood project designed to prepare children for school. The success of this committee can be measured by its influence. In this year's session of the General Assembly, Mr. Carson and other business leaders supported bills ranging from free immunization to preventive health care and full-day Head Start.
 
Care for Uninsured Children
 Their support was vital in the passage of such legislation that standardizes training for child-care providers, provides intervention measures for crack babies, supports preventive health care for uninsured children, and phases in a full-day Head Start program, Commissioner Zimmerman said. "I think these business leaders helped us move an agenda faster. We've gained a few years and we've capitalized on an opportunity that might have been closed."
The role business can play is also evident to Mr. Joyner. Unlike Mr. Carson, who got involved with Kids Count after a call from the Commission on Children, Mr. Joyner's call came in a different way.
Earlier this year, while praying, he said he was directed to use his expertise as a minister to help people in the community beyond his church. He sought to do this by involving his company, and he met with the company's president. As a result of that meeting, the company's chief executive officer, Jack E. McGregor, considered ways the company could expand its current involvement in the community. Aquarion was already involved at the Barnum Elementary School through the Adopt a School program. Mr. McGregor approachedthe Bridgeport Police Department, where Mr. Joyner's full-time help in community service work was welcomed.
 
Crime Victims and Crime Prevention
 Mr. Joyner helped the police in their DARE program, advising youngsters on the risks of drugs and alcohol. He counseled crime victims and their families, and helped elderly people with crime prevention. After six months, he returned to his company, where he was promoted to the new job of community relations representative. He is now working as an executive on loan to the United Way.
The associate executive director of the United Way of Eastern Fairfield County, Sherbie Worthen, said there has been a surge of new interest by business and community programs. "We tend to put business on the shelf as not knowledgeable about these issues and not wanting to get involved, well that's not true," Ms. Worthen said. She said business understood that social problems would cost more to fix later.
"It's not just philanthrophy at work here -- it's enlightened self-interest," maintained Timothy H. Smith, executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in New York. Companies are being pressured by shareholders, politicians and community leaders to become more socially responsible, he said.
 
Immunization as 'Centerpiece'
 In addition to a desire to be a good citizen, corporations have learned that it makes good business sense to focus on social service. For example, the director of corporate public involvement for Aetna, Thomas Q. Callahan, said his company decided to make the immunization grant its "centerpiece" in corporate giving because it fit in with their business as an insurance company. "I wouldn't say it's purely altruistic, in that it's related to one of the businesses we're involved in," Mr. Callahan said.
Although some businesses have long had policies relating to social consciousness, for example, giving money for scholarships, the realization in recent years that education is important to the pool of qualified workers has caused many companies to expand their traditional roles.
Companies across the state are increasingly becoming involved in the schools, either on the local or state level. Local programs include the Adopt A School model program in Norwalk, Champion International's partnership with Stamford educators to improve the middle school curriculum, and a variety of mentoring and tutoring programs throughout the state.
 
Statewide Initiatives
 Several statewide initiatives are also in place, the most prominent being the Connecticut Business for Education Coalition, which is lead by Robert D. Kennedy, chairman and chief executive officer of Union Carbide. He is a leader in the American Business Roundtable's work to help public education meet President Bush's national goals. In Connecticut, the broad-based coalition of business leaders is promoting revisions in education.
In Hartford, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association is working with the Hartford Alliance for Mathematics and Science Education to test a new math curriculum that, if successful, would be used nationwide. The association helped obtain a $3.7 million grant from the National Science Foundation for the project. John Rathgeber, the association's executive vice president, said Connecticut's business leaders were concerned that entry-level employees lacked the necessary language and math skills and sense of teamwork to help keep Connectiut companies competitive.
The high cost of training employees without basic skills has thrust many companies into the forefront of educational revisions. "Business has been involved in minor ways, up until now," said George Bellinger, chief executive officer of Bar-Pat, an electronics company in Bridgeport. The urgency has developed, he said, because "business believes the products the schools are producing, the children, are not business ready." He takes his colleagues to task for complaining and not getting involved. "Business people are at fault if they haven't concerned themselves with something as simple as education."
Mr. Bellinger is a member of the business advisory committee of Kids Count and also teaches eighth-grade students in the Junior Achievement program.
 
Toward a Broader Perspective
 Mr. Carson of People's Bank said business people and educators must work together to develop a broader perspective on the issues. "The U.S. has the finest higher education system in the world, but we haven't been as successful in providing quality education in the younger years," he said. There is much talk today, he continued, about improving school performance by introducing the concept that has worked well for business called "Total Quality Management," whose goal is to encourage employee performance through teamwork.
A decade ago, most business people would not have anticipated the extent of their involvement in social and educational issues. Indeed, neither did legislative leaders, who during the last session of the General Assembly voted to establish an additional commission, which brings together business leaders, educators and legislators to study the state's educational system.
Former State Representative Alice Meyer, of Easton, who served on several business and education committees in the legislature, is a member of the new commission, called the Commission on Education Excellence for Connecticut. In the past, Mrs. Meyer said, many legislators refused to listen to business. Today's economy has forced them to be more attentive, she asserted. "I think they're listening a lot more because their constituents don't have jobs and it is a lot more obvious," Mrs. Meyer said.
The growing influence of business, coupled with the state's commitment to revise education standards, may produce some substantial changes in the decade ahead, the experts say.
Meanwhile business has found itself taking on a variety of new responsibilities. "What we need to do is make success happen," Mr. Carson admonished.

HEADLINE: Talking: Paydowns;
Reducing Mortgage Principal

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
ABOUT two years ago, Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH, a mortgage monitoring and advisory service in Butler, N.J., decided to personally try out an idea increasingly being promoted in his industry: making additional principal payments each month so the balance of his home mortgage could be paid off faster.
He had been in his Jefferson Township house only two years and, like other homeowners, was worried that any attempt to refinance could be rejected if the value of his home had dropped too sharply. This is likely to happen when a mortgage balance loan exceeds the customary 80 percent loan-to-value limit. 
 The same heavy balance might also preclude changing over to a 15-year loan. Further, retaining a hefty loan balance, he concluded, could also generate higher closing costs if and when he refinanced.
Mr. Havemann was equally concerned that if he needed to sell in a hurry he might be left with so high a mortgage compared to what he could get for the house that he might need an infusion of cash just to pay off the balance. So every month he's been adding an extra $70.
There are compelling reasons these days to pay off a mortgage principal faster. The customary method is to add $25 to $100 each month to the required payments and note on the payment slip that the extra is for reducing the principal (not for paying part of the next month's bill in advance).
Nevertheless, the idea remains controversial. For one, it violates a sacrosanct rule that suggests people fare best when they diversify their assets.
For instance, Gary Greenbaum, president of Greenbaum & Associates of Oradell, N.J., investment advisers, argues that the average homeowner already has about 30 percent of the family's total net worth tied up in the home. To add more would be putting too many eggs in one basket. Moreover, in a declining or stagnant property market, that money is not really helping to increase the asset base. Thus any extra money may be better invested elsewhere. However, he concedes it could make sense for people who cannot cope with risk.
Lewis J. Altfest, president of L.J. Altfest & Company, financial advisers in Manhattan, disagrees. He maintains this is an ideal time to pay down a mortgage balance because so many other investment vehicles are paying such paltry returns.
Further, the interest charges that can be saved, even taking into account their tax-deductibility, create savings that in the long run are cost-effective for most homeowners. Moreover, paying down a mortgage guarantees a reduced debt load. Paying off early also makes more sense in times of low inflation.
Larry Hagemann, an engineer in Chicago, would agree. His goal was to have his mortgage paid off by the time his daughter started college in the fall of 1993. He also knew he needed a way to lock up his savings rather than have them available to spend on other things. Further, he looked around and knew he could not easily get the sort of 10 to 12 percent returns available in the 80's.
So early in 1989 he began adding $120 each month to the $360 he was already paying -- the amount he had figured he would need to pay off the $18,000 outstanding balance by August 1993. The idea also appealed to him, he said, because he had calculated he could save $27,000 in interest payments over the life of the $50,000 mortgage.
And even though he would be losing a tax deduction, it was not all that meaningful, he said, for anyone in the 28-33 percent tax bracket. "I would only save about 30 cents for every dollar I paid interest," he noted. Moreover, he figured he could always take out an equity loan if he ever needed extra cash.
However, most advisers caution that it's more important to start by paying off non-deductible debt, like credit card balances and car loans, before working on a mortgage prinicpal.
BY FAR the best benefits will accrue to the person who has bought a home in the last four or five years, according to Marc Eisenson, president of Banker's Secret of Elizaville, N.Y., a company that sells computer software and books to help homeowners make their own calculations.
This, he said, is because the savings become most pronounced when a balance is paid down fast in the early years. He cites the following example: If someone paid an extra $100 a month on a $100,000, 30-year loan during the first five years and never paid another additional cent, the term would be reduced by five years, at a saving of $38,035 over the life of the loan.
By contrast, the person who started with the same $100,000 loan but waited 10 years to begin making additional payments would reduce the term by only 2.5 years and interest charges by $16,026.
But why not get similar results by changing to a 15-year mortgage? For one, it could mean paying a new round of closing costs that could reach 5 percent of the outstanding balance. Second, it obligates the homeowner to higher payments each month irrespective of whether those payments are convenient. "There is a real advantage in tough times to being able to slack off," said Mr. Eisenson.
Moreover, if the homeowner is concerned that the optional payment method creates a temptation to skip the additional principal payments, there are other ways to prevent backsliding.
Chase Home Mortgage, for example, has a program that lets the homeowner authorize Chase to make an automatic withdrawal of the additional sum from a checking account each month. And unlike payments on a 15-year loan, the arrangement can also be halted any time, said Tony Petrizzo, Chase's vice president for customer support.
But there are caveats. Paying extra each month will not reduce the size of the monthly payments -- those terms are set by contract when the loan is taken out. And it's important to keep tabs on how much extra is being paid in (some lenders, like Chase, include this calculation in their regular statements).
To find out specifically what the saving might be you could start by asking the lender to produce some estimates based on how much you intend to add each month.
There are also books and software that can help compute tables and answers. "The Banker's Secret" (1-800-255-0899), books and software, is one source. Another is a program called "Mastering Your Mortgage" from Home Equity Software, available for about $40. So far, however, the program works only with IBM-compatible computers. The Mac version will be available late next year.

South Norwalk Commercial Pump Primed

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
A ROLLER-COASTER economy over the last decade has taken the rehabilitation of South Norwalk to the heights of the mid-80's, the depths of the 90's and the occasional whiplash stop.
Rather than continue at the mercy of such forces, the city decided in 1991 to include in its capital budget a $1 million fund for what it calls the Facade Improvement Program, which can -- despite its name -- include other exterior work such as landscaping. 
 By injecting this quick-fix investment into lagging business districts, the program has in less than two years been successful enough to win an award for outstanding planning from the American Planning Association, a professional organization based in Washington.
To date, 16 retail and commercial exterior rehabilitation projects have been primed with city grants ranging from $6,500 to $75,000. While property owners must put up a minimum of 35 percent of the total rehabilitation cost, and several have invested a good deal more, most say they would not have gone ahead on their own in this economy.
Edward J. Musante, Jr., director of the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, which administers the program, said there had been a snowball effect.
"When one building is improved, others on the block tend to follow suit," he said.
His agency applies for new funds annually, subject to approval by the city's Common Council.
Joseph Caiati, a Westchester furniture retailer who has owned a warehouse in South Norwalk since 1985, called the program "an incentive and an inspiration."
"I have not seen anything as serious as this anywhere," he said. With a $75,000 grant and $118,000 of his own money he converted the site at Main and Elizabeth Streets into a retail furniture store with a 30-car landscaped parking lot.
Norwalk's business districts, running from South Main to North Main Street below I-95, and onto West Avenue and Wall Street north of I-95, have suffered heavily since the 1950's with the loss of industries that moved south and shops that moved to suburban malls.
In an initial attempt at renewal in the early 80's, Washington Street, near the mouth of the Norwalk River, was transformed by the Collins Development Corporation of Stamford, with the help of Federal tax credits, from a wasteland of derelict, burned-out brick buildings sheltering junkies and prostitutes into a tree-lined thoroughfare of shops, restaurants and condominiums.
RECLAIMING its 19th-century charm, the street became a model for similar restorations of buildings throughout the city. A prime example is the four-year-old Maritime Center on Water Street, converted from a defunct factory.
But when the economy weakened, dozens of plans for redevelopment, including a $40 million housing and retail complex to be built by the Starrett Corporation of New York around a new South Norwalk railroad station, were put on hold.
Now Norwalk is redefining itself "not as a city like Stamford," said John L. Burritt, assistant director of redevelopment, "not New Canaan or Darien, although some residential areas look like those towns. We decided to retain a small city flavor, attract small manufacturers and one-of-a-kind retailers."
That may not be easy.
"I don't have many tenants interested in South Norwalk, especially below I-95," said Peter Corbett, a retail broker at CB Commercial in Stamford. "They don't want to be pioneers."
"There is still a perception of crime south of I-95, of space sitting for a long time, of a lot of turnover on Washington Street and ugly public housing projects," he continued. "But Norwalk is taking a real pro-active stance. They are doing the right thing and if anyone can, they will pull it off. Not tomorrow or next year, but eventually."
North of I-95 on West Avenue, The Gap/ Gap Kids store constantly bustles, and a new CVS Pharmacy is expanding by 1,000 square feet, both without city assistance.
On Wall Street, David Harvey Jewelers spent $300,000 in addition to a $75,000 city grant to expand and renovate and the Fairfield County Savings Bank is enlarging into adjacent space with help from the facade program.
Last summer the city spent $100,000 on 750 linear feet of new transient boat docks at Veteran's Park, across the river from Washington Street. The idea is to link boaters and Maritime Center visitors to a network of streets that will eventually offer a wide range of shopping, restaurants and entertainment.
SoNo Cinema on Washington Street, known for foreign films, is undergoing a facelift with the help of the city program, and a 24,000-square-foot block of dilapidated North Main Street shops between Marshall and Ann Streets has been refurbished by Bruce Beinfield, the owner-architect, and his partner, Clayton Fowler, with a city grant. Rents for about 7,000 square feet remaining range from $10 to $12 a square foot.
The rear of the building, a block and a half from the Maritime Center, faces the New England Brewery, a local beer maker, pub, and beer museum that is taking advantage of the facade program to make improvements.
A VISUAL connection of the business districts north and south of the highway is taking place with the installation of brick sidewalks, Victorian streetlamps, landscaping, sheltered bus stops and benches, road repairs and some relocation of utilities underground with a combination of Federal, state and city funds.
The same continuity is being carried out with identical streetscaping southward along Water Street past Elizabeth and Tolles Streets, where SoNo Square is under redevelopment with a facade grant. The 110,000-square-foot building, covering a square block, has 45 tenants, including the Woodworker's Store, a new, innovative shop that holds seminars on carpentry and caters to seekers of exotic woods. Rents in 20,000 square feet of retail space that will become available when renovations are completed in 1993 will be about $14 a square foot.
Two years ago, M.F. DiScala, a Norwalk development firm, built a handsome apartment and office building at 49 Day Street, behind SoNo Square, after demolishing an old brick structure on the site. The project was completed before the facade program became available.
"Maybe we should have waited," said Michael DiScala, the company president, "and gotten a grant."

HEADLINE: New Hospital Housing Plan in White Plains

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
A PROPOSAL by a major hospital here to build 1,200 units of town-house-style housing on undeveloped hospital property, which some residents see as the city's future "Central Park," has received a warmer welcome from the Common Council than a more ambitious project offered for the same site a decade ago.
The new proposal, which would use 90 acres of the heavily wooded 235-acre campus owned and occupied by New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, a psychiatric institution, is smaller in scope than the original plan, eliminating proposed office buildings, a motel and a shopping mall and reducing the planned residential space by a third. The new project would provide the hospital with at least 200 units of additional housing for its staff, as well as income needed for research and services. 
 It was presented informally to Council members on Nov. 19, but as Mary Ann Keenan, a Council Democrat, said, "We seem to be the last to know." The reference was to a strategy being pursued by the hospital that is as different from the 1983 presentation as the scope of the project itself.
The hospital's development team, which will need a zoning change to build the project, has been meeting with neighborhood associations to measure reaction and, hopefully, enlist support. They have given the impression that they will be adjusting the proposal to accommodate the city.
S. J. Schulman, a Council Democrat and former chairman of the city's Planning Board, indicated that he was impressed with the proposal. Speaking of the hospital and its development team, he said, "I can't blame them for not wanting to spend all this money on the project without getting a clear signal that the city will go along with it."
The casual approach seems to have found a welcome reception in the ornate Council chamber, where members agreed in an unusual display of accordance to hear the proposal again, this time along with the influential Planning Board, on Dec. 9.
In 1983, the planned development of the hospital grounds landed with explosive force, surprising and infuriating community leaders. It was rejected as too ambitious by the Common Council, whose members declined even to consider the request for rezoning. This time, the hospital, stung by the hostile reaction, decided to take a more studied approach with a more modest proposal.
The new plan is limited mostly to residential development. The 1983 plan called for two million square feet of office space, a 500-room motel, medical offices, a 320,000-square-foot shopping mall, a 50,000-square-foot shopping center and a six-theater movie complex in addition to 400 town houses and 1,400 apartments in 8- to 12-story buildings.
Conceived by the Robert Martin Company, Westchester's leading developer, the original complex, which covered twice the area now being proposed for development, would have been linked by a ramp to Interstate 287, which sweeps through White Plains, sparing the adjacent communities of burdensome congestion, as the developers saw it.
 
Objection to Limited Access
 But that limited access turned out to be one of the objections that Council members cited when they rejected the original plan. Mayor Alfred Del Vecchio, who also held the city's top elected post when the original plan was submitted, said last week that the ramp link was a "negative aspect" of the 1983 plan, isolating the proposed development from the rest of the city.
"The original plans had a street system and limited access, none of it impinging on the city," Mr. Del Vecchio said. "They thought it should not interfere with the rest of the city, but that was absolutely wrong. It was not what we really wanted.
"By and large I'd like to see housing there as long as the families are integrated with the rest of the city and the project does not become something apart from the rest of the city."
Under the new plan, access would be from Bryant Avenue, a city street separating the hospital development from Bryant Gardens, a 422-unit garden apartment complex.
 
A More Modest Project
 As for the current plan, Mayor Del Vecchio said, "I feel better about it than the original proposal, which was a major misuse of the land." The revamped project, he said, "does not propose to use as much land as the original project, and they make some provision for open space."
Under the new plan, the hotel, office structure, medical offices and mall and cinema cluster would disappear, and the acreage to be developed would be cut in half, to 90 acres. Proposed residential units would drop from 1,800 to 1,200. Shopping facilities would be scaled down to a size accommodating the new community.
The new plan, as outlined by William L. Porter, a noted land-use planner who worked with the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, was offered to the Council with great care, and, in several aspects, with intended vagueness. For example, Mr. Porter did not say whether the 1,200 families would be buying or renting their apartments.
"Our objective," Mr. Porter said, "was to develop a master plan for the property that would preserve its most valuable buildings and natural features while allowing for future hospital expansion on the site and providing for the hospital's financial needs."
 
Historic Site Eligibility
 In that simple statement, Mr. Porter was addressing three major elements of the debate that led to rejection of the first plan. By "valuable buildings," he was apparently referring to the listing of the site on the State Register of Historic Places, a designation sought by opponents of the development. There are only three structures on the 90-acre site, none of them with historic significance.
In a letter dated May 29, Julia S. Stokes, deputy State Parks Commissioner, confirmed the site's listing in the State Register and its status as eligible for inclusion in the National Register presumably because the design of the 235-acre hospital grounds is attributed in part to Frederick Law Olmsted, revered as the father of American landscape architecture and the designer of Central Park in Manhattan.
Architects of the new plan, aware that such designation does not foreclose development of the property, have discussed their plans with the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to make sure they are within the limits permitted under the regulations covering historic places.
Commissioner Stokes confirmed that the state listing and eligible status for Federal designation "would not restrict development of the property in a manner consistent with the natural resources of the site and the guidelines we are discussing."
 
'Developmental Sprawl'
 Mr. Porter's reference to preserving the site's natural features was presumably intended to address at least some of the objections voiced by those who are opposed to any but the minimum development of the site permitted under existing zoning, which would be several hundred private homes.
Theodore Benjamin, who formed Concerned Citizens for Open Space to seek the historic site designation as a means of banning the original plan, said that "there's a lot more openness now in listening to those resisting the plan." He said he was still opposed to the scope of the project, which he characterized as "developmental sprawl" that requires "planning on a citywide basis."
He said he would prefer that the site be left as open space. The developers say that all the significant features have been preserved, including the densely landscaped perimeter of tall trees, which will be retained to screen the housing, consisting either of town houses or garden apartments of up to three or four stories.
Mr. Porter's reference to providing for the hospital's financial needs goes to the heart of the developmental effort, with the institution seeking to insure its economic future through the conversion of its eastern sector into income.
 
Some Council Members Cautious
 Initial reaction by some Council members indicated general praise for the new presentation as much more realistic than the original plan, with comment on the plan itself ranging from enthusiastic to cautious.
Mr. Schulman, who is serving his first term on the Council, said that the new proposal "is worth serious consideration by the city." He said it was "certainly responsive to the city's own comprehensive master plan, which designated 1,200 units for that parcel."
It was he who suggested that the Council meet with the Planning Board, "whose members are more into long-term issues than we are." He said that retaining the site for open space would be expensive and unfair to the property owner, representing what he said would be a confiscatory act.
Councilman Richard S. Hendey Jr., a Republican, praised Mr. Porter for "a masterful job of analyzing" the situation but remained cautious about the hospital's need to build housing well in excess of the need for its own staff, which Mr. Porter put at 200 of the 1,200 units. Residential housing already exists on the hospital grounds for staff members, but Mr. Porter said the hospital needed additional housing for medical and administrative personnel.
Councilwoman Keenan said she was interested in learning how the neighborhood associations were reacting to the hospital plan. She said she was not convinced that the development, if approved, would necessarily succeed, "considering the real estate market and the number of unfinished housing developments we have in the city."
 
Many Questions Unanswered
 Rita Z. Malmud, a Council Democrat, saw the proposal as "an improvement over the plan suggested many years ago, but the big question is whether or not it is sufficiently attractive to approve." She said many questions remained unanswered. "When I asked Mr. Porter if they would be selling or renting the units, he said that had not been determined."
The property, bounded by Bryant Avenue, Bloomingdale Road, Westchester Avenue and North Street, has major department stores as its neighbors, including Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus and Saks as well as a proposed shopping mall, a branch of Nordstrom's and the Fashion Mall, a cluster of boutiques.
Other neighbors include Kraft General Foods, St. Agnes Hospital, Bryant Gardens, the garden apartment complex; a neighborhood of single-family homes adjacent to a golf course fairway, additional housing newly built on the hospital's eastern edge and mid- and high-rise apartment houses on Mamaroneck Avenue.

THE ECONOMY
 
Maybe This Time Recovery Was Just Around the Corner
Just weeks after an election that turned on three factors -- the economy, the economy and the economy -- a flood of numbers spilled out suggesting that things may be looking up. Economic growth was surprisingly strong in the third quarter, home sales, consumer confidence and personal income rose and jobless claims fell for the sixth time in eight weeks. The election's winners and losers seemed to lapse by habit into campaign mode, with Marlin Fitzwater shouting, to the accompaniment of a roaring Presidential helicopter, "The Bush recovery is coming on strong," while Bill Clinton took more of a wait-and-see stance. News that the economy grew 3.9 percent in the quarter "could have some impact" on short-term judgments about a stimulus, he said, but it "won't change my long-term plans" to try to strengthen industrial competitiveness. Meanwhile, many economists came down on the side of caution, saying it was too early to call a turning point for a recession that has blinked repeatedly but has defiantly refused to get out of town. 

Democracy, at the Flip of a Dial
When Ross Perot entranced the nation's television audience with his economic wisdom, Bill Clinton must have been watching. Last week his much-discussed closed-door economic "summit" turned into a "retreat," and every potato (or even potatoe) with a couch is welcome to tune in. The conference will resemble the campaign's town meetings, and the "real Americans" to participate will include the heads of Apple Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Xerox and Sara Lee. Mickey Kantor, a Clinton aide, said the goal was "putting some meat on the bones" of the President-elect's economic proposals. "This is assessment and input," he said. But another Clinton aide acknowledged that "the real work is going on right now." And at the conference, Mr. Clinton will be meeting privately with Robert B. Reich, head of his economic policy team.
 
Tax-Deductible Penance
Struggling to recoup some of the money that went down the savings and loan sinkhole, the Government got from Ernst & Young what almost amounts to loose change in this multi-billion-dollar game -- $400 million. Regulators say that in its audits of numerous institutions, the accounting firm should have seen the billboard-size handwriting on the wall and sounded a warning. But by settling, Ernst may have got off easy. It faced numerous huge suits, each running as high as hundreds of millions of dollars, but both sides wanted to avoid endless litigation, so Ernst has wiped those off the slate. Still, $400 million seems like a crippling number. But look closer: insurance will pay $300 million, and the 2,000 partners are allowed to pay their (tax-deductible) share of the rest over four years. That works out to $8,000 a year apiece, out of average earnings of $200,000. No one is likely to be out on the street.
 
G.E.'s Military Discharge
The end of the cold war, which has mapmakers working overtime worldwide, continues to redraw the map of the American economy as the nation spends less on the military. General Electric last week completed its departure from the military and aerospace businesses it has held since World War I by agreeing to sell its aerospace unit to Martin Marietta for $3 billion. The aerospace businesses, which generated more than $6 billion of G.E.'s $60 billion in revenues last year, supply satellites, technical services and systems involving radar, sonar and communications. The stock market greeted the news warmly, with the stock rising $2.125 on Monday, to $82.125, and ending the week at $82.875.
In another pullback from the military priorities of another era, the Army canceled a $594 million "Star Wars" research contract with McDonnell Douglas. The Army said the shrinking Defense Department budget had forced it to withdraw the contract to develop a ground-based surveillance and tracking system.
 
Listen Up, You of Little Tax!
"Solutions to the U.S. budget situation are readily found. What is required is the will." No, that's not Ross Perot talking. It's the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and it has a strong message. The group, representing 24 big nations, is fed up with America's inaction on its deficit, saying it threatens to push up global interest rates and undermine United States Government plans to raise investment. Its specific suggestions: a 25-cent-a-gallon rise in the gasoline tax and a 5 percent national sales tax. It said the Government spent far too much on current consumption that would be better used in investing in a more productive nation.
 
COMPANIES
 
A Day Older, a Whole Lot Poorer
Even into the most glittering garage-to-riches stories, some wrenches must fall. The stock of Microsoft, the world's largest software company, is worth more than 10 times what it was when it went public in 1986, with the stock market now valuing it above General Motors. Its chairman, William H. Gates 3d, owns so many of those shares that last Monday morning he had a net worth of $7.8 billion (give or take several lesser fortunes), probably making him the richest man in America. But look at the dent one lowly analyst can make: On Monday, Rick Sherlund, of Goldman, Sachs, lowered his earnings estimates for Microsoft, and a fickle Wall Street yanked back more than $500 million of Mr. Gates's paper nest egg, as the stock dropped $6.50, to $88.50, in a single day. The stock regained $3 on Tuesday after Mr. Sherlund tempered his remarks, saying his numbers may have been too harsh, and ended the week at $91.75.
 
The Numbers Looked Good
Another high-tech darling of the market fared far worse last week, proving -- if it needed to be proved -- that investors do not look kindly on executives' making up profit numbers. Comptronix, an Alabama electronics company that seemed to have all the right hot-stock stuff, suspended its top three executives after they admitted that they had inflated earnings for as much as three years. Its stock, selling at eight times its price at the end of 1990, tumbled from its perch, in a single day dropping nearly 75 percent, to $6.125, from $22. By Friday, the stock had crept up only a bit, ending at $8.375.
 
Another Headache for G.M.
General Motors' problems just keep on coming. Last week Moody's lowered its ratings on an array of G.M. debt securities, worth about $70 billion. Moody's said the auto maker was "likely to remain under pressure because of the company's high cost structure and product weakness."
 
Biting 'the Ultimate Bullet'
Westinghouse Electric lost $1.7 billion on its financial-services businesses last year, dragging its overall results deep into the minus column, and investors were not amused. Its shares, which earlier this year traded above $20, plunged below $10. So last week it "bit the ultimate bullet," as one analyst put it. The company had tried to stage an orderly retreat from the business, but in the face of continuing losses and dwindling sources of credit, its chairman, Paul E. Lego, said it could no longer "tough it out." Westinghouse said it would close down the financial services unit and sell other businesses, cutting the company's size by a third. Investors were enthusiastic. Even though the dividend was cut nearly in half, the shares jumped almost 25 percent, to $12.125, when the plan was announced on Monday, and inched up further later in the week, to a close of $12.625.
 
At ABC, Youth Serving Youth
Network television has long set its sights on younger viewers, and last week one network put a manager where its mouth was, as Robert A. Iger, 41, was named to head ABC, becoming one of the youngest people ever to head a network. Daniel B. Burke, president of Capital Cities/ABC, clearly trying to put in a new generation of top executives at the company, said Mr. Iger's "youth and energy level" were big factors. ABC's news, sports and entertainment divisions will report to Mr. Iger, who is now president of the entertainment division. His prime-time programming has often led the other networks in delivering the younger audiences advertisers prefer.
 
Analyst Speaks, Company Yells
When David R. Korus of Kidder, Peabody speaks, people listen. And when the analyst spoke of his doubts about whether Dell Computer's accounting had inflated profits, they heard "sell," and sell they did. But Dell fought back, first in sharp words from its chairman, then in asking the S.E.C. to look into trading patterns. It also said it was contemplating legal action. Defending an analyst's freedom to scrutinize, Charles R. Wolf of First Boston said, "There has to be a healthy degree of cynicism, because very few companies will say they are doing poorly."
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Talks Resume, to French Dismay
French farmers took to the streets to protest a European accord with the United States, a pact whose sharp cuts in farm subsidies would make it harder for them to sell their goods abroad. Leading French politicians denounced the plan as well, but were unable to block it. The agreement opened the way for world trade talks to resume in Geneva after being deadlocked for nearly a year -- talks widely viewed as a key to reviving economic growth, particularly in the industrialized world. The stated goal: to finish a trade-liberalization package by year's end.
 
U.N. to U.S.: Hands Off Cuba
When the Soviet Union died, Fidel Castro instantly became an economic orphan. Not much future in that. But the United States does not want to wait around for Mr. Castro's inevitable exit, and the United Nations does not like Uncle Sam's latest method of trying to get its way. Last week, in a surprise rebuke, the General Assembly called overwhelmingly for an end to Washington's long embargo against Cuba. What prompted even America's friends to cry "Enough" was a new law that further tightens that embargo. Under the law, American companies' foreign subsidiaries that have traded with Cuba in the past can be prosecuted under American law if they do so in the future. Mexico's delegate to the United Nations called the American move "a violation of international law."
 
Royal Contribution To Public Coffers
Marital strife. Fire. What other earthly torments is royalty heir to? You guessed it: taxes. Victoria paid them, and now Queen Elizabeth, amid resentment of the royal life style, will chip in, too.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Economy: Holiday Cheer, But Will It Last?

BYLINE: By Steven Greenhouse

 BODY:
LAST week's economic reports were a hearty, heartening Thanksgiving feast for statistics mavens. The economy grew by a stunning 3.9 percent in the third quarter, orders for big-ticket factory goods soared in October, and consumer confidence finally lifted itself.
Although this news provides some much-needed holiday cheer, the consensus among economists is that the 3.9 percent jump in third-quarter output overstates the economy's underlying growth rate. They expect fourth-quarter growth to be weaker, between 2 and 2.75 percent, for several reasons. Consumer spending in the third quarter grew faster than disposable income, and third-quarter military spending rocketed despite the downward trend in military outlays. In addition, business inventories grew strongly for the second straight quarter and corporations won't want to continue that trend. 
 Still, although some reports, like industrial production, point to more weakness, more and more economists say the economy is coming out of the woods. And, says David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist at Herzog Heine Geduld Inc., the Dow Jones industrials don't fully appreciate that, although he said the Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index and Nasdaq combined composite do. Both these indices hit records after Wednesday's G.D.P. news. "The economic news will help the Dow make a catch-up move between here and the end of the year," Mr. Bostian said.
As a result of last week's bullish news, President-elect Bill Clinton said he might rethink his plans to give the economy a quick jolt. He is still expected to propose a tax credit on equipment purchases. But it is not quite as clear that he will embrace a stimulus package that creates jobs through increased deficit spending. That could help firm the bond market.
What appears likely is that the faster growth is in the fourth quarter, the smaller will be any stimulus package.
Speaking about the third-quarter growth numbers, Robert F. Wescott, an economist with the WEFA group, said, "I think it lowers the amount of fiscal stimulus Clinton will do." That, too, could buoy the bond market.
But, he added, "I think he will do something as an insurance policy. I think Clinton feels there is too much of a risk of getting two or three months of positive numbers and things going soft again." Mr. Wescott sees growth of 3 percent next year, perhaps without stimulus, or if growth falters, then with one.
Mr. Bostian said Mr. Clinton's agenda should benefit capital-goods stocks, especially technology, machinery, construction and pollution-control issues. He said a stimulus package could push long-term interest rates back up to 8 percent.
But there might be a pleasant surprise, Mr. Bostian added. Growth might prove so strong that tax revenues will rise enough to offset the cost of a $40-billion public works plan, so the deficit would hardly rise. "He just might have his cake and eat it too."

A Wireless Widget Master

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
BILL CAMPBELL is no stranger to challenges. Armed with degrees in economics, he spent six years (1974-79) as head football coach at Columbia University, there compiling a 12-41-1 record (even so, it was better than any coach since then).
Then came jobs at J. Walter Thompson, Eastman-Kodak, and Apple Computer Inc., where he rose to executive vice president. He quit Apple to start the Claris Corporation, a software company. But when Apple bought Claris in 1990, Mr. Campbell saw the handwriting on the wall -- or rather, the screen. 
 In 1991, he became president of the GO Corporation, in Foster City, Calif. GO's Penpoint operating system is being adopted by a new generation of portable computers that use the pen for such applications as note-taking and scheduling, wireless electronic mail and facsimile, as well as standard business applications.
Question: You just got off the plane from Tokyo -- your 12th trip this year -- and now you're dashing off to speak on a panel. Are things always this hectic?
Answer: I'm a madman. I work 24 hours a day. That's always been my style. I'm an early riser and I don't sleep much. I'm really pretty dull.
Q: Is there really a market for these pen-based, wireless widget things?
A: The way I look at it is, there is an inevitability. Devices are getting smaller and more personal, so the answer is more like, "Why not?" It's like local area networks a few years ago: Everybody said, "year of the LAN, one of the most overpromised technologies." But you knew that it had to happen. People want to be connected, and sooner or later they're going to have to share all this stuff. When it becomes easy to use, and practical to use, then people will use it. And that's what happened. I think the same thing is going to happen with this. If we do a good job making them simple and cheap, this will be a gigantic market. I mean, I can't think that it wouldn't be, but then again, I'm more cautious than everybody else.
Q: Why?
A: A couple of people got too hypey about this. This is not going to happen overnight, and we just have to be careful. Pen computing already has a lot of wounds from too-high expectations. I came here in '91, and you notice we've taken a lot lower profile. I'm just not interested in being out there telling everyone how good we are. I just want to do it, and let everyone look at it.
Q: What sort of gizmos do you carry?
A: I don't carry one of the pads with me. I don't use my mobile phone; the battery life is so short. Aargh! It drives me crazy. I'll use a pay phone.
Q: What kind of device would you like to carry?
A: The ultimate is one I could carry like the old Hewlett-Packard calculators. People are looking at wireless devices as notebook replacements. If these devices are going to be successful, somebody has to say, "This is as good as a notebook, but it also offers other things -- like communications." That's why at GO we've taken a completely different approach, designed to take advantage of mobility. These are truly mobile devices, not things that have to have 120-megabyte hard drives and replace the desktop. If we have to compete for the notebook replacement or desktop extension market, then we're dead, Microsoft just crushes us.

New Generation Feeling the Fire

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
GRADUATION day, a bittersweet time for most college seniors and parents as they look backward and forward, may have provided Derrick Diggs's parents with one alarmingly bittersweet moment last spring. They assumed their talented son had spent some part of his last year at Morehouse College in Atlanta applying to graduate schools or looking for a job, as most anxious seniors do.
No, he told them after the family returned to its hotel from a shopping trip. "They said, 'Well, this is your last party. After that you're on your own,' " Mr. Diggs said. 
 College graduates are supposed to be cosmically unsettled in this, the year of the worst job market for recent grads in 50 years. So why do neither Derrick Diggs, nor his friend Imar Hutchins, seem in the least bit jittery?
Perhaps because they know what they want. The pair opted off the future-shock treadmill to develop a national network of private preschools called Freeform Academy -- a kind of shoe-leather, from-the-ground-up version of Chris Whittle's Edison Project. One school with 15 preschoolers is already open in Atlanta. Mr. Hutchins and Mr. Diggs plan to open five more there next fall and, in the next few years, move, as they say, "concentrically" from their Atlanta base into neighboring states, up the Eastern Seaboard and across the country.
Baby boomers, well into middle age and as yet without majors, may want to pause over the example of Mr. Hutchins, 22 years old, and Mr. Diggs, 23. Though they are members of the supposedly lost and forlorn Generation X, their intensity -- if not their discipline -- feels familiar. They would like not merely to start schools, but to transform institutions.
They have been counseled to go slowly in their venture, to think small, to postpone while they credential themselves. No. "Now's the time," said Mr. Hutchins, who reads the Harvard Business Review to relax. "If you feel the fire now, do it. The fire isn't always on you."
But, unlike their befringed, be-bell-bottomed 60's counterparts, they view private enterprise as the path to transformation -- and self-sufficiency.
The two men have an abiding faith in the gospel of entrepreneurialism, instilled by their fathers who owned businesses. In the year before graduation, they talked among friends at Morehouse about possible ventures. Certain existential decisions were made. "We decided what we weren't going to do, not what we would do," Mr. Hutchins said. "We knew something would come." What they weren't going to do included going off One of an occasional series on the experiences of recent college graduates.
 to any of the prestigious graduate programs or big companies that were courting them. The confidence to take a risky, unconventional tack came in part from their experience at Morehouse, in part from family.
BOTH were economics majors, both good and active students. Mr. Hutchins, who is from Philadelphia, graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Mr. Diggs, from Wichita, was an honors student and an All-American sprinter for three years. He says, simply, "I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur like my dad." When Mr. Hutchins was seven, his father helped him start Imar's Card Company. He went door-to-door in his neighborhood, selling greeting cards his father got wholesale. "The inventory would be magically renewed when I ran out," he said. "My father set it up so I couldn't fail."
Providing opportunities for such "microsuccesses" to develop student confidence is an important part of the Freeform Academy curriculum. The idea for a school open to all and oriented to the needs of African-American children was one of several on the menu of the senior-year discussions, suggested by a fellow student, Ayize Sabater. Mr. Hutchins was intrigued, but less with the school than with the potential. "A lot of people have schools," Mr. Hutchins said. "I said, 'Wait, we don't need one school, we need a hundred schools.' " Mr. Sabater is now principal of the school and its chief resource in educational philosophy and teacher training.
The notion that a venture of such magnitude could be successful is so improbable that -- who knows? -- it might work. McDonald's was once a single entity. Mr. Hutchins, the company president, and Mr. Diggs, its chief financial officer, undertook a two-month tour in the fall to take word of Freeform to educational groups around the country. At the moment they are scouting sites in Atlanta for the five schools they intend to open next August. They and six full-time workers are living on nearly infinitesimal draws and a belief in Freeform's future. As they expand concentrically, they plan to increase the number of new schools geometrically. By the time Chris Whittle gets his first school off the ground in 1996, they point out, there should be several dozen Freeform Academies up and running strong.
 
 
 
AVERAGE VERSUS EXCELLENT
 FOR now, Freeform Academy is operating on tuition payments ($75 a week), donations, a little startup capital and a lot of sweat equity. Derrick Diggs and Imar Hutchins, the two founders, put in long hours, as do several other full-time employees. Freeform's principal, Ayize Sabater, opens the school at 7 A.M. and goes home at 8 P.M.
Mr. Diggs and Mr. Hutchins already have in mind some entrepreneurial pitfalls. To control the sirens of unfettered growth, they have delayed plans to open schools outside Atlanta next year. And though they will probably seek venture capital at some point, they decline to think in terms of big infusions just yet. "That's the least of our worries," Mr. Diggs says. "People is what we need."
Describing the type of venture he wants Freeform to be, Mr. Hutchins refers to wisdom garnered from a recent Harvard Business Review. "An average company fulfills consumer demand," he says. "An excellent company leads consumers to the market. We're trying to see the hidden demand." He has little doubt it's there. The lone Freeform in existence now has a long waiting list.

HEADLINE: Chicago's Exchanges Look Toward an Electronic Salvation

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
LAST December, after President Bush toured the trading floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, he came away dazzled by the frenzy of shouts and hand signals. "I have seen the future," he said.
Officials at the Merc and its longtime neighbor and rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, were pleased by the vote of confidence. But in fact they are counting on the future looking a bit different. Separately and jointly, the two exchanges are investing heavily to modernize as they battle to preserve their leadership in the world's markets for futures, options, and related instruments. 
 The exchanges are spending millions of dollars annually on electronic systems. Some aim to make the current open-outcry trading more efficient by eliminating paper orders along with many of the clerical workers who handle them. Other systems will sidestep the pits entirely to help Chicago's traders compete with new exchanges around the world that trade exclusively on computers.
And in moves that would have seemed unimaginable a decade ago, top officials from the Merc and Board of Trade have set aside historical rivalry to travel together to Europe and Asia on sales trips, to merge overseas offices and to begin negotiations to merge the back offices that process trades.
The exchanges' products are known as derivatives because they are based on underlying commodities. The extension of the futures concept from traditional commodities like crops, animals and metals to financial commodities like stocks, bonds and currencies has transformed derivatives into a basic cog in the global economy and one of the most incredible growth industries ever. Hal T. Hansen, the Cargill Investor Services executive who is president of the Futures Industry Association, a trade group, described the industry's growth chart as looking like the path of a homesick angel.
Industry sources figure there were more than 500 million futures and options contracts traded in the world last year -- an average of nearly 1,000 per minute. Chicago became the worldwide futures king by leading the development of financial futures.
But Chicago's share of futures and options trading, estimated at about 75 percent just five years ago, is now thought to be just under 50 percent and falling. The exchanges have been losing ground to the approximately 50 exchanges outside the United States, about half of which have been founded since 1985. Off-exchange deals between banks and other institutional investors are also a rapidly growing part of the derivatives business.
Futures are an obligation to buy or sell, anywhere from a few days to several years in the future, a fixed quantity of a commodity. The commodity could be securities like Treasury bonds, 5,000 bushels of corn, or even the exchange rate between the German mark and the Japanese yen. A futures contract specifies price, date, and place and terms of delivery. Options are the right, but not an obligation, to complete similar trades on or before a specified date.
Futures and options were once regarded as dangerous financial oddities because they attracted so many speculators. It seemed that in every famous financial bust dating back to the run-up and crash in tulip-bulb prices in 16th-century Holland, derivatives had worked like gasoline thrown on a fire. In the past 20 years, though, derivatives have come to be accepted as a useful tool for any conservative business exposed to wide swings in profitability.
THE Chicago markets, and rivals like the New York Mercantile Exchange and the London International Financial Futures Exchange, allow a farmer to establish the revenue he will have after selling a crop long before it is harvested, a manufacturer to lock in the dollar value of exported products long before payment is made, or a pension fund to build a safety net of assets that generate income to match the projected pace of payments to its members.
Although no bottom-line measure of the benefits to the world economy of financial derivatives is possible, the business world has been won over. Futures trading in the United States alone went from 18.3 million contracts in 1972 to 112.4 million contracts in 1982 to a peak of 276.5 million in 1990, according to the Futures Industry Association. (Exchange officials say that increased competition might have been a factor in the decline to 262.9 million last year but that the recession was the primary reason) Options on commodities, and on futures contracts themselves, began trading in 1982 and soared to 64.1 million contracts by 1990, the trade group said.
Not included are trades on exchanges that focus on options on stocks or stock indexes. The largest is the Chicago Board Options Exchange, a Board of Trade spinoff that has a daily volume of 500,000 contracts.
IF worldwide trading continues to expand as rapidly as it has in recent years, the Chicago exchanges could prosper even as they lose market share. But they aren't taking growth in this country for granted.
In the past, the exchanges' growth has been driven by a handful of big products. The Board of Trade, founded in 1848, owes its claim to being the world's largest derivatives exchange primarily to its 30-year Treasury bond futures, introduced in 1977. The bond contract is the world's most popular way of hedging on long-term interest rates. The Merc, founded in 1919, has grown even faster. It grabbed the lion's share of bets on short-term interest rates (through Eurodollar contracts) and foreign-exchange movements (through foreign-currency futures). And with its S.& P. 500 contract, it is Wall Street's favorite place to trade stock futures.
In recent years, though, neither exchange has come up with a new-product home run. The Board of Trade is currently making the most adventurous efforts here to snap the slump, with forays into insurance and environmental futures (see box). Most outside experts are not optimistic. "All of the obvious ideas have been done," said Jack D. Schwager, director of futures research at Prudential Securities Inc.
Conceding as much, the exchanges here are working hard to market themselves and their derivatives to investors around the world. The most potent symbol of cooperation is Globex, an electronic network that allows traders to offer and buy futures contracts through their computers. It was developed jointly by the two exchanges with Reuters, to allow their products to be traded anywhere when the exchanges are closed. .
Originally seen as a two-year project, Globex has swallowed about $7 million from the two exchanges and tens of millions more from Reuters. When trading finally began this summer, interest was limited because a number of crucial features are still under development. Among them: built-in credit limits on users of the trading terminals, ability to program in buy or sell orders that are placed automatically when fast-moving markets hit a specified price and instantaneous switching to backup networks.
Some critics doubt that Globex will ever generate the trading volumes needed to justify the hundreds of thousands of dollars members have to invest in equipment, fees and staffing to use it. But Globex did teach the exchanges that they could cooperate on complicated projects, leading not only to the joint marketing efforts but also to other technology projects. An example: work on Audit, a handheld order-keeping and order-entry device being developed for pit traders (an early prototype was tested this fall at both exchanges). Recording trades and forwarding them for clearing, the device will allow clearers to quickly detect errors, unauthorized trades or disagreements about what happened. The exchanges also hope Audit devices will eventually provide traders with news and pricing aids.
LEO MELAMED, chairman of the joint venture company managing Globex, said Globex is already serving its purpose of discouraging other exchanges from setting up competing systems or attempting to trade Chicago's products. In fact, Globex has agreements with exchanges in Singapore and France to list their most popular contracts and is negotiating with the London exchange.
In addition to being an after-hours home for many exchanges' crown jewels, Globex may also serve as a forum for global experiments with new products. It costs far less to put something on a screen and see whether it trades than to develop a trading pit. For just that reason, the Board of Trade recently brought on line a computer-based trading network known as Project A that operates during the exchange's normal trading hours. It can be an incubator for contracts that may grow into pit trading, or a permanent home for niche products like barge traffic futures.
"The idea is to be ready to trade whenever the demand arises," said William O'Connor, the chairman of the Board of Trade. That sums up the driving force behind both Project A and almost everything else the exchanges are doing these days.
 
 
 
COMING SOON: NEW PRODUCTS
THE Chicago Board of Trade is hoping to end a slump in offering successful new products with moves into insurance and environmental futures. The insurance contracts start trading next month. They are intended to allow insurance companies to sell some of their exposure to catastrophic risk to futures markets. Today, the insurance industry's only routine method for spreading a portion of its risks to private investors outside the industry is to sell to investor syndicates at Lloyds of London.
The Board of Trade's first environmental products are scheduled to start trading next spring. They will allow utilities to buy and sell permits to emit specific amounts of sulfur dioxide. The Environmental Protection Agency, which chose the board over other exchanges to test the concept, hopes that the utilities that can most efficiently invest to cut such emissions below the levels allowed for their plants will do so and then profit by selling permits covering their unused emissions allowance.
The key challenge, as with all contracts, is to attract enough traders so that anyone can get a competitive bid or offer at any time. And, as with other contracts, the exchange hopes that local traders will add liquidity to the market by buying and reselling the contracts in an attempt to profit from changing perceptions of their value as the specified date for delivery of the insurance risk or pollution permit closes in.

Settling Disputes Without Litigation

BYLINE: By John Durniak; John Durniak is a freelance writer, editor and consultant on photography.

 BODY:
IN the current recession, the pressure is on photographers and their clients to keep costs low by making deals and cutting corners, which makes the climate ripe for disagreements. The phrase "sue me" is being heard nearly as often as "nice shot."
Working photographers, however, have an alternative to going to court: the Joint Ethics Committee, which was organized in 1945 by professionals in the graphic communications industry. 
 The committee's main function is to help settle disputes while maintaining high professional standards. This is done through whatever works -- writing letters, for example, or arranging mediation or arbitration.
The committee's resources are available to all people in the industry, including both part-time and full-time photographers. They do not have to be members of the sponsoring organizations. And although the committee is based in New York State, it takes on cases from other states if both parties to a dispute are willing to go there for hearings.
The committee is sponsored by New York chapters of the Advertising Photographers of America, the American Institute of Graphic Arts, the American Society of Media Photographers, the Art Buyers Club, the Art Directors Club, the Graphic Artists Guild, the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Photographer and Artist Representatives.
The Joint Ethics Committee is run by four unpaid representatives from each group, and it was set up to operate independently of the sponsoring groups.
All complaints are initially handled by mail and must be accompanied by a $50 administration fee ($35 for members of the sponsoring organizations; there is no charge in hardship cases).
One recent conflict that the committee helped settle involved a photographer who had completed a series of pictures for a catalogue but said he was still owed almost $5,000 because his photos had been used not just in the catalogue but also in national advertisements. Edward Meyers, a New York photographer and writer who helps represent the American Society of Media Photographers on the Joint Ethics Committee, said it took six months and a number of letters back and forth before the client agreed to pay the photographer.
"We took a neutral position throughout the negotiations by letter," Mr. Meyers said. "If there is refusal to cooperate, then they could go to court. Good business people try to settle disagreements and not let them hang."
Robert Scott Ellis, a New York lawyer who works pro bono for the committee, constantly reminds members of the group that in negotiations they must stay neutral. Mr. Meyers said that, in fact, the committee has rejected complaints brought by members of sponsoring groups.
In mediation, a case is usually heard by three members of the committee. When a dispute goes to binding arbitration, the panel is enlarged, usually including the three committee members plus two independent experts from the communications field who are not members of the committee.
As part of the Photo '92 show next weekend at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the committee will give a seminar on Sunday called "Fair Business Dealings Should Be a Right, Not a Fight." (For more information on the show: (203) 852-0500.)
The committee is encouraging professionals in other states to form their own Joint Ethics Committees. Toward that end, it has published a booklet that includes the "Articles of the Code of Fair Practice -- Relations Between Artist and Buyer."
The booklet, $4 a copy, can be obtained by writing to Joint Ethics Committee, Box 179, Grand Central Station, New York 10163. Enclose a self-addressed envelope with 52 cents postage.
More information about starting a committee may be obtained by writing to that address or by calling (212) 966-2492.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
From Geo, a Second-Generation Prizm

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
PITY the poor consumer who wants an American car. Some full-size Chevies and Mercurys are built in Canada. Some of Ford's popular Escorts are made in Mexico. The Dodge Stealth is made in Japan. Pontiac's LeMans comes from Korea, and nearly every new automobile carries parts from all over the world.
Not only that, but the designs and engineering and economics also are a case of mix and match.
General Motors owns all of Lotus, half of Saab and almost 40 percent of Isuzu. Ford owns Jaguar and about a quarter of Mazda -- although its new Mercury Villager van is a joint venture with Nissan. And Chrysler, which owns all of Lamborghini and 15 percent of Maserati, holds an 11 percent stake in Mitsubishi. 
 It's hard to tell who is what anymore, and the new Geo Prizm sedan is a perfect example.
The four-door design derives from the Toyota Sprinter, a new Corolla that is sold in Japan but not here. The Prizm, however, is built in Fremont, Calif., by New United Motors Manufacturing Inc., the General Motors-Toyota partnership that also assembles Corollas for the United States.
Spokesmen for Chevrolet, which markets Geos, like to say that the Prizm and the Corolla share not a single body panel, and they are right. What they don't say much, though, is that the half-sisters are identical under the skin.
In fact, the Prizm looks more Japanese than the Corolla, whose lines and details are a bit busier. From its body-colored front bumper to its rounded roof and trunk, the Geo has the appearance of . . . well, of today's curvaceous Mazda or of the Honda Civic that is a prime competitor.
The front-wheel-drive Prizm has been the best-selling car in the Geo lineup ever since the brand was established in 1988, and the '93 model represents a second generation that takes the car out of the econobox league. There is more basic power, more safety, more creature comfort. Its exterior and interior dimensions also are bigger than before, allowing it to graduate from the subcompact category and step out as a classy compact.
Two trim levels, Prizm and Prizm LSi, are available. Last year's sporty GSi model has been discontinued, but an optional sport package teams a new and slightly larger 1.8-liter engine with a stiffer suspension. Antilock brakes are an option, and a driver's air bag is standard across the line.
In addition, the front seatbelts now have a five-position vertical adjustment to encourage safer driving by making it comfortable, a fillip normally found on more expensive machinery. And, wonder of wonder, Geo has found a way to make the entire hub of the four-spoke wheel serve as a horn, eliminating those tiny and hard-to-find buttons.
The test car, a white LSi with blue interior, had the basic 1.6-liter engine, feeding 108 horsepower through a five-speed manual transmission, and performance was fairly zippy. However, the bigger engine, which puts out 115 horses and adds 15 foot-pounds of torque, might be a better choice with either of the optional automatic transmissions, one a three-speed and the other a new four-speed with electronic control.
The new automatic, even with the larger engine, produces fuel-economy figures that are surprisingly close to those of the basic manual powertrain, which is rated at 28 m.p.g., city, and 33 highway. All of the engine-transmission combinations also have had their gearing and torque fiddled with, and the Prizm now produces most of its power in the middle range, where customers are more likely to use it.
On the road, the car is taut and quiet, riding on a wheelbase that is two inches longer than in the past. Tires also have been upgraded to match the 14-inch wheels that now are standard, and there are other niceties like full power equipment and a low-liftover trunk with 13.8 cubic feet of space and a pass-through to the passenger compartment.
All in all, the Prizm seems to have come of age. And Geo has kept the ticket where it ought to be. The base car costs $9,995 and the LSi $10,630. Options swell the price, of course, and the tester had a sticker of $14,417. But that is still about $1,000 less than a comparably equipped Corolla, and it is considerably less than a Honda Civic EX, which starts at $15,100.
Maybe this time we shouldn't pity the poor consumer.
 
Geo Sips Its Way to the Top
 PART of the competition between Geo and Honda has to do with fuel efficiency, and Geo has won in that category again, according to 1993 Government figures.
For the third year in a row, the Geo Metro XFi was the stingiest car sold in the United States, pulling 53 miles from a gallon of fuel in city driving and getting 58 m.p.g. on the highway. Honda's Civic VX hatchback was the runner-up, posting 48 m.p.g., city, and 55, highway.
The Honda, the Metro and the Metro's twin, the Suzuki Swift, took all of the top 10 places in fuel efficiency. Geo's Metro and the Swift are produced in Canada by CAMI Inc., a joint venture between General Motors and Suzuki. The Civic VX also is made in Canada.
Chrysler's new LH sedans, sold as the Dodge Intrepid, the Eagle Vision and the Chrysler Concorde, won the sweepstakes among large cars with ratings of 20 m.p.g., city, and 28, highway.
Rolls-Royce was at the bottom of the list with city-highway figures of 10 and 14. As they say, though, if you have to ask. . . .

HEADLINE: Flood Tunnel: A Way To Avert Tragedy

 BODY:
Re: "Passaic Flood Tunnel: A Turning Point," Nov. 8:
I find it incredible that the people least affected by the flooding in the Passaic River basin are those most opposed to the only viable flood protection measure -- the construction of the Passaic River flood tunnel. 
 As a resident of Bloomingdale and an official elected to represent all the people of Passaic County, I am haunted by the catastrophe that is waiting to happen in the Passaic River basin. In 1984, I saw the homes and businesses of friends and neighbors destroyed. I saw widespread fear and terror grip my county for days as the torrential rains swept out roads and bridges and prevented people from either leaving their homes or getting to them.
That scenario can easily be repeated, perhaps as early as next spring, if the right combination of winter snowfall and heavy March rains occurs.
Yet a hard-core group of environmental extremists -- some based in Basking Ridge, others in Bergen County, both miles away from the heart of the flood problem -- opposes the remedy for our troubles and is influencing public policy.
I respect the environmental movement, but cannot support it when its goals are unrealistic attempts to push back the clock hundreds of years. Certainly, our problem would be solved if there were less building in the flood plain. But it's too late for such pie-in-the-sky dreams. We must deal with what is; and what we have is a serious flooding problem that could become a devastating tragedy if the tunnel is not built.
The buyout that the extremists cling to as a solution is just unworkable and probably far more expensive than the tunnel construction. A buyout would require uprooting thousand of families and businesses, destroying entire neighborhoods and eliminating thousands of jobs.
Secondly, all those structures in the flood plain would have to be destroyed, creating a huge mountain of garbage -- much of it toxic -- that would have to be landfilled at an extremely high cost to taxpayers. And finally, towns along the river would have to raise property taxes dramatically to make up the loss of tax ratables caused by a buyout.
The tunnel, on the other hand, is a permanent solution that is good for the local economy, helpful to the taxpayers and not disruptive to the residents. The tunnel plan will not increase building in the basin, as more than 5,000 wetland acres will be permanently preserved.
Additionally, the Passaic County Freeholder Board has already acted to limit the water runoff effects of development in the upper basin by preserving 2,000 acres of Sterling Forest in West Milford and Ringwood and keeping it forever as parkland.
After decades of study, there is no evidence that the tunnel will cause ecological harm. There is, however, well-documented evidence that continued delay on the tunnel endangers life and property. It's time for the obstructionists to step aside and allow progress and technology to rectify a horrendous problem.

HEADLINE: NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Dover, Del.;
Highway Inn Expanding

BYLINE: By Maureen Milford

 BODY:
A HOTEL that opened in this capital city two decades ago is undergoing a $4 million expansion designed to turn the highway lodging into a regional conference center.
The 145-room Sheraton Inn Dover, on Route 13 just north of the city's historic downtown government center, is midway through the 55,000-square-foot addition that will give it a ballroom-banquet room, a catering kitchen and 11 new guest rooms, as well as 9,500 square feet of office space. 
 "We did this because we felt it was necessary to keep up with the times," said Gregory S. Kramedas, one of two principals in K & W Partnership, which owns the hotel.
He and his partner, Davis Wood of Milford, consider the expansion a first step toward the development of a multimillion-dollar civic center in this city of 27,630 residents.
For nearly a decade Kent County has been trying to promote a civic center, arena, hotel and business park to be called Liberty Center near the Sheraton Inn. Kent County is the state's middle county, between New Castle on the north and Sussex on the south.
Such a development, business leaders say, would make this city a regional attraction for conventions and concerts, drawing people from across Delaware and from Maryland's Eastern Shore.
In Wilmington, the state's most populous and developed city, similar civic center plans are being drawn up to anchor a downtown revitalization effort.
Such a complex as Liberty Center, said LeRoy Klein, chairman of the Central Delaware Economic Development Council, would give "us an opportunity to strengthen our position as the center of state activity, culturally, politically and economically."
The expansion project, by J. Roland Dasheill & Sons of Salisbury, Md., will include a ballroom and banquet room with a capacity of 1,600 when used as a theater and 1,800 for dinner.
The room will also accommodate 200 trade-show booths, and loading docks for such events are included in the design, as is an audio-visual conference room. In addition, there will be an indoor swimming pool and a health club.
Becker/Morgan Architects of Salisbury, Md., designed the space to be on the west side of the building facing what was once farmland. Before work began on the addition in May, K & W Partnership sold 33 of its 88 acres to the Wal-Mart Company, which built a discount store to the north of the hotel and a Sam's Club west of it. It was Wal-Mart's entry into Delaware.
The hotel management is already negotiating to bring in several regional trade shows and conferences when the addition is completed in the spring.

HEADLINE: Trade New World;
As It Comes Together, It's Pulling Apart

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In these waning days of the Bush Administration, with the Clinton regime still unborn, two competing forces are at work in the world, one pushing nations closer together and the other ripping them apart.
The clash between the two forces was clearly in evidence last week as the United States and Europe reached a compromise in their incipient trade war -- and farmers, politicians and others in France reacted furiously to the deal. Both accord and discord aptly illustrated how, at the same moment, nationalistic political impulses and pressures for economic integration are increasing dramatically. The resulting conflict threatens world stability and presents President-elect Bill Clinton with potentially severe problems. 
 The end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe are partly responsible. How many times from 1945 to 1990, a senior ambassador in Washington asks, was a fight over trade or politics or weaponry defused with the comment, "We can't afford this, because it might affect the East-West balance?"
No one need doubt the intensity of the feelings -- ethnic, religious, national -- that push peoples apart. Even as Europe has moved closer together in recent decades, with an economic locomotive pulling a political train, the Catholics and the Protestants have fought an undeclared war in Northern Ireland, and Basque separatists have done something similar in Spain.
Now, as European integration approaches, there are other difficulties; France's unwillingness to accept the deal reducing Government subsidies to farmers is only the most recent, dramatized by attacks on McDonald's and Coca-Cola installations and by troops in Parisian streets. Britain refuses to accept the European Community's passport plan, fearing an influx of undesirables, and Denmark's voters, rebuffing its politicians, have voted down the whole integration plan as an intrusion on nationalism. Germany hesitates to lower interest rates, its own bitter memories of Weimar-era inflation outweighing its pan-European instincts.
In central and eastern Europe, the Parliament of Czechoslovakia on Wednesday approved the division of that country into two republics on Dec. 31. What used to be Yugoslavia and what used to be the Soviet Union continue their process of disintegration into warring or squabbling states and factions.
In Asia, the Japanese worry about their rice farmers, like the French worry about their oil-seed farmers, and opt for measures to protect them at the same time they chide the Europeans and the Americans for giving in to "regionalism" -- trading blocs that might exclude the Japanese.
In North America, Canadian voters have rejected, despite warnings of economic difficulties ahead, a hard-won agreement on national unity, and there is opposition in the United States to the North American Free Trade Accord with Mexico and Canada. Even Mr. Clinton finds fault with it, though he wants to modify it rather than scrap it.
 
'Long Run' May Be Too Long
 All of this divisiveness takes place in the face of the conviction of most economists and political leaders, first, that smaller national and regional units usually mean lower standards of living for their citizens, and second, that free trade really does accrue to the benefit of all in the long term. President Bush has stood resolutely for free trade, and so do Mr. Clinton and his advisers, but there are protectionist elements in the Democratic Party (remember the campaign ad with Senator Bob Kerrey as a hockey goalie, blocking the best shots of "unfair foreign competition"?) and on Capitol Hill.
It may be that the lengthy negotiations intended to codify this widespread belief in free interchange in a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- known as the Uruguay Round -- will reach a successful conclusion while Mr. Bush remains in office. Few diplomats believe that the French really will pull down that whole temple in wrath over the compromise in the European dispute with the United States, no matter how bellicose the words of French politicians.
But the diplomats may be wrong, and even if they are right, Mr. Clinton will face long-term problems in keeping free trade high on the world's agenda.
The problem that will vex him is the same one vexing Helmut Kohl of Germany, John Major of Britain and dozens of other leaders. Giving up farm subsidies makes farmers angry, and angry farmers vote against governments. Free trade by a rich nation with a neighbor that pays lower wages may suck jobs out of the richer nation, and jobless workers there will vote against the government. Politicians do not like to alienate voters, no matter how lofty the goals.
To put the matter another way, it is difficult enough to persuade the electorate of any nation to yield even a scrap of sovereignty (which is why President Bush was insisting late last week that any American troops sent to Somalia serve under American command). Only the awful memories of World War II prompted the western Europeans to begin doing so over the last 50 years.
 
Leading the World
 It is even more difficult to persuade the voters to do so when some are being asked to yield their present livelihoods in the expectation that, down the road, perhaps in their children's or grandchildren's time, more and better jobs will be created in many countries by liberalized trade rules. Yet that is what Mr. Clinton will try to do, not only as the American President but as the de facto leader of the world's industrialized nations.
Mr. Clinton speaks of an Economic Security Council, by which he means to symbolize the importance he attaches to creating jobs and rebuilding the infrastructure at home as an indispensable first step to strengthen the role of the United States in the world. That mission seems a sensible one to most Western leaders, who have complained that American economic weakness made it hard for this country to play its world role.
But those same leaders are troubled by the very title of the President-elect's new council. To them it has a protectionist ring. It seems to some to signify a combative approach, along with his pledge to focus "like a laser beam" on the domestic economy first.
In fact, Mr. Clinton will have to focus on the problems of the world economy at the same time he focuses on his own. The two cannot in any meaningful way be disentangled. If Mr. Bush failed to assign a high enough priority to turning things around in the United States, he also took a less than commanding approach in meetings of the Group of Seven industrialized nations -- among the major forums for coordinating economic policies.
Much will happen before then, but next summer in Tokyo, Mr. Clinton will have his best chance to take charge on the world's struggling economy, and to persuade the Japanese, the Germans and the French to try much harder to put aside their differences for the larger, common good.
Nine years ago this month, Europe was struggling with the question of where American cruise missiles should be based. There were big anti-American demonstrations in the Netherlands, Britain and Italy. This year, the struggle involves trade, not weapons -- a nice metaphor for both the blessings bestowed by the end of the cold war and the uncertainties that followed.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Leticia Quezada;
L.A.'s Schools Chief Wants Power, And the Vote, for Immigrant Parents

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
LETICIA QUEZADA remembers that day 16 years ago when, as a Mexican immigrant fresh out of college with a teaching credential in bilingual education, she applied for work at the Los Angeles schools. She was turned down "flatly," told Los Angeles did not need bilingual teachers. Today Ms. Quezada greets visitors as the first Hispanic president of the Los Angeles Board of Education, presiding over a school system in which nearly half the students cannot speak English.
She also presides over what is now perhaps the biggest crisis the nation's second-largest school system has ever faced. Six months after the civil disorders and arson that swept Los Angeles, the 641,000-student system is threatened both by insolvency and a strike by teachers furious over a recession-induced pay cut of 12 percent. 
 In all this, Leticia Quezada, who migrated to California at age 13 without speaking a word of English, the daughter of a Mexican copper miner who died of tuberculosis at age 33, has emerged as the teachers' chief nemesis and a forceful advocate for the children of the deprived.
Wednesday, on the eve of a courtroom showdown with the teachers union, Ms. Quezada put on the hard edge that sometimes comes with this territory, the complex shifting politics of the Los Angeles Unified School District, and defended the pay cut imposed on teachers.
"The union is saying 'lay off the rest of the employees to pay us the same salary,' " she said in a soft voice tinged with the accent of her native Mexico. "We have said in bad times the morale of our employees is very important. It would be a real disaster if some employees feel they've paid the entire price of the economic depression this district is facing. We have said we are not going to lay off any employees, teachers or classified because we felt this economy could not afford any more unemployed. We thought it was the right policy decision.
"There's no way for any union to say it's okay to cut salaries by 12 percent. But the reality is that bankruptcy is the only other choice. In the final analysis, this will get resolved. It will not be easy. The problems we have are so complex and so huge that most people would want to give up."
Moments later, tears flowed down her cheek as she described the plight of the children of what she calls the "forgotten America," the poor and dark-skinned.
 
Up From a Macho World
 "More and more, the color of the school system looks like my family," she said. "Unless someone steps in who has the understanding, the sensitivity and the language skills to speak not only to the children but to their parents, we are going to lose this generation. The little ones, they did not ask to be born into a poor family, to go to a school that does not have a nurse. The problems have gotten bigger. The riots brought lot of anxiety and tension to the surface. Things have gotten more intense and intense. People are beginning to say, 'Forget it, it's not worth it.' They give up and start killing, committing suicide."
Leticia Quezada is one of the first of a growing number of female political leaders to emerge from the macho world of Hispanic America. The most notable here is her erstwhile ally, Gloria Molina, elected last year as the first Hispanic member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
Ms. Quezada's journey began in the slums of Ciudad Juarez, opposite El Paso, Tex., from which her mother emigrated to Pittsburg, Calif., near San Francisco, and worked as a waitress. The young Leticia started eighth grade without English, caught up and eventually graduated from high school with honors and attended the University of California at Santa Cruz on a scholarship, then earned a master's degree in bilingual education.
But early on, she said, she decided her calling was not teaching, but the politics of teaching. "A professor instilled in me a sense that rather than helping one child at a time there are bigger things like changing educational policy," she said. "I was always searching for a place to make a contribution to my community through changing policy."
To do that, she felt she had to move to a big city with lots of Mexicans. That inevitably led to Los Angeles, which she had never visited. After being rejected by the school system, she did job training, then in 1981 joined the Carnation Company, the Los Angeles-based food maker, as its representative to the national Hispanic community.
She eventually plunged into electoral politics, winning one of seven seats on the school board in 1987, representing the mostly Mexican-American east side of the city. Last spring, the fractious board elected her president. The politically powerful teachers union supported her re-election in 1991, but turned on her this year in a dispute over their contract. They marshalled enough support to thwart Ms. Quezada's bid for Congress in a bitter primary fight last June.
She has been the board's foremost proponent of two controversial notions, bilingual education and giving parents more control over their local schools, which have among the country's highest drop-out rates, lowest achievement scores and most violence.
 
Angering Blacks
 "We have a tremendous challenge in educating Latino students," she said. "In entry points like Miami, New York and Los Angeles, we believe the best way to educate these students, to get them to graduation, is bilingual education."
Even more contentious has been Ms. Quezada's proposal to let noncitizens vote in school board elections, which would greatly benefit Hispanic candidates inasmuch as Hispanic people are about two-thirds of the school population but only about a third of the voters in Los Angeles. Her proposal drew fire from the leaders of Los Angeles's black community, where frictions have developed with the fast-growing Hispanic population, and she was accused during the recent Congressional primary of promoting illegal immigration.
But she contends that the proposal, shelved for now, is a key to getting parents involved. "Over 70 percent of our parents are immigrants, very likely not U.S. citizens. So many parents are disenfranchised in choosing who will decide on the education of their children. At a time when all reform movements in public education are saying that the only way schools are going to do better is with better parent involvement, this is major form of parent involvement.
"Change is very threatening. If you give Latinos the right to vote, what is going to happen to the gains blacks have made? All of us have to get used to idea of change." In many schools in the riot-scarred South Central area, the schools are now about half Hispanic, half black. "Children have to learn to live together," Ms. Quezada said. "That is the reality most us in public office are going to have to start speaking.
"I am always going to be committed to the issues of large cities," she said, "to questions of policy rather than personal issues, always looking to the next generation. Education provides the most answers, because if you do a good job in educating children, most of the other issues are taken care of."
At age 39, Ms. Quezada has no children of her own and contemplates none. "No, I already have enough," she mused. "I take care of other people's children."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
It's China Against the World, With a Great Deal at Stake

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
THE American bullies, joined by the greedy French arms peddlers and the deceitful British colonists, are brazenly conspiring to overthrow our Communist system, subvert the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, and detach Taiwan as their permanent "unsinkable aircraft carrier." But comrades, what can we do about it?
That kind of bunker mentality, according to knowledgeable Chinese, hangs in the air these days behind the high red walls of Zhongnanhai, the domain of China's past and present emperors. If many Americans are frustrated by an inability to get China to moderate policies that seem outrageous, reciprocal sentiments vex leaders on this side of the Pacific Ocean. 
 China now finds itself at a turning point in its relations with the West, and its actions in the next two or three months may determine the course of its relationship with the West for years to come. No one seems to want a deterioration in China's ties to the outside world, but this could come to pass through miscalculations on both sides -- the kind of misjudgments that have been frequent during China's last 150 years of contact with foreigners.
The government continues to emit mixed signals, probably reflecting a tense debate over how China should proceed. The immediate question is how it should respond to President Bush's decision in September to sell F-16 fighters to Taiwan, and to France's apparent plans to sell Mirage 2000 fighters to Taiwan as well.
At the Foreign Ministry's press briefing on Thursday, a Dutch reporter noted that when the Netherlands sold submarines to Taiwan in 1981, the Dutch Ambassador was expelled and diplomatic relations were lowered to the level of charge d'affaires. The reporter asked, "Why is the American Ambassador still here?"
It is still possible -- though unlikely -- that China will downgrade relations with both the United States and France over the arms sales to Taiwan. Chinese leaders feel strongly that such arms sales violate promises to them and will encourage Taiwan to secede from China and declare itself an independent nation. The leaders also believe that if China does not make the United States and France pay a severe price for the transactions, then Germany and the Netherlands will be lining up to sell Taiwan military equipment as well.
So it is possible to envision a scenario for a downward spiral. One way it could start is if China downgraded relations with the United States and France and canceled an option to purchase six more Airbus passenger jets from the European consortium that makes them. Germany has hinted to China that if the Airbus option is not exercised, Germany may sell submarines to Taiwan. If that happened, China might downgrade relations with Germany as well. Meanwhile, the United States would react to the eviction of its Ambassador by adding tough conditions early next year to the extension of most-favored-nation trade status. Washington might also launch a "Radio Free Asia" to broadcast to China. Alarmed and insecure, China's leaders would increase the repression of dissidents and purge some pro-Western officials. They might increase military spending and sell missiles to Syria and nuclear technology to Iran . . .
This sequence of events is quite unlikely. But it is possible, as well as a reminder of the stakes involved.
"China is in a very unhappy situation right now," said a European diplomat. "They've got to realize that they can't keep on going like this. You can't take on everyone at once."
The diplomat said he expected China to downgrade relations with France over the Mirage sale, but to maintain ambassador-level relations with the United States.
"At some point, China's got to cool down and realize that it wouldn't take much to improve relations," he said. "If they just stopped talking about Hong Kong, then the situation there would recover and relations with Britain would be O.K. With the U.S., if they released a few political prisoners, there would be an improvement."
Western countries are much more willing to irk Beijing than they used to be, for two main reasons. The first is that China has lost its strategic weight as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union. The second is that China today is dismissed by many as a repressive regime on its last legs. Nevertheless, no one wants to take China lightly because of its continuing importance as a nuclear power, arms merchant and one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
Moreover, China has taken some important conciliatory measures in recent months. It has allowed many dissidents to leave China. It has released many Catholic priests from prison. Just a few days ago it freed a "counterrevolutionary," Bao Zunxin, from prison 19 months before the completion of his sentence. The Government caved in to American demands for opening Chinese markets. And in a bouquet to President-elect Bill Clinton, China announced shortly after the election that it would buy 2 million tons of American wheat.
China rarely gets much credit for such actions, in part because it is stunningly incompetent at public relations. While it was releasing the priests from prison, for example, it suspended its dialogue on human rights with the United States. The suspension of the dialogue -- which in any case was mostly alternating monologues, accomplishing very little -- is precisely the kind of gesture that achieves nothing for Beijing while reinforcing perceptions of China as repressive and recalcitrant.
There are some signs that both sides are trying to pull back from the precipice and open up channels of communication. Secretary of Commerce Barbara Franklin is scheduled to visit China next month, to help re-establish exchanges of high-level visits that have been largely suspended since the 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen democracy movement. Mr. Clinton sounded a little more restrained about China at a press conference earlier this month than he had during the campaign. And early next month China is welcoming five American senators, including some of its critics, for talks and a visit to Tibet, the western region where Chinese troops have continually put down pro-independence movements.
"I think both sides are showing a fair amount of restraint here," said Harry Harding, a China specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "They realize it's a potentially delicate situation and neither one wants to move precipitously in a way that could trigger a problem."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Poised in Haiti: 2 Kinds of Refugee With a Single Goal

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: LEOGANE, Haiti

 BODY:
IN the shade of an unfinished vessel that will almost certainly one day spirit Haitians off on a clandestine journey toward the United States, two distinct voices of desperation can be heard.
Audelin Julien, a fast-speaking, rail-thin 20-year-old who supported Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, tells of how several times he has been harassed and narrowly escaped arrest by the police for his political views. Then, pointing to the beached wooden hulk nearby, he says, "By the time Jan. 20 comes, I will have enough money to buy a seat on that boat and then, God willing, I will go." 
 Under the makeshift shed where workers saw and hammer away to complete the ship, Hilaire Altidore, a gray-whiskered, unemployed man of 58, also expresses a strong desire to reach the United States. "We have a lot of problems now," Mr. Altidore says glumly. "There's no money. There's no food. There's no work."
And almost as an afterthought, he adds: "Then you have the problem of the club. Nowadays, someone can be just standing in front of your house and the police come and beat them."
The two men -- one clearly spurred by political fear and the other by economic deprivation tinged with fear -- reflect the two kinds of motives driving Haitians to flee their country. Can President-elect Bill Clinton afford to blur the distinction between them, thereby opening the gate to large scale immigration at a time when the United States, especially hurricane-wracked southern Florida, seems especially hard-pressed to absorb it?
 
An Unresolved Debate
 The dichotomy fuels the debate over which Haitians should be considered political refugees entitled to asylum under United States law. Since the violent overthrow of Father Aristide a year ago, surprisingly little has been resolved in that debate as some 40,000 Haitians have sought to flee to Florida by small boat. While most have been turned back, nearly a quarter have been admitted temporarily into the United States to pursue their asylum bids.
With many more Haitians openly preparing to leave in light of promises of more generous treatment made by Mr. Clinton during the election campaign, diplomats and human rights advocates are still arguing over whether the boat people should be intercepted, where they should be taken when picked up at sea and how they should be processed while in United States custody.
At its core it has really been a debate over whether the United States is carrying out a humane refugee policy or simply crowd control.
American diplomats insist that their actions toward the Haitians are strictly dictated by the law's criterion of "a well-founded fear of persecution." These days in Washington, that is interpreted as meaning likely punishment for specific political acts or beliefs. Mr. Julien, the first Haitian quoted above, would appear to meet the criterion.
 
A Double Standard?
 Mr. Altidore, the second, probably would not. The diplomats say that despite the climate of violence and sporadic lawlessness in Haiti, the overwhelming majority of boat people lack true political motives for their flight.
"Of the people who have come to our attention, either on the boats or at the consulate, I would say that only 5 percent or so have a reasonable fear of being killed or roughed up or brutalized because of positions they have taken," said a United States official who asked not to be identified. "For most people, this is purely an economic move, and in this regard, Haiti is no different from many other places in the region which have sent us one third of their population."
Advocates for the Haitian refugees, however, say that the Bush Administration's policy of summarily returning fleeing Haitians is just the latest strategy in an approach that has long singled out Haitians as a serious threat to the domestic order.
The advocates say that instead of impartially applying the law, Washington has deliberately set prohibitively high standards for Haitians. The contrast with refugees from Cuba is often cited. Cubans have never been the target of interception efforts. Instead, they automatically become legal residents once they reach United States shores.
Refugee advocates say that the average Cuban refugee is much like the average Haitian refugee, fleeing mainly because of deepening economic hardship although having lived in a general climate of repression. They note that Cubans face nothing like the pervasive violence in Haiti, in which hundreds of people have been killed since Father Aristide's overthrow in September 1991.
Diplomats agree that the treatment accorded Cubans is special, but insist there is no discrimination against Haitians. They point to the longstanding guarantee of asylum for people fleeing Communist rule.
With Haiti in the policy spotlight, the new Clinton Administration will face difficult-to-navigate pressures to balance treatment for refugees from the Caribbean's two largest sources of immigrants.
"We will be looking to redress past policy mistakes, and for us that means an even-handed approach, regardless of where the person comes from," said Jocelyn McCalla, director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees.
Stricter standards for Cubans are hardly in the cards, for they would quickly face stiff resistance from the large and influential Cuban-American population. On the other hand, relaxed standards for Haitians could touch off an unmanageable new wave of boat people, both physically perilous for the refugees and politically perilous for the Administration.
A failure on the part of the Clinton Administration to fulfill promising statements made during the campaign and transition would surely raise loud cries from Haitians, blacks in general and human rights groups. But given the realities, many refugee advocates say they are braced for more disappointments.

HEADLINE: A Foreign Notion for Washington: U.S. Needs Higher Taxes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
SOMETIMES other countries view the United States as a rich spoiled brat that not only refuses to eat its broccoli but steals precious crumbs from poorer kids. This view jumped off the pages of a new economic report issued by 24 industrial nations that scolded the United States for refusing to increase taxes to cut its gargantuan budget deficit.
The report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group of wealthy nations, said that because of its $290 billion deficit, Washington was forced to borrow billions in investment capital from abroad. This, the report suggested, was turning the United States into an economic ogre -- gobbling up huge sums desperately needed by third world nations and the former Soviet bloc in order to continue living beyond its means. 
 In a snippy aside, the report noted that among the 24 wealthy nations, only Turkey collected a lower percentage of gross domestic product in taxes than did the United States. Americans pay 32 percent of G.D.P. in Federal, state and local taxes, compared with more than 40 percent for the 23 other countries. The report said the United States "would remain among the least taxed even if taxes were raised sufficiently to balance the Federal budget."
The report said America's living standards had stagnated partly because of its spending on current consumption. It warned that the nation was saving far too little to invest in machines or railroads to make the economy more efficient.
American officials, Republican and Democratic, say increasing taxes could weaken the jittery economy. And, many conservatives argue, higher taxes discourage business investment.
What should America do? One suggestion was to increase the gasoline tax 25 cents a gallon, providing more than $20 billion a year -- and helping fight pollution.

HEADLINE: The Senator And the Builder: A special report.;
Gramm's Homebuilding Bargain Raises Issue of Possible Conflict

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH with DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who is a leading member of the Senate Banking Committee, helped guide a troubled Dallas savings and loan operator in dealings with Federal regulators one year after the executive had picked up nearly half of about $117,000 worth of building expenses on the Senator's waterfront vacation home in Maryland.
Back in 1987, Jerry D. Stiles, then a prominent homebuilder and developer in the Dallas area, took on a project for Mr. Gramm and his wife, who together had bought more than 35 acres on a remote part of Maryland's Eastern Shore and needed a contractor to finish construction on the shell of a two-story house. Mr. Stiles also owned three Texas savings and loans, which later failed and which regulators say will cost taxpayers more than $200 million. 
 Mr. Stiles assembled a crew of workers in Texas, led by a skilled craftsman, and flew them to Maryland. There, lodged in hotels, they worked for a few months to finish the Gramms' 2,815-square-foot house along the banks of the Honga River.
 
Advance on Costs
 In constructing the interior of the house, Mr. Stiles advanced the $117,000 -- interest-free -- for labor, materials and travel expenses that the job was said to have finally cost. But he never billed the Senator for anything until three months after the work was finished, and then he asked for only $63,000, the maximum Senator Gramm had told Mr. Stiles he was willing to pay.
"I do not believe for a minute that the work on my house was worth more than I paid for it," Senator Gramm said in an interview earlier this month.
At least two Federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, examined the relationship between the Senator and Mr. Stiles, in 1989 and 1990, according to documents and interviews. But the Government decided not to investigate further, partly because the Senate Ethics Committee subsequently decided in January 1990 that the Senator had not unethically accepted something from Mr. Stiles and did not owe him any money. The inquiry, which was requested by Mr. Gramm, did not include interviews with important witnesses.
Both he and Mr. Stiles have described the extra expenses to Senate investigators as a cost overrun that Mr. Stiles willingly assumed. At one point, after learning that the F.B.I. was looking into the financing of the house, Mr. Gramm sent a check to Mr. Stiles to cover the difference plus interest. But after the Ethics Committee ruled, Mr. Gramm kept the money.
 
Other Questions Raised
 But an examination of Mr. Gramm's dealings with Mr. Stiles, who is now accused by Federal regulators of helping to cause the failure of the three savings and loans, raises questions about Senator Gramm's ties to members of an industry he helps oversee as a member of the Banking Committee.
Senator Gramm acknowledged that it was unusual to hire a Texas builder and savings and loan operator -- more accustomed to putting up entire subdivisions -- to help finish a vacation house in rural Maryland. But he said he wanted to stimulate the sluggish Texas economy by providing jobs for Texas workers. And he said Eastern Shore contractors and laborers had reputations for being unreliable. Three or four Texas workers eventually worked on the job.
"I came up with the idea of getting a couple guys from Texas who were out of work," the Senator recalled. "Sort of the hungry builder approach, as I think I said to Jerry Stiles."
Senator Gramm said he had not counted on air fares and hotel bills adding significantly to the cost because he had expected that Texas workers, hard pressed to find jobs in a recession, would pay their own way.
The examination also illustrates how the Senate Ethics Committee can help quiet possible scandal. In this case, documents show that the committee's findings discouraged further investigation by both the F.B.I. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The F.D.I.C. was trying to determine whether Mr. Stiles had paid for the work on Senator Gramm's three-bedroom house with his own money or from federally insured deposits from any of his savings and loans.
In reaching its conclusion, the Ethics Committee relied on affidavits from the Senator and Mr. Stiles, who never contended that the Senator had owed him more money. There is no record that the committee talked to anyone else. In addition, the committee's ruling described Mr. Stiles as a "prominent Dallas homebuilder," making no mention of his involvement with the three savings and loans, which, regulators say, were used to enrich the Stiles family, according to court filings in Dallas.
Senator Gramm picked Mr. Stiles as his general contractor at a time when Texas savings and loan executives were pleading for relief in Washington as their institutions were rolling up huge losses and Texas real estate values were plummeting.
The complicated story of the Senator's vacation house attracted the attention of regulators and law enforcement officials in late 1989, more than a year after it was built.
The story unfolded when Dallas F.B.I. agents assigned to investigate the failure of one of Mr. Stiles's institutions, the Hallmark Savings and Loan Association of Plano, Tex., subpoenaed some records of Ronnie J. Hawthorne, the carpenter Mr. Stiles had chosen to work on Mr. Gramm's home. After examining the records and talking to Mr. Hawthorne, they noticed that Mr. Stiles had run up a construction bill of $117,000 but had been paid $63,433 by the Senator.
Mr. Hawthorne, in an interview, said that after the F.B.I. met with him and discussed his work on the Senator's house, he called Mr. Gramm.
"The F.B.I. didn't want me to say anything," he recalled. "I was a longtime Republican. I called Gramm and told him the F.B.I. was at my doorstep."
 
Senator's Account
Offer by Gramm To Pay Difference
 Senator Gramm offered a different account in an interview. He said he had learned of the cost discrepancy when he called Mr. Hawthorne and asked if he was interested in doing some work on the Senator's house in Washington. He said that while Mr. Hawthorne might have mentioned the F.B.I., it was not an important part of the conversation.
Senator Gramm said that before talking to Mr. Hawthorne he had no idea that Mr. Stiles had picked up nearly half the cost of the interior of his vacation house, which he owns with his wife, Wendy Gramm, who is leaving as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He said that he immediately tried to make up the difference but that Mr. Stiles, whom he described as a major political backer, refused to accept the money.
 
 
A Cap of $63,000
 The Senator said that based on what he had budgeted for a two-story house with two decks, and the cost of the land, he placed a cap of $63,000 on the interior. Mr. Stiles, for unknown reasons, did not mention that it went far above that, though Mr. Stiles and Senator Gramm had raised the original ceiling to $63,433, from $60,000, according to Senator Gramm.
After learning of the F.B.I. investigation from Mr. Hawthorne, Senator Gramm said he got an informal estimate from a Maryland contractor to reassure himself about the value of the work. He said the estimate came in at $57,000 -- less than the $63,433 Mr. Gramm had paid Mr. Stiles. The Senator stressed that this was informal, and that the contractor did not actually look at his house. It would also not have included travel and lodging for two or three months for workers.
 
The Arrangement
An Unusual Deal: Nothing in Writing
 Mr. Stiles's arrangement with the Senator was highly unusual in the construction business. There was no written estimate or contract.
Mr. Stiles set up a separate account at Hallmark Savings and Loan and placed it under the control of Mr. Hawthorne. It was called the "Ronnie Hawthorne, Incorporated D.C. account," and Mr. Stiles replenished it from money drawn from an account at another bank whenever it ran low, according to a deposition that Federal regulators took in 1989 from Harold Wayne Ikerd, a former Hallmark official.
Mr. Stiles has not returned telephone calls left at his lawyer's office. He has no listed office or home numbers.
The Senate Ethics Committee's ruling in January 1990, which has never been made public, was issued to Senator Gramm just as five other Senators were caught up in a public firestorm over their relationship with Charles H. Keating Jr., a high-flying West Coast savings and loan operator who had made hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to senators. It also came just nine months before Senator Gramm won re-election that year.
In 1987, at the time Mr. Gramm's house was built, Senate rules prohibited members from accepting anything of value from people with direct interest in legislation. Any other gift had to be reported.
In early 1990, amid the Keating scandal, the rules were changed. Now members are generally prohibited from taking any gifts over $300, except from relatives.
To prove that Senator Gramm violated the rules that applied at the time, it would be necessary to show that Mr. Gramm knew all along that Mr. Stiles was going to pay for some of the construction work.
 Mr. Stiles bought Hallmark Savings and Loan in 1984. The executive, a former part owner of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team, saw running a savings and loan as a way to provide money for his own real estate ventures.
Indeed, earlier this year the Resolution Trust Corporation, the main agency running the Federal bailout of the savings and loan industry, sued Mr. Stiles, contending that at his direction Hallmark made millions of dollars in risky loans to a handful of his close business associates and family members, loans that led to the failure of the institution. Mr. Stiles is contesting the accusation.
 
The Campaign
Seeking to Save A Failing S.& L.
 In early 1989, as regulators determined that Hallmark was overwhelmed with bad loans and actually insolvent, Mr. Stiles started a campaign to keep the business alive with an infusion of cash from investors and the Federal Government.
He wrote to Senator Gramm and other politicians asking for support. In March 1989, Mr. Stiles visited Mr. Gramm in his Capitol Hill office. The Senator, by Mr. Stiles's account to Federal investigators a year later, offered advice on how to navigate the complex new rules that would determine which savings institutions could remain open. Mr. Stiles made his comments to F.D.I.C. investigators who looked into the Hallmark failure. An F.D.I.C. transcript of the interview was obtained by The New York Times.
Mr. Gramm, a former economics professor at Texas A&M University, said he had advised Mr. Stiles as an economist rather than as a senator, warning him that more bad economic times were coming and advising him to get out of the savings and loan business.
But Mr. Stiles told the investigators: "The purpose of meeting with Phil was the system is nothing but political. The regulatory industry is nothing but political."
According to the transcript, Mr. Stiles added, however, that the Senator did nothing to help him, and that Mr. Gramm even warned him that there was no way regulators would pump Federal money into Hallmark.
 
Letters Are Passed On
 During this same period, Mr. Gramm urged regulators to listen to Mr. Stiles's requests for aid and waivers from Federal rules. He passed Mr. Stiles's letters on to regulators, in one case calling for a response "as soon as possible."
High-ranking regulators responded to the Senator by saying that they had looked into his case and arranged meetings with Mr. Stiles to try to work out his problems.
George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which regulated savings and loans at the time, wrote the Senator that the regulatory staff was "sympathetic to Mr. Stiles's situation and is working with him," according to correspondence provided by Mr. Gramm.
Senator Gramm said it was routine to pass correspondence on to regulators.
Ultimately, Mr. Stiles's efforts were unsuccessful. The Government shut his three savings and loans in July 1989, and have portrayed them as saddled with large losses resulting from insider deals. And Federal prosecutors in Dallas are investigating Hallmark's operations, court records in Dallas show. The other institutions controlled by Mr. Stiles were the North American Savings Association of San Antonio and the New Braunfels Savings and Loan Association of New Braunfels, Tex.
 
Industry Complaints Echoed
 In the interview, Mr. Gramm insisted that unlike many Texas politicians he had not blindly supported the politically influential Texas savings and loan industry. He said regulators had praised his cooperation.
But he has also gone on record echoing industry complaints about overzealous regulators.
In 1985 or 1986, when troubles were just beginning for the savings and loan industry in Texas, the Senator said he routinely summoned regulators to his office to listen to the general complaints of Texas savings and loan operators. The Senator said Mr. Stiles was likely to have been among those invited but there was no record that he attended.
Joe Arendes, a former assistant director of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who sat in on one of these meetings, recalled that he had felt "flimflammed" because the Senator had not told regulators that angry savings and loan operators would be present.
"They were looking for us to ease up on regulation," he said of the savings and loan operators at the meeting, "not to take a hard line, not to close them down."
In an interview, Mr. Hawthorne, the construction crew chief, recalled that Mr. Stiles had agreed to pay him $25,000 in cash, plus all equipment and expenses, including travel and hotel, with no ceiling on the total amount.
Senator Gramm said Mr. Hawthorne told him that there had been a dispute over expenses on the Maryland job between Mr. Stiles and Mr. Hawthorne, and that this drove up the cost. But Mr. Hawthorne said he recalled no such dispute.
 
Ethics Ruling
Committee Finds No Impropriety
 Shortly afterward, Senator Gramm, who was recently re-elected head of the Senate Republican campaign fund-raising arm, was the keynote speaker at the recent Republican convention and is often mentioned as a potential Presidential candidate in 1996, got in touch with the co-chairman of the Ethics Committee, Senator Warren Rudman. Mr. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican who will retire from the Senate next year, was a co-author with Mr. Gramm of the deficit-reduction law that bears their names. That call to Senator Rudman ultimately led to the Ethics Committee ruling.
By Mr. Rudman's account, Senator Gramm was prepared to repay Mr. Stiles but felt it was the contractor's fault if the job went over budget. Mr. Stiles, in an affidavit to the committee, supported Senator Gramm's version, saying he thought he could perform the contract for the agreed-upon price.
Senator Rudman said he remembered thinking that a Texas developer was an odd choice to build a Maryland house. "It struck us as unusual," he said. "It doesn't mean there was anything wrong with it."
On Jan. 31, 1990, the committee concluded that Mr. Gramm had done nothing wrong and did not have to pay Mr. Stiles for the work done on his house.
 
Limited Investigation
 Mr. Hawthorne, who had detailed records of his work for Senator Gramm, said he was never questioned by the Ethics Committee. Nor did the committee talk to the F.B.I. agents investigating Mr. Stiles's Hallmark Savings and Loan or the F.D.I.C. officials who had spent months interviewing Hallmark executives, and poring through records of the savings and loan.
Shortly after the committee's ruling, Mr. Gramm's lawyer got in touch with the Dallas F.B.I. agent who had interviewed Mr. Hawthorne, law enforcement officials said. He told the agent of the committee's ruling, and that Mr. Stiles had taken the blame for the cost overrun, the officials said.
At that point, the F.B.I. team decided to drop any further investigation, given the fact that Mr. Stiles and Mr. Gramm were in agreement.
The F.D.I.C. had planned on attending a scheduled meeting with the F.B.I. and Senator Gramm, the records show.
But in an internal March 1990 memorandum, an F.D.I.C. lawyer, Mark Blanchietti Hollander, wrote to top F.D.I.C. officials that the meeting never took place. "Apparently Senator Gramm was somehow able to secure approval of this and all related transactions from the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee," the memorandum said.

DATELINE: SUMMERLAND, Calif., Nov. 28

 BODY:
Taking his first vacation since winning an exhausting one-year race for the Presidency, Bill Clinton spent most of a sunny and warm Southern California day resting at a multimillion-dollar oceanside estate leased for his use by friends.
Mr. Clinton, who has scarcely gone a day since the election without doing something that put him in the public eye and who spent his first day of vacation campaigning in the Los Angeles area, seemed determined to relax today. 
 The President-elect scheduled no events that would take him far from the grounds and beach around the $8 million Tudor-style house rented by Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, producers of several television series, including "Designing Women" and "Evening Shade."
On Saturday evening, Mr. Clinton planned to go to Pasadena for a surprise birthday party for Mr. Thomason. The Thomasons, who have Arkansas roots, are close friends of the Clintons and were influential, if informal, advisers to Mr. Clinton's campaign.
The estate, which the Thomasons recently leased expressly to provide the Clintons with a holiday home, sits on a cliff on land known as Loon's Point, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Commanding a view across the Santa Barbara Channel to the islands of Anacapa in Santa Cruz, it is about a mile from the minute downtown of Summerland, a town of 2,500 people a few miles from Santa Barbara.
Although the front of the property is close to the heavily traveled Highway 101, the house itself is some distance from the road's noise, set amid eucalyptus, cypress and pine trees. The Secret Service has established a command post in a mobile trailer between the road and the house.
The neighborhood is notably rich, even by California standards. The singer Kenny Loggins and the actor Jonathan Winters own homes on the narrow, tree-lined street of luxurious estates. In this setting, the normal commotion caused by a Presidential presence seems particularly loud. Nevertheless, Summerland seemed to be prepared to enjoy the Clintons' presence.
When Mr. Clinton arrived Friday evening -- his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, had come earlier in the day with Mr. Thomason -- he was met by a welcome banner strung across the town's main street and by several hundred people cheering his motorcade.
The Santa Barbara area, whose economy centers on tourism, enjoyed the benefits of eight years of President Ronald Reagan's vacations to his mountain-top ranch about 20 miles from the city. Presidential visits, with their bevies of journalists on expense accounts, are especially dear to the hearts of restaurateurs, and the hope that Mr. Clinton might usher in a new flock of big spenders was evident everywhere.
In the Nugget Restaurant, where a portrait of Mr. Reagan has long hung above the Presidential booth, a recently purchased saxophone now also hangs in hope of luring Mr. Clinton in for a visit.
A local jazz bar noted the President-elect's arrival by spreading the word that he was expected to drop by sometime Friday evening for a jam session. Actually, he was not expected to do any such thing, and he did not, but the half-believing anticipation that he might seemed to add a little something extra to the evening.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offering Few Hints Of His Plans for Spy Agency

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
When it comes to the future role of American intelligence, President-elect Bill Clinton's thinking is almost as opaque as the decision-making process of China's aging leaders.
Since the election, Mr. Clinton has said nothing about what role secret intelligence analyses will play in policy making, whether he favors more or less covert action, whether the United States should spy on corporations or what sort of person will serve as the nation's spy chief. 
 Last September in Little Rock, Ark., when Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, gave Mr. Clinton the traditional intelligence briefing for Presidential candidates, they talked about the state of the world, not about the art of intelligence gathering or about the risks of selling spy-quality commercial satellites.
 
Whither U.S. Spies?
 During the campaign, Mr. Clinton issued only two vague statements on intelligence needs, calling for a shift from "military bean counting" to a more sophisticated understanding of the conditions that ignite conflicts, and for better intelligence to identify nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs.
The best indication of how the nation's intelligence agencies will fit into a Clinton Administration is found in his economic blueprint, unveiled during the campaign, which would slash $7.5 billion over the next five years from the intelligence budget. This year Congress already cut more than $1 billion from intelligence spending, leaving a $28.5 billion budget in fiscal 1993.
But Congressional Democrats who advise Mr. Clinton say he will need a more complete and timely analysis of the messy problems of civil wars, ethnic conflicts and economic competitiveness. Although in 1990 C.I.A. analysts correctly predicted the ethnic turmoil that would result from the breakup of Yugoslavia, for example, the first reports of Serbian death camps were reported last August not by covert operators on the ground but by Newsday.
 
Redefining Intelligence Needs
 "The Clinton Administration will be faced with a number of serious diplomatic challenges early on that will require more timely, objective and relevant intelligence," said Representative Dave McCurdy, the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. "The Bosnias and the Somalias will be the rule rather than the exception in foreign policy, and that requires a different focus."
To meet those needs, Mr. McCurdy and other influential Democrats say, Mr. Clinton will have to redefine his intelligence needs. At the moment, policy makers bombard the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies with requests ranging from big issues like North Korea's nuclear threat to minutiae like the length of a Somalian airstrip.
A broad national security review begun with much fanfare earlier this year defined the role and priorities of the intelligence agencies until the year 2005. But instead of reducing the agencies' post-cold-war missions, the review resulted in a list of 176 areas of concern ranging from Brazilian rain forests to money-laundering techniques, a scope so vast that when Mr. Gates first presented the 1993 budget to lawmakers it did not include any cuts.
 
Decision on Economic Spying
 Democrats also recommend that Mr. Clinton place greater emphasis on reporting from spies on the ground and on analysis of publicly available information. "A satellite photograph cannot detect the actions of a terrorist making explosive devices in an abandoned building," Senator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote recently in the journal Foreign Affairs.
Mr. Clinton is also expected to review the hotly contested issue of economic espionage as part of his campaign to make the nation more competitive. Retired Adm. Stansfield Turner, who headed the C.I.A. during the Carter years, wrote in Foreign Affairs last year, "If economic strengths should now be recognized as a vital component of national security, parallel with military power, why should America be concerned about stealing and employing economic secrets?"
But a report to be published next month by the Cato Institute, a Libertarian research group in Washington, argues the opposite. "Economic competition is not a threat to national security," it states, adding that it is not proper for the C.I.A. to spy "on economic activities taking place in a capitalist global marketplace."
Mr. Clinton has chosen two longtime Capitol Hill aides to handle intelligence issues during the transition: George J. Tenet, the staff director for the Senate Intelligence Committee, and John G. Keliher, his counterpart in the House. Both men played important roles in developing legislation introduced by their committees earlier this year to reorganize the nation's intelligence agencies. More important, they enjoy the respect of Congress and the intelligence bureaucrats.
Mr. Clinton has given no hint of his choice for the next Director of Central Intelligence, and Representative McCurdy and Senator Boren, have urged the President-elect not to rush to push Mr. Gates out of what is supposed to be a nonpolitical job.
"I didn't support him when he came in, but I've come around," Mr. McCurdy said. "Gates has tried very hard."
Senator Boren, who personally lobbied 35 senators to confirm Mr. Gates's appointment as C.I.A. chief last year, now believes he will leave a mixed legacy because of the agency's initial failure to cooperate fully with the Justice Department on a politically sensitive multibillion-dollar bank-fraud case involving Iraq.
 
Impenetrable Filing System
 Improving the interaction between intelligence and law-enforcement agencies will be crucial for the new Administration, particularly in investigations of international drug trafficking, money laundering, bank fraud and terrorism. Senator Boren recommends an overhaul of the C.I.A.'s arcane filing system, which compartmentalizes information in more than a dozen computer databases and often prevents the agency's own analysts from gaining access to information gathered by spies.
"The document-retrieval system of the intelligence community, particularly the C.I.A., is woefully inadequate," Mr. Boren said. "Obviously, you're dealing with two different cultures that don't mesh very well."
Mr. Gates has defended his record as C.I.A. Director in a speech on Nov. 14 to the Association of Former Intelligence officers. He ticked off a list of his successes, including structural changes to streamline intelligence agencies, an improvement in the quality and timeliness of analytical papers, a new emphasis on intelligence collection from human sources, the reorganization of the National Reconnaissance Office, which buys, launches and manages spy satellites, and the creation of a new office to coordinate photographic intelligence.
 
Classified Recipes
 He also boasted of moving toward "openness," saying, "There is no reason why we cannot describe to the American people what it is we do, what our priorities are, our process for producing intelligence and providing it to Congress, and the way in which we are organized to do that."
But promises to streamline the system of document classification and to become more "transparent" are hard to keep in an agency that remains so closed that its recipes for chocolate cheesecake and poached lobster with creme fraiche and caviar, published in a recent issue of Studies on Intelligence, a C.I.A. journal, are kept secret because the journal contains classified material.
To abolish that culture of secrecy, Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Arizona Democrat who will assume the chairmanship of the Senate Intelligence Committee in January, recommends appointing an outsider, perhaps a successful corporate manager, as espionage chief with a mandate to reorganize the unwieldy C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies in a dramatic way.
"Gates is a decent guy, an honest guy," Senator DeConcini said. "I just think he was the wrong guy to move the agency. What we don't need is another Gates type, another inside company person."
 
Who's Who of Unavailables
 A number of the predictable contenders have already taken themselves out of the running, some explaining privately that they have no desire to take a no-win job running secret organizations where only the failures are made public. Among those who have stated publicly that they are not interested in the job are retired Adm. Bobby Inman, a former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Senator Boren and Representative McCurdy.
Some former senior intelligence officials are promoting James R. Woolsey Jr., a Washington lawyer who was Under Secretary of the Navy during the Carter Administration and an arms-control negotiator for the Bush Administration. Another often mentioned candidate is Morton I. Abramowitz, a former head of the State Department's intelligence bureau who is now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
There are few illusions that the job will be an easy one. "Reforming the intelligence world is as difficult as turning around a Trident submarine," Mr. McCurdy said.

HEADLINE: Libya Faces More Sanctions at a Precarious Time

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement this week raising the specter of further sanctions against Libya at a time when the country is reeling from rising economic chaos, deepening isolation within the Arab world and a new series of strange pronouncements by its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
In a joint communique issued in Paris on Friday, France, the United States and Britain promised "even more effective" sanctions to force Libya to cooperate in investigations of the bombings of American and French airliners in the late 1980's by delivering two of its security services agents for trial either in Britain or the United States and four others for questioning to France. Since March, Libya has been under Security Council sanctions that ban all civilian flights to and from the country and the sales of any arms to Libya. 
 The three Western nations have accused Libya of masterminding the two bombings, in which 441 people died. Libya has consistently denied the accusations.
The sanctions already imposed have hurt Libya to the point where hundreds of Government employees reportedly have not collected their salaries in months. Major construction works are being postponed. The country's oil industry is said to be deteriorating for lack of sophisticated spare parts.
Many Arab diplomats and Libya-watchers say the pressure may be taking its toll not only on Libyan citizens but also on Colonel Qaddafi, who has been Libyan leader for 23 years.
Increasingly erratic behaviour and pronouncements from Colonel Qaddafi, as reported in newspapers throughout the Arab world, are reviving talk and speculation about how well Colonel Qaddafi is coping with the pressure, at times making him almost a laughing matter in an Arab world in which he is nearly completely isolated.
In the last few days, Saudi, Jordanian, Egyptian, Algerian and other Arab newspapers have prominently displayed the Libyan leader's most recent comments, followed sometimes by exclamation points, on their front pages.
A few days ago, the Saudi daily Asharq al Awsat told its readers in a front-page article how Colonel Qaddafi decided to stop normal budget operations recently, telling Libyans in a national speech that he would instead distribute the country's yearly income estimated at $10 billion from oil directly to Libyan families in sums of $7,000 to $10,000 a year.
Colonel Qaddafi was said to have declared that the first to get the money would be the first 100,000 families that agree to emigrate to the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, countries Mr. Qaddafi referred to as "heavens rich with water that Libya does not possess," and blessed with land and opportunities.
The Sudan has been in decade-long civil war and experienced serious famines. Chad, an arid desert, is one of Africa's poorest countries. Egypt is one of the world's most overpopulated countries, so much so that nearly 6 million Egyptians work and live abroad -- including a million in Libya.
Over the last few days and weeks, the London based Arab dailies Al Hayat and Asharq al Awsat and the Paris-based satirical weekly Al Moharer have published other statements Colonel Qaddafi has made.
In chats and speeched to members of the so-called popular committees in the last three weeks, Colonel Qaddafi is said to have described Switzerland as a "neighboring country" that is "less developed than Libya"!
He referred to capitalism as "a retarded concept from a past period of history which has totally failed" and politics "another retarded concept that has been abolished in Libya"!
He also reportedly suggested that the collapse of the Soviet Union was aided by hamburgers "filled with cockroaches, rats and frogs with which the Soviet Union was destroyed" That was presumably an allusion to the opening in Moscow of a McDonald's outlet.
During the last two weeks, Colonel Qaddafi's speeches and comments went so far and wide they distracted attention in Libya and in the Arab world from the Lockerbie issue.

HEADLINE: Japan (Bush Backer) Tiptoes Around Clinton

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The Japanese Government is spreading a quiet message to the hundreds of bureaucrats, businessmen and politicians who hop trans-Pacific flights every week to the United States: Visit your factories, play lots of golf, but stay out of Little Rock.
As President-elect Bill Clinton assembles his transition team, Japanese officials, who openly rooted for the loser, say they are fearful that an overly eager rush to build bridges with the Democrats could prompt a post-election backlash. After a campaign marked by repeated criticism of foreign lobbyists -- and promises by Mr. Clinton to raise $45 billion in new revenue by taxing foreign companies more heavily -- there are words of caution. 
 A task force at Japan's Finance Ministry is already producing reams of paper about how trade policy may change in the new Administration, and the Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, is itching for pre-inauguration talks with Mr. Clinton and his advisers.
But a number of officials warn that it would be unseemly to press Japan's case before Mr. Clinton's economic team is in order.
"I'm telling my people not to make haste," Noboru Hatakeyama, Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry, which has the most at stake as the new Administration comes to power. "Every once in a while the question arises, and someone wants to get in touch with the new crowd. But perhaps it is better to wait."
Japanese business executives say that they have not received any formal directives from the Government over how and when to approach the new Administration. But several executives report informal cautions against quickly and conspicuously changing lobbying firms, dumping those with close ties to the Republicans in favor of those linked to the Democrats.
"These are issues that the business community must decide for itself," said Nobuo Matsunaga, a former Japanese Ambassador to the United States. "But I don't think they need to be told" to use discretion, he said.
But in a country perpetually in policy overdrive, restraint is not easy. Tokyo is already overflowing with ideas to broach with the new Administration, including one to scrap the Bush Administration's biggest initiative with Japan: a broad, three-year effort to criticize the fundamental flaws in each other's economies, and then force reforms. The Japanese want to replace the effort, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, with another, yet-undefined program that they say will be aimed more at the distant future and would be less awkwardly named.
But some officials concede their timing is poor. Japan's trade deficit with the United States is at all-time heights, largely because a slowdown in the Japanese economy has stalled imports.
Right now, major questions swirl around Mr. Clinton's election for the Japanese. One, oddly enough, is how it will affect Japan's domestic politics, at a time of voter dissatisfaction with the scandal-ridden governing Liberal Democratic Party.
Some young members of the party have cited the election as evidence that it is time to retire an older generation of leaders, and wrest power from a governing party that has been in for a long time -- 37 years in Japan's case. Just today a popular consultant, Kenichi Ohmae, created a new political pressure group that is explicitly dedicated to ousting the Liberal Democrats from power, arguing that they have made the central Government far too powerful.
Another focuses on the makeup of Mr. Clinton's economic team. Many say that they feel good about Robert B. Reich, the Harvard professor who is heading the economic transition team. Rather than protectionism, his books, which are suddenly being read with more care here, talk about many of the types of solutions for American industry that the Japanese have advocated.
But there are fears that more protectionist advisers are emerging, so the Japanese are also looking for reassurances that Mr. Clinton's promise to get deeply involved in the foreign-policy aspects of trade -- one of the few regions of foreign affairs that seemed to bore Mr. Bush -- would not raise a new level of tensions with Japan.

HEADLINE: How the President Lost: a Campaign of Disorganization and Disappointment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
By the time the Republican Party massed in Houston last August for its convention, President Bush's re-election campaign appeared a thoroughly snakebit enterprise. In just eight months it had been jolted by an ugly primary fight, a third-party challenge, two White House staff shake-ups, an urban riot and a seemingly endless economic slump. Bill Clinton led in the polls by 15 points. Yet the President, his political advisers say, was utterly, serenely certain of victory come fall.
It was the advisers who were starting to perspire. 
 As campaign officials told it in interviews this month, the Bush re-election effort was struggling with bouts of breathtaking incoherence. The convention had been planned largely by party officials outside the control of the campaign. The campaign itself was operating without help from the White House. The White House was so disorganized that simple political directions changed daily, and officials took seven months to hire a speechwriter for the President.
As for Mr. Bush, he was balking, refusing with a stubbornness born of pride and overconfidence to do what a candidate must: retail himself and his policies through the tawdry practice of politics.
Eleven weeks remained until Election Day. Mr. Bush still had $40 million to spend on advertisements, a week-long convention and the debates in which to showcase his candidacy, and he had just persuaded James A. Baker 3d to return and impose order on chaos.
There was still hope. Many Republican strategists believed that Mr. Bush held the upper hand, even in the dark days of August. "This campaign was very winnable until the late stages," said Mitch Daniels, an Indiana political adviser who was brought into the campaign at about that time.
"We didn't need the best strategy, or even the third or fourth best. All we needed was a strategy, period."
But there was no strategy, top campaign officials said, until the very end, when Mr. Bush finally threw himself wholeheartedly into the fray. And the lack of direction during the rest of the campaign manifested itself in every facet of the re-election effort.
Mr. Baker, while he imposed admirable mechanical order to the race, brought it neither purpose nor focus. The Republican convention killed off what should have been one of the campaign's major sales pitches and alienated millions of voters with its right-wing oratory. The Bush advertising effort began in confusion, consumed three-quarters of the $55 million re-election budget, and nearly collapsed twice in disarray.
Amid it all, Mr. Baker and the campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, erred, many argue, by attacking Mr. Clinton without explaining to voters clearly why Mr. Bush was a better choice.
 
The Convention: Dismaying Voters

The Republican convention in August was a political showcase, but not, it turned out, for Mr. Bush.
Conceived in June, when Ross Perot's candidacy was plundering the Republicans' conservative base, the convention was intended to reassure right-wing voters of Mr. Bush's solidarity. It did so superbly. The trouble was that Mr. Perot dropped out of the race a month before the convention and Mr. Bush's problems now lay elsewhere, among suburban moderates and Reagan Democrats who were swarming to Mr. Clinton.
And moderates who heard the firebrand speeches of Mr. Bush's former primary rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, Marilyn Quayle and the television evangelist Pat Robertson fled in droves.
That might have been averted, aides said this month, had convention preparations been housed within Mr. Bush's campaign, as they were in 1988. But convention organizers this time were more independent, working with but not relying on Mr. Teeter's staff for explicit instructions.
The consequences were woefully obvious.
"We were overly preoccupied," said Jim Lake, who ran the campaign's communications operation. "We didn't write Pat Buchanan's speech. We didn't have editing rights over his speech. Very few people read the speech."
In fact, the Bush camp had no censorship rights over any convention speeches, something the political director, Mary Matalin, later called "a very serious mechanical breakdown."
"We were in a deep, deep hole after the convention," Ms. Matalin said. "Even if we'd had a coherent message then, we were spending our entire time denying that the Republican Party was a bunch of homophobic bigots."
 
The Advertising: Agreeing on Nothing

While party loyalists played at the Astrodome, Mr. Bush's top campaign advisers closeted themselves at the suburban Doubletree Hotel. The talk was of advertising: there was none.
Mr. Teeter had lured Madison Avenue's top talent months ago to a new advertising "agency," dubbed The November Company, whose sole task was to create Mr. Bush's television campaign commercials. Unfortunately, over an entire summer of debate, neither the campaign nor the advertising executives could agree on what the campaign should say.
The agency workers complained that campaign officials seemed unable to describe what they wanted. Instead, proposed commercials and even topics for commercials were dispatched to focus groups -- hand-picked assemblages of ordinary voters like middle-class housewives or blue-collar men -- who registered their approval or distaste by pressing small electronic buttons or talking to group leaders.
The result: advertisements perished by the score before their most powerful elements -- the narrator's voice, music, the pictures -- were ever heard or seen.
"They had the worst sort of client-agency relationship," said one of the members of the Bush advertising team. "Teeter was clearly dissatisfied with the work of The November Company. The November Company was very frustrated that nothing they thought was worth a damn was getting through."
 
The Strategy: A Message Is Found

Determined to break the creative logjam, the strategists at the Doubletree toiled for nine hours to produce a plan for how best to use their $40 million advertising budget to promote Mr. Bush in the 75 days remaining.
It was disarmingly simple: a three-week introduction to the President's second-term economic agenda; a few weeks to compare that agenda favorably to Mr. Clinton's higher-priced economic proposals, and a concluding barrage emphasizing Mr. Bush's experience and stature and maligning Mr. Clinton by comparison.
"What was killing the President was the impression that he was indifferent or insincere in his commitment to repair the economy," said Mr. Daniels, the Indiana adviser who was assigned to bridge the canyon between the campaign and its advertising team.
At last, a November Company commercial appeared -- a high-tech, upbeat sales pitch for the President's view of the economic future. Mr. Baker's aides repackaged a dog's breakfast of White House trade and fiscal policies into an "agenda for American renewal" that Mr. Bush unveiled to wide praise at the Detroit Economic Club on Sept. 10.
But except for banners at political rallies and boilerplate explanations in his campaign speeches, that was the last anyone saw of the agenda or the strategy from which it sprang.
 
The Attack: Forced to Retaliate

Ten days after the Detroit speech, Mr. Clinton released his first negative television campaign advertisement, portraying Mr. Bush as unconcerned about the economy and showing footage of him denying that the country was in a recession.
The judgment in the Bush camp, some strategists said, was that the President had run out of time for image-polishing and had to attack in return.
The trouble was that the leaders of the November Company found negative advertisements distasteful. In August, Mr. Baker had allowed Mr. Daniels to form a "B team" of advertising experts who would take on the task. But business summoned Mr. Daniels to Japan, and by late September, when most campaigns have reels of commercials at the ready, "our inventory was pretty slim -- like, nonexistent," said Robert Gardner, a San Francisco advertising executive who was involved with the campaign.
Mr. Baker called Sig Rogich, one of the brains behind the Reagan and Bush advertising campaigns in 1984 and 1988, who had become the American ambassador to Iceland.
Mr. Rogich immediately produced six commercials. He became the architect of the campaign's increasingly negative tone on television. "He took it over," Mr. Gardner said. "He gave it some leadership."
 
The Debates: Political Soap Opera

As the advertising effort underwent upheaval, a political soap opera was developing over what many saw as Mr. Bush's salvation -- the debates.
Mr. Baker and Mr. Teeter had abandoned conventional political wisdom: that a trailing candidate engages his foe in debate as soon and often as possible. Instead, they jousted with Mr. Clinton over the number and format of the debates, dragging the dispute onto the nation's front pages for most of September before settling on three meetings.
Aides were confounded by the dithering over what they viewed as an opportunity to match a real President with two pretenders in every sense of the word.
Mr. Perot, who had returned to the race on Oct. 1, was regarded as a wild card whose political impact was unpredictable, but the hope was that the debates would expose him as irascible and unworthy of serious support. Mr. Clinton tended to turn pedantic in debates. But the President, it was thought, relished such competitions and was at his relaxed best in town hall-style meetings and news conferences.
As cramming for the match-ups proceeded, however, Mr. Bush seemed disengaged, several aides said, and the image carried to the debates themselves. Except in the final debate, where he performed well, he sat passively as Mr. Clinton wooed the audience or Mr. Perot rattled on.
Mr. Perot's presence rankled Mr. Bush. "He understood why the organizers let Perot in, but he thought it was degrading," an adviser said. "He sure didn't consider Ross Perot his peer."
 
The Final Sprint: Focusing on Trust

Mr. Teeter had argued from the start that elections are decided in the final weeks, and that agonizing over strategy was is a waste of energy. Now came the test of that theory.
With three weeks left, the President trailed Mr. Clinton in campaign polls by as much as a dozen points. Mr. Bush's solution was to cancel the briefings he was given on the polls.
Armed with a new 20-minute speech, he boarded a train in Atlanta and slugged away at Mr. Clinton with his two best remaining weapons: taxes and trust.
For the first time in the year-long campaign, a seemingly rejuvenated President and his media advisers struck the same gong, relentlessly, for weeks in a row. And something strange happened: the polls showed Mr. Clinton losing popularity, and Mr. Bush gaining it daily, in big leaps of support. On Oct. 29, a campaign survey judged the Bush-Clinton race even, at 39 percent each, with momentum flowing to Mr. Bush.
 
The Telling Blow: Scandal's Impact
 But the the tide reversed the next day. As Mr. Bush gave a speech in St. Louis, the prosecutor in the Iran-contra affair released a document that mentioned Mr. Bush and contradicted the President's statements about his knowledge of the scandal.
Mr. Clinton immediately questioned Mr. Bush's trustworthiness, Mr. Bush cried foul and the episode dominated the evening news. Mr. Clinton then gained five points in the Bush campaign's own polls and widened his lead over the weekend.
If the President felt mortally wounded, he apparently told no one. "He never entertained the possibility that he'd lose. I spent time with him," one aide said. "He never -- never -- said he thought he wouldn't win."
He did come close, once. It was on the morning of the election, as Mr. Bush stood in the Houstonian Hotel bantering with aides about the day's vote. Everyone was politely upbeat. Then there was a lull, and Mr. Bush quietly filled it.
"Well," he said to no one in particular. "Do you think we're all fooling ourselves?"

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Attacks the Segregation of Urban Schools From White Suburbs

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The de-facto segregation that divides Connecticut into poor, largely minority cities and affluent white suburbs is about to go on trial here in a lawsuit attacking the racial isolation of Hartford's public schools.
The suit, scheduled for trial Dec. 15 in Superior Court, asks a state judge to rule that segregated conditions, whatever their cause, violate the Connecticut constitution's guarantee of equal educational opportunity. 
 Lawyers in the suit, filed by the families of 17 black, Hispanic and white children from Hartford and West Hartford, say a victory could lead to a new era of school desegregation in northern states like Connecticut, where schools have become segregated not by law, but because minority groups are concentrated in a handful of cities.
 
Relying on State Constitution
 Federal courts have refused to find such de-facto segregation unconstitutional, or to address it by ordering the transportation of students across city lines.
Relying on their state constitution's provision for free public education and its guarantee of equal opportunity regardless of race, the lawyers hope to make the case that even when segregation is not intentional, it is unconstitutional, because it leads to unequal school systems.
Connecticut has been studying the effects of school segregation since the 1960's, and many state officials, including Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and his Education Commissioner, Vincent L. Ferrandino, are committed to promoting the integration of city and suburban students, said John C. Brittain, a University of Connecticut law professor working on the suit.
"The problem," Mr. Brittain said, "is that Connecticut institutions, the General Assembly and local school boards, lack the courage to make the changes."
No one denies the racial and economic segregation that is reflected in Hartford's schools, where more than 90 percent of the children come from minority groups and more than half are from families living below the poverty line. The state, in opposing the suit, has maintained that it did not cause the segregation.
"There is no violation of the constitution because the state has in no way caused or contributed to the residential patterns that underlie the segregation," said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. "There are a great many complex, difficult issues involved."
"We share their basic objective of eliminating segregation to the extent it exists and of improving educational achievement," he said. "Where we part company is simply on the legal issue. We don't believe that the courts should assume control of our school systems."
The suit, known as Sheff v. O'Neill (for Milo Sheff, a Hartford fourth-grader when it was filed in 1988, and for William A. O'Neill, the Governor then), has already survived two state attempts to kill it on the grounds that there is no constitutional violation and that the social and economic conditions underlying segregation are beyond the scope of a court.
The state, however, is prepared to call experts who will offer a much stricter defense against integration itself, including testimony intended to prove the following points:
*That desegregation has not significantly affected the achievement of black students.
*That most differences in school performance between Hartford and its suburbs are due to family background and economic status, not race.
*That most people in the Hartford area live where they do by choice, not because of discrimination.
*That minority groups in Connecticut cities do not believe integration is necessary for quality education.
*And that in any case, minority groups are moving to Hartford's suburbs at an increasing rate, achieving integration themselves.
Mr. Blumenthal emphasized Governor Weicker's commitment to achieving greater integration as he explained the state's strong defense effort. "We are open to negotiation," he said. "There is a great deal of common ground. The only potential solution that the Governor has ruled out, emphatically, and unequivocally, is a court order."
Mr. Brittain and other lawyers for the families say a court order is necessary precisely because the state is responsible for public education, including the drawing of local school districts, but has studied the issue for years without taking significant action. The statistical case, in large part, will be made from the state Department of Education's own reports.
"This court should not hold another generation of children hostage to the state's good intentions," the lawyers wrote in a pretrial memorandum.
Lawyers for the families have not offered a plan for integrating Hartford's schools with those of neighboring towns, but they do want numerical goals for the mixing of white and minority students, teachers and staff throughout the metropolitan region. They say students would have to cross the city line in both directions.
Mr. Brittain, however, envisions a process that could take 20 or 30 years to complete. He is looking not for the forced, overnight integration of 90-percent minority city schools with 90-percent white suburban ones, but for what he calls "mandatory voluntary integration," in which districts would be told what direction to move in, and then, with financial incentives from the state, could decide themselves how to get there.
The best result, he said, would be a remade educational system for the entire region that would provide a better education for everyone, white or black, urban or suburban.
"I would like, in the end, a victory for collective responsibility," he said.

Economic Council

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a co-sponsor of the Commission on Government Renewal, I appreciate your strong support for our proposal for a new economic council in the White House in "The New White House Order" (editorial, Nov. 15). 
 However, your concern over our having a misplaced focus on "competitiveness" is misplaced. The Competitiveness Policy Council, whose initial report to the President and Congress last spring helped inspire the recent commission, defines that term as largely synonymous with "productivity," just as you suggest. While the huge trade deficits of the last decade are a clear indicator of America's competitiveness problem, we explicitly rejected the trade balance as defining that concept.
To avoid any possible confusion, however, we would call the new entity simply the Economic Council. We would exclude the word "security" because, as you suggest, it could connote a protectionist intent.
The Competitiveness Policy Council shares your view that America's economic problems start at home. In proposals to the President and Congress, we will emphasize increased national saving and investment; reform of the education and worker training systems; increased investment in public infrastructure; control of health care costs; improved commercialization of technology; renewed emphasis on manufacturing, and better corporate governance.
We believe that creative initiatives in these areas, coordinated through the new economic council, represent the best protection against new trade protection.

HEADLINE: What We Need Money for and Where to Get It;
Fixing Unemployment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In this century no political party has been able to retain control of the White House after a four-year increase in civilian employment of less than 5 percent. Warren G. Harding in 1920, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Bill Clinton in 1992 were all able to oust the incumbent party from the executive office when increases in civilian employment were 3.1, -15.7, 3.3, 3.1 and about 2.4 percent, respectively. 
 Since the Great Depression of the 1930's no President has been re-elected when the civilian unemployment rate for October of the election year was in excess of 7.3 percent.
Gerald R. Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George Bush in 1992 were all ousted when the unemployment rate was in the vicinity of 7.5 percent or more.
The dilemma a President faces is that the United States electorate also dislikes high inflation. Since Woodrow Wilson kept us out of World War I in 1916 no political party has been able to get re-elected when the annual inflation rate for the consumer price index was in excess of 4.5 percent. Harding in 1920, Richard M. Nixon in 1968, Mr. Carter in 1976 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 were all successful at ousting the incumbent party when consumer price index inflation rates were 4.7 percent to 15.8 percent.
How much can Mr. Clinton reduce the unemployment rate without unleashing an inflationary spiral that might be self-defeating?
Stuart Weiner of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City noted in his 1986 discussion of the natural or "nonprice accelerating" unemployment rate (in the absence of adverse supply shocks) that estimates of this rate vary from 5 percent to more than 7 percent.
To be on the safe side, a re-election-minded Bill Clinton should probably be content not to push the unemployment rate much below 6 percent. After the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in December 1988, the consumer price index inflation rate rapidly accelerated to 6.1 percent in 1990 before it could be subdued or "cured" with another recession.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
In Trenton, It's the Vote No One Wants to Cast

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

 BODY:
There will be a lot of people holding their noses in Trenton tomorrow. That's what governors and lawmakers do in New Jersey when they have left themselves little room to maneuver and are forced to sign or vote for legislation they publicly decry.
"I'm going to sign this bill, but I'm going to hold my nose while I do it," has been said by more than one governor to indicate to the public that he is being forced to do something by circumstances beyond his control and shouldn't be held accountable. 
 But the expected passage of a package of bills intended to end a crisis in financing health care for the poor is something everyone agrees is long overdue, and tomorrow's deadline was agreed upon several months ago by Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, and the Republican leadership of both houses of the Legislature.
The trouble is that the two sides were unable to agree on something to replace the 12-year-old system that expires on Tuesday. That system imposed a 19.1 percent surcharge on hospital bills to pay for the care of those who do not have health insurance. There are approximately 823,000 such people in the state.
In May, Judge Alfred M. Wolin of Federal District Court in Newark ruled that the surcharge violated Federal law as it applied to self-insured health plans, which cover 40 percent of all insured patients.
To replace most of the surcharge, the Governor and legislative leaders have compromised on a plan to divert $1.6 billion from the state's Unemployment Insurance Fund over the next three years to pay for indigent care. The move has drawn sharp criticism from both business and organized labor and has been called "inadvisable" by the United States Department of Labor.
With that kind of reception, the administration and many legislators have been putting on unhappy faces and practicing their nose-holding technique. The plan is expected to pass, but the vote could be a lot closer than legislative leaders predict.
Governor Florio, who has been making his unhappiness with the compromise obvious to everyone, nevertheless sent a strong signal of support for it on Tuesday through his State Labor Commissioner, Raymond L. Bramucci, a former labor leader. Mr. Bramucci's task was unhappy and it showed in the text of his statement. He reluctantly supported the diversion of money from the unemployment fund but said a broad-based tax was a better solution.
He pointed to his role as "faithful steward of our Unemployment Insurance Fund," and wanted to make it clear the diversion would continue for only three years. If anyone is holding his nose during tomorrow's legislative session, it will be Mr. Bramucci.
 
Leaving at His Own Speed
 Albany insiders snickered a year ago when an advertisement appeared in an American Society for Public Administration journal seeking applicants for the top staff position on the New York State Senate's Finance Committee. Among those who did not realize there was an opening for the job was its current occupant, Eugene K. Tyksinski.
Mr. Tyksinski, a bulldog budget negotiator who has feuded occasionally with aides to the Senate majority leader, Senator Ralph J. Marino, said after the ad appeared that he was not quite ready to leave. But many in the Capitol interpreted the ad as a rather inartful effort by Marino aides to tell Mr. Tyksinski that they considered him too autonomous and, in the words of Al Gore, it was time for him to go.
Few in Albany have succeeded in telling Mr. Tyksinski what to do during his 10 years as secretary of the Finance Committee. And it was only last week, a full year after the ad was placed, that he announced his resignation, effective Jan. 1.
No successor has yet been named by Mr. Marino, although Mr. Tyksinski said in an interview last week that he had recommended his deputy, Paul Reuss. Mr. Tyksinski, who is 57, said he was "exploring options with several groups in the financial sector." He is the highest-paid employee of the Legislature, receiving a salary of $102,988.
In representing the Senate Republican majority in closed-door budget negotiations in Albany, Mr. Tyksinski has fought for more money for schools and roads in Republican strongholds like Long Island and upstate New York while arguing for budget cuts in Medicaid, welfare and other social services programs.
When the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo kick off the next round of budget talks, when they face a projected gap of at least $2 billion in the state's 1993-94 budget, the Senate Republicans will have lost significant experience. Not only is Mr. Tyksinski leaving, but the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Tarky Lombardi Jr. of Syracuse, is also retiring this year.
 
A Challenge to Mailings
 He lost the election. But Michael J. Siris, a lawyer who earlier this month failed to unseat New York State Senator Michael J. Tully Jr., a Nassau County Republican, remains particularly angry at one thing: Mr. Tully's propensity for sending tax-financed newsletters to his constituents.
Mr. Siris says that he doesn't know how many Mr. Tully sent, but that he suspects they were not all free of politics. In a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in Albany, Mr. Siris said he tried repeatedly to force the Republican-controlled State Senate to reveal how many newsletters Mr. Tully had mailed and at what cost to the taxpayers. But the Senate refused, even when Mr. Siris filed a request under the State's Freedom of Information Law.
Justin McCarthy, a spokesman for Mr. Marino, the Senate majority leader, called the suit frivolous. "The Senate has strict guidelines regarding mailings and Mr. Tully was absolutely in compliance, as were all the other Senators," he said.
If Mr. Siris wins his case, it could force the State Legislature, which is notoriously tight-lipped about its own budget, to open its books about mass mailings for all Senators. (Assembly rules provide for the disclosure of such information). As a result, watchdog groups that have long called for more extensive disclosure by the Legislature are looking on with special eagerness.
 
Economic Salvos in Hartford
 Reviving Connecticut's economy, long dependent on defense and other faltering industries, promises to be a priority in the legislative session that begins Jan. 6. And in the first indication of what shape the debate could take, the State House minority Leader, Edward C. Krawiecki Jr. announced his party's economic plan last week.
Mr. Krawiecki, a Republican from Bristol, also called for an economic summit among Republicans, Democrats and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who is an independent, that would take place before the session begins.
The Republican plan, released on Wednesday, lists job creation, a reduction in mandated requirements for businesses, affordable health care and education as its priorities. Specific proposals include tax breaks for businesses and investors, expansion of the state's enterprise zone program to include towns where the defense industry predominates, a loan program for small businesses, and new rules that would reduce the cost of unemployment benefits and workers' compensation.
A spokeswoman for Governor Weicker, Avice Meehan, said he was out of town and had not seen the plan. She added, "The state has a well-developed and well-articulated and comprehensive economic development plan, which received broad bipartisan support in the General Assembly in 1991 and 1992, and included a whole range of programs, including manufacturing assistance and funds for defense diversification."
An earlier call by Mr. Krawiecki for an economic summit was rejected by Mr. Weicker. "I don't know that the Governor views that as productive," Ms. Meehan said, "given the fact that we already have a very significant economic development program under way."

HEADLINE: In Cities and Prisons, Hispanic Gang Grows

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MERIDEN, Conn.

 BODY:
With commando stealth, the Latin Kings, about 50 of them, some in military fatigues, swept into the courtyard of the Mills Street housing complex in this fading industrial city, with guns, bats and knives, bent on bringing a wayward faction into line.
Three recalcitrant members of the gang were seriously injured in the attack on April 26, which sent children and other bystanders fleeing. It was perhaps the most dramatic incident in the violent growth of the Latin Kings, a highly organized band of Hispanic men and women who, law-enforcement officials say, have rooted themselves in Connecticut's cities and prisons for more than a year, cloaking criminal activity with an appeal to cultural identity. 
 Spray-painted sketches of a five-pointed crown, the graffiti insignia of the Latin Kings, mar utility poles and burned-out buildings in Connecticut's crumbling inner-city neighborhoods, neglected areas with high unemployment, violence and despair. To many, the very name arouses dread. Shopkeepers in Bridgeport fall silent when the Latin Kings are mentioned. In New Haven, parents worry their children will get caught up with the gang. In Stamford, the Latin Kings have begun selling drugs.
The gang, which traces its name to a cultural organization in Chicago in the 1940's, was founded in the Somers Correctional Institute, a maximum security prison, in early 1989 by two inmates, Pedro Millan and Nelson Millett, who make up the ruling authority known as the Supreme Crown, court records say.
The Latin Kings have carved the state into five regions, with commanders, presidents and soldiers. Its members have been linked to drug sales and scores of assaults, and authorities suspect the gang in at least six homicides, said Richard Palmer, the chief state's attorney.
It is not clear how big the group is. Mr. Millan says there are nearly 2,000 members. Other estimates range from 1,300 to 8,000.
What no one disputes is the Latin Kings' portrayal of the group as an organization for the advancement of Hispanic people. It is an image that the authorities see as insidious, but that Mr. Millan defends as a proper appeal to ethnic pride.
"We have to take care of our own," the fast-talking co-founder of the group said during a recent interview at the Hartford Correctional Center. His co-founder, Nelson Millett, is in prison outside the state.
Invoking Malcolm X, Mr. Millan portrayed his group as locked in a social struggle, saying: "We shall not be deterred in our quest to achieve our goals for our Latin community."
A problem law-enforcement officials face is that the gang seems to thrive within prisons while maintaining contact with members on the streets. Members recruited in prison swell the numbers on the streets as they are released.
 
Chief Philosopher
 Indeed, the attack in Meriden, court records charge, was orchestrated by Mr. Millan, who bears the title of chief philosopher, over a telephone from a prison in Ray Brook, N.Y. Imprisoned for assault, he had been transferred out of the Connecticut system after officials found his organization involved in a major prison disturbance stemming from a struggle for control of prison rackets. He is now awaiting trial on conspiracy charges in connection with the Meriden assault.
"In the past, once we got criminals into the prison system, they were removed and we didn't have to deal with them," said Sgt. Frank Rudewicz, the intelligence division commander for the Hartford Police Department.
"But what we're finding is that what is happening in the prisons is affecting what is happening on the streets," he added.
Throughout the pockets of Hispanic neighborhoods in the state, the gang's talk of Latin unity has impressed many young men like 19-year-old Harry Rodriguez.
Mr. Rodriguez has had a troubled life. He lives in Bridgeport's blighted east end alongside aggressive drug dealers. He has no job. He never finished high school. He said he served a year in prison for stealing a car, something he denies doing.
 
Joined Gang in Prison
 It was during his prison term, starting in May 1991, that he met and joined the Latin Kings. Mr. Rodriguez calls them brothers and says they protected him from thugs and rival prison gangs. They got him whatever he needed in jail: soap, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrush, underwear, socks, sneakers and food.
In turn, he has given the gang his loyalty and wears its colors -- bead necklaces of black and gold -- like armor. While Mr. Rodriguez acknowledges that some Latin Kings are involved in crime, he adds: "We're not supposed to be like that. We're not supposed to start trouble."
It is not surprising that some members like Mr. Rodriguez cling to such beliefs about the gang's integrity. In outlining the group's philosophy, Mr. Millan said that he and Mr. Millett drew up a thick charter with a cover page featuring a crude drawing of a crown. Members are admonished to adhere to the principles of honor, sacrifice, obedience, love and respect.
The rambling, ungrammatical text has 57 entries, among them a membership creed, prayers, a funeral arrangement form, a history of the organization, and a goal to have 100,000 members by the year 2000.
The charter lists 10 rules, including prohibitions on drug use, lust for relatives of a member, theft, assaults on members and discussion of the organization with nonmembers. Mr. Millan said he did not approve of violence or lawbreaking and said disobedient members faced expulsion.
But documents seized from gang members portray the Latin Kings as a brutal organization, shrouded in rituals and creeds, that punishes those who cross it. The group has an enforcement arm, a military-style band called Terminators, which exacts harsh penalties, the authorities said.
The worst form of punishment is, in the gang's parlance, termination, which the authorities say has led to people being "beat down" by five or more members, stabbed or shot. In the Meriden case, the attack was ordered because the local chapter was not complying with the gang's rules, court documents say.
Several crimes demonstrate the group's power in the prison system. One man whose name appeared on a termination list obtained by the authorities was an inmate who died after being set ablaze in his cell at the Somers Correctional Institution in April 1991, court records show.
In March, a Cheshire prison guard was accused of being a regional commander for the Latin Kings and of ordering an assault on an inmate, court documents show. In May, another prison guard was arrested in the delivery of razor blades to an inmate in the Cheshire prison who was a member of the Latin Kings. Both cases are pending, said Stephen Grasso, chief inspector for the Chief State's Attorney's Office.
Given the organized nature of the gang, the authorities recently have shifted tactics in fighting the Latin Kings. Whereas the problem was once largely left to the local police, now officials swap information to track the gang's movements.
"The gang was operating throughout the state," said Mr. Palmer, the chief state's attorney. "We all needed to work together on the law-enforcement problem they posed."
Evidence shows that the gang has spread beyond Connecticut. This summer, gang members moved into Springfield, Mass., flashing their gold-and-black beads. In September, a 17-year-old was shot by a member, the police there say.
In investigating this new, mysterious gang, the Springfield police looked across the border for help. They learned that they were up against a formidable foe.
"We were surprised that a street gang would be that organized," said Sgt. Michael Reid of the Springfield police, adding, "They've got a lot of headaches in Connecticut."

Law-enforcement officials in Connecticut say that behind the gang's ethnic public agenda is a criminal organization.; Harry Rodriguez, standing with his girlfriend in a stairwell in Bridgeport, Conn., calls the Latin Kings brothers. He joined the gang in May 1991 while in prison for auto theft and said the gang protected him there. Members recruited in prison swell the gang's numbers on the streets upon their release.

HEADLINE: As Pay for Nurses Increases, So Does the Number of Men Entering the Field

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif.

 BODY:
Gary Welch, an industrial parts distributor, decided to change careers the night he went to Valley Children's Hospital here to watch his sister work.
"I thought it would be boring," Mr. Welch said of his sister's job. "But there was this young patient, a girl, 11 or 12, who coded. Short for code blue, cardiac arrest. The activity! The nurses, the interns, all interacting. They got the girl breathing. 'Wow!' I thought, 'this is exciting. Everything going on to preserve the life of a person.' That got me hooked." 
 So Mr. Welch, 26 years old, is going to school here to become a registered nurse. So are Michael Newsome, 33, who was an oil-field roughneck, and Robert Ribiero, 40, a former police officer in San Francisco. Xavier Flores, 33, ran a cutting machine at a sawmill, Randy Shadle, 32, was an operations manager for Target Stores, and Mike Woods, 36, whose wife is a nurse, was a clerk at Safeway.
This big farming community of central California is no more a locus of sex-role convulsion than most American towns. In the Veterans' Day parade, the marchers playing flutes and twirling batons were girls, and the boys beat drums and blew horns. "Boys have more wind," explained a woman whose son was marching in the band. Men here say high school guidance counselors do not routinely steer men into the female bastion of bandages and bed pans.
But typically, after sampling other careers, men in Fresno and across the country are surging into nursing. For years they have made up a stable 4 or 5 percent of all registered nurses, or about 90,000 of 1.7 million last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But they make up about 10 percent, or 19,000, of the current crop of student nurses, the National League for Nursing in New York reports. In 1988, men made up about 6 percent of all student nurses.
Like Mr. Welch, men here say they find joy and excitement in nursing. But what makes women's work women's work is poor pay, and what makes nursing a career worth considering is that the pay is sharply rising. Registered nurses' wages range from $25,000 a year in the rural South to as much as $50,000 a year in New York, Boston and much of California. Here, $40,000 a year is common.
Pay in nursing started rising in the mid-1980's, as more and more women were going to work as police officers, construction workers, lawyers and doctors. A shortage of nurses ensued, and it persists with an aging population needing medical care. So after two to four years of schooling, a newly licensed registered nurse usually earns more today than established workers in historically male factory jobs.
Nurses' health benefits are also among the nation's best. In many communities nurses are being given more control over nursing's once-onerous hours and working conditions, and there is hardly a community hospital in America that is not bidding for registered nurses and even offering hiring bonuses. "You never have to be without a job, and the market is wide open for men," said Lee Cohen, a registered nurse and nursing instructor in Augusta, Ga.
 
'Quickest Way to Good Money'
 Stuart Barger, a registered nurse and vice president for instruction at Everett Community College in Everett, Wash., where about 15 percent of the nursing students are men, said, "You can make a family stay together with the wages." Grace Whitis, head of the nursing department at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, said 14 percent of her beginning students are men. "We do not go out and actively recruit men," she said. "They just seem to be coming in. I think it's economics. It's a good career. It's stable, and it has some intrinsic rewards."
Mr. Newsome, the former roughneck and a student at Fresno City College, said he had considered becoming a teacher. "But this was the quickest way to good money," he said, "and it's something I enjoy." Besides, he said, nursing is easy enough to master. "A patient is like a car," he said. "A car needs gas and oxygen. The body needs sugar, which is carbon, like gas, and it needs oxygen."
The male nursing students of Fresno tell different stories about choosing their new careers. But the pleasures of the work and the satisfying wages are common threads. Mr. Shadle, who is married to a real estate loan processor and has two children, ages 5 and 7, enrolled in the nursing program at California State University at Fresno after some soul searching about his career in retailing at Target Stores.
"I began to examine where I was at and where I was going," he said. "The next step would have been store manager. What I enjoyed about my job was working with people. I decided to find a field where I would enjoy myself more. I started looking for a helping profession, and nursing was the best choice by far. I can be in this career and be happy." The pay was immaterial, he said, because he can earn as much from nursing as he would have managing a store.
Mr. Flores, who is divorced and has one child, is a student nurse at Fresno City College. He said he first sought a career in farming and went to college for two years to get an associate's degree in agriculture. "I found there were no jobs waiting for me," he said. "I went to work for a lumber company for seven years. We'd be laid off for two months in the winter, and it got to where we were laid off for half the year."
"I got fed up," Mr. Flores said. "I wanted a job that gave me consistent employment. I remembered there was always a job for a nurse." So he put his name on the waiting list for admission to the nursing program at Fresno City College and was admitted three years later. "Economics had a lot to do with it," he said, "but I find I really enjoy it."
As men take up nursing, stigmas, stereotypes and entrenched relationships among hospital personnel are unraveling, much as they have started to do in other fields that were once the realms of a single sex. Confronting jeering bricklayers, Michael Prosperi, 20, a student nurse at California State University at Fresno, said, "Just ask them how much they're making."
That essential quality of nursing, the primal call to nurture, may not be so exclusive to women. "I think women are socialized to be more nurturing," said Rosalee Yeaworth, dean of the college of nursing at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. "But look at farmers. Look at the nurturing they do with livestock, caring for animals when they are ill."
Often, however, men need help in tapping their reservoirs of compassion. "If they haven't had children, if they haven't done baby-sitting like girls have done, some men are just real reluctant to pick up a baby," said Ann Walzberg, an instructor in pediatrics at Fresno City College.
So Ms. Walzberg said she often leaves a male student alone in a room with a baby. "I'll find a likable baby," she said, "and then I'll leave the room for 20 minutes. Almost always, when I come back, the baby's smiling and looking at their face."
 
'Softer and Gentler Man'
 Charles Freeman, 40, another instructor at Fresno City College, a nurse and husband of a nurse, said: "There is something that happens to men in nursing. I think I've become a softer and gentler man. The more you're in it, the more you become in touch with that side of your personality."
Still, Gordon L. Ogden, a registered nurse since 1957 and head of the nursing school at Fresno City College, said men should proceed differently from women. "They're not going to be nurturing in the same way," he said. "They should be more affirming." Rather than stroke patients softly as a female nurse might, he said, "They should touch patients firmly so they won't be misinterpreted."
Mr. Newsome said that in his experience many male patients respond better to male nurses. "Some things you just understand better as a guy," he said. "A man who wants to talk dirty will open up to a guy a lot more."
Male nurses here say older female nurses sometimes use them in stereotypical ways. Mr. Woods, the former Safeway clerk, said that as the only man in a team of seven nursing assistants in his last job, "The nurses tended to use you for pushing, pulling, positioning." But none of a score of male students interviewed here complained of serious discrimination.
"I just don't see much," said Mr. Ribiero, the former police officer. "Female workers seem to want me to learn, want me to get involved." Mr. Shadle said, "I anticipated ridicule -- 'You gay?' 'You trying to pick up nurses?' But I have not had a single person at the college or the hospital question my motives."
Students and faculty members do note differences among men and women in nursing, particularly in their choices of specialities. Men seem to prefer adrenalin-pumping assignments, like emergency rooms and intensive care units, over assignments to nursing homes and maternity wards.
"They like all that equipment, and working on a team," Mr. Ogden said. Mr. Ribiero agreed. "I want to be an air-ambulance nurse," he said. "I'm real action-oriented."
Mr. Shadle was even more emphatic. "Action!" he said. "I don't want long-term care. I want trauma."

HEADLINE: A Christmas Plea on the 'Lords' of Commerce

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
Saying that the commercialization of Christmas "devours some, leaves others in ruinous debt and punishes the poor," a group of 25 major Christian leaders have issued an open letter urging Americans to exercise "moderate and thoughtful giving" and "genuine charity."
The letter, signed by Catholic, Protestant and Unitarian leaders and issued Wednesday, is sharply critical of the "advertising lords" of Madison Avenue, who, it says, have "reduced Christmas to a carnival of mass marketing." 
 While such appeals have become almost routine at Christmas from individual preachers, the letter was unusual because it represented the collective concern of a prestigious group of clergy.
The group included the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president emeritus of Notre Dame University; the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Manhattan; Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit, and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
"I hope this statement is read in every church in the country," Dr. Lowery said.
While it is hard to gauge the impact of the letter on the public, it is bound to add to the anxiety of retailers as they face another Christmas season in a recession.
"Consumption has taken on an almost religious quality," the religious leaders said. "Malls have become the new shrines of worship. Massive and alluring advertising crusades have waged war on the essential meaning of the spiritual life, fostering the belief that the marketplace can fulfill our highest aspirations."
The letter was prepared by a group called the Campaign to Take Commercialism out of Christmas, a project of the Washington-based Center for the Study of Commercialism. It was issued at the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season.
 
'The Gift of Family'
 In it, the religious leaders do not rule out the giving of gifts, but say that the stress should be on the "altruistic and reflective."
"For some," they add, "this may mean giving the gift of family, baking and breaking bread with old and young alike. It means opening our hearts to family and friends, and more, to those we do not know personally but whose needs we recognize."
The letter also warns about the consequences on the environment of excessive gift-giving. "We must be mindful of how our addiction to consumer goods is devastating the planet," it says. "Let us instead invest in renewing our own spirits, our relationships and our natural environment."
The coalition is sending the statement to hundreds of local and regional church organizations and is encouraging the clergy to discuss the issues in their sermons as part of the coordinated effort.
Among the others who signed the appeal were the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches; Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the Rev. Robert Kaufman, interim senior minister of the East Shore Unitarian Church in Bellevue, Wash.

HEADLINE: Shift for Urban Renewal: Nurture the Grass Roots

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
LaVerne Cooper and Deborah Gibson spend their days about two blocks apart in the Sandtown neighborhood, where pride is more memory than reality. But a chasm separates Mrs. Cooper, who has a job and will soon own her home, from Mrs. Gibson, a former heroin addict daunted by the demands of any given day.
Now a generation of urban crusaders is trying to bridge that divide in Sandtown-Winchester, a cluster of 71 blighted blocks just west of downtown named for the residue that gravel-laden carts once left on its streets as they traveled from a nearby quarry. 
 Over the last three years, various public and private groups have joined forces in Sandtown-Winchester to see if this neighborhood of 10,000 people can again become a place where people will want to stay. Their plans offer a view of the latest tactics in the war on poverty: not just urban renewal but a wide array of strategies, large and small, to help make inner-city residents willing and able to meet the demands of owning their own homes.
Like similar public-private projects in the Bronx, Chicago and Milwaukee, the effort here hopes to avoid the rubble of failed programs by attacking on several fronts at once. They include training a few people to monitor the health of their neighbors; hiring others to cajole their neighbors into participating in meetings about the future; creating a day-care center where mothers are asked to volunteer time in lieu of payment, and trying to enable people to buy homes and keep them.
Mark V. Levine, director of the urban studies program at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, calls the strategy a mixture of ideas from the 1960's and 80's: grass-roots social-services in the neighborhood combined with the idea of public-private partnerships.
The hope, he said, is "you rebuild the physical infrastructure, the social fabric, and you create a viable neighborhood out of one that is demolished."
The planners believe that earlier initiatives failed in part because they had imposed programs that were out of step with the residents' goals or abilities.
"Experience tells you that if you bring things in from the top down, they are not going to work," said Pat Costigan of the Enterprise Foundation, a partner in the Sandtown initiative. "We believe things can be done rooted in a community base."
Among the other partners are the administration of Mayor Kurt Schmoke; a local church, New Song Community, and Habitat for Humanity, the community redevelopment group given high visibility by former President Jimmy Carter.
More than anything, the Sandtown program and others like it try to avoid overpromising. The hope is that concrete results -- lives like LaVerne Cooper's -- will speak for themselves and make success contagious. If people like Deborah Gibson believe they can do more than just survive, the advocates say, then Sandtown and other islands in urban America's archipelago of decay can be transformed.
 
The Challenge Of Transformation
 Mrs. Cooper knows from experience how much Sandtown has changed in the last generation or so, and how challenging it will be to revive it.
She was born in the neighborhood 39 years ago, when jobs were plentiful and segregated housing patterns kept the neighborhood both black and economically diverse. It is so different now, she said recently. "This couldn't be the neighborhood I grew up in, no matter what," she said. "The role models left. You can't get them to move back. But you can take what you have and work with it."
Mrs. Gibson, a 43-year-old mother of seven and grandmother of four, lives from one welfare check to the next. She smiles a lot, and her sentences are laced with thanks to God and Jesus, whose image looks down from a drawing on a crumbling wall.
In many ways Mrs. Gibson embodies Sandtown's depressing statistics. Forty percent of the households depend on welfare; almost 50 percent of working-age people were out of work during the 1990 census, before the 1991 recession. More than 1,000 of 4,500 dwellings are vacant; only 19 percent of the occupied houses are owned by the people who live in them.
"The real job the Enterprise Foundation faces," said its founder, the developer James Rouse, "is to demonstrate that these conditions are correctable and will cost less to correct than the cost of supporting the neighborhood in its current nonworking state."
Mr. Rouse, whose vision turned around the downtowns of Baltimore, Boston and Norfolk physically and financially in the 70's and 80's, is now pressing with the same passion in the Enterprise Foundation to make poor neighborhoods work.
 
Meet, Clean Up And Then Build
 Four blocks from Mrs. Gibson's home, past cracked brick housefronts and a blocklong lot strewn with a mosaic of glass shards, a dozen residents hacked away vines covering two abandoned houses one recent afternoon.
Most of the workers were middle-aged or older. They had seen urban renewal programs come and go while drug dealers came and stayed. Some were volunteers; others, like 40-year-old Jerry Cross, were paid by the partnership to be "community organizers," a link between the neighborhood and the men and women downtown with the charts and graphs and glossy "vision statements."
"I had a lackadaisical attitude at first," said Mr. Cross, a lifelong Sandtown resident. "Was this really something that could make a difference?
"What changed my mind was the statistics. I've been in this community for 35 years, and for the first time I can see, the people who are my friends are dying around me. What was going on was affecting the people who play with my kids, the people I see on the basketball court. Things are getting worse. We could remain the same and not do nothing. Or we could do this."
Four sweaty hours of work on the vines left the 1100 block of North Gilmor Street a little less bleak. Small changes, like cleanups and neighborhood garden plots, have given the partnership a chance to get residents involved.
This is part of the effort to convince people that they can change things. Another element is coordination of services. Child care and day care are integrated with job training and employment counseling; health programs are coordinated with programs for addicts or alcoholics, and home ownership is coordinated with everything.
"Our approach has to be to identify each dysfunction and take care of it," Mr. Rouse said.
Barbara Bostic, an aide to Mayor Schmoke who heads the Sandtown project for the city, has been at work for months in community meetings on health, crime, education and housing, trying to get residents to lay out their needs.
"We're not going to try and retrieve the same spirit they had in the past when Pennsylvania Avenue was the cultural center of black Baltimore," Mr. Schmoke said, referring to a main avenue bordering Sandtown. "But we're trying to build on the old things. The new homeowners will have an attachment to Sandtown."
 
Homes, Yes. Jobs, Maybe.
 Most of Sandtown's new homeowners live in 227 detached houses financed by the city, state and Federal governments through a $4.9 million grant. These houses replaced the area's biggest eyesore, the huge abandoned Schmidt's Bakery plant, which was razed, and they were bought by employed families with annual incomes of at least $12,000.
While most of those families came from elsewhere in the Baltimore area, poorer Sandtown residents have another hope for home ownership: Habitat for Humanity. In the last two years, the organization's local director, Allan Tibbels, has given keys to renovated houses to eight local residents.
Seven more houses are now being rehabilitated, and Mrs. Cooper is scheduled to take over one of them. Like the other Habitat homeowners, she will have to make a cash contribution, but it could be as low as a few hundred dollars, depending on her earning power and resources. She will also have to put in at least 300 hours of "sweat equity" like nailing in new walls and shingles.
Habitat shares its local headquarters building with the New Song Community Church, an urban ministry of the Presbyterian Church run by the Rev. Mark Gornick. A church-sponsored clinic, day-care center and after-school program are also in the building.
Mr. Gornick, who has been here about four years, is like scores of other young ministers who feel that their vocation leads them to areas that, they say, society has abandoned.
"This has been a throwaway community," Mr. Gornick said, trying to make himself heard over the thrumming of a police helicopter. "People have treated it like trash.
"To rebuild communities you've got to see them as a whole. What are the building blocks? Good schools. Job opportunities. An economic stake in the community. Homeownership."
But jobs, one of the most obvious needs in a city that has lost 40,000 in manufacturing in the last 15 years, are something no one can guarantee.
"Jobs are an enormous challenge," said Mr. Costigan from Enterprise. "You've got a chasm between where people are in terms of skills, and where the jobs are."
Experts in urban policy are also cautious.
Programs like the ones in Sandtown-Winchester "shouldn't be evaluated as a strategy to try and change the whole neighborhood," said Gary Orfield, a professor of education and social policy at the University of Chicago. "This is a maneuver against the grain of policy to provide something for families who would otherwise have nothing."
 
The Present And the Future
 Sandtown-Winchester, whose population is 98 percent black, has ample suspicion of white outsiders and their projects. Jerry Cross once thought Mark Gornick was a drug dealer; other residents, Mr. Gornick said, took him and Mr. Tibbels, the Habitat leader, for narcotics agents.
But as residents like Mrs. Cooper and a few others joined forces with the outsiders, people began to take notice. Deborah Gibson, for example, has put herself on Habitat's list of 100 or more would-be homeowners, a list that signals not only hope but a kind of faith in the neighborhood and a willingness to stay and help rebuild it.
"Everybody likes Sandtown," said Mrs. Gibson's oldest daughter, 22-year-old Octavia Teal, who has four children of her own.
Not exactly, said her sister Shanna, an 18-year-old former member of a girl gang: "They like it, but they don't like how they live. You want to print something? Print this: 'Someone help Shanna Teal!' "
Her mother said: "The whole thing is survival. The whole thing is, 'How can I live day to day?' "

HEADLINE: Immigrants' Faith Lifts the Housing Market

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
When Tricia and Philip Chen landed on American soil in 1990, having endured an eight-year wait to gain entry from their native Taiwan, buying a house was low on their list of family priorities, somewhere below becoming fluent in English and obtaining credit cards.
But priorities quickly changed. 
 The Chens, now proud owners of a four-bedroom house in Park Ridge, N.J., are among large numbers of immigrants to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut who have been buying homes, even during the depths of a long housing slump that has discouraged many of their native-born counterparts.
And while no one expects the immigrants by themselves to fuel a quick recovery of the housing market, analysts attribute their aggressive buying to a bedrock faith in the long-term value of real estate, a widespread belief that home ownership represents full enfranchisement in American society and the professional skills and hefty financial resources that some -- but far from all -- recent arrivals have brought to the region from abroad.
 
Lender's Survey
 "This gives us stability," said Mrs. Chen, whose husband is an engineer with Reebok International who spends much of his time working on research-and-development projects in Asia. In English that is brisk but still slightly broken, she said she still marvels at how big their New Jersey house is, compared to the cramped quarters that even affluent families must accept in her native country.
"In Taiwan, you would have to be a millionaire," she said.
Although precise data on how many immigrants are buying homes in the region are not available, one new measure is provided in a survey of 800 people by the Dime Savings Bank of New York, a large mortgage lender.
The survey results, released this month, found that 26 percent of the homes and apartments purchased during the last 12 months in New York City, Westchester, seven counties in northern New Jersey and on Long Island were people who had been born outside the United States.
Were the same results derived from a study that was confined to New York City -- as much as ever a "city of immigrants" -- analysts said they would not have come as a surprise. Indeed, after huge levels of immigration from the Caribbean, South America and Asia during the 1980's, city records show that fully one-third of its residents were born outside the country.
But considering the fact that in the area surveyed by the Dime, immigrants make up only 16 percent of the population, the figures took on added significance.
"The study highlighted the importance of the immigrant market in helping stimulate an economic recovery," said David J. Totaro, the Dime's director of marketing. In the survey, the bank also asked respondents about their home-buying intentions, and concluded that immigrants would also make up about a quarter of the region's home buying public during each of the next three years.
In fact many immigrants profess a greater faith than other homebuyers in the national and regional economy and little fear that the housing slump will last much longer.
"Since we are in a recession, I got a better house at a better price," said V. N. Prakash, a native of India who owns a jewelry business in Jackson Heights, Queens, and bought a large new five-bedroom home here in Farmingdale in 1990. "Things have to bounce back eventually."
The region's housing market remains mired in a slump that is now more than four years old. The Dime's survey comes at a time of evidence that home sales elsewhere in the nation are beginning to emerge from the trough. On Wednesday, a report by the National Association of Realtors in Washington said that existing home sales rose by 9 percent across the nation in October, the biggest increase in six years.,But it said sales in the nine Northeastern states, including the New York region, rose by only 2 percent.
But Mr. Totaro said the Dime study also provided a warning to banks. "We have got to better accommodate the needs of immigrant buyers," he said.
The growing importance of immigrants to the housing market is forcing lenders to rewrite some of their rules, including providing the bank with a detailed credit history and a birth certificate, that have proven to be obstacles to people not born in the United States.
For instance lenders, who have long been careful not to accept down payments unless they can be sure that the money is actually that of the borrower, say they have been increasingly presented with unconventional propositions from loan applicants, some of whom have even presented themselves with suitcases filled with cash.
 
Distrust of Banks
 "We are still trying to establish a policy for mattress money," said Michael J. Burke, manager of the Affordable Housing Program at Chemical Bank, which was established in January to make mortgage loans to families with incomes no higher than $60,750, and which has dealt extensively with immigrants from the Dominican Republic and elsewhere in the Caribbean and Latin America.
Many immigrants, because of their experience in their native lands, distrust banks. They often try to keep their borrowing to a minimum by making large down payments and in some cases even offer to pay for homes entirely in cash. But they often lack the credit histories that are normal for people who have credit cards, car loans and other experience as borrowers.
Still, the financial clout of some immigrant groups -- those from Korea and the Dominican Republic in particular -- is often enhanced by cultural traditions in which money is pooled among several members of a family or groups of friends.
At Chemical, Mr. Burke said, "25 percent and 50 percent down payments are very common" among immigrant buyers, forcing the bank to liberalize its rules for monitoring the sources of cash down payments.
To make sure that borrowers have not gone deep into debt to raise the down payments, or produced the money through criminal activity, lenders have traditionally sought documentation of how the down payment funds were raised. And applications have been rejected from applicants who received money from people other than their relatives.
But now, Mr. Burke said, Chemical is far more willing to accept down payments that have been raised by groups of immigrants. In such cases the applicants provide a letter from other members of the pool explaining how the pooling arrangement works.
 
Lack of 'Green Card'
 Another problem for some immigrants is the lack of a "green card," or documentation from their foreign employers. At Dime, Mr. Totaro said a past requirement that all applicants who are not citizens provide a green card has been changed -- now the rule is waived whenever an applicant makes a down payment of at least 25 percent.
Still, the attempts by banks to accommodate immigrant borrowers have not eliminated all hurdles.
"It seems to me that banks would want to make it easier for immigrants to engage in traditional American business practices," said Orlando Acosta, deputy director of New York City's Human Rights Commission, a Dominican immigrant who is among the hundreds of Dominicans who have purchased cooperative apartments in recent years in the Inwood section of Manhattan.
He said requirements by banks for green cards and other documentation from immigrants remain excessive and unfair. "They are just making things more cumbersome and more intimidating for people who don't represent credit risks," he said.
In Park Ridge, Mrs. Chen said she, too, found the process of obtaining a mortgage loan daunting. At the time, neither she nor her husband had credit cards or sufficient credit histories in the United States to satisfy normal policies of New Jersey lenders.
They also did not have enough cash for a 20 percent down payment on their house and were forced to borrow the money from Mr. Chen's sister.
But despite the hurdles, Mrs. Chen and other immigrants said they were not surprised that people born in other countries had emerged as a strong component in an otherwise sluggish real-estate market.
"In Asian countries, people have a very different cultural attitude toward owning real estate," said Grace Lu Volkenhouse, a specialist in minority lending for the State of New York Mortgage Association, and herself a Korean immigrant.
"We take a very long view of the world," she said, adding that many buyers who have personal roots in Asia have been undeterred by the region's housing slump. "We will invest and sit it out," she said.
In this suburb in eastern Nassau County, Mr. Prakash, the Jackson Heights jeweler, shares her optimism. He purchased his house last year after arriving in New York City in 1979, starting his jewelry business in 1984 and prospering.
He said he was attracted to the Farmingdale subdivision by a fellow Indian immigrant who first showed him the house he ultimately purchased and now expects his own family's move here to be part of the first wave of Indian immigrants moving from the congestion of Queens to the suburbs of eastern Nassau County.
"Buying a house on Long Island will always be a prestigious thing to do," he said.
Now Mr. Prakash says he cannot be sure when the recession and housing slump in the region will end. But he says he is certain it will. "This is America," he said, "and I can wait."

HEADLINE: NOV. 22-27: Economic Upturn;
Too Late for Bush, Too Early for Clinton

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The economic bulletins in the waning days of the Bush Administration are proving to be good news (though much too late) for President Bush -- and a bit awkward for President-elect Bill Clinton.
Last week, the Commerce Department issued several reports showing that the economy has been much stronger this autumn than most people realized. It grew at a hearty rate of 3.9 percent a year in the third quarter, much more than the initial estimate of 2.7 percent. Americans also earned more money in October and spent more, the department said. 
 But Mr. Clinton may not find comfort in the timing of the news. For one thing, it reduces his chances of being able to claim credit some day for the economic recovery that may already be under way. It also appears to weaken any argument for a quick jolt of Federal spending to stimulate the economy.
During the election campaign, Mr. Clinton proposed a wide variety of programs, including extra money for the nation's bridges, highways and communications links. But in recent weeks he has stopped short of saying whether he is willing to widen the deficit by spending more money while delaying any tax increases.
If the economy is indeed growing strongly again, such measures could seem unnecessary; tax revenues would be expected to rise eventually even without tax law changes. This would make additional money available for domestic programs without increasing the budget deficit. And that would be one argument for waiting before embarking on any big spending programs.
For the moment, Mr. Clinton and his aides still emphasize lingering economic weaknesses. "There's some increased activity," Mr. Clinton said on Wednesday. "But manufacturing is still in some trouble. There's still a lot of structural layoffs planned and Boeing announced another layoff today."

HEADLINE: What Is a 24,000-Square-Foot White Elephant?

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
28 rms. Riv vu.
That capsule description is about the only thing conceivably compact about Arlene and Gene Kule's Riverdale home, a 24,000-square-foot Tuscan-style, coral-faced mansion so secluded one can ski down the driveway. The house, which offers a majestic tower and sweeping views of the Hudson River and Palisades, went on the market shortly after the Bronx couple opted for a life style change after their three grown daughters moved out. 
 Seven years later, the house, which the deal-ready Kules say is worth $3.5 million -- is still for sale, the price negotiable. Their daughters have moved back, so disillusioned by what passes for luxury in Manhattan that they reclaimed rooms of their own under their parents' capacious roof. The Kules are even talking less about changing their life style and more about staying put and changing the decor, having learned that selling one of the city's largest houses is no easy task despite low interest rates.
"Listen," said Mrs. Kule, her optimism echoing inside the marble-floored foyer. "You got a nice family that wants a fantastic home and tradition? This house brings tradition."
 
Architect's Masterpiece
 It also brings some bizarre proposals for alternative financing. The Kules have been offered everything from a fleet of luxury cars to a chain of grocery stores in exchange for the mansion. They declined, more intent on cash, thank you.
Known as the Campagna House, the mansion was built in 1922 by Anthony Campagna, a Sicilian immigrant who made his fortune building luxury apartment houses. The Federal Writers Project declared it "one of the finest villas in the East" and the masterpiece of Dwight James Baum, the architect who designed the house and its surrounding estate, which has since been broken up for other houses.
A dozen years ago the Kules forsook both their Park Avenue duplex and their country house in Connecticut after Mrs. Kule accidentally knocked on the mansion's door. She had mistaken the stately home for her daughter's school, and set her heart on buying it when she learned it was for sale. They paid about $1.5 million.
"It was a little piece of Europe," she said. "Oh, well, a big piece."
Less than 15 miles from mid-Manhattan, the mansion sits on 3.5 leafy acres, including a long cobblestone driveway leading to a fountain in the front and an elegant pool flanked by an orangerie in the back. Inside, the house boasts marble floors, ornately gilded ceilings and thick, carved doors among its two dozen or so rooms -- Mrs. Kule isn't sure of the total. The basement features a ballroom that accommodates several hundred revelers, although Mrs. Kule admitted she hardly ever ventured down there anymore.
 
From Working Class
 Not that she has much time. She, her husband and daughters work at the Silk Club, their family-owned business in Manhattan that manufactures garments made from machine-washable silk. Her job requires her to travel a lot, visiting suppliers and factories in the Far East.
Mrs. Kule's origins are a little nearer east -- she was raised in the Vladeck Houses on the Lower East Side. Her husband hails from Brownsville, Brooklyn. They shared a working-class upbringing before marrying and striking it rich in the garment business.
Mr. Kule admitted he felt a bit odd when his friends from the old neighborhood came by the mansion to help him celebrate his 50th birthday. They walked around the cavernous house, half in shock.
"I told some of them it was rented," Mrs. Kule said. "I was embarrassed."
Nor was Mr. Kule's mother sold on the idea of such a large house, and greeted it with skepticism when she first visited.
"You going to take in boarders?" Mr. Kule remembered her asking. "But she wasn't happy when I lived on Park Avenue either. She thought it was too dark."
 
Sale Foiled
 The mansion itself is never dark, even when the Kules embark on their frequent business trips, leaving behind their live-in help. Those voyages may take them far from home, but the home is never far from their thoughts.
"When we travel throughout the world, she calls and asks 'How's our kid? How's everything about the house?' " Mr. Kule said. "She doesn't even ask about the children."
When their daughters embarked on their own lives away from home, and their rapidly growing business entailed more meetings and entertaining in Manhattan, the Kules decided to sell the house. A food corporation in search of a new headquarters was eager to move in, but that set off a wave of opposition from neighbors who feared that a business in their midst would attract too much traffic and alter the sedate nature of the area. The sale became mired in litigation and was ultimately derailed last year, bringing the Kules back to square one.
Once they were offered 200 Mercedes-Benzes in exchange for the house. Another time, they were offered a chain of grocery stores. The Kules inspected the stores, but declined the barter.
"It doesn't turn out to be a good deal," said Farrah Kule, their daughter. "You're just taking somebody's headache away. Why not sell it and give us the cash? We don't want to get into business, we just want to sell the house."
Their efforts have attracted celebrities. The Kules said the Rev. Sung Myung Moon expressed interest in the mansion.
And Farrah Kule chuckles at the memory of her high school prom night in 1986 when Darryl Hannah, who starred as the mermaid in the movie "Splash," arrived to inspect the property with the musician Jackson Browne -- just as the Kules were frantically trying to extinguish a smoky fire caused by a stuck flue in a fireplace.
"My dad was at the front door and he called her the fish or the mermaid or something," Farrah said. "The fireplace was smoking, I'm dressed for my prom with my boyfriend and we were all running to get water."
And Ms. Hannah and Mr. Browne?
"They had some fling and went to South America or something," Mrs. Kule said. No sale.
The Kules have learned how to weed out curiosity seekers who darken their doorway. Sometimes it seems that every other "buyer" is a wide-eyed gawker asking if anyone famous ever lived in the mansion.
"I think they're looking to kill a Sunday," Mr. Kule said. "A lot of Sundays."
While not wanting to deter potential buyers, the Kules are upfront about upkeep: $22,000 in taxes, $6,000 for insurance and $7,000 for utilities.
The only moving trucks to roll up their driveway lately have been the ones hauling home their daughters' belongings. Each of them has several rooms on the second floor that they treat as their own apartments.
"It seems silly when you have this house to rent an expensive apartment in the city, a cubicle, when you can live here," Farrah said.
In fact, the whole family may slowly be realizing that it may be silly to live anywhere else. Mrs. Kule is talking about refurbishing and taking a spiritual cue from the Far East, perhaps settling in for the long haul.
In her travels, she said, she has come to admire the Chinese respect for family.
"You ever see a Chinese person in an old-age home?" she said. "They just extend the family. This house could help me do that. Nobody could throw me away."

HEADLINE: 81st Annual Campaign For the Neediest Begins

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
After roaming the country as a migrant farm worker for more than two decades, Rene P. Velez returned to New York City in 1989 in search of his childhood. He spent his first 36 hours on the elevated subway lines he remembered riding as a young boy, peering out the windows for a glimpse of a familiar station, building or street.
When he found none, he felt that his identity would remain forever clouded, that the future held nothing for him because he had no past on which to build. Angry and despondent, he tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of pills. 
 "I took the whole bottle because I didn't know how to get help," he said the other day as he reflected on a long struggle with mental illness.
Three years later, after a number of stays in psychiatric hospitals, Mr. Velez, 39 years old, has finally come to terms with his rage and depression. His life has changed markedly, he said, because of a program for the mentally ill sponsored by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The Neediest Cases begins its 81st annual campaign today amid a relentless recession in New York City that has heaped added burdens upon charities. Many are trying to aid growing numbers of newly unemployed while also caring for people like Mr. Velez.
 
Record Amount Last Year
 This year, the fund starts with $257,431.56. Last year's campaign was the most successful ever, raising $5,083,550.81. That figure included thousands of small donations from people who could not spare much, but gave nonetheless because they still believed in the ideals embodied by the fund.
"Despite tough times, all of us involved in the Neediest Cases Fund are optimistic that readers will respond to this year's appeal and match the record contributions of the last drive," said Arthur Gelb, president of The New York Times Foundation, which administers the fund.
"Many of the leading charities in our city," he added, "depend on these contributions to ease the suffering of those struggling to survive under unbearable hardships: the traumatized homeless, the abandoned children, the dying victims of AIDS and tuberculosis, the homebound elderly in need of hot meals, the new immigrants with no place to go. The need to alleviate their agony is urgent."
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund was born in 1911, when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times, decided that his readers would be eager to improve their city if only they knew about the poverty around them. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.
The Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all contributions are given directly to the seven charities, which must rely more and more on private donations because of strained budgets and reduced government assistance.
"We have more to do, with either a little less or the same resources," said Dr. Megan E. McLaughlin, executive director of another Neediest charity, the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. "My big fear is that we keep increasing case loads. While it's not an easy thing for people to understand, that will have long-term consequences."
 
'They Listen'
 Mr. Velez enrolled in May in Project Moving On, a program at the Brooklyn Bureau that tries to help people with a history of psychiatric hospitalizations live on their own. At first, he was rebellious and disruptive, seemingly unable to overcome a distrust of authority figures that lingered from his days in mental hospitals. He often lashed out at his counselors for urging him to talk about his parents, who abandoned him when he was a child, touching off repeated bouts of depression.
But gradually, he let his guard down.
"The people here, they listen," he said. "It's one of the most basic, most important things, because when you find someone to listen to you, you have trust. When you find someone dictating to you, you have mistrust."
Mr. Velez has turned into a leader at the Brooklyn Bureau, channeling his energy into working as an advocate for the views of the mentally ill. He runs meetings in which patients in the project talk about their problems and has discussed his concerns about the mental health system with city and state officials.
"They need to hear our voices," he said. "There is a percentage of people in the mental health system who can really function like I can function. There is not enough being done to get people into independent living and functioning better."
"I feel angry at the system, but now I'm trying to do something about it," he added. "The Rene of yesterday would get angry and say the hell with it and just walk out."
Like Mr. Velez, Lawrence James has spent much of his life drowning in anger -- at his mother for being cold and distant, at the Army for a dishonorable discharge, at himself for failure after failure. For most of that time, he sought refuge in alcohol, cocaine and heroin.
"I was mad at the world," Mr. James, 53, said in an interview at his apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
Mr. James first tried to wean himself from his addiction after a violent family fight on Christmas Day in 1985. Police officers called to his home agreed not to arrest him if he sought help. But he said he was able to fool his drug counselors -- and himself -- into believing that he had really changed. When he left the rehabilitation center, he relapsed.
He finally turned his life around in 1990 after he confronted his guilt over his teen-age daughter, who had been alienated from him because of his drug addiction. He enrolled in another rehabilitation program and has now been free of drugs for 20 months.
During that time, the Community Service Society of New York has paid for food, furniture, clothing and expenses for moving from a halfway house to an apartment. He has also drawn strength from Christine Collymore, his caseworker at the society, another one of the charities assisted by the Neediest Cases.
 
'Another Chance'
 "It feels great at this age to have another chance," Mr. James said. "These are people who really made an impact in my life. They have really changed my faith in humanity. It gives you encouragement to know the whole world isn't out to get you."
After being unemployed for more than two years, Mr. James is to start a new job tomorrow, cleaning and repairing buses for the New York City Transit Authority. He is also studying alcoholism counseling at Long Island University in Brooklyn so he can help others like himself.
"For the first time, I feel that I am beginning to know who I am," he said. "I don't feel mad about things I don't have control over. My life hasn't gotten better because of material things, but because of a new feeling inside."
 
7 Charities in 81st Appeal

HEADLINE: ON GOLF;
Players Can Find a Sublime Simplicity in the Birthplace of the Game

BYLINE: By Jaime Diaz

 BODY:
"The game was invented a billion years ago. Don't you remember?"
Old Scottish saying. 
 As it has undergone a second tidal wave of popularity since Arnold Palmer first shook the world, golf in America has been suffering from a case of the terrible toos: too slow, too expensive, too elaborate, too self-conscious and too hard.
Too often, the packaged American golf experience begins with paying something frighteningly close to $100 for a five-hour journey in an electric cart, which, the golfer is instructed, is to remain wedded to a concrete path. The golfer maneuvers the vehicle between island greens and condominiums, stopping only for quick excursions onto a carpet of overwatered emerald grass, from where he or she will try to avoid hitting the ball into a lake, creek or someone's backyard.
As more golfers have been shunted through this sterile production line, the pendulum has begun to swing back to a more elemental approach to an ancient game. American architects have been building courses that are less penal, flow more with the indigenous terrain, cost less to play and maintain, and are more conducive to walking. With luck, golf in America will be a better game by the year 2000.
Of course, the transition would be immediate and complete if America's golfers could all take a pilgrimage to Scotland. In the land where golf was invented and has been played by the working classes for 500 years, the natives have never allowed the superfulous to intrude on the game's sublime simplicity. In Scotland, more than anywhere else in the world, there is pure golf.
That belief was bolstered on a weeklong trip that my father and I made last month. We crisscrossed the country to play five classic links courses -- North Berwick, Gullane, St. Andrews, Turnberry and Prestwick -- in three days.
On a links course in the British Isles -- and only a few true links exist anywhere else in the world -- the golfer feels like a time traveler. By standing on the first tee, he has stepped back through centuries to what is literally common ground and common experience. On the gnarled, tumbling 14th hole at North Berwick, called Perfection, the game seems so old that imagining your playing partner to be a shepherd hitting a rock with a crook is effortless.
Physically, a links is an invigorating environment, made to walk. Because less has been done to them than any courses on earth, the rumpled links have a natural, unadorned beauty. The colors are rich but muted, an almost khaki green turf blending into a gunmetal grey sky. The sounds are the dull roar of the wind, broken by the crunch of spikes on hard packed turf. The smells are a clean mix of ocean air and cool, energizing menthol from the heather, gorse and sandy soil.
For an American golfer, a links is a litmus test of skill and attitude. It asks the golfer if he has the imagination to improvise shots along the firm ground, if he can absorb with humor and wisdom the inevitable serendipity of this type of play, and ultimately, if he can put aside the preoccupation with score and enjoy the simple act of playing.
It is an approach that comes easily to the Scots, a people whose history of economic and political deprivation has made them adept at taking the bad with the good. Accordingly, they love the game in its totality, and look upon its inherent unfairness as just another facet of an overriding cosmic joke.
Armed with that philosophy, the game is played briskly, without all the fidgety indecision and general wasted motion so common to American golf. Scots do not take "mulligans," and play preferred lies only when the greenkeeper is trying to protect the condition of the turf. The arc of their swings tends to be compact, all the better to keep the ball low and out of the wind and in the fairway, from where the game can keep moving. Three-hour rounds are the standard in Scotland.
In short, the Scots seem to know something about the game that most Americans simply do not, and the quiet certainty with which they carry that presumed knowledge has entranced us.
I know that each of the six times I've been to Scotland to work and play golf, I've gone home with a wonderful sensation of reflective ease. For the first few days back, problems seemed solvable, and tasks were welcomed challenges.
Our recent trip had a similar effect on my father, a 63-year-old, 9-handicap golfer who has played golf nearly every weekend for the last 30 years.
He isn't steeped in the history of the game, but he feels the ancestral lure. Like Bobby Jones, his favorite course is the Old Course at St. Andrews, even though hidden pot bunkers frequently catch his 180-yard drives.
This time, he particularly loved Turnberry, a course off the Irish Sea whose tall dunes and jagged cliffs make it perhaps the most dramatic course in Scotland. On an idyllic morning we had the course and what seemed like the entire Ayrshire coastline to ourselves.
A few days after we returned, I called my father at home in California.
"You know, I can't get that Turnberry out of my mind," he said. "I remember every hole. I've been having dreams about it."
There was a pause on the phone, which was broken when my mother said, "Well, aren't you going to tell him?"
My father laughed, and then continued in a voice that was full of wonder.
"You aren't going to believe what happened," he said. "Three days after I got back, I had a hole-in-one." Before I could react, he stopped me. "Then yesterday, I had another one. Both of them flew in the hole."
He had only had one before. I took the news with a strange calm. Somehow, I knew it had everything to do with Scotland.

HEADLINE: Education for the Gifted, Seen As a Luxury, Faces Cutbacks

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ABERDEEN, N.J., Nov. 25

 BODY:
As financially pressed school districts in the region struggle with declining Federal and state aid, rebellious taxpayers and rising costs, special programs for gifted and talented students are being trimmed, gutted or eliminated.
Enrichment classes, honors courses and other educational tools intended to accelerate learning at all levels of instruction are also experiencing setbacks in many districts. Advanced courses are being dropped from the curriculum, class sizes are swelling, and teachers are working harder with fewer resources. 
 Although many school districts have been able to preserve gifted programs, they have done so only at the cost of limited enrollments and classroom hours. And administrators who have already increased the number of children in ordinary classrooms and cut staffs and supplies find it politically difficult to spare gifted programs that may serve 5 percent or less of the student body.
 
A Cost-Cutting Option
 "It's difficult to go to the decision-makers and say 'my child is chronically gifted and needs your support,' " said Joyce Rubin, president of Advocacy for Gifted and Talented Children in New York state. "We don't want to take away from children with other special needs, but this country needs to insure that its smartest kids are challenged in school."
Gifted programs are being cut across the nation, education experts say, and some express concern that the effects of these cuts will be seen in, among other things, declining college admissions scores in the future.
"Sadly, we are producing a nation of unchallenged bright kids and underachievers and the cost to society will be with us for years," said Joseph S. Renzulli, director of the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented at the University of Connecticut.
For many school districts, however, cutting programs for the gifted and talented is one of the few ways costs can be reduced, since programs for intellectually or physically handicapped students are mandated by the Federal and state governments and cannot be cut. Schools receive special funds earmarked for the handicapped or disadvantaged students but local taxpayers pick up much of the cost.
Dr. David J. Irvine, coordinator of gifted education in New York, said state aid for gifted programs has been frozen at $13.3 million for the last few years.
Between 1989 and the last school year, the amount of money spent by the 450 school districts outside New York City on gifted programs declined from $35 million to $32 million and the number of students exposed to a variety of gifted instruction declined from 87,000 to 76,000, a trend that is expected to continue in the current school year and possibly into 1994.
"There has been a substantial reduction -- better than 20 percent -- in the number of teachers for the gifted," Dr. Irvine noted.
Dr. Rubin, who directs the gifted program in Community School District 18 in Brooklyn, called the situation "devastating" in most of the state.
 
Parents Seek Help
 "We get letters from parents pleading with us for help," she said. "Their children in elementary school are reading three or four grades ahead of their class but the gifted classes have been eliminated."
Parents who cannot afford private education may become desperate, she said, and some opt to educate their children at home. "One couple with a son and daughter extremely gifted in mathematics gave up trying to educate them in the public schools and moved to Israel," she said. "That's a big loss for America."
In Connecticut, racked by budget problems, the decline of financial support for gifted education has been dramatic for a state that was one of the nation's leaders in the field.
By 1988, when Connecticut was contributing $8.5 million a year in state aid to 160 of 166 school districts that had academically gifted and artistically talented programs, the Legislature asked state educators to develop recommendations for future needs of the programs. The next year they were handed a study recommending that the state's share rise to $20.5 million.
"But Connecticut that year had its first budget deficit," explained Alan White, a state consultant for the gifted and talented.
 
Hartford Reverses Direction
 So instead of increasing aid to the gifted and talented, the Legislature cut the existing state subsidy until it was eliminated in the current school year.
Loss of state aid, combined with the impact of the recession and the need of local districts to reduce or hold the line on spending, led to the elimination of gifted programs in 36 districts, Mr. White said, while many other programs have been trimmed.
"For example," he continued, "some districts have reduced staff for the gifted and talented, renewing the contracts of three teachers instead of six. Or they have reduced the number of grade levels that have gifted programs.
"Some districts have, in my opinion, mistakingly gone back to whole class enrichment. While that may be applauded, that is general education, not gifted education." Under budget constraints, he said, educators "may fall into the trap" of thinking that class enrichment takes care of the needs of the gifted.
The consequences of such cutbacks are dismaying to those who staunchly support special attention to intelligent and creative students, students who often lose enthusiasm for learning in normal classroom settings that fail to challenge their abilities.
 
Doing More With Lessn
 But not all educators consider the cutbacks devastating. Dr. Philip Geiger, superintendent of the Piscataway, N.J., school district, said budget cuts were forcing public schools to develop dynamic new programs that were not necessarily inferior to the ones they replaced. Gifted students, he said, are now taught in mainstream classrooms in his schools without detriment to them or other students.
The key to success in a time of reduced Federal and state aid, he said, is diverting funds from non-instructional school costs, by, for example, privatizing cafeteria services and selling the school bus system to a private carrier, and using the savings for instruction. "We are making rational decisions, cutting out the fringe stuff, and doing more with no tax increases," he said.
In gifted programs, students are selected on the basis of testing and teacher recommendations, usually representing the top 5 percent of their age group in ability.
In many districts, it is the other talented children just below this group -- smart, able but not gifted -- who are hurt most by budget cutting, increased class size, and a host of other economies.
 
Not Live Frogs, But Drawings
 "How many times can we cut enrichment programs, squeeze advanced placement courses or eliminate things like class trips to museums before we start seeing through the fabric of public education?" asked Barbara Horl, chairwoman of the Matawan-Aberdeen Board of Education in Monmouth County, N.J., a mostly white-collar suburban area less than an hour's drive south of Manhattan.
In this district, with 3,800 students, voters have rejected the board's budget in recent years, forcing hasty cuts and bitter fights over priorities. As a result, said Peggy Schoen, a parent whose two daughters went through the elementary school gifted program, "Everything has been cut and if you want money for special things, the children and the parents have to have a bake sale or fruit sale to pay for them."
Marie Jackolow, a sixth grade teacher, said: "We used to have live frogs for science class. Now we have drawings. Once a week we gave each pupil a newspaper for current events. Now there are 20 newspapers for 60 pupils, but there's no cutting and pasting because the papers have to go to the fifth Grade to look up the stock tables."
The district has managed to keep one self-contained gifted class at each elementary grade level, though money for supplies, textbooks and even periodicals for these select pupils has greatly diminished.
 
Stretching Education Thin
 But the district was forced to abandon a magnet program at its four elementary schools that directed about half of all students into ability-related study programs, such as science and technology, performing arts, language skills and mathematics. It was estimated by administrators that the magnet program today would cost the district, which has a present budget of $35 million, about $300,000 a year.
There is no gifted program in the regional high school serving the district, and budget cuts have taken their toll on honors and advanced placement courses that help students prepare for college, said Kenneth Hall, the district's superintendent of schools.
Moreover, Mrs. Horl said, the district, which is one of those middle-class districts taking a 30 percent reduction in state aid under a state plan to transfer those funds to poorer districts, is experiencing a decline in many aspects of classroom learning.
"Everyone who is part of the public schools is seeing the strain," she said. "Most of the teachers are giving above and beyond their contractural obligations. But how long we can continue holding the system together before something snaps is the big question for not only us but school districts everywhere."

HEADLINE: Keansburg Journal;
Cheers for a Football Hero's Return

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN

DATELINE: KEANSBURG

 BODY:
JONATHAN EDWARDS SCHULTHEIS is back at Keansburg High School, and people here view his return as a harbinger of good things to come.
They remember him when he was the school's leading football star, back in the late 1970's, and then the only resident of this mile-square borough of 11,000 people to graduate from Princeton University. They remember that he turned down a pro football offer to pursue a career as a teacher, and to keep his Sundays for the Pentecostal Church. 
 Now the 6-foot-3-inch, 31-year-old native son is coaching his old school's football team, and residents see that as a hopeful sign for the borough's efforts to rebuild its image and economy.
"It's been an enormous shot in the arm" for the borough, the school and the students, said Pat Antonacci, who has been teaching social studies and psychology at the high school for 17 years and is also Keansburg's Deputy Mayor.
"We're working hard to bring young families into Keansburg," Mr. Antonacci said. "We're meeting with real-estate people so they know what a bargain Keansburg homeownership is. Our taxes are stabilizing. Our real-estate values are starting to increase. When someone like Jon Schultheis commits himself to this town, it builds up our self-image and our self-esteem."
Police Chief Raymond O'Hare, whose son Bryan plays on the high school team, said: "The kids know who Jon is, and they have great respect for his ability. He is a no-nonsense disciplinarian. He runs a tight ship. And he is making our job easier."
 
A District in Need of Help
 Keansburg, where the spindly frame of the amusement park roller coaster and the water slide dominate the scene along Raritan Bay, needs whatever help it can get. The welfare rolls have been climbing, and increasing numbers of homeless people have been seeking shelter. The school district receives aid under the Quality Education Act as one of the state's 30 poorest districts.
Three years ago, the borough flirted briefly with a major economic revival plan that called for building a giant condominium, conference center and marina project called Point Atlantic. Valued at about $200 million, it was to be put up on the site of the amusement park. But the recession brought the project to a halt.
Now the Mayor and the Borough Council plan to seek state Green Acres financing to help revitalize the waterfront with a park and a boardwalk that would provide vistas of the New York City skyline.
At Keansburg High School, Mr. Schultheis, the son of the Rev. James F. Schultheis and the Rev. Grace Schultheis, co-pastors of the Keansburg Pentecostal Church, was an honor student as well as a sports hero. At Princeton, he majored in history, joined the exclusive Cottage Club and was a lineman on the varsity football team.
Princeton gave him "a freedom and a depth of knowledge" he had never known before, Mr. Schultheis said, though it was also "much too liberal for my taste." He does not drink, smoke or use profanity. He was active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes at Princeton.
Even when the football team played out of town, he skipped the postgame parties, piled into his car and returned to Keansburg to play the organ for the Sunday service. "My parents needed me, and so did the church," he said. "I couldn't let them down."
After graduating from Princeton in 1983, Mr. Schultheis was offered $40,000 to sign with the Philadelphia Eagles and $80,000 to $100,000 a season after that. But he had never played football in high school or college on Sunday, and he was not about to change. Sundays were for church.
"I did what I felt was right," Mr. Schultheis said. "I never had any regrets." He makes $4,300 a year coaching at Keansburg.
He continues to serve the 150-member church as choir director, Bible teacher for adults and Sunday school teacher for children. He sometimes leads services here and at a satellite church in Spotswood, in Middlesex County. Such church experience will give him the training necessary to be approved by a Pentecostal board and ordained as aPentecostal minister, which is his goal.
As he did while a student at Princeton, Mr. Schultheis works summers as a stagehand. "The money is good," he said, adding that he felt that his union card brought him closer to many of the working people in Keansburg.
His main occupation, though, is as a social studies teacher at the nearby Holmdel Intermediate School. Before taking the coaching job in Keansburg, he had been an assistant football coach at Holmdel High School.
He lives with his parents in Keansburg.
 
'Coach Has Done a Lot for Us'
 Members of the borough's football team speak highly of their new coach. "Coach has done a lot for us," said Steve Boyton, the team's co-captain and a fullback. "We respect him. We know how smart he is. He tells us we are the best -- and we believe him."
Keansburg has come through with a winning regular season, though it lost to Dunellen in the state football playoffs. Ray Coleman, the athletic director at Keansburg, said the season was "highly successful" and the program was getting "better and better."
The team's other co-captain, Russell Gogan, an offensive guard, said Mr. Schultheis was working to build the team members' academic qualities. There are study halls, for example, before practice sessions, with tutors for those who need extra help. "Coach is setting high standards for us," Mr. Gogan said. "He tells us not to let anyone say anything bad about Keansburg."
Mr. Schultheis will not tolerate profanity, from players or coaches. "Say something vulgar or make a profane gesture, and that means 25 laps or 25 pushups," said Paul Markulin, a senior and backup quarterback.
Kerri O'Keefe, a senior, said the Schultheis "role model" was spreading through the school. She added: "Many of us are now saying to ourselves, 'He's from Keansburg and he made it.' He's become an inspiration."
That's just what the Schools Superintendent, Joseph Caruso, likes to hear. A Keansburg native who also played on the line in football, Mr. Caruso said Mr. Schultheis's efforts "have been contagious." He added: "Jon is helping to set high standards not only for the athletes but for the whole school. And Princeton is a part of it. Many of our kids used to think of lesser schools after graduation -- mainly because of finances. Now their sights have been raised. They know they can accomplish more."
Alice Kumanov has been teaching at the 400-student Keansburg High School for almost 26 years, and she remembers Mr. Schultheis as her best German scholar ever. "He was exceptional," she said.
But she also had praise for her other students over the years. "They were not born with silver spoons in their mouths," she said. "They work for what they get." She also likes to point to the first-place finishes by Keansburg students in high school German competitions at Rutgers University.
"Our students need help and they need motivation," she said. "But we're fortunate to have a fine, dedicated faculty at Keansburg. It is important that our students feel good about themselves and their town. Jonathan Schultheis is helping us to do that now, and it is working in a very real way."

HEADLINE: Foreclosures on Rise While Prices Still Falter

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHILE most of the Connecticut economy languishes, one sector is thriving. Lawyers, auctioneers, real estate agents and others involved in foreclosures are doing a booming business.
Four years ago, when real estate prices in Connecticut were at an all-time high, about 20 mortgages of every 1,000 were in foreclosure. But as real estate prices plummeted and many people lost their jobs, foreclosures have now soared to 159 for every 1,000 mortgages, the fourth highest rate in the nation, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
 But the worst might be over, accoring to Thomas E. Hylinski, first vice president at People's Bank in Bridgeport and a vice president of the Connecticut chapter of the Mortgage Bankers Association. He said that in the last few months he has seen a decline in the number of delinquencies: at the start of the third quarter in July, 30-day delinquencies were down 10 percent and 90-day delinquencies were down 30 percent.
"The fact is, the loss of jobs has stopped growing, things seem to be getting better," Mr. Hylinski said. Others aren't so sure. Jeffrey L. Briggs, senior vice president of loan services for Centerbank Mortgage Company, a subsidiary of the Waterbury-based Centerbank, said the things that were driving the process -- layoffs, wage and benefit concessions, among them -- were still plaguing Connecticut. As more people lose their homes, there are fewer people to buy the houses coming on the market through foreclosure and normal turnover, he said. That means the people and banks trying to sell must reduce the price even further, putting more mortgages at risk.
In better times, those who could no longer afford their mortgage payments could sell the property and move to less expensive quarters, he said.
"That option has diminished," Mr. Briggs said. "And until that changes, the experts' predictions that prices are going to continue to fall will probably hold true."
John M. Clapp, a professor of finance and real estate in the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut, predicted that housing prices would remain depressed for a long time because the high foreclosure rate has produced a greater number of bargain properties on the market now, and because the vacancy rate in existing housing was high.
He expects that foreclosures will not stop until employers realize that they have downsized too much and they start hiring again, and when the housing stock that is out there is absorbed. "I've heard some predictions of 1997, and that seems to make sense," he said.
According to a study Dr. Clapp made of Connecticut real estate prices, prices peaked in the third quarter of 1988, when a house that would have cost $100,000 in late 1981 would have brought $248,200, a 150 percent increase over seven years. Since then, prices have fallen more than 22 percent, so that same house would cost $190,700 today, still 90 percent more expensive than 11 years ago, but representing millions of dollars in lost equity for those who bought four years ago.
In fact, a buyer who put only a modest down payment on a house a few years ago would now owe the bank more than the house is worth, Dr. Clapp noted.
That means that when a homeowner loses a job or takes a pay cut and must to move out of the house, he or she cannot afford to sell. As a result, the bank often winds up owning the property through foreclosure.
 
Cutting Lender Losses
 Mr. Briggs said that Connecticut's high foreclosure rate did not even take into account some new policies that have been designed during the recession to prevent foreclosures, even if the bank lost money. For example, most banks now have programs to authorize sales that will not satisfy the mortgage, because the real estate problem is so severe. "The lender agrees to accept less than the amount which is owed, but over all the amount of money the lender is going to lose is less than it would lose if it didn't allow the sale to take place," Mr. Briggs said.
"This is not like a recession where in a couple of weeks things could turn around and start to get better," Mr. Briggs said. "This is a restructuring. Connecticut's economy has been defense-oriented so long, and it's got to find new directions. In the meantime, we've got to adjust."
The only lenders who are not having trouble are those that offer government subsidies. John T. Cooper, housing chief for the Farmers Home Administration in Connecticut said that only 58 of the 2,618 mortgages his agency wrote in the state in the last 30 years were in foreclosure, which was an increase over the last three years but still less than 15 percent of the foreclosure rate on privately financed homes.
 
Interest as Low as 1 Percent
 For a couple of years, the Farmers Home Administration was prohibited, by court order, from foreclosing on homes. The agency, which makes mortgage loans to low and moderate income families, can offer a moratorium on payments, or reduce the interest to as low as 1 percent, for people who have financial problems.
"For anyone who's willing to work with us, we're able to offer a lot of programs and benefits that other lenders can't," Mr. Cooper said.
But other lenders are seeing troubling numbers. Presently, only Massachusetts, New Jersey and Oklahoma have higher foreclosure rates than Connecticut. The foreclosure rate, once the envy of the nation, is now 50 percent higher than the national average of 104 for every 1,000 mortgages.
Larry Moore, a spokesman for the state Judicial Department, said the foreclosures have meant an increasingly heavy burden for the courts. The number of actions has risen steadily in the last four years, from 3,482 in the 1987-88 fiscal year, to 5,376 the next year, to 9,248 in 1989-90, to 13,422 in 1990-91, and to 14,054 in the fiscal year ended in June.
 
One Day of Court's Week
 Frances Z. Calafiore, deputy director of court operations, said that in most jurisdictions judges have set aside one day of the court's weekly calendar to hear foreclosure cases.
"Housing cases, particularly foreclosures, are driving up the number of cases on the docket throughout the state," Ms. Calafiore said.
Jay B. Weintraub, a West Hartford attorney who often handles foreclosure cases, said the increase has been significant.
"Go over to the court any Monday morning and there may be 500 or 100 cases on the docket," Mr. Weintraub said. "A few years ago it would have been one-third that number."
Mr. Weintraub said that in years past the judge might order a court auction of real estate that was in foreclosure. But today, because mortgage balances often exceed the value of the property, judges are more likely to try to work out an arrangement for private sale, he noted.
"We found the auctions were bringing about 30 percent less than even the most recent appraisals, and that's if anyone bid at all," Mr. Weintraub said. "A very, very small percentage have any equity at all."
 
Mass Auctions
 Still, some banks are resorting to mass auctions to unload some of the properties they have amassed through foreclosure.
Daniel E. Anderson, sales manager for Petrowsky Auctioneers Inc. in Norwich, which this month auctioned more than 50 properties for two New London County banks, said the price a property brought depended largely on its condition and location.
"Some of the returns from auctions are darn close to what the same properties would bring at retail -- good stuff brings good money," Mr. Anderson said. "But everyone attends an auction with the thought of getting a real bargain in the back of their mind."
The traditional method of auction is to advertise and market each house separately, which is a tremendous investment of time and money, Mr. Anderson said, particularly if a bank has dozens of foreclosed properties.
"The auction is the only way to put 50 or 100 properties together and market them and still get some attention," Mr. Anderson said. "Auction advertisements generate a lot more public interest. It brings the bank real close to the customer and it gets things done quickly."
But Dr. Clapp criticized that kind of mass sale as one of the reasons prices were depressed.
 
Short-Sighted Banks
 "Banks are short-sighted to sell off these properties," Dr. Clapp said. "They'd be better off to manage them and hold onto them until they can get fundamental value."
Mr. Hylinski of People's Bank, however, said banks were often driven by their own financial need, and even when they employed auctions they offered houses that were spread out over several towns. "If they're all located in one neighborhood that would have a significant impact on the market," he said. "But typically the auctions are pretty diverse -- one condominium in this complex, two more in a complex a couple of towns away -- so the effect hasn't been that dramatic."
Still, housing prices in Connecticut have plunged much faster than in neighboring states, and more steeply than at the national level, but then, Dr. Clapp noted, prices in Connecticut also rose more quickly during the mid-1980's boom.
"There is a bright spot in this, in that housing is more affordable in Connecticut, more competitive with neighboring states," Dr. Clapp said. "But the problem is, people still need a job to afford any housing."

HEADLINE: Unions Brace for Fight Over County Contracts

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
UNION leaders furious over the Board of Legislators' refusal to ratify their contracts -- say their rank and file feel like pawns in a power struggle, betrayed by government leaders who "sat back in their ivory tower and played with other people's lives."
"It's not fair," said Thomas F. O'Neill, president of the Corrections Officers Benevolent Association. "You're not only dealing with people's money but with their emotions, too." 
 Early in September, the Board of Legislators, claiming that fiscal belt-tightening in a tough economic climate was in order, voted no on 1992 contracts calling for pay raises for four unions representing workers in Westchester. The Board's vote came even though the contracts had been negotiated with County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke and his negotiator, Michael W. Wittenberg, director of the county's Labor Relations Department.
In addition to the corrections officers, the unions affected by the decision of the Board of Legislators are the Westchester units of the New York State Nurses Association and the New York State United Teachers and the Superior Officers Association of the county's Corrections Department.
Although Mr. O'Neill said that Westchester "has never been more anti-union than it is today," the situation is not restricted to the county. Budget problems are generating union conflicts between public-sector workers and their employers statewide, said Richard A. Curreri, director of conciliation for the State Public Employment Relations Board, which has received complaints from three of the four unions that did not have their contracts ratified.
 
Board Is Standing Firm
 "I've seen more impasses than at any time since 1983," Mr. Curreri said. "It's happening not just in the state, but all over the country."
But the Board of Legislators is standing firm on its decision, saying that its vote was not only legal but fiscally necessary.
The chairman of the Board of Legislators, Stephen P. Tenore, said he was confident that the State Public Employment Relations Board would decide that the legislative body acted legally.
"Our job is to ratify or deny a contract," Mr. Tenore said. "Hopefully, this will lead to a greater understanding that the Board of Legislators is an independent and co-equal branch of government with the right to vote a contract up or down."
Mr. O'Rourke said he agreed that the County Board was an independent body with the right to ratify or turn down contracts. He also said that when negotiating with the unions, "nothing is written in stone" until the Board puts its final stamp of approval on the contract.
Mr. O'Rourke added, "I know people in the private sector who have gone years without a pay raise."
 
Unions Willing to Fight
 Nevertheless, union leaders in Westchester -- armed with their anger and the feeling that they have been betrayed by government leaders-- say they are willing to fight over the issue of contract agreements that were made in good faith with Mr. O'Rourke and Mr. Wittenberg.
They claim that the County Board's 13-to-2 vote to renege on those agreements was illegal, and that they are prepared to do whatever it takes to overturn that decision.
The teachers union, for one, has filed an improper-practices charge with the State Public Employment Relations Board in Albany. "We are arguing that we had a valid agreement with the County Executive and that the legislators did not have the independent authority to vitiate that agreement," said Susan Bloom Jones, a labor-relations specialist for the teachers.
That union, which represents 500 teachers at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, is taking the position that the County Charter does not give the legislators the right to undermine an agreement made with a county executive.
 
'Core of This Whole Issue'
 "That is the core of this whole issue," said Richard J. Rosell, president of the community college teachers union and an associate professor of social and behavioral sciences. "The Board of Legislators doesn't want the authority to negotiate a contract. It just wants the authority to turn down the contract after the fact."
The nurses union, too, has filed a complaint with the Employment Relations Board, also claiming that the Board of Legislators does not have the authority to reject a union contract that has already been agreed upon.
"The County and the Board of Legislators should have had all their ducks in order," said Thomas W. Darby, negotiator for the 1,300 nurses in Westchester who are public-sector employees. "We negotiated a contract; we came to an agreement, and that contract was ratified by the nurses.
"Now the Board says that's too bad. It shows a complete ignorance of public-sector bargaining."
 
'We Have to Fight Back'
 The corrections officers union, which represents 950 employees, was found guilty on Nov. 10 by a judge in State Supreme Court in Westchester County of being involved in a work slowdown, but that decision has been stayed by the Appellate Division in Brooklyn. The corrections officers, too, are seeking assistance from the Public Employment Relations Board.
The Superior Officers Association, which represents 125 employees, has not taken any action on the matter.
Whatever the legalities of the Board's decision to turn down the contracts, union representatives claim that at the very least, their rank and file have been caught in the middle of a budgetary tug of war between the Legislature and Mr. O'Rourke, a power struggle that has left them in the lurch.
"We've been pushed over the edge," Mr. O'Neill said, "and now we have to fight back."
 
Keeping Faith With the Taxpayers
 The County Board, however, intends to stand by its decision.
"Nobody likes to turn down a union contract, but we have to keep faith with the taxpayers," said County Legislator Audrey G. Hochberg, a Democrat from Scarsdale.
"These are hard times," she said. "We are not stubbornly doing something just to be difficult."
Sandra R. Galef, a Democrat from Ossining, said the Board of Legislators was being more fiscally realistic than Mr. O'Rourke. The County Executive, she recalled, said at the beginning of the year that there was no money for raises, and later recanted, saying $20 million in surplus funds was available.
"But that's only 2 percent out of a $1.2 billion budget," Ms. Galef added. "And it is a bad move to use a surplus. We had to put our collective feet down and say no."
"I admit this is a kind of power struggle," she added. "But we're not doing it to go against Mr. O'Rourke. We just can't spend money when there isn't any."
 
May Be a No-Win Situation
 One of the two legislators who voted to ratify the union contracts, Leonard N. Spano, a Republican from Yonkers, called the Board's refusal to grant pay raises to the unions "demoralizing" and said that compared with other counties in the state, Westchester was in good shape financially.
Watching from the sidelines and looking forward to contract negotiations for the coming year, a spokeswoman for another union said she was afraid those negotiations would not be made in good faith by the county. Mr. O'Rourke said recently that there would be no pay increases in the 1993 budget.
"That's very discouraging," said Anita I. Manley, who represents 6,500 laborers, janitors, public health nurses and Social Services Department workers, among others, in the county's unit of the Civil Service Employees Association, Westchester's largest municipal union.
"All we're asking is that the negotiators sit down with an open mind, ready to negotiate with honorable intent," she said. "But obviously they can't do that if their minds are already made up."
Despite that union's concerns, Mr. Wittenberg said he would go into any future negotiations "in good faith" and bargain hard for fair contracts.
Whatever the outcome of the four unions' objections to the Board of Legislators' vote, it may be a no-win situation, the Legislators said. If pay raises are granted, jobs will have to be cut.

HEADLINE: The Smart Club Comes to the White House

BYLINE: By Nicholas Lemann; Nicholas Lemann, a national correspondent of The Atlantic, is working on a book about meritocracy in the United States.

DATELINE: PELHAM, N.Y.

 BODY:
We've been reminded over and over that Bill Clinton will be the first President born after World War II and that he represents the coming to power of a new generation. True enough, but new generations come to power all the time. Another Clinton first is more important: he is the first product of the American meritocracy to reach the White House.
Only two or three times in a century does a new elite take broad control of our country. The Clinton inaugural could mark one of those times -- but it's by no means a certainty, because the meritocracy, though triumphant at the moment, is in a precarious position. 
 By meritocracy, I mean a kind of national personnel system that uses higher education to sort and slot a substantial portion of the population. Meritocrats are successful people whose first big break was getting into the right school and whose career paths since then have been fairly orderly. The evolution of the meritocracy, during and after World War II, had the effect of making routine the eternal unruly American obsession with personal ambition.
It's still pretty unruly out there for entrepreneurs and actors. Some people still have success conferred on them as a birthright, and millions have no realistic chance of getting ahead. But the surest, most predictable and often traveled avenue of upward mobility is the higher-education system. That's why getting into and paying for college and graduate school is such an obsession of the middle class.
The meritocracy has become so pervasive and so well established that it's worth reminding ourselves that the Presidents up to now didn't have much to do with it. If they went to Ivy League schools (Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, George Bush), it was not because they had been plucked, Cinderella-style, out of virtuous obscurity by the admissions office but because they were, like most Ivy Leaguers before 1950, rich kids who had been enrolled in Dad's alma mater. Harry S. Truman didn't go to college at all, and Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan went to obscure local undergraduate schools and got on a track to power later on.
The most meritocratic modern Presidents were military academy graduates, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter, but for them college was the doorway only into a narrow elite, the officer corps, not the common run of leadership positions.
Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton will be the first occupants of the White House who truly meet the big break test: the day that fat letter from an elite college (Georgetown and Wellesley, respectively) arrived in their middle class, middle-of-the-country mailboxes was the day the trajectory of their lives changed dramatically.
The Clintons met and courted on the campus of the elite Yale Law School; as the sociologist E. Digby Baltzell has observed, for meritocrats the dean of admissions functions as a de facto marriage broker.
Mr. Baltzell called America's previous elite the Protestant Establishment: it was almost entirely WASP and quasi-hereditary. George Bush grew up in the bosom of the Protestant Establishment (he met his wife at a country club), and during the 1992 Presidential campaign you could almost feel every last remaining shred of the immense deference, trust and respect his class once commanded being blown away. The sense that people like Mr. Bush cannot be trusted to look after the interests of ordinary Americans was palpable. Mr. Clinton, the meritocrat, had much more of the log-cabin President quality than Mr. Bush did.
Since Bill and Hillary Clinton stand at the head of a substantial class of people who, since graduating from school, have risen to the top of a wide range of institutions, it's tempting to regard the ascendancy of the meritocracy as a sort of "end of history" of American elites. The system that churns these people out is firmly in place. They're smart and capable. They seem to control everything. What could possibly go wrong for them?
Actually, a lot. Because of the strength of the populist strain in the American character, the power of any elite is automatically at risk. Each succeeding elite, from the Virginia squirearchy to the robber barons to the Protestant Establishment, has seen itself as having risen in the fairest system ever devised, and has expected the admiration of the rest of the nation. Instead, the rest of the nation has eventually turned resentful and the elite has been unseated. There is no reason why the meritocracy would be immune to this.
In particular, the meritocrats are expected to deliver two elusive and possibly incompatible social benefits at the same time: equity and efficiency. The meritocracy took form during a period of high democratic spirit and economic expectation; therefore, it is imbued with the idea that it is supposed to provide every American with a genuine opportunity to get ahead, and also to keep the country on an upward path of growth. The original theory was that if we opened up the leadership ranks to everyone on the basis of talent and ability, rather than background, naturally the people who rose to the top would do a great job of running the country.
But today the equity and efficiency of the meritocracy are in question. Perceptions of the fairness of the education system vary widely from class to class, ethnic group to ethnic group and region to region. The basic tools of the meritocracy, standardized tests and admissions offices, have become controversial. Public schools for the poor have lost any reputation they may once have had for being engines of upward mobility; and, at the other end of the system, the ability of colleges to admit students without regard to their parents' financial situation has eroded.
All in all, the meritocracy is getting to the point where it is regularly accused of being a disguised aristocracy. Remember that the Clinton campaign's polling last spring showed that people thought the Governor had grown up rich, simply because he had gone to Georgetown, Oxford and Yale.
On the efficiency front, the meritocracy's problem is that its rise has coincided with a great stalling of the economy. The two phenomena may be unrelated, but it doesn't help the meritocracy's image as a promoter of economic growth that a strong plurality of the graduates of the very best colleges go into law, medicine, investment banking and management consulting. Robert Reich, one of President-elect Clinton's chief economic advisers, once memorably insulted the meritocrats by accusing them of being "pie-slicers" rather than "pie-enlargers."
Bill Clinton will have the power to shore up substantially the system that made his own rise to the Presidency possible. To do so he has to accomplish two goals. First is the obvious one of getting the economy moving again. Second, and more difficult, is re-establishing the linchpin of the meritocracy's legitimacy -- the link between education and individual possibility.
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton repeatedly sketched a vision of a society in which every schoolchild would get the basic skills necessary to make a living and any adolescent who wanted access to higher education (meaning, presumably, higher success) could have it. Nothing would insure the survival of the meritocracy better than his doing this.
"The system" is a vague term. But when things aren't going well, Americans are very good at making it specific. When the system seems not to be working, it quickly becomes identified with a group or a social process to be gotten rid of. Under President Clinton, meritocracy will be the obvious candidate.
During the campaign, the Republicans tried to foster resentment against the meritocracy. President Bush said that under Bill Clinton we'd be ruled by "the best and the brightest" -- not meaning that as a compliment. Vice President Dan Quayle said, "They think they're smarter than us." And it's no accident that the draft issue kept popping up all year: the basic sorting techniques of the meritocracy were invented partly as a way of keeping the smartest people out of the line of fire during wartime.
Now that the meritocrats are about to run the country, there will surely be more of these attacks. They had their least possible potency coming from the Bush Administration, which represented an elite far more unpopular than the meritocracy.
The real competitor elite to the meritocracy is a group composed of rich, self-made Sun Belt entrepreneurs such as Ross Perot and the men who got Ronald Reagan into politics. They can say, "We may not have gone to Ivy League schools, but we understand ordinary folks and basic economics better than the people who did."
Like every Administration, Bill Clinton's will soon find itself nearly overwhelmed with specific issues. When election year comes around again, though, they will recede in importance and larger themes will come forward. You can bet that the theme of meritocracy -- the performance of the elite Mr. Clinton belongs to, especially in education and economic management -- will be one of them.

HEADLINE: Who Speaks for Malcolm X? The Writings of Just About Everybody

BYLINE: By Michael Eric Dyson; Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of American civilization and Afro-American studies at Brown University, is the author of the forthcoming "Reflecting Black: African-American Cultural Criticism."

 BODY:
IN "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," the charismatic black religious nationalist recalls his momentous 1964 pilgrimage to Mecca, a visit that would alter the course of his life and career. For 12 years this minister of the Nation of Islam had been trumpeting a doctrine of the intrinsic evil of white people, likening the dream of American equality to a nightmare for American blacks and championing a plan to redeem black Americans by saving them from the tide of brainwashing that had drowned awareness of the black race's true superiority. But now Malcolm X writes of an incident in Jedda, in which he is treated with great hospitality by a man who, in the United States, would be considered white.
"That white man, . . . related to Arabia's ruler, to whom he was a close advisor, truly an international man, with nothing in the world to gain, had given up his suite to me, for my transient comfort. . . . He had followed the American press about me. If he did that, he knew there was only stigma attached to me. I was supposed to have horns. I was a 'racist.' I was 'anti-white.' . . . Everyone was even accusing me of using his religion of Islam as a cloak for my criminal practices and philosophies. . . . 
 "That morning was when I first began to reappraise the 'white man.' It was when I first began to perceive that 'white man,' as commonly used, means complexion only secondarily; primarily it described attitudes and actions. In America, 'white man' meant specific attitudes and actions toward the black man, and toward all other nonwhite men. But in the Muslim world, I had seen that men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been.
"That morning was the start of a radical alteration in my whole outlook about 'white men.' "
Malcolm's life-changing encounters were recorded in letters from Africa to family members and other followers in the United States. The revealing missives detailed Malcolm X's view of the color blindness of Muslim society and religion. This series of experiences forced Malcolm X to "rearrange much of my thought-patterns previously held, and to toss aside some of my previous conclusions."
Less than a year later, Malcolm X was gunned down by assassins in New York's Audubon Ballroom. By the time of his martyrdom, he had seceded from the Nation of Islam (after bitter disappointment in the moral failures of its leader, Elijah Muhammad, and the tensions within the sect concerning Malcolm X's own increased public presence) and begun two organizations, one religious, the other political. Each group reflected Malcolm X's transformed perspective about racial and religious matters, especially his belief that broad social engagement permitted blacks their best chance to oppose the lethal legacy of American racism.
It is around Malcolm's increasingly independent political activity during the final 50 weeks of his life, combined with his startling reversal of feeling about the possibility of redemption for white America, that so much controversy and confusion have gathered. Although Malcolm X made many overtures to a broader philosophy of human community, he simply did not live long enough to fulfill the promise of his significant yet tentative first steps. While we may conclude with certainty that Malcolm X had rejected the whites-are-devils pronouncements that helped to focus his earlier life and brought him the attention and vilification of a nation, we are brought up short when trying to deal definitively with the universal humanitarianism of his latter days.
Though Malcolm X's legacy until recently has been demonized and dismissed by the traditional academy, his popularity never flagged among a cadre of black nationalist activists, journalists and independent intellectuals who for a quarter-century have debated intensely his significance to black politics, black culture and American society. These debates have had a trickle-up effect; they created the grounds for the current war of interpretation being waged over Malcolm's meaning in our time.
IN the face of the grim recurrence of a racism many thought was gone forever, the renewed popularity of Malcolm X -- both his image and his ideology -- has taken on new importance. The signs of his ascent -- from posters, ubiquitous baseball hats and samplings of his voice on rap records, and the appearance of his reissued autobiography on the best-seller lists, to the recording of the opera "X," created by Anthony Davis and Thulani Davis; the recent release of the epic film biography directed by Spike Lee; and the forthcoming publication of his speeches, edited to reveal his ideological evolution -- all are a response to the current need, deeply felt by many, for a confrontational stance toward this country's continuing racism and the seductive mythology of the perfect black man.
Thus it is that Malcolm X's name no longer belongs to him, no longer refers simply to his tall body or to his short life. Like Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm has come to mean more than himself. For some, he was an unreconstructed nationalist; for others, a man who wed his nationalist beliefs to socialist philosophy. Still others subject him to Marxist and Freudian analysis, while others emphasize his vocation as a public moralist. No matter how he is pigeonholed, his stature derives as much from his detractors' exaggerated fears as from his admirers' exalted hopes. He has become a divided metaphor: for those who love him, he is a powerful lens for self-perception, a means of sharply focusing political and racial priorities; for those who loathe him, he is a distorting mirror that reflects violence and hatred.
Malcolm X himself anticipated this confusion. When he announced his new beliefs he had not fully gauged the disquiet they would cause among supporters already thrown by his earlier break with the Nation of Islam. Among its powerful dramatis personae -- its leader, Elijah Muhammad; the world-champion boxer Muhammad Ali and Louis X, now Minister Louis Farrakhan, Malcolm's associate turned enemy -- it was Malcolm who had emerged as the major player in the Nation of Islam's dramatic attempts to rescue black Americans from what they saw as the bankrupt religious and social values of white society.
Yet Malcolm X has received nothing like the intellectual attention devoted to King. As the central figure of the civil rights movement, King justifiably has been the subject of extensive scholarship, but his cultural visibility also has to do with the style, content and aims of his leadership, which for most of his life were both easily translatable and largely attractive to white America. On the other hand, Malcolm X's complex leadership positions, which visited rhetorical scorn on white supremacy and which appealed especially to working-class and poor black people, have typically invited derision, caricature and dismissal -- forces that undermine extensive and balanced scholarly investigation.
To be sure, a flood of writings about Malcolm X's legacy has been published over the years in alternative and black newspapers, journals, pamphlets and books; they have been vigorously discussed throughout this country's black communities. (Nearly two dozen books about Malcolm, ranging from biographies for young adults to collections of his writings, have been reissued or published for the first time this year.) Yet with notable exceptions, both mainstream and alternative literature on Malcolm X has often missed the mark, offering praise where critical judgment is called for, trapping itself in intellectual frameworks that neither illuminate nor surprise.
Of course, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," as told to Alex Haley, is the Urtext of contemporary black nationalism. Activists and intellectuals tote it in their back pockets and briefcases for ready reference in debates about black America, while rappers imitate its radical tones and students often quote it as scripture. As Malcolm X's faithful and creative scribe -- he had written two articles about Malcolm and interviewed him for Playboy magazine when a publisher tapped him to write the autobiography in 1963 -- Haley placed his considerable narrative skills at Malcolm's disposal. It was Haley who brought Malcolm's life into full color, crafting a classic of African-American letters. But as Malcolm opened his life to Haley, he was also reinventing it on the spot. Malcolm was improvising a personal narrative that drew from both the virtues and failures of memory. But the lapses in accuracy that he exhibited were often rooted less in mendacity than in the human need to tell stories in ways that make our lives make sense.
Despite the crucial role of his autobiography in expanding black cultural consciousness, the full meaning of Malcolm X's life inevitably must be judged using more than a single source. Thus it is especially important now to explore a select group of books published over the past two decades that offer widely divergent views of Malcolm X's complex political journey.
In "Malcolm X: The Man and His Times," first published in 1969, the first anthology dedicated to exploring Malcolm's life and thought, John Henrik Clarke, a black historian and professor emeritus at Hunter College, has edited a collection of pieces that undermine a single, unified understanding of Malcolm's place in history. What many of the essays share is a reverential regard for his black nationalist legacy.
In his contribution to this collection of 34 essays, interviews and organizational statements, the black theologian Albert Cleage (who knew and worked with Malcolm X) boldly defends Malcolm's black nationalist reputation by concluding that "if in Mecca he had decided that blacks and whites can unite, then his life at that moment would have become meaningless in terms of the world struggle of black people." Mr. Cleage seeks to rebut the contentions that Malcolm at the end of his life was becoming either an integrationist, an advocate of the internationalization of black struggle or a socialist.
In another essay from this anthology, the political theorist James Boggs criticizes Malcolm's black nationalist heirs, whom Mr. Boggs views as preoccupied with black-power sloganeering and lacking sufficient analytic depth. He also chastises "white radicals who lend a grudging support to black power," patronizing black revolutionaries as "unfinished products" who will one day see the light and recognize the superiority of Marxist theory and the necessity of an alliance with the white working class.
Charles E. Wilson insightfully discusses Malcolm's "failure of leadership style and a failure to evolve a sound organizational base for his activities," concluding that Malcolm was a "victim of his own charisma."
Mr. Clarke's anthology mattered: in the days following Malcolm X's death, its contributors addressed urban blacks and nationalist intellectuals confronting their deepening social crisis. It argued that black nationalism was an important and thriving alternative to black bourgeois protest, which held out as its goal black integration into white society. Mr. Clarke's book also countered the demonization of Malcolm. But its goal of redeeming Malcolm X's legacy rather than evaluating it lessens its value; the collection's tone suggests an exercise in beatification, with cultural interpreters working to preserve fragments of Malcolm's memory against abuse or amnesia.
FORTUNATELY, the very books that present Malcolm primarily in relation to his views on racism also supply a wealth of detail about his career and a framework for criticism. The black theologian James H. Cone's "Martin & Malcolm & America: A Dream or a Nightmare" treats the religious roots of Malcolm's moral vision; the journalist Louis E. Lomax's "To Kill a Black Man" addresses the social and political dimensions of Malcolm's moral perspective. But it is in their roles as comparative studies of King and Malcolm X that the two books seize our interest. Mr. Cone, a professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York, has been profoundly influenced by both King and Malcolm X, and his book is a public acknowledgment of intellectual debt and inspiration.
Many Americans believe that Malcolm X and King occupied violently opposed ethical universes, that their positions on the best solution to this country's racial crisis led them to a permanent parting of paths. More likely, though, they were the yin and yang of black moral responses to white racism, complementing more than contradicting each other in their last years. Mr. Cone even suggests that King and Malcolm X were in important ways converging, saying that "Malcolm and Martin moved away from the extremes of their original positions and began to embrace aspects of each other's viewpoints." Thus, King began in 1966 to emphasize black pride, explore the virtues of "temporary segregation" to foster the economic health of black communities, and became more radical about the limits of social protest. And Malcolm X for his part became publicly political, acknowledged the militancy of integrationists, and even encouraged voter registration.
Although King and Malcolm X met only once for a brief moment -- resulting in the famed photo of both figures smiling broadly at the Capitol in 1964 -- Malcolm did journey to Selma, Ala., in 1965 when King was in jail, to speak to civil rights workers before leaving for London. His remarks on that occasion to Coretta King -- less than a month before his death -- reveal his poignant awareness and acceptance of the distinct roles he and King played in the black freedom movement. "I want Dr. King to know that I didn't come to Selma to make his job difficult," he said. "I really did come thinking I could make it easier. If the white people realize what the alternative is, perhaps they will be more willing to hear Dr. King."
"To Kill a Black Man," written in the torturous aftermath of King's assassination in 1968, has all the virtues of historical immediacy -- impassioned narration, proximity to the feeling of the moment, unvarnished insight. What it lacks is the greater virtue of historical perspective, which comes from long and mature reflection upon events. This is the virtue that Mr. Cone's book, published in 1991, possesses, along with an analytical acumen in exploring King's and Malcolm X's lives and thought in larger scope and richer detail than many of the author's nationalist predecessors.
However, like them, Mr. Cone is plagued by excessive reliance on the theme of racial unity as an intellectual principle to explain his twin subjects' failures and achievements; this limits his understanding of King and Malcolm X and skews his view of their complex uses (especially King's) of history and culture. Nevertheless, Mr. Cone's book is an invaluable aid in comprehending the similarities and differences between the two towering influences on contemporary black culture.
Malcolm X lived for most of his life in opposition to the fundamental assumptions of American moral judgment: that innocence and corruption are on a continuum, that justice and injustice are on a scale and that proper moral behavior depends on making the right choices between existing options of good and evil. Such a vision is presented in "The Death and Life of Malcolm X," by Peter Louis Goldman. The author, a senior editor at Newsweek, met Malcolm in 1962 and spent hundreds of hours interviewing him. The book, published in 1973, captures with eloquence and imagination the forces of white racial oppression that made life hell for northern poor blacks, and the minimal resources apparently at their disposal before Malcolm's defiant rhetoric rallied black rage and anger to their defense.
Mr. Goldman's Malcolm is one whose "life was itself an accusation," a "witness for the prosecution" of white injustice, a "public moralist." With each aspect of Malcolm's life that Mr. Goldman treats -- whether it is Malcolm's foreshadowing of the forthcoming black power movement or his withering assaults on white society -- Mr. Goldman's narrative subtly and skillfully illumines Malcolm's career.
What the author fails to do is properly convey the mammoth scope of competing economic, cultural and historical forces that erupted during the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, and that reflected not only racial antagonism but class conflict and sexual oppression as well. Nor does he present a sufficient analysis of the extreme political limitations placed on black militant men of either religious or secular sensibility. Still, Mr. Goldman's book, the first full-scale life of Malcolm X, remains an indispensable biography of the enigmatic leader.
If one task of biography is to cast as bright a light as possible over the shadowed areas of human behavior, then psychobiography doubles the effort, using the insights gleaned through psychological theory to illumine the full range of human experience. Over the last decade, several journal articles and two books have notably applied this approach to Malcolm X, with varying results. The social theorist and Marxist psychoanalyst Eugene V. Wolfenstein's 1981 study, "The Victims of Democracy: Malcolm X and the Black Revolution," is a work of considerable intellectual imagination and rigor that represents the best of this trend.
Mr. Wolfenstein takes ample measure of the energies that created Malcolm X and the demons that drove him. Recalling Malcolm's "earliest vivid memory" -- being traumatically awakened in the middle of the night in 1929 because the family house in Lansing, Mich., was burning to the ground -- Mr. Wolfenstein contends that Malcolm's "consciousness began in a moment of racist violence." Starting from that point, he brilliantly maps Malcolm's developing awareness both as a black man in a racist culture and as a member of a violent family. Mr. Wolfenstein says that Malcolm's father "made himself, by his own hand, both the defender and destroyer of his family."
In Mr. Wolfenstein's scheme, because Freudian theory "provides no foundation for the analysis of interests, be they individual or collective," and Marxism "provides no foundation for the analysis of desires," he uses both to explain Malcolm's life. But his book has deficiencies; besides his lack of clarity about the importance of religion in providing social cohesion among Nothern urban black communities, he focuses exclusively on biological definitions of race. Recent race theorists have maintained that race is not only a biological reality, but carries socially created meanings as well. Such an approach to race might have helped Mr. Wolfenstein explain how Malcolm and other blacks understood and employed race in their defense against white racism, and how rigid views of race held by black nationalists limited their range of social response.
Mr. Wolfenstein's major limitation lies in his excessive reliance on the autobiography for information about Malcolm. Nonetheless, Mr. Wolfenstein offers the most astute treatment to date of Malcolm's intellectual and psychological roots.
If Mr. Wolfenstein, despite his flaws, represents the best of the psychobiographical impulse, Bruce Perry's "Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America" (1991) may represent the worst. In Mr. Perry's eyes, Malcolm's troubled childhood holds the key to his subsequent career as a black leader. According to Mr. Perry, the physical abuse of his mother by Malcolm's father, his parents' extramarital affairs, the breakup of the family after the father's death and the mother's mental collapse, Malcolm's inheritance of his mother's obsession with color and his hatred of women, learned during childhood, all contributed to the mature Malcolm's contorted leadership style.
Mr. Perry says Malcolm's "war against the white power structure evolved from the same inner needs that had spawned earlier rebellions against his teachers, the law, established religion, and other symbols of authority." The author portrays Malcolm's family as besieged by unremitting violence, criminality and pathology. The mature Malcolm is equally tragic, a man of looming greatness whose self-destructive personality "contributed to his premature death."
TRUE enough, he does unearth new information about Malcolm. For instance, he reveals that in 1961 Malcolm X held a secret meeting with the Ku Klux Klan on Elijah Muhammad's behalf, seeking the Klan's aid (since both groups opposed racial mixing) in obtaining land for the Nation of Islam to implement its separatist philosophy. Mr. Perry also discusses Malcolm's alleged homosexual activity, both as an experimenting adolescent and as a hustling young adult "who sold himself, as if the best he had to offer was his body." But Mr. Perry's revelations are less striking for their threat to Malcolm's image as the quintessential black man than for the pedestrian interpretation he offers of Malcolm's homosexual motivations: absent male role models and a history of tyrannical females. 
Since Mr. Perry makes a plausible case for their occurrence, a discussion of Malcolm's homosexual alliances might have served as a powerful interpretive tool, a way of exploring and explaining the cultural weight of oppressive black machismo and the cruel varieties of homophobia that afflict black communities. Instead, Mr. Perry's treatment of Malcolm's sexuality fails to enlarge our understanding of black sexual politics or its relationship to social liberation.
Mr. Perry fills in details about Malcolm's last year, but again his tendentious reading of Malcolm's career mars his perspective. For instance, he concludes that Malcolm's forays onto foreign soil were an attempt to secure financial support for his fledgling organization. But this is only partly true; through his trips abroad, Malcolm X sought to expand the scope of his views about the black struggle as his philosophy took on international dimensions. And while Mr. Perry convincingly argues that Malcolm had forsaken his views about "devil" whites as early as 1959 (during his first trip to the Middle East and long before his trip to Mecca in 1964), he cynically concludes that Malcolm's press conference held at New York's Kennedy Airport after his return from Africa in May 1964 was a "fitting culmination" to a "public relations campaign."
While Malcolm X's last year was undoubtedly a year of sometimes frantic searching for the right road to take, Mr. Perry portrays it as a series of ploys to expand his support among nonblack audiences. Although the author concedes Malcolm's "extraordinary capacity for political ambiguity," he more often characterizes his subject as a "political chameleon." Mr. Perry's book finally impresses as little more than a sniping account that makes a complex figure smaller than life.
To fully grasp Malcolm X's complexity, it is necessary to probe his radical shift to a broader base of racial protest during his last year. Perhaps the most prominent and controversial interpreters of Malcolm's last year have been a group of intellectuals associated with the Socialist Workers Party, a Trotskyist group that took keen interest in Malcolm's views after his return from Mecca and sponsored some of his last speeches. For the most part, their views have been articulated by the social critic George Breitman, author of "The Last Year of Malcolm X: The Evolution of a Revolutionary" (1967) and editor of two volumes of Malcolm's speeches, organizational statements and interviews he gave during his last years, "Malcolm X Speaks" (1965) and "By Any Means Necessary" (1970).
Mr. Breitman passionately argues that Malcolm's split with Elijah Muhammad was a major shock, however inevitable. Thus Malcolm needed time to rethink his beliefs and determine his organizational direction. Mr. Breitman divides what he calls Malcolm's "brief independent phase" into two parts: a transition period, lasting the few months between the split in March 1964 and his return from Africa at the end of May of that year; and the final period, lasting from June 1964 until his death in February 1965.
Mr. Breitman maintains that this final period marked Malcolm's maturation as "a revolutionary -- increasingly anticapitalist and prosocialist as well as anti-imperialist," although Mr. Breitman acknowledges that Malcolm himself never adopted those labels. But the truth is that we have only the bare-bones outlines of Malcolm's emerging world view, including his views on socialism. In the speeches collected in these volumes, Malcolm X displays sympathy for socialist philosophy without committing himself to its practice as a means of achieving liberation for African-Americans. He confessed in an interview near the end of his life that "I still would be hard pressed to give a specific definition of the overall philosophy which I think is necessary for the liberation of the black people in this country." As a speculative study, Mr. Breitman's book is fascinating and provocative; as a definitive study of Malcolm's evolving intellectual positions, it is much less convincing. Malcolm X left behind fragments of political speech, not systematic social thought; suggestive ideological gestures more than substantive political activity. Mr. Breitman is attempting to saddle him with a set of views he did not live long enough to clarify or adopt.
With the rebirth of black nationalism since the early 1980's, placing Malcolm X in history has acquired renewed urgency, and might well serve to put into context the popularity of the Nation of Islam leader Minister Louis Farrakhan; the broad appeal and capacity to disturb that are inherent in rap music; the adoption of African hair styles, jewelry and clothing; the expression of Afrocentric ideas by scholars such as Molefi Asante, chairman of the African-American studies program at Temple University in Philadelphia, and Ivan Van Sertima, a professor of Afro-American studies at Rutgers University; and, of course, the cultural deluge that is Malcolmania.
Malcolm X is now a part of the American imagination that once relegated him to its margins. This transcendent status, however, does not free us from the obligation to demand more from our examination of the life that really was his. More than ever, we must forsake uncritical celebrations -- not by denying his myth but by taking it into account, by probing for the continuing wellsprings of his appeal and in so doing understand our need to romanticize or revile him. Battered by unprincipled opponents, smothered by well-meaning loyalists, Malcolm's past is not yet settled; it never will be. Nonetheless, he must in the end receive what every important historical figure deserves: a comprehensive examination of both word and deed. To do less would be to fail ourselves, and the history Malcolm X so boldly helped to create.
 
 
 
A MALCOLM X BOOKSHELF
 THE POLITICAL LEGACY OF MALCOLM X. By Oba T'Shaka. (Pan Afrikan Publications, 1983.) A clear exposition of Malcolm's political ideas as a revolutionary black nationalist. It is weak, however, as a critical examination of his thought.
MALCOLM X: SPEECHES AT HARVARD. Edited by Archie Epps. (Paragon House, 1991; previously published by Morrow in 1968 as THE SPEECHES OF MALCOLM X AT HARVARD.) Three speeches delivered by Malcolm at Harvard during the 1960's, edited and introduced by Archie Epps, who knew him. An imaginative introduction compares Malcolm's views to Shakespeare's plays, but almost swallows the speeches themselves.
THE ASSASSINATION OF MALCOLM X. By George Breitman, Herman Porter and Baxter Smith. (Pathfinder Press, third edition, 1991.) A collection of essays and book reviews, most of them by Mr. Breitman, that purport to prove a Government conspiracy to assassinate Malcolm.

Extensive excerpts from Malcolm X's F.B.I. files, arranged in 19 sections, provide invaluable information about his activities and progress as an activist and thinker. An excellent introduction argues that the files place Malcolm in the context of American racial politics of the 1950's and 60's.
THE BLACK MUSLIMS IN AMERICA. By C. Eric Lincoln. (Beacon Press, 1961; out of print.) The classic treatment of the Nation of Islam during the leadership of Elijah Muhummad and Malcolm X; unsurpassed as a sociological study of the sources of Black Muslim belief and practice.

Two bibliographies that give an indication of the wide debate about Malcolm carried on in journals, magazines, books and the popular press (especially alternative news papers).
THE END OF WHITE WORLD SUPREMACY: Four Speeches by Malcolm X. Edited by Imam Benjamin Karim. (Arcade Publishing, 1971.) As a historical document that records Malcolm's thought during the crucial year preceding his departure from the Nation of Islam, these speeches are invaluable. However, the book is marred by the attempt of the editor (who served under Malcolm, and introduced him on the day of his assassination) to validate through Malcolm's words the views he lived to reject -- making the book an act of ironic ventriloquism achieved by editorial manipulation.
MALCOLM X: THE LAST SPEECHES. Edited by Bruce Perry. (Pathfinder, 1989.) A valuable collection of six speeches and interviews, including two delivered during the last week of Malcolm's life, that is especially helpful in documenting his maturation as a social activist and intellectual who began to view the problems of black Americans within an international framework.

HEADLINE: Let's Reform Health Care Before It's Too Late

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Eli Ginzberg, who was kind enough to quote me in "The Health Swamp" (Op-Ed, Nov. 12), is right when he says that not everyone wants health care reform. Certainly, insurance companies and other powerful lobbies find the present system profitable enough. However, I think more Americans are dissatisfied with our system than Dr. Ginzberg suggests.
Every year thousands of families are impoverished by our health care system, yet few are getting their money's worth. Last year we spent more than $800 billion on health care, nearly half of it on administration and unnecessary tests and procedures. Our public hospitals are overburdened and will become more so as poverty, drugs and the AIDS epidemic take a further toll. 
 Many of our schoolchildren aren't ready to learn, in part because of poor or neglected health. Many adults who can afford to see a doctor can't find one because of an acute shortage of primary-care physicians in rural areas and inner cities, or they are disheartened by physician insensitivity or indifference.
At least 37 million people lack health insurance, a number bound to grow if unemployment increases. Medicare, which Dr. Ginzberg implies is chockablock with satisfied customers, falls far short of the real needs of our older population. Most of the elderly are not affluent -- the majority of women older than 65 have an income of less than $10,000 a year -- and even the poorest must spend their own money before Medicare kicks in. Even then, the system will not provide the medication or treatment many need to stay alive, and it makes no provision for long-term care or for avoiding or postponing nursing home costs by providing services to the elderly at home.
Medicaid, the other major government health insurance program, is even worse. It excludes most of the poor it is meant to serve by simply calling them too well off. Even those who qualify for Medicaid often find it does them little good: because the system pays physicians only a fraction of the real cost of treatment, more and more doctors refuse to see Medicaid patients.
It's no wonder then that, according to one national poll, 67 percent of those who voted for Bill Clinton ranked health care reform as their most pressing concern, ahead of education and jobs, and just behind the environment. How should the new administration begin the job of reforming our faltering health care system?
I have four modest suggestions. The first is to go slowly. The President-elect has said he will not be pressured into making hasty decisions on serious issues. I hope he maintains his resolve. America has voted for change, but not for haphazard change or for poorly drawn legislation that could take a generation to undo. Some adjustments, such as eliminating unnecessary paperwork, can be accomplished relatively quickly. However, more sweeping reforms, such as eliminating unnecessary tests and procedures, and overhauling the insurance industry, will take much longer -- a decade or more, even if everything goes smoothly.
Second, the new Administration should look to the states for guidance, rather than trying to impose its will on local jurisdictions through a national health board that would regulate the cost of everything from tongue depressors to bypass surgery. After 12 years as Governor of Arkansas, President-elect Clinton understands better than most the stresses state governments suffer when asked to absorb the economic and human cost of ill-conceived Federal mandates. He also knows that some of the most imaginative and effective contributions to health care reform have come from our states and cities, which have moved forward as our Federal Government fiddled.
Third, the President-elect needs to take the leadership in developing a national consensus on a plan of action. The most practical way is to appoint a bipartisan national health commission, representing doctors, patients, business, Congress, state and local governments and other interested groups to assess conflicting proposals, to choose the best and most balanced, to weigh and make clear the trade-offs, and to present a rational plan to Congress. The commission will succeed if its Congressional appointees commit themselves to the task, rather than delegating the work to their staffs, and if they take the proposals back to the House and Senate, lead the debate and enable the legislation. That's how we salvaged Social Security.
Finally, what the new administration needs most is the political will and the moral courage to challenge the interests that hold our health care system hostage. As Dr. Ginzberg notes, there's a crisis in the offing, and unless we reform the system now, before it reaches chaos or collapse, we will end up with government-run medicine, exorbitantly expensive and insensitive to patient needs, or have private medicine run amok.

HEADLINE: TOUGHER MEASURES TO FIGHT TB URGED BY NEW YORK PANEL

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
Wading into one of the most contentious issues in modern medicine, a panel of 34 scientists, ethicists and public health leaders yesterday released a report calling for broad new measures to stem the rampant spread of tuberculosis in New York City and around the nation.
Two of the panel's recommendations are likely to fuel angry policy debates: that all tuberculosis patients allow someone to watch them take their medication once they leave the hospital and that all patients receive treatment until they are completely cured rather than just no longer contagious. The recommendations would apply to all patients no matter what their economic background or the cause of their illness.
 
Curing the Sick
 In its report to the United Hospital Fund, a New York philanthropy that focuses on health-care issues, the panel also rejected controversial and growing demands for mandatory AIDS testing, saying it is not necessary for effective TB screening. People with the virus that causes AIDS are 40 times more likely to develop active cases of tuberculosis once they are infected with TB than those without H.I.V., and health officials say if the TB epidemic is not quickly contained by curing those who are sick, it could spread far more rapidly in the coming years. 
 New York City reported nearly 4,000 new cases of tuberculosis last year, and many of the patients had strains resistant to drug treatment. Many of those who are sick are homeless or drug addicts who rarely complete their treatments.
"This is an extremely cogent analysis of many of the issues raised by the resurgence of tuberculosis," New York City's Health Commissioner, Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, said of the report.
 
Legal Questions
 The central recommendations and others by the panel, which include extensive workplace education and measures to protect those infected with H.I.V. from discrimination, would have enormous impact if they are adopted by the New York City Health Commissioner. And they would add millions of dollars to a deeply strained budget.
Requiring patients to have people watch them take their medicine each day -- called directly observed therapy -- would force health officials to spend millions of dollars on supervising many who may be willing to take medicine without any such supervision or incentives. And the possibility of new laws that could strengthen public health officials' ability to detain patients has fueled intense debates about the murky line between civil liberties and the right of healthy people to stay that way.
"We absolutely agree that completing therapy has to be our No. 1 priority," Dr. Hamburg said. "But the reality is that it simply makes no sense in terms of our limited resources to force everyone to have directly observed therapy. I understand the problems of civil liberties and I understand who is most likely to get sick in New York. But we cannot afford to hold off on TB control efforts and wait until a damaged society is repaired. And we won't."
Many of the report's recommendations have been strongly endorsed by the Health Department. Others, like the far-reaching recommendation on directly observed therapy, would require legislative approval. Dr. Hamburg said that because there was no precedent for such laws, it was unclear who would have to approve them.
The group that wrote the report, titled "The Tuberculosis Revival: Individual Rights and Societal Obligations in a Time of AIDS," included representatives from the city, the state, leading medical schools, law firms, New York's largest labor unions and such organizations as the Gay Men's Health Crisis. Because it is perhaps the broadest such study released since deadly new strains of TB have proliferated in many American cities and because it coincides with some plans already approved by the Department of Health in New York City, where the epidemic is by far the worst, the findings are expected to wield influence far beyond the city.
The panel, led by New York physicians and ethicists, worked for more than six months on the document, which it envisioned as a way to look beyond the medical facts of the TB epidemic to the more difficult social issues of poverty and class that the disease has again underscored. Curing new strains can require patients to swallow a dozen pills a day for up to two years, and the difficulties of treatment have made the resurgence of tuberculosis particularly hazardous in poor communities.
 
'Lessen the Stigma'
 "It is absolutely essential that we never again draw lines in health care between the haves and the have nots," said Nancy Dubler, the director of the division of bioethics at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and a main author of the report. "If everyone is forced to take their medicine in the same way, it will lessen the stigma for all. And that is a sacrifice and a goal worth seeking."
Dr. Dubler said she hoped the recommendations, which were developed with extensive testimony from New York Health Department officials, would help erase the sharp divisions in the quality of health care for many urban residents. But some city health officials and advocacy organizations suggested they seemed more a wistful reminder of how bad services are than a reasonable way to change them.
"We are all dealing with huge problems and little money," said David Hansell, deputy director for government affairs at Gay Men's Health Crisis. "Why on earth would we put everyone on monitored therapy when clearly there are many who don't need it?"
The panel, however, claims it is unfair to suggest that only poor, black and Hispanic people -- who make up the great majority of TB patients -- fail to complete the treatment necessary for a cure. A goal of the panel is to create a single tier health system, and it sees the recommendation of directly observed therapy for all patients as an important step in that direction.
"We are not saying hold the epidemic hostage to our sense of social obligation," Dr. Dubler said. "What we are saying is for once let's act with fairness in a crisis."
As always, when threats to public health bump up against civil liberties imperatives, the question of fairness arises. Is it fair to lock people away from their families until they are not simply contagious but completely cured? Many community advocates say no, but public health experts are uniform in their insistence that the answer is yes. Is it fair to require H.I.V. testing of all workers who might come into contact with TB patients? Public health officials say that testing should be a personal decision, but many health-care workers think it should be mandatory.
"These are not easy issues," said Bruce C. Vladeck, president of the United Hospital Fund.
The document essentially makes a simple case: It is time to stop blaming victims of poverty for a disease that has always been primarily a result of destitution and urban crowding. It argues that without fundamental changes in the way poor people receive health care, measures like arresting those who do not take medicine will never really do any long-term good. It suggests that New York provide incentives -- including payments -- to get them to complete treatment.

HEADLINE: Promises Aside, States in Region Fight With One Another for Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
A little more than a year after Connecticut, New Jersey, New York State and New York City signed an agreement intended to end the luring of companies from one another, the interstate war for jobs is intensifying and the so-called nonaggression pact seems close to collapse.
In recent months, New Jersey and Connecticut have fattened the packages of financial aid they offer companies that relocate there. New York State, which has had the biggest arsenal of financial incentives, has been forced to increase sharply the amount it doles out to keep companies from leaving. 
 This month, for instance, New York City and New York State had to offer $80 million in incentives to prevent the New York Mercantile Exchange from moving to Jersey City. New York officials say that without the competition from New Jersey, they would have had to pay only $50 million.
"Maybe the key players have got to sit down and look each other in the eye and say, 'Do we have a regional cooperative agreement or is it truly economic warfare?' " said Barry F. Sullivan, New York City's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "If we mean what we say about fostering a cooperative economic-development agenda, then we have to get together and reinforce it."
The aim of the nonaggression pact signed by the four governments in October 1991 was to prevent companies from playing one part of the region against another to obtain public subsidies like tax breaks, grants, low-cost financing and energy discounts. The hope was that these resources would instead be used to invest in things like transportation, training and marketing to make the region more competitive against other parts of the country.
But promises of cooperation have gone by the wayside as the recession-ravaged states have desperately tried to stop the plunge in jobs. Since the pact was signed, New York has lost 134,000 nonfarm jobs, New Jersey 93,000 and Connecticut 53,000.
In October 1992, the number of nonfarm jobs remaining in New York was 7,752,000; in New Jersey, 3,392,000, and in Connecticut, 1,504,000.
From the sketchy data available, New York State -- especially New York City -- is the biggest loser in the intensifying war. Rather than luring companies from New Jersey or Connecticut, New York is losing businesses to those states or having to pay ever-higher incentives to keep them.
Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a strong advocate of regional cooperation, contends that the incentive war is hurting the entire region. "It does not create new jobs or economic activity in the region," he said. "What it does is enrich private-sector entities."
Despite such calls for cooperation, the fighting seems to be escalating. Vincent Tese, New York State's director of economic development, is threatening to retaliate against New Jersey by making a special effort to attract its companies.
Although he expressed concern about such new Connecticut subsidies as tax credits for relocating companies, he is outraged by recent New Jersey measures like a development bank that offers companies a variety of aid.
 
New Program in New Jersey
 Today, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey is expected to announce a new program in which the state will make investments -- and will even take partial ownership -- in privately owned buildings to enhance the ability of their owners to attract tenants.
New Jersey did just that in September when it persuaded a unit of the First Chicago Corporation to move 1,000 jobs from lower Manhattan to the empty, new Newport Tower in Jersey City. Now, Mr. Florio plans to expand the practice significantly. He is also expected to announce today that the USA cable network is moving operations with 100 employees in New York City and Long Island to Newport Tower, in a deal similar to First Chicago's.
The 1991 pact was actually fairly limited in its promises. The four merely vowed not to use negative advertising against one another and to avoid programs designed exclusively to lure companies from the others. They also promised to increase cooperation in marketing, to develop a regional development strategy and to create a committee of policymakers that would meet at least quarterly to deal with regional economic problems and to undertake initiatives.
A ban on soliciting companies within the region and reductions in subsidies used to woo companies were long-term goals.
The governments have refrained from negative advertising. But some annoyed officials are concerned that state-regulated utilities like Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey and the Brooklyn Union Gas Company have been running ads that promote their service areas and knock neighboring states.
There has also been some increased cooperation. For example, New Jersey joined New York City and New York State in a successful effort to bring the 1998 Goodwill Games to metropolitan New York.
But the four governments have yet to begin work on a regional economic-development strategy, and the committee of policy makers has yet to meet. By some accounts, turnover among senior economic officials in the region is partly to blame. Mr. Sullivan, who assumed his position on May 1, said he became aware of the pact only last month.
Barbara W. McConnell, who became New Jersey's Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development less than a year ago, also called for a regional meeting. But with states in other regions increasing incentives, she added, "in these tough times it's a lot more difficult to sit still."
Joseph J. McGee, Commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Economic Development, agreed. "I would welcome another meeting, but let's also be realistic," he said. "We're all protecting our job base."
Connecticut and New Jersey officials insisted that it was better for the region if companies interested in leaving New York went to one of their states instead of leaving the region.
 
Differing State Strategies
 To hear officials of the three states tell it, the incentive programs are mainly intended to help companies already in their states expand.
Connecticut recently lowered its corporate tax rate, eased taxes on manufacturers and introduced tax credits for research and development. All three states have increased aid to companies for job training.
Playing catch-up to New York, Connecticut and New Jersey have expanded their ability to help companies obtain low-cost financing, which they see as vital at a time when commercial banks have been reluctant to lend.
Connecticut and New Jersey have also formed venture-capital groups to invest in companies and help them develop new products. New York State has invested heavily in collaborative research centers for universities and industry that are intended to promote the commercial use of inventions.
But what has become clear is that programs whose original purpose was not to steal jobs from a neighbor may do just that as companies play one state off the other. As the states and New York City acknowledged in 1991, the only way to avert that is for members of the region to harmonize their incentives.
While some concede that they failed to take meaningful steps down that road, they still seem skeptical that cooperation is possible. "No matter what we have in common as a region, we are not identical in our economic base, our work force and our demographics," Ms. McConnell said.
New York officials say NGersey is most responsible for the escalating economic war. They cite its efforts to xfive commodity exchanges, the headquarters of Prudential Securities Inc. and the First Chicago unit from Manhattan.
New Jersey succeeded only with First Chicago. But New York officials say New Jersey forced them to offer much more in incentives to keep other businesses.
To a lesser extent, New York officials are worried about tax credits that Connecticut is offering to entice companies. The Morgan Stanley Group, which considered moving its headquarters from Manhattan to Stamford, Conn., would have received as much as $100 million in credits over seven years to do so.
Instead, the investment bank agreed to stay in Manhattan after Mayor David N. Dinkins agreed to a four-year freeze of New York City's corporate-income-tax rate and the city and state offered a 10-year, $40 million package of incentives.
 
Attacks on a New Fund
 New York City and New York State also prevailed over New Jersey when The New York Times decided to build a printing and distribution plant in College Point, Queens, to replace its midtown Manhattan press operations. But Mr. Tese emphasized that The Times did not aggressively try to play one state against the other. "I think The Times wanted to stay in New York," he said. "What The Times was asking for was not excessive."
New York officials are especially angry about New Jersey's use of its new $224 million Economic Recovery Fund to woo New York businesses. The fund can be used to make grants, loans, investments or loan guarantees.
"In theory, its purpose is broader than stealing New York City businesses," said Carl Weisbrod, president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation and one of the city's main warriors in its battle to retain companies. "In practice, that is what it seems to be aimed at."
The fund will provide $6 million to outfit Newport Tower for First Chicago. In return, the fund will receive as much as 8 percent ownership in the building. New York officials estimated that it would have cost the city and state more than $50 million in incentives to beat the New Jersey package.
New York and New Jersey officials say they are negotiating with what they describe as several high-profile companies threatening to move operations out of New York City. New York officials fear New Jersey is using the Economic Recovery Fund to woo them.
"We are not actively going across the river, picking the pockets of the city and the state," said Ms. McConnell, pointing out that the fund mainly provides capital for small and medium-sized companies already in New Jersey and for local public construction. "But if there are companies in New York City looking to move out, I don't think the agreement called for us to sit on our hands."

HEADLINE: The Vietnamese Speak Softly Of Their Own 300,000 M.I.A.

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LANG SON, Vietnam

 BODY:
Me Thi Ha believes she is a widow. But apart from the faded, red-bordered Government certificate proclaiming her husband a "Vietnamese martyr in the struggle against America," she has no proof of his death.
Mrs. Ha worries about calling herself a widow because she still does not know how or when or where her husband died, and she says she probably never will. 
 "Of course I understand how the Americans feel," she said. "When I read in the newspapers how the Americans come here to search for the missing soldiers, I know exactly the pain of the families. We share the same grief."
 
Missing and Presumed Dead

In Vietnamese homes, the red-bordered certificates are typically displayed in the finest wooden frames the families can afford, and as household decorations they are as common here as wall calendars and family photographs. Like the families of many Vietnamese soldiers, Mrs. Ha received the certificate instead of a body that the Vietnamese Army could never find.
According to the Hanoi Government, her husband, Capt. To Van Thinh, and more than 300,000 other Vietnamese soldiers are still missing and can only be presumed dead from what many Vietnamese in the north still call the War Against America.
About a million and a half Vietnamese were killed in the war -- 185,000 South Vietnamese soldiers, 924,000 North Vietnamese and Vietcong and 415,000 civilians. About 58,000 Americans died.
More than three-quarters of the Vietnamese missing are from central or north-central provinces, although the figure of 300,000 includes Vietcong as well as tens of thousands of soldiers who served in the South Vietnamese Army.
 
Careful With Americans
 There are death certificates on display everywhere in Lang Son, a city of merchants and small farmers on Vietnam's mountainous northern border with China, about 80 miles northeast of Hanoi. Lang Son is the capital of Lang Son Province, home to nearly 2,400 soldiers listed as missing from the war.
The Vietnamese Government, which is eager to resume diplomatic and economic ties with the United States, is careful not to offend American visitors by suggesting directly that the sacrifice of Vietnamese families was greater than that of families in the United States.
But when American investigators come to Hanoi to press the Vietnamese to cooperate in the search for 2,265 Americans still listed as unaccounted for in Indochina, the Vietnamese will turn the conversation -- slowly, carefully, inevitably -- to the fact that so many more Vietnamese are also missing.
 
Few Dental Records
 Hanoi's recent announcement that it will step up cooperation in the search for missing Americans by opening up its war archives is thought likely to result in a relaxation of a 17-year-old American trade embargo on Vietnam.
Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is responsible for trying to help Vietnamese families determine the fate of missing soldiers, but there is little it can do.
"Vietnam is a very poor country, and so the people must take responsibility for this themselves -- this must be a people's campaign," said Nghiem Xuan Tue, a military spokesman. "Even when we have a soldier's remains, we have none of the modern technology to identify them."
Dental records, among the most valuable tools the Pentagon has for identifying the remains of American troops, are usually not available for North Vietnamese soldiers, most of whom had never had a dental X-ray.
 
Families Keep Searching
 As a North Vietnamese soldier in the early 1970's, Mr. Tue fought on some of the most grisly battlefields of the south, and he said it was common for northern soldiers to be buried hurriedly in shallow dirt graves marked only by a few stones.
"In the war there was no time to bury a man properly," he said. "I buried so many myself. You would leave stones on the grave and hope to go back someday to find it." For thousands of soldiers who were hit by bombs dropped from B-52's, he said, there were no remains at all.
While the chances of finding a soldier's remains are virtually nonexistent, nearly 1,000 northern Vietnamese families apply to the Government each month for the chance to travel south to look for clues to the fate of missing relatives.
 
Proper Burial Is Essential
 Many go armed only with a one-page typewritten letter that was commonly sent to families by the army informing them of little more than the fact that a soldier had died; if a family was lucky, the letter mentioned a province where the body might have been buried.
During the war, communication from the southern battlefields was difficult and dangerous, and mail from soldiers did not routinely travel north. Many northern families were not notified for years that a soldier had died or was missing.
Tran Van Ke, a 64-year-old shipping clerk from Lang Son, waited five years before he learned that his son had died of wounds suffered in South Vietnam.
"His friends came home from the war in 1975 and told us our brave son died in 1970 and that he had been quickly buried," Mr. Ke said, reaching up to remove a small black-and-white photograph of his son, Tran Ban Tiep, from the wall of the front room of the family home. The 1968 photo showed a boyish Mr. Tiep, then 18, in full military uniform, carrying an AK-47 rifle.
"His friends cannot remember where he was buried," Mr. Ke said. "It is my great hope that we will someday discover where he is buried."
Ancestor worship dominates the spiritual life of the Vietnamese, and it is considered essential that the remains of the dead be properly buried and venerated.
"If I could afford the trip, I would go south to look for my husband," said Mrs. Ha, a retired army cook whose only income, apart from gifts from her three children, is a $5-a-month pension. "Even if I could not find him, I would like to try. I am not a religious woman, but I do know I would feel relief in my dreams if I know where my husband was buried."

HEADLINE: Clinton May Carry the Campaign Into Office

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Nov. 29

 BODY:
Running along the beach here Saturday, Bill Clinton came upon a volleyball game, a group of bronzed young Californians at play. The President-elect briefly joined in. Gawkers marveled.
"Which one is the President?" a woman asked. 
 "He's the one with the white legs," another replied.
But Mr. Clinton, so much paler than the typical beach devotee as to seem of a different species, has one great point in common with the worshipers of sun and sea in Southern California. Like the surfers in "The Endless Summer," the 1966 movie that helped define California beach culture, Mr. Clinton is chasing his own version of the perfect wave: the perfect encounter with a voter. His endless summer is an endless campaign.
 
Continuing Courtship
 When Mr. Clinton was elected, it seemed reasonable to assume that he would stop campaigning. Instead, he has done something unique for a President-elect. He has segued from the last race into the next one. The emerging style of his Presidency is the style of the endless campaign.
At its heart, the style is personal, a ceaseless, tireless effort to maintain and extend a connection between Bill Clinton and the people. The connection is intimate and emotional and far more physical than is the Presidential norm. It has already led to extraordinary scenes of the President-elect moving impulsively through barely controlled crowds, and it has clearly become a concern for the Secret Service agents assigned to protect him.
The Clinton touch with the public is an article of faith among his advisers, who liked to boast during the campaign that he almost invariably won the support of anyone he actually met. And they have high hopes that this approach will work in the long haul of the Presidency.
But others say the tactic carries risk as well. While calling what he termed the "post-inauguration extension of the campaign" a good idea in the short term for a President who will take office without a majority of voters behind him, Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst, warned against a prolonged reliance on public relations.
 
'Risk of Trivializing'
 "If he reaches the point where this is seen as an attempt to camouflage non-action on the economic front, it could be counterproductive," Mr. Phillips said. "He also runs the risk of trivializing his mandate and damaging the gravitas of the Presidency if he monkeys around too much."
Mr. Clinton's style as he prepares to enter the White House is the successor to the style that got him there. With the possible exception of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, no Presidential candidate of recent years campaigned so aggressively, so physically, among the public.
While George Bush mostly limited his excursions among the people to brief visits with small, well-controlled groups, Mr. Clinton reached out to as many people as possible. In a 16-hour day, he would touch and be touched by perhaps several hundred people, and would speak directly to many thousands.
 
Selling 'Retail Politics'
 Since winning office, he has continued to campaign in this manner, which political experts call "retail politics." On his daily run or exercise session at the Little Rock Downtown Y.M.C.A., he is open, for instance, to anyone who approaches him for a private word or an autograph.
On a grander scale, he has developed the habit of making an ostensibly informal, but actually carefully arranged, walk among the people once every week or so. These events, known among Mr. Clinton's aides as "meet and greets," are the heart of retail politics, and Mr. Clinton does them very well.
The third of these, following walks on Georgia Avenue, in Washington, and through a poor area of Albany, Ga., came Friday, when Mr. Clinton toured the Glendale Galleria, a gigantic mall in a suburb of Los Angeles.
The event illustrated the great political and emotional lift such visits offer as well as the danger they pose. Thirty thousand people were so tightly crammed in the mall's two floors that movement along the areas where Mr. Clinton was to walk became almost impossible.
 
No 'Prisoner of the White House'
 As Mr. Clinton made his way, talking and listening and touching, the crowd reacted with a level of excitement more usually accorded to movie stars. They screamed and surged as Mr. Clinton approached, straining against the line of obviously worried police officers and Secret Service agents, who made them wave their hands in the air to show they carried no weapons.
Mr. Clinton's top aides say he will continue this sort of thing after he assumes the Presidency.
"He does not intend to become a prisoner of the White House," said Bruce Lindsey, a senior adviser. "This is one of the ways that he maintains a sense of what's going on -- talking to real people about their real problems is a way for him to maintain a sense of what the national problems are, and whether the solutions are working."
Discussing "meet and greets" like the walk in the Glendale Galleria, Mr. Lindsey said Mr. Clinton "learns from these sort of events, by talking to people and finding out what their needs are," adding, "It's nice to read studies that tell you that this or that is what the people need, but it's better to go talk to the people directly."
Meeting large numbers of people also has an emotional benefit for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Lindsey suggested.
"For years, other politicians have told him that he can't keep working crowds so energetically, that it would exhaust him, drain him," Mr. Lindsey said. "Clearly, it doesn't drain him. It re-charges him. It energizes him."
On one level, the accuracy of Mr. Lindsey's analysis can be seen in five minutes of watching Mr. Clinton in public action. He bounds from encounter to encounter, leaning forward into conversation. He seems deeply comfortable with very intimate moments, willing to allow strangers to hug and kiss him. He beams at the evident adulation; in the Glendale Galleria he seemed as much and as happily in his natural element as a man could possibly be.
 
Political Benefit, Too
 But the psychological needs of a career politician -- and Mr. Clinton has been campaigning toward the White House for almost the whole of his adult life -- often dovetail with the political ones.
Mr. Clinton's aides do not generally cite as the model for his first term John F. Kennedy, the President their boss most obviously evokes in mannerisms of gesture and speech. Rather, they point to Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Like Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Clinton will take office at a point of history's cusp. Like Mr. Roosevelt, he is widely admired but also widely mistrusted. Like Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Clinton will have to deal with competing interests pressuring him in contradictory directions.
If Mr. Clinton is to emulate Mr. Roosevelt's success, his advisers say, he must build a base of support strong and deep enough to allow him to bend Congress to action and to override criticism from interest groups and the press.
Mr. Roosevelt built his base with fireside chats that bypassed the press to forge a strong, intimate bond with millions of voters. But Mr. Clinton must use television, in which pictures, not words, serve to establish emotional connection.
 
Power of Television
 What Mr. Clinton and his advisers appear to have grasped is that the power of television allows a politician who understands the camera to gain a wholesale benefit from a moment in retail politics. A hug with a weeping woman at a roadside stop in the Midwest, a few minutes of volleyball on a California beach, a walk through a poor black neighborhood in Washington -- these moments, captured on camera and played nationwide on the evening news, can serve to build a sense of kinship.
"There's a tremendous effect beyond just the community we go to on one of these visits," Mr. Lindsey said. "We find that in communities like the ones where the visit took place there is a feeling that Bill Clinton is one of them because of the visit. If he goes down and visits a town in Georgia, people see that not just in Georgia, but in places like that all across the South, and it moves them."
Mr. Clinton's approach clearly worked in the 1992 campaign and was, in a modest way, revolutionary. Going against accepted political wisdom, he ran a retail campaign in the season of wholesale politics, understanding that the broadening effect of television would make small moments large.
Whether it can work in the White House is a new matter. No one, including Mr. Clinton, can know right now if the public will still have an appetite for the endless campaign a year from now.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Vying for Committees, Freshmen Mimic Insiders

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
After a campaign focused on fighting the status quo, it did not take long for the freshmen in Congress to start wheeling and dealing for coveted positions in the insider network.
Even before they have been sworn in, the members of the largest freshman class to enter Congress in more than 40 years are falling into the clutches of incumbency -- fighting like political pros for the committee assignments that will determine how much influence they will wield over the next two years. 
 In fact, the jockeying is more intense than ever, inflamed by the many retirements and defeats of incumbents that left scores of empty seats on Congressional committees.
"It's overachievers' hell," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Representative-elect Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, said he was taking a "chin-first, Rocky 1" approach in his bids for a seat on one of three gold-plated committees: Appropriations, Energy and Commerce, or Ways and Means: "I just go in there and say, 'Guys, this is what I need.' You write them, you call them, you harass them. If it's politically advantageous for all those concerned, that's what they all want to know."
 
Suddenly Popular
 Others just grovel.
"I've been called at home, paged at airports, and I've never been so popular," said one of the few Democratic leaders who would discuss the subject, but only on condition that he remain unidentified.
Although the selection process has only begun, some incoming lawmakers are already expressing disgust, or at least dismay. Representative-elect Sam Coppersmith, Democrat of Arizona, said he wished the leaders would just leave it up to the new members themselves to make the committee selections.
"There would be a certain poetic justice if they just threw three juicy steaks into a room full of 65 hungry dogs and see which three dogs come out with the steaks," he said. "It would be an amazing labor-saving device."
And while the incoming members are running their fax machines on overdrive and shuttling to Washington to lobby Congressional leaders, battles have broken out among sophomore and junior members in the California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York delegations for assignments on the House Appropriations committee, the panel that disburses pork.
 
Patrons Are Desirable
 Because of the huge turnover -- 122 new members in the Senate and House in all -- the large number of committee vacancies (no one knows exactly how many) is making the byzantine process of obtaining desired assignments more frenzied than ever.
There is no precise formula for going about it, but finding a senior patron is of prime importance. Then junior lawmakers must flatter other members of their state delegations and sweet-talk the titans like the Speaker of the House, or at least a member of the party committee in charge of assignments.
Finally, they must beat out other junior members when the four party committees -- one for each party in the respective chambers -- take their votes around the second week of December.
Members of one assigning panel, the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, say some junior lawmakers are writing pandering letters to Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and other leaders, reminding them of their help on past issues or pledging their fealty.
Most explain why they are qualified for one position or another, but several of the most effective letters, according to a member of the steering committee, note that they are in competitive districts and therefore need a chance to shine.
"The more independent, the more of a maverick you are, the worse off you are in this insider process," the steering committee member said.
No matter what their seniority, all lawmakers know that their re-elections could well depend on the new highway project they bring home from the Senate Appropriations Committee, the loophole for a local business they sneak into a tax bill from the House Ways and Means Committee, or even the occasional televised repartee with a controversial Supreme Court nominee from a seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
On the other hand, most are running away from unwanted assignments on the Committee on House Administration or the Committee on the District of Columbia, which can mean handling complaints about service at the House restaurant or delays in garbage pickups in the nation's capital.
This year, leaders are practically begging House members to fill more than 20 vacancies on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a reflection of the fact that foreign issues are on the political back burner. Meanwhile, scores of members are throwing their names into play for the 10 or so open seats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, one of the most powerful panels in economic affairs.
"It's like in the Army," said Representative Scott L. Klug of Wisconsin, a member of the Committee on Committees, the Republican House panel that makes committee assignments.
"The people with the best experience don't get the assignments," said Mr. Klug, a critic of the process. "It's who is better at making deals, not who knows energy and tax issues best."
 
Heeding His Instincts
 Members design strategies that fit their temperaments. Senator-elect Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he has received numerous offers from well-placed advocates for various causes to lobby senior members on his behalf for choice assignments. "My instincts told me that's not the way to go," said Mr. Feingold, who added he could be satisfied with a more modest assignment on the Budget Committee or the Special Committee on Aging. "That's not a good first impression. Immediate gain can lead to long-term pain."
Representative-elect Blanche Lambert, Democrat of Arkansas, has taken the unconventional tack of holding back her assignment requests until the last minute to see how the demands for openings shake out. "It's a little bit like a board game," she said, "or like in bridge, you always have to know what cards have been played."
Insiders do not take Ms. Lambert lightly. At age 32, she is an experienced Capitol Hill lobbyist who began her career as a receptionist for Representative Bill Alexander, the man she beat in a primary last spring on her way to Congress.
Complicating the process is the fact that seats are assigned according to a member's state or region. When more than one member from the same state wants the same seat, seniority comes into play, as well as race, sex and ideological orientation.
Carolyn B. Maloney, a City Councilwoman in New York who defeated Representative Bill Green, Republican of Manhattan, promised to make a run for his Appropriations Committee seat. But she ran into the stone wall of four, more senior, delegation members who want the same position and the extra staff that goes with it.
The job of mediating among those four colliding egos fell to Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Harlem and the dean of the delegation. To whittle down the field, Mr. Rangel called Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, to ask if he could make room for Michael R. McNulty of Albany.
 
A Three-Way Showdown
 Mr. Rostenkowski said yes, setting up a three-way showdown -- among Representatives Floyd H. Flake of Queens, Nita M. Lowey of Westchester and Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx -- for the delegation's secret-ballot recommendation to the steering committee before Dec. 8. The three are vigorously lobbying their colleagues for at most two openings.
Mr. Serrano has enlisted the Hispanic Caucus to help him, while Ms. Lowey has beseeched several fund raisers and even rabbis to make calls on her behalf. Although Mr. Flake has the most seniority, his case is hurt by a previous rejection by the Steering Committee as well as the excess baggage of a 1990 indictment, later dismissed, accusing him of evading taxes.
Boldness is called for when a junior member is opposed by party leaders for a desired seat.
Representative Arthur Ravenel Jr., Republican from a South Carolina coastal district, threatened to change parties a few years ago if he did not get on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. A ranking Republican on the panel, Representative Don Young of Alaska, was blocking him because Mr. Ravenel opposed offshore oil drilling in Alaskan waters.
Mr. Ravenel's bluff worked. Already hopelessly in the minority, the Republicans acceded and granted the plucky South Carolinian his seat.

HEADLINE: Chinese Premier Making a Rare Visit to Hanoi

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Prime Minister Li Peng is to travel to Vietnam this week for the first such visit by a Chinese leader in more than two decades.
Despite the normalization of relations a year ago, dealings between the Communist neighbors remain so strained that they threaten the peace in the region. 
 Mr. Li is to visit Vietnam from Monday through Friday, in part to build on the resumption of normal diplomatic relations. But his visit is not expected to achieve any breakthrough on the territorial disputes along the countries' land border and in the South China Sea.
China and Vietnam fought a brief border war in 1979, and there have been periodic skirmishes since then. This year China has challenged Hanoi by taking a more assertive posture toward its territorial claims.
Sensitive to charges that they have been bullying Vietnam, Chinese officials are eager to portray the trip as a sign of friendship between the former enemies.
 
'A Very Important Visit'
 "It will be a very important visit," said Wu Jianmin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. "There is far more common ground between China and Vietnam than there are differences and problems between them."
One of the most important topics during Mr. Li's visit will be the dispute over the Spratly and Paracel islands in the South China Sea. The islands are claimed fully or in part by six nations in the region, but China is in the best position to back its claims by force.
In May, China signed a contract with an American company to explore for oil in a region of sea that is much closer to Vietnam than to China. Then in September, a Chinese ship began drilling near the Gulf of Tonkin, in waters that Vietnam claims as its own.
Western diplomats take no position on whose territory it is, but they warn that the dispute could lead to another Chinese-Vietnamese war -- particularly if oil is found in the South China Sea.
China's trade minister, Li Lanqing, is to accompany Prime Minister Li to Hanoi, and economic ties are also expected to be on the agenda.
"We expect our trade and economic collaboration will receive a shot in the arm from the talks," Wei Xiaorong, a trade official, told the China Daily newspaper.
Since relations were formally normalized in November 1991, air links have been restored and trade has soared. In the first nine months of 1992, trade totaled $104 million, more than three times the figure in the similar period of 1991.
In fact, total trade is far higher, because many goods are smuggled by merchants across narrow mountain trails or by fishermen in the South China Sea.
Rail links were supposed to have been restored as well, but China annoyed Vietnam by building a station in a buffer zone at "Friendship Pass" along the border. In addition, China announced that a strip of several hundred yards of what used to be Vietnam was now its own territory.
Another obstacle for trade is the recent practice by the Chinese border police of seizing cargo ships plying between Hong Kong and Vietnam. At least 19 ships have been seized, and the total is probably higher since some shipowners try to avoid publicity. The ships are normally freed after an investigation, but some cargoes have been confiscated.
China says its purpose is to curb smuggling, and Hong Kong officials say there may be something to that. But the seizures have focused on ships heading for Vietnam, and some see them as official piracy -- as well as a way of showing Vietnam who is stronger.
China was a firm supporter of the Communist Government in Hanoi during the 1960's and the early part of the 1970's. According to Chinese estimates, 300,000 Chinese volunteers took part in the Vietnam War on the side of Hanoi, with 1,100 killed.
Vietnam later angered China by expelling and often severely mistreating its ethnic Chinese inhabitants. The friendship collapsed completely at the end of 1978, when Vietnam's Army invaded Cambodia to oust the regime of the Khmer Rouge, China's ally.

HEADLINE: Revamping U.S. Commerce Agency

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award -- three rectangles of foot-high crystal mounted on an aluminum base -- sits on a coffee table in the office of Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin.
But the base of the nation's highest award for corporate quality does not hold the crystal blocks tightly and it comes apart, Ms. Franklin said apologetically, adding: "It's the way it was designed." 
 Many people, some of them close to President-elect Bill Clinton, say the same thing about the Commerce Department.
The agency looks after a potpourri that includes economic statistics, unfair trade cases, weather forecasts, the census and dead dolphins. After reviewing the obstacles to making sense out of the department, the Clinton transition team now leans toward shifting the missions of its many agencies, Democrats said.
 
Old Plans on Hold
 Previous Democratic plans to take some agencies out and substitute new ones have been put on a back burner.
By installing his own people in existing agencies at the Commerce Department and elsewhere, Mr. Clinton should be able to emphasize Government assistance in the research and development of new commercial products and Government aid to exporters without fighting a political battle to reorganize the department, Democrats say. The agency may even be renamed the Department of Commerce and Technology, they add.
The heart of the department's mission will be a broad new interpretation of trade policy, Democrats say, with Government trying to help new American industries into the international marketplace and help flagging industries before they run into trouble from imports.
The leading candidate to replace Ms. Franklin and carry out this task is John A. Young, who has announced plans to retire soon as president and chief executive of the Hewlett-Packard Company. Details of the Democratic plan have not been worked out.
Under the Bush Administration, trade policy has consisted mostly of international agreements negotiated by Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative. The Commerce Department has started several programs to help exporters by telling them where to find information and money in the Federal bureaucracy. But its main role has been the occasional imposition of steep import taxes or quotas to protect struggling American industries.
Democrats and Republicans across the political spectrum agree the agency now serves a hodgepodge of unrelated functions. The late Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, for whom the award is named, tried in vain in the early 1980's to expand his department to include the Office of Trade Representative, which is part of the White House.
Senator John Glenn of Ohio and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, introduced the best known and most influential Democratic plan in 1988. It would have put now-independent Federal export financing agencies into the department, created a civilian technology agency in the department to back private-sector research, transferred the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the Environmental Protection Agency and set up an Economic Security Advisory Board to oversee trade and international economic policy.
The department did create a Technology Administration three years ago, but its role and budget have been kept small.
 
Change in Mission Sought
 Mr. Clinton has expressed interest in reorganization and in changing the missions of existing agencies as ways to shake up the Commerce Department.
Mr. Clinton said at a news conference on Nov. 12 that too often "Presidents-elect have been in a rush to fill the Cabinet positions before they decided whether they wanted these departments to pursue a different mission than had been pursued in the past, and without considering perhaps how these departments should fit one with the other."
Actually transferring agencies faces a daunting obstacle: the enormous number of Congressional committees involved.
"To reorganize anything in this town, you have to reorganize the Hill, and the jurisdictions of the committees, and I don't think that's in the cards," Ms. Franklin said.
A few Democrats still think reorganization possible. "I don't think the jurisdiction issue really bothers members," said Representative Robert Matsui, Democrat of California and senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on international trade, "because we don't see the Commerce Department as being relevant."
But large corporations are the main constituency of the Commerce Department, and they have expressed little enthusiasm over the years for reorganization.
The department's International Trade Administration alone reports to the House and Senate Commerce Committees, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee on trade issues, and the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on breaking the Arab economic boycott against Israel.
"There are very few committees or subcommittees that don't wind up involved in some aspect of Commerce," said a department official who insisted on anonymity. "No matter how you split the baby, you're going to take away jurisdiction from a powerful Congressional committee chairman."

The Economy
Business executives say the Clinton economic expansion may have arrived even before the President-elect moves into the White House. But they add that the pace of the rebound will be far slower than in past recoveries and that too few jobs will be created to bring unemployment down quickly. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Retailers Buoyed by First Holiday Shoppers

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
As a group, retailers rarely describe business forecasts in terms that are not upbeat. But if any message can be gleaned from their reports on the first two days of the all-important holiday shopping season it is this: "Cautiously optimistic" has been upgraded to "pretty optimistic."
Although only a few retailers offered hard numbers yesterday, a consensus appeared to be emerging that sales were up from 5 to 8 percent over the same period last year. For example, a survey of about 10,000 retail outlets by Telecheck Services suggests that retail sales on Friday rose 5.1 percent compared with the day after Thanksgiving last year. 
 And Younkers Inc., a chain of department stores in seven Midwestern states, reported a 6 to 8 percent increase in sales on Friday and Saturday. "There's not been a big increase in traffic," said Tom Gould, chairman and chief executive, "but the customers who are out, are buying."
If such jumps are borne out when all the cash register slips from Friday and Saturday are tallied and reported, it will mean a slight improvement over most retailers' predictions of sales increases of 4 to 6 percent. That would compare with gains last year of a little more than 1 percent for the two days after Thanksgiving.
To some degree, holiday shopping gains will be easier this year, because there are two more shopping days than there were last holiday season. In 1991, Christmas fell on a Wednesday. This year, being a leap year, Christmas is on a Friday. Retailers hope that will translate into at least incremental increases for the holiday shopping season, when they typically ring up as much as 40 percent of their annual sales and half of their profits.
This year's sales will compare with depressed sales in the previous three holiday seasons. Even so, "the numbers we're looking at are really good by any standard," said Robert E. Nourse, president and chief executive of the Bombay Company of Fort Worth. "This is a good one."
As many industry observers had predicted, the West Coast states that are still heavily yoked by a sluggish economy did not share in many of the gains reported yesterday.
 
Sears Is 'Quite Pleased'
 One exception, however, was Sears, which had some of its strongest sales jumps in the Southwest and California. Matthew A. Howard, a senior vice president of marketing for Sears, attributed the gains in part to the company's exclusive sponsorship of broadcasts of the movies "Ghostbusters" and "E.T." on the Spanish-language network Telemundo on Thursday and Friday nights. For the second year, Sears was also the sole sponsor of "E.T." on Thanksgiving night on CBS.
Although Mr. Howard would not disclose details about Sears's results from Friday and Saturday, he said they exceeded expectations of increases in the mid-single digits. "It's only two days, and the next few weeks will tell us how we do," he said. "But we are quite pleased. There was excellent traffic in the stores and in the malls." That included areas in the Northeast, he said.
Popular items varied from store to store and chain to chain, but most retailers roundly trumpeted the importance of value.
Mr. Gould of Younkers said his chain had increased the use of its "V.P." promotion, an abbreviation of "value priced." Displays typically show a photograph of the item, its price and three features. Mr. Gould said the tactic had proved so effective that the company had affixed such labels to 10 times as many goods this year as it had in years past.
"The customer is looking for four components: fashion, quality, value and service," he said. "You're dealing with very savvy customers."
 
'Strong' Sales at Dayton Hudson
 For the first time, the Dayton Hudson Corporation has expanded a value-oriented "Great Gift" promotion to its Mervyn's chain of stores. With prices that range in $5 increments up to $30, the store is selling gift-wrapped goods that the company says are particularly appealing to consumers this year. For example, a product that combines an A.M.-F.M. radio, clock and flashlight sells for $10.
Dayton Hudson, the nation's fourth-largest retailer, with discount and department stores in 33 states, did not disclose statistics on sales.
But Kenneth A. Macke, the chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: "We expected strong sales for the post-Thanksiving weekend, and our sales were strong. With the exception of California, our Target stores led our companies with double-digit comparable store increases."
Tactical Retail Solutions, a retail consulting firm, has estimated that discount chains like Target and Wal-Mart will see a 6 percent increase in sales, while specialty stores and department stores will reap smaller gains of 1 to 2 percent.
The survey by Telecheck, based in Houston, indicated that the biggest increase in spending on Friday came in the Midwest, up 10.2 percent from the comparable day a year ago. The rise was 6.3 percent in the Southeast, 5.4 percent in the Southwest, 3.5 percent in the Northeast, 2.5 percent in the Middle Atlantic region, and 2.2 percent in the West.
But New York sales were down 3.3 percent and New Jersey's fell 3.7 percent. Los Angeles showed a 3.1 percent decline, and Hawaii's sales fell 4.3 percent, the company said.
"Although one day doesn't make a season, the percentage increase in national sales indicates that this season's shopping should be better than last year's," said William Ford, Telecheck's senior economic adviser. "Retailers should do considerably better than the 1.8 percent increase recorded during the 1991 holiday season and probably will post a national increase of about 6 percent."

HEADLINE: Signals of the Clinton Recovery: Rebound Is Seen, but a Slow One

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
A number of business executives say the Clinton expansion may have arrived even before the President-elect moves into the White House. But they are quick to add that the pace of the economic rebound will continue to be far slower than in past recoveries and that too few jobs will be created to bring unemployment down quickly.
In interviews over the Thanksgiving weekend, business owners and executives said they were seeing signs of a recovery -- from more classified advertising to more business travel -- in their own businesses and communities. Taken together, the various indicators suggest that the American economy is at last turning a corner. 
 "It seems that this recovery is finally under way," said George N. Hatsopoulos, chief executive of the Thermo Electron Corporation, a maker of industrial instruments in Waltham, Mass. "I believe it's going to catch on this time."
 
Heartened by New Activity
 Business people say they are heartened by a surge in consumer confidence since the Presidential election, by last week's surprisingly strong economic reports and by the crowded stores on the first days of the holiday shopping season. A consensus appeared to be emerging that holiday sales were up 5 to 8 percent so far from a year earlier. [Page D1.]
That is not to say that most businesses are not still struggling; that gains -- particularly on the job front -- will be anything but slow, or that good times are imminent. Indeed, business people stress that competition will remain as brutal as at any time in memory.
"It's tougher to make money whether you're a cab driver or an entrepreneur," said Jerry Della Femina, the New York advertising executive who created the Joe Isuzu ads in the 1980's and who started a restaurant, a real estate company and an ad agency this year. "Everybody's coming off the memories of the 1980's, when people made fortunes by just showing up. Now that's past."
Although many Republicans are quick to point out that President Bush had long predicted this recovery, several executives said the election of Gov. Bill Clinton had done the most to raise their confidence in the economy. "A lot of this is psychological," Mr. Della Femina said. "Almost all of it, in fact. We talk ourselves into recessions. This is Clinton's chance to allow us to talk ourselves into a recovery."
 
 
A Jump in Sales
 In San Francisco, Ruth Owades, chief executive of Calyx & Corolla, a fresh flower catalogue company, reported a jump in sales immediately after the election. "We did more than twice as much business this year as we did last Thanksgiving Day," she said.
But business is also clearly responding to stronger sales and rebounding profits.
Economic growth more than doubled from the glacial 1.2 percent pace of the first nine months of the recovery, which most economists reckon began in the spring of 1991, to a moderate 2.8 percent in the last three quarters. Apart from the effect of Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, after-tax corporate profits are back to a record high.
One reason is that consumers, who account for roughly two-thirds of the gross domestic product, are making purchases again. Consumer spending rose at a strong 3.7 percent annual rate last summer and surged at an 8.4 percent annual rate in October.
Business confidence in the economy -- reflected in start-ups of businesses and in loan demand, as well as in surveys -- has been making a quiet comeback for months. At least some executives talk about adding employees, restocking inventories and spending money on equipment that would raise productivity.
Paul West, the proprietor of Paul West Heating Inc., a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning contractor in San Francisco, said business had been building since August and that he had hired two workers since then. "My telephone is ringing off the hook now," he said. "I've got too much work. There's some old customers I can't take care of."
He added: "If the phone keeps ringing after the first of the year, I'll know we are on to something. What we are seeing now could be seasonal. I've had false starts before."
In Cleveland, Sandra Pianalto, the chief operating officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said that bankers in the area were seeing more demand for loans in recent weeks. "Bankers around here seem to be a little more optimistic," she said.
 
Better Sales at Ford
 The Ford Motor Company has seen its car sales turn up. "Sales of cars to individuals were up 8 percent in August, 15 percent in September and 30 percent in October," said Joel Pitcoff, manager of research and analysis.
Ford has been increasing its production schedules. Its North American assembly plants have been running 94 percent of straight time, compared with 78 percent of straight time last year. Straight time means two eight-hour shifts, five days a week.
Housing has been a bright spot, too. The eagerness of first-time home buyers to put deeds in their pockets, and fears that mortgage rates are likely to go up, helped push sales of existing houses in October to their highest level in four years. And building permits for new single-family houses recently picked up as well.
"We really don't have a whole lot to complain about, " said Ginny Constable, a real estate agent at Coldwell Banker Horsley & Constable, in Harrisonburg, Va. "We had almost-record months for our company four months through October. Our inventory is really down now, and we're struggling to find people properties in the first-time-buyer range."
Business is spending more money to make money. Rodger Ballou, president of the travel services group of the American Express Company, said that business travel was up.
So is advertising. Heinz Prechter, chairman of ASC Inc., an automotive supplier and owner of several small newspapers southwest of Detroit, said the regional newspaper business "has been incredibly strong, reflecting local optimism." He added, "All the advertisers are coming back, and linage is up."
 
 
Spending for Investment
 Thanks to its drive to lift productivity and cut costs, businesses have been on a capital-spending spree. Outlays on computers, telephone systems and other high-technology equipment has climbed at an 8.5 percent rate after inflation in the last three quarters. In September and October, orders for capital equipment jumped 11 percent to a record high.
In Waltham, Mr. Hatsopoulos of Thermo Electron said business had been improving for months. The equipment division, which was losing money, is again profitable. "We are going into another round of planning for next year in early January," he said. "It looks as if we're going to revise our investment plans up."
Peter Wayne, a computer consultant and physician in Yonkers, decided that the recovery had arrived when he suddenly started having trouble reordering computer equipment and parts from his usual suppliers. "They didn't answer their '800' number," he said. "They were out of parts. They had to back-order. A few weeks ago, they were shipping orders the following day."
But for him, what really clinched the idea of a recovery was that two of the half-dozen suppliers he had called said that they were hiring more help to handle the flood of orders.
Mr. West, of the San Francisco heating company, said that in order to expand, "I need new trucks and to build up capital to cover the payroll until we get paid" for a job.
"I'm still trying to save as much as possible," he said. "We are on a very strict diet. We don't take anyone out for business dinners, for example."
For all these signs of strength, few executives or economists expect the economy to keep growing at the summer's perky 3.9 percent pace, much less the 5 or 6 percent pace typical of the early phase of previous recoveries. Most economists expect the growth rate to settle at 2.5 percent or so.
 
Exports Could Fade
 Among the forces that are restraining spending: Consumers are still nervous about their debt loads and their low saving rates. State and local governments are cutting budgets. And military contractors will be slimming down for years to come.
At the same time, exports, which have been one of the economy's sources of growth in the last year and a half, may fade unless the recessions in Europe and Japan ease before too long. Machine tool orders fell 24.9 percent in October as exports dropped by half.
The key to the recovery, virtually everyone agrees, is jobs.
"The public is only going to declare the recession over when there's sustained and convincing job growth," said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.
Although private companies have added just 300,000 jobs since last winter there are signs that the worst of the layoffs are behind and that companies are adding workers by the ones and twos.
The unemployment rate has edged down to 7.4 percent, from 7.8 percent. Initial unemployment claims have fallen in six of the last eight weeks and are now below 400,000, the dividing line between a labor market that is stagnating or contracting and one that is gradually expanding.
 
Hiring Plans Improve
 What is more, hiring plans continue to improve modestly. A survey released yesterday by Manpower Inc., a Minneapolis-based temporary-help company, shows that more companies are planning to add employees in the first quarter and fewer are anticipating staff cuts.
Still, despite the upbeat mood and the hopeful signs, business is not going to let President-elect Clinton off the hook. "Clinton promised to focus on the economy like a laser beam," said Ms. Owades of Calyx & Corolla. "That's what the country's looking for."

ECONOMIC WAR BEGINS ANEW
A little more than a year after Connecticut, New Jersey, New York State and New York City signed an agreement intended to end the luring of companies from one another, the interstate war for jobs is intensifying and the so-called nonaggression pact seems close to collapse. In recent months, New Jersey and Connecticut have sweetened the packages of financial aid they offer companies that relocate there, and New York State has been forced to increase sharply the amount it doles out to keep companies from leaving. This month, for instance, New York City and New York State had to offer $80 million worth of incentives to prevent the New York Mercantile Exchange from moving across the Hudson River to Jersey City.

SCIENTISTS URGE STRONG TB MEASURES
Wading into one of the most contentious issues in modern medicine, a panel of 34 scientists, ethicists and public health leaders is calling for broad new measures to stem the rampant spread of tuberculosis in New York City and around the nation. Two of the panel's recommendations are sure to ignite angry policy debates: that all tuberculosis patients should have to let people watch them take their medication once they leave a hospital and that new laws be passed requiring all patients to receive treatment until they are cured. A1.
 
O'CONNOR DENIES PRESSURING CLINTON
Denying published reports, John Cardinal O'Connor says that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York is not trying to sway the Clinton transition team from considering Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, with whom the Cardinal has often been at odds, as a potential Secretary of Education. The Cardinal says that he does not know of any effort by Catholics to block consideration of Mr. Fernandez, and, if it existed, that "the archdiocese would have no part of it." B3.
 
TROLLEY PLAN HITS ROADBLOCKS
A plan to have privately run trolleys shuttle riders along 42d Street is mired in a political deadlock, despite widespread support. The electric trolleys, seen as an environmentally sound way to reduce congestion along one of the New York City's showcase thoroughfares, has fallen victim to a larger battle between aides to Mayor David N. Dinkins and New York City Council leaders over who has the power to approve future transit franchises. B3.
 
MAKING MONEY BY SPECIALIZATION
Though his only business education was in the school of hard knocks, Seymour Rosenberg exemplifies one of the hottest trends in today's industrial sector: flexible manufacturing. His arcane specialty, as chairman of the New York Sewing Machine Company, is taking ordinary-looking sewing machines and refashioning them for specialty work. The idea is to tailor production exactly to a customer's needs, anticipate his emerging problems and be there as a continuing and necessary part of his business. Strictly Business, B2.

HEADLINE: Trying to Mend the Ties That Bind

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
For the last six months, Shaquesha O., her mother and her seven brothers and sisters have lived in a shelter in Brooklyn. Because of a computer error, the family's welfare checks were reduced to $12.10 every two weeks for over four months. Then Shaquesha, 13 years old, and her older sister were arrested and charged with larceny in a subway robbery.
That's when Dwight Melhado, a slight man who speaks with a Jamaican lilt, came into their lives. Carrying the slightly prim job title of "family preservationist," Mr. Melhado was assigned by a Family Court judge to work with Shaquesha and her family, arranging counseling for her and trying to solve the family's other problems, like getting the welfare checks straightened out. 
 Beyond the friendship that he offers to the struggling family in Brownsville in Brooklyn, Mr. Melhado is part of a small but growing program in New York City's Department of Juvenile Justice that many experts say represents the future of juvenile justice across the nation. Family preservationists, who are on call around the clock, are specially trained counselors who work intensively with a troubled family for up to eight weeks, helping to solve problems ranging from a lack of skills as parents to finding housing.
 
Started as Pilot Program
 Now in 30 states, family preservation programs are modeled on Homebuilders, developed 17 years ago in Washington State as an alternative to foster placement. Colorado, Alabama, Connecticut and New Jersey are among the first few states to use family preservation programs as part of their social-service system.
New York City's program was begun as a pilot effort in 1989. Currently in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan, it is to expand to Queens in January. So far, statistics seem to prove the case for the program. Of the 250 families that have gone through Family Ties, 70 percent of the children have averted placement with the State Division for Youth.
A follow-up study showed that a year later about 70 to 75 percent of those on probation were still at home after going through "intensive supervision." That means they spend more time with their probation officers and are offered more services than other juvenile probationers at less risk. What happens to these children two, three or more years later, only time and more studies will tell.
Next year, there will be four family preservationists for each New York City borough except Staten Island. Families enter the program with a judge's approval after children, like Shaquesha, are charged with crimes and the case enters Family Court. She and her family, like others in Family Ties, agreed to be interviewed only on the condition that their full names not be used.
The idea behind Family Ties is simple: with some professional intervention, children who are at high risk of being locked up because of their crimes can stay at home and be placed on probation. Detention costs the city $70,000 annually per child, compared with about $7,500 for Family Ties.
Moreover, a growing chorus of juvenile-justice experts say that confining adolescents to detention centers does little to rehabilitate them and to stem what is a growing wave of juvenile crime. Family Ties tries to help children by using resources in the community and to alter any underlying family dynamics that might contribute to future problems.
 
Avoiding the 'Treadmill'
 "Family Ties is a very good program," said Mark Soler, executive director of the Youth Law Center, a public-interest law center in San Francisco. "It's a landmark program. It's the first program in the U.S. to apply family preservation in a juvenile-justice program.
"Juvenile justice has been geared toward individual kids and behavior modification. It's not geared toward the family although the problem is in the family. This program can get kids out of the system instead of being on the treadmill they are on. There are more kids going into the juvenile-justice system and more kids being locked up, but juvenile crime is worse than ever."
Nationally, the number of boys between age 10 and 17 who were arrested for violent crimes rose 40 percent between 1987 and 1991, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's uniform crime report shows. For girls in the same age group, the rate rose 49 percent. Violent crimes were defined as homicide, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.
In New York City, the number of juvenile offenders who are in secure centers on an average day has grown 81 percent in the last two years -- to 148 in fiscal 1991 from 82 in fiscal 1989. Juvenile offenders are those accused of crimes so serious that they are to be tried in adult courts rather than Family Court. The number of juveniles tried in Family Court has risen to 12,700 in 1991 from 6,700 in 1986.
"We saw parents who did not have control over their kids; we saw parents who did not have parenting skills; we saw families overwhelmed by economic pressures," said Rose W. Washington, the city's Commissioner of Juvenile Justice. "I was really tired of the fact that I was seeing children who I said that if they had someone working with them, they wouldn't be there. I vowed we would focus on the family and prevent children from coming in."
 
Budget Constraints
 Although Family Ties has won generally good reviews from those within the juvenile-justice system, its size and therefore its impact have been limited by the constraints of a tight city budget. And the city has enough money to pay for only 7 of the 12 preservationists the program calls for currently. It expects to have the money next year to pay for all 16, including 4 for Queens.
There were some concerns early in the Family Ties program that after children had gone through the program, judges were pressured to recommend them for probation instead of placement to prove the effectiveness of Family Ties.
Kathyrn McDonald, the administrative judge for New York City Family Court, said that although Family Ties was limited in scope, "I think it's a splendid concept."
"This is the future," she said. "It's cheaper, the children learn more and it's safer. The child has learned to behave within the community. If you place a child in a synthetic environment and then release them back into the community, they may not be any better in the future."
In New York City, the Human Resources Administration last year shifted $12 million from its foster-care budget to pay for 240 caseworkers to act as family preservationists for up to two families at a time. In the next few weeks city officials are expected to assess the effectiveness of that program.
 
Setting Family Goals
 The preservationists spend a great deal of time just talking to families, two-thirds of whom are already known to the city's Child Welfare Administration for various reasons. They then set family goals, often enlisting the help of others, like extended-family members, school counselors and church members, to help the family to meet them. At the end of the intervention, they make a recommendation to the judge for probation or placement.
Mr. Melhado, who became a family preservationist in 1990, said he was still in touch with the families he has helped. And Shaquesha, a lively girl who enjoys reading, is convinced that Mr. Melhado is one of the best things that has ever happened to her. He has taught her, she said, that anger is not the most constructive way to deal with her problems and also how to make decisions and choose her friends more carefully.
Shaquesha contends that she and her sister did not participate in the subway robbery but were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. She acknowledged that she had been suspended from school many times for talking back to adults, but Mr. Melhado has got her to try talking respectfully to her teachers and guidance counselor at school.
"I've learned that if somebody tells me something that makes me feel bad, I can't jump to conclusions," she said.
 
Happy With Progress
 Mrs. O. said she initially resented the idea of a stranger intruding on the family, but is happy with Shaquesha's progress with Mr. Melhado in the last few weeks.
"At first I said I wasn't the one in trouble," she said. "I said why do we need someone coming in here? But she's more calm now."
Sometimes, parents need as much help as their child. Marysa Besse, the family preservationist working with Damien W. and his mother, observed that Ms. W. never set goals or punished her son. Damien, who is 14, was involved in a gang called Brooklyn's Most Wanted and had been charged with criminal trespassing and shoplifting. Mrs. W. complained that Damien never came home on time, but then acknowledged that she never set a curfew.
"She buys him a lot of expensive items," Ms. Besse said. "She threatens to discipline him, but never follows through."
Kathy Watson, the program coordinator for Family Ties in Manhattan, put it this way: "Kids don't exist outside families. Whenever a kid has a crisis, you can assume the family has a crisis."

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Fell 24.9% In October

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools declined 24.9 percent in October as the weak economies of the nation's trading partners cut exports in half, an industry group said today.
Compared with a year earlier, October tool orders dropped 7.8 percent, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology, which compiles the monthly report. 
 Orders for machine tools, which include metal cutting and metal forming instruments, are a barometer of industrial production and capital spending by factory owners.
"The drop-off in export orders, although disappointing, is not surprising given poor economic growth in our major export markets," said Albert Moore, the association's president.
Foreign machine tool orders will probably deteriorate further before recovering, Jean Sundrla, a private economist in Alexandria, Va., said. The higher dollar and recessions overseas are likely to hurt orders, she said.
She added, though, "We should see domestic demand increase as the economy improves, and turn things around over the next few months."
Monthly domestic orders declined 18.3 percent in October to $184.15 million, the industry group said. Monthly export orders plunged 54.4 percent to $22.95 million in October.
But year-to-date total orders were 2.3 percent ahead of 1991.

HEADLINE: Individuals Pushing Stocks Up

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Individual investors, their confidence reviving with the economy, are ardently buying stocks, propelling stock indexes, especially for smaller issues, to new highs.
These investors are forsaking cash and some high-yielding, high-risk bonds to pour money into stock mutual funds at a record rate. 
 All told in 1992, for the first time in 30 years, individual investors will be net buyers of stocks, whether directly or through mutual funds, said Steven G. Einhorn, chief strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. In recent years, their sales of individual stocks have more than outweighed their purchases of mutual funds.
With individuals holding only about 22 percent of their financial assets in stocks, near a record low, Mr. Einhorn said, low yields on other investments and an accelerating economic recovery could bring about a fundamental shift. "We are in the early stages of a re-entry by individuals into the stock market that will last several years," he said.
Brokerage firms and mutual funds report a strong revival of interest.
 
One Fund Up 13% in Month
 "We've picked up a lot in equities just in the last few days," Diane M. Coffey, director of corporate communications for the Dreyfus Corporation mutual fund group, said last week. The New Leaders Fund, which buys smaller stocks, has grown 13.5 percent, to $218 million, in just one month, she said.
The election of a new President has apparently amplified the effects of an improving economy. A monthly index of investor sentiment that Fidelity Investments compiles from University of Michigan consumer surveys rose from 75.7 in October to a preliminary 88.9 in November, the sharpest gain and highest reading since the Allied success in the Persian Gulf war in early 1991.
Individual investors still have $3.5 trillion, or 35 percent of their financial assets, in money market funds and certificates of deposits, Mr. Einhorn said. Yields have fallen to virtually nothing, after inflation, and while stocks are more volatile in the short run, a well-diversified portfolio tends to outperform other common investments by several percentage points a year over the longer run.
 
One Investor's Story
 Dan Tooker, a New York City teacher who had invested in money market funds, bond funds and apartments, began planning to redeploy his sliver of that $3.5 trillion on Friday.
First the real estate crash persuaded him to invest no more in apartments. Then he watched money market rates shrivel. On Friday, as crowds filled New York's stores, he gave up shopping and went to the Dreyfus office in the lobby of what everyone still calls the Pan Am Building. There he flipped through pamphlets for mutual funds that invest in stocks, initially pleased but then increasingly distressed by the variety.
Enough investors are following through to virtually guarantee that 1992 will be a record year for stock funds. Net investments in equity funds, subtracting redemptions from sales, topped $5 billion in October, up from $4.4 billion in September, according to the Investment Company Institute's latest report.
With $58.8 billion of net cash inflows for the first 10 months of the year, and reports of a strong November, only huge, last-minute withdrawals could leave 1992 gains below the record $38.4 billion set last year.
 
Bond Funds Gain Less
 The popularity of stock funds comes as some investors are calling off their quest for high income from bonds. Bond funds, which have steadily attracted about $8 billion in net cash flow a month, gained only $2 billion in October. Junk bond funds and global income bond funds -- some of the highest yielding but riskiest categories -- suffered net cash withdrawals.
William J. Cooney, who dispenses advice at Dreyfus, says savvy investors who piled into bond funds early this year were seeking to reduce their risks in case prices suddenly plummeted as the economy picked up.
"Prices are the highest we've seen in a long time," he said. "There are only two other places you can invest: money markets or stocks."
Individual investors have already helped push several stock indexes to record highs. The Nasdaq composite index, primarily of smaller stocks, reached its third straight record Friday, closing at 649.49, up more than 15 percent over the last three months.
 
Institutional Buying Seen
 Some market analysts cite the gains among larger stocks within this index as evidence of institutional buying, but the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which includes many more larger stocks, has gained only 4 percent in the same period. It also set a record of 430.16 on Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which includes only large stocks, has risen less than 1 percent since late August, to 3,282.20, still below its high of 3,413.21 set on June 1.
Individuals tend to favor smaller stocks, which are often unable to absorb the huge amounts of money that pension funds and other large institutions move around.
"We're seeing a tremendous amount of activity in the secondaries," said Robert Dineen, the national sales manager for Merrill Lynch's western region. "Three months ago nobody wanted to go near them."
Rather than a sudden stampede, Mr. Dineen has seen investors' confidence building on what had already been a healthy year for purchases of stocks. "There's a sense of optimism we haven't seen in a while," he said.
And what of Mr. Tooker, puzzling over his choices among Dreyfus funds? He decided to take home a clutch of pamphlets, then make his selection.
"They've got 97 things in there," he said, exaggerating only somewhat.

HEADLINE: Neediest Fund Helps Victims of AIDS

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Ever since Simon Rutledge learned that he was infected with the virus that causes AIDS, he has worried that his illness would also drag down his two children, as if the mistakes he had made -- dropping out of school and stealing to support a heroin habit -- would linger after his death.
His children, Alicia and Simon Jr., did not get the virus, H.I.V., from him or their mother, who died of AIDS three years ago. But every day they saw the disease eating away at their parents. The children became withdrawn and resentful, apparently afraid of getting close to people who would soon be taken away from them. 
 In recent months, though, Alicia, 10 years old, and Simon Jr., 6, have opened up to their father because of help from the Children's Aid Society, one of seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"Things have turned around completely," Mr. Rutledge, 42, said the other day, referring to a home-care worker provided by the society. "Before we had a lot of tension. We were losing each other. Now we have a much better rapport with each other."
Mr. Rutledge said he had spent hours and hours talking to the children about his life, trying to break through the barriers they had erected during the years their mother was dying. He also said his health has improved because he was taking AZT, a drug that slows the onset of AIDS symptoms.
During last year's Neediest Cases campaign, Mr. Rutledge described the rift his illness caused in his family in an article in The New York Times. He said at the time that with the help of the Children's Aid Society, he was taking the first steps toward re-establishing his relationship with his children. Alicia was beginning to do better in school and Simon Jr. was starting to accept his mother's death.
Since then, the Children's Aid Society has stood by the Rutledge family, insuring that the bond Mr. Rutledge was trying to build did not crumble. The society has also paid for therapy, food and medicine.
Mr. Rutledge's story underscores how the charities assisted by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund not only rescue the ailing in times of crisis, but also continue to provide support afterward.
The fund began its 81st campaign yesterday at a time when charities across New York City are confronting growing responsibilities. They must help New Yorkers like Mr. Rutledge in addition to people who are for the first time in their lives facing homelessness, disease and unemployment.
The Neediest Cases was born at the beginning of the century when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times, decided that his readers would be eager to improve their city if only they knew about the misery around them. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28. The Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all contributions are given directly to the seven charities.
The change in the Rutledge family is most apparent in Alicia. She delights in going to school, in helping to cook dinner, in playing with her brother, and, most importantly, in spending time with her father.
"When he is sick, I take care of him and I bring him his medicine," she said. "Sometimes, when he goes to sleep, I worry that he won't wake up, so I go in and check on him every night."
Mr. Rutledge, who is now working odd jobs around his Tremont neighborhood in the Bronx, has been bolstered by children's happiness.
"I haven't had too much of a good life, using drugs and all," Mr. Rutledge said. "I'm hoping that my children will get a good education and try to have the things that I didn't have. I also talk to them about being close to one another. They have to stay close. They have to understand that one of these days, Daddy's not going to be there."
 
HOW TO AID FUND

Baffled by Vector Analysis? Here's Help in 3 Volumes

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Care to know who runs the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland or, for that matter, what the bank really does? Perhaps you would like to discover what a martingale is (hint: not a bird). Or maybe you just want to learn, without enrolling in night school, how the gold standard worked in the 19th century.
The Macmillan Press Ltd. of London is betting $2 million and four years' effort that a lot of people will plunk down $595 to find out. They have crammed the answers -- and just about everything else anyone might want to know about matters financial -- in the three-volume, 2,621-page New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance, introduced last week by the Stockton Press, Macmillan's publishing arm in New York. 
 Is there, in fact, a market for this nifty, if not thrifty, reference work? It certainly comes with an imposing imprimatur. Two of the editors, Peter Newman, formerly of Johns Hopkins University, and Murray Milgate of the University of Bradford in England, are academic heavyweights.
The third, John Eatwell of Trinity College of Cambridge, is a political mover and shaker as well as a distinguished scholar. He served as the principal economic adviser to Britain's Labor Party until the defeat of Neil Kinnock and recently became a Labor member of the House of Lords.
Moreover, a sampling of the 803 contributors who wrote the 1,008 encyclopedia-style essays reads like a roll-call of past and future Nobel laureates: Franco Modigliani on bond markets, William Baumol on economies of scale, Jacob Frenkel on fiscal policy, Steven Ross on arbitrage, Thomas Sargent on rational expectations, Joe Stiglitz on the principal-agent problem, James Tobin on money.
Nor have the editors neglected the stars of business economics. Among the luminaries in print: Alan Walters of AIG Trading, Stephen Axilrod of Nikko International, Helmut Kaiser of Deutsche Bank, Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski of First Boston International and Albert Wojnilower of First Boston Asset Management.
 
Aimed at a Broad Audience
 Some of the essays may prove very rough going for folks who never mastered college math. But Mr. Newman expects that most of the entries will be accessible to a broad audience -- "everyone from central bankers to academics to businessmen" -- because most are written in plain, jargon-resistant English.
Actually, Macmillan's investment was based on more than just a guess that sufficient numbers of readers would shell out big money for big names and big, handsome reference volumes. Macmillan has reportedly done very well as the publisher of the equally technical 20-volume New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which sells for $2,300. And The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance itself has a long and glorious lineage dating to 1894.
Macmillan orginally published it as the Dictionary of Political Economy under the guidance of R. H. Inglis Palgrave, the legendary editor of The Economist magazine. It was updated a number of times through the 1920's. The idea of a comprehensive survey of economics was resurrected in 1987 as a four-volume work edited by Messrs. Eatwell, Newman and Milgate.
More than 5,000 copies of this New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics have been sold worldwide at $750 a set. Soon after publication, Macmillan went back to the three editors in search of a companion work that would appeal to a broader audience.
 
An Editorial Compromise
 "They wanted a dictionary of business," said Mr. Newman, who like his fellow editors had little taste for assembling a nuts-and-bolts guide to the corporate world. The subject of money and finance, offering wiggle room for theoretical essays as well as practical ones, was the compromise -- or, as Mr. Newman put it, "an intersection of interests."
The primary appeal of the dictionary will no doubt be the fact-packed essays on traditional and relatively timeless topics ranging from securitization to futures trading to the "capital asset pricing model." But Mr. Newman notes that in contrast to the 1987 Dictionary of Economics, some topics are as current as the savings and loan crisis and the breakup of the Soviet Union.
This is likely to add to the value of the work. The essay on German monetary unification, for example, is a remarkably lucid and compact piece of analysis that could save the reader a tedious afternoon of research.
But the decision to cover unfolding events does carry some risks: the three otherwise excellent entries on the European monetary system end the story in 1991, and thus make no mention of the system's virtual collapse this summer.
 
The Odd Tidbit
 While the dictionary is first and foremost a capitalist's tool, it is also a browser's delight. Trolling through the first volume (A-E), one discovers that the Emperor Caligula auctioned his furniture to pay his debts; that Japanese chief executives are, on average, seven years older than their American counterparts; that 32 of the necessary 34 state legislatures have called for a convention to approve a balanced-budget amendment to the United States Constitution.
And if such arcana do not clinch the sale, the editors hope a few truly daffy entries will. Where else, asks Mr. Newman, are you likely to read that "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" by L. Frank Baum is an elaborate parable about the bimetallic currency controversy of the 1890's, with Grover Cleveland cast as the Wicked Witch of the East and William Jennings Bryan as the Cowardly Lion? (In the book, unlike the movie, Dorothy wears silver slippers as she follows the Yellow Brick Road.)
And where else are you likely to discover that the outcome of the Super Bowl predicts changes in prices in foreign stock markets as well as domestic ones, but is utterly useless in forecasting bond prices?
Oh, yes: back to those martingales. A martingale is a betting strategy in which the bettor tries to come out ahead by doubling the sum lost. But according to the essayist, Alan F. Karr of Johns Hopkins, economists have appropriated the term to mean "a mathematical model of a stochastic process that is incrementally noise." Aren't you glad you asked?

HEADLINE: America's Great S.& L. Land Sale

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Government has embarked on one of the biggest land sales in recent history. At a time when real estate is still in the doldrums, the Government is selling some 2,300 square miles of land -- an amount twice the size of Rhode Island.
From land suitable only for cattle grazing to vast tracts outside fast-growing cities, the land comes from the portfolios of failed savings and loans taken over by the Government. It is the wreckage of the real estate excesses of the 1980's and, for the Government, signifies even more: that its savings and loan cleanup effort is nearing an end. 
 For the last three years, the Government has been selling office buildings, shopping centers, mortgages and homes from failed savings and loans. Now, with some $144 billion of these assets sold, the Government is turning to the bottom of its real estate barrel and selling raw land, some of the toughest real estate to sell.
 
Opening 'the Faucet'
 "We've been trickling land into the market," said Lamar C. Kelly Jr., senior vice president for asset sales at the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency charged with the savings and loan cleanup. "Now we're going to open the faucet. Some of the land is real pretty. But, there's a lot of other parcels where the highest and best use is just to hold the earth together."
The sale of the land, valued on the Government's books at $17.5 billion, will put only a slight dent in the price of the savings and loan bailout, which has already topped $100 billion and is rising. But it will rid the Government of assets that are hard to value, costly to maintain and tricky to market.
It is hard to turn dirt in the ground into cash in the pocket. With the economy still slumping, it may be years before there is enough demand to warrant the construction of new offices or homes -- which is how developers make money when they buy raw land. In the interim, owners of land, whether it is the Government or private buyers, face bills for taxes, insurance and maintenance that each year can amount to about 10 percent of the parcel's market value.
"Land eats at your table three times a day, in property taxes, insurance expenses, and it produces no income," said Scott Shay, a managing director at Ranieri Wilson & Company, an investment firm that has bought Resolution Trust assets. "Raw land is the riskiest part of real estate. With so many empty buildings in this country, who wants to buy raw land and build more?"
 
Several Tactics Planned
 With a Congressional mandate to sell all assets as soon as possible, without waiting for real estate prices to bounce back, the agency is experimenting with a variety of selling strategies and will begin in earnest this December. It will auction some of the land. It will package portions into big tracts and sell them to sophisticated investors. It will sell small lots to individual developers. It will provide mortgages to help buyers finance the purchase.
Most important, it plans to discount the properties greatly at a time when most other owners of land, typically banks, insurance companies and real estate concerns, are sitting on their portfolios, waiting for better times.
"We're going to use every sales mechanism known to man," Mr. Kelly said. "We're willing to price it so low that we can dispose of this land, cut our carrying costs and realize whatever value there is. We're willing to recognize the true value of this land, which we estimate is around 30 percent of book value. And there's not many sellers out there willing to take a 70 percent loss."
Unlike office buildings or shopping malls, raw land lacks "cash flow," in business parlance, because it consumes cash instead of generating it. As a result, it cannot be securitized by large Wall Street firms, which have made a lucrative business of buying packages of troubled real estate assets and turning them into marketable securities.
 
Wall Street Not Interested
 Nearly 90 percent of Resolution Trust's real estate assets have been securitized, and this financial maneuver has turned some of Wall Street's biggest names, like Goldman, Sachs & Company and the GE Capital Corporation, into the agency's biggest customers.
But, these deep-pocket customers are not expected to buy land. "You can't securitize something without any cash flow and without any known value, " said Andrew Stone, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities. "The buyers of R.T.C. real estate assets have largely been institutional bond players, and bond players aren't interested in raw land because you can't securitize it."
Moreover, there is skepticism over the desirability of the land being sold. By Resolution Trust's own admission, it is a strange lot: Everything from vast patches of desert land in the Southwest that the agency has dubbed "rock farms" to desirable lots in the middle of fast-growing Boca Raton, Fla., or scenic La Jolla, Calif.
"Their portfolio ranges from some parcels that are enticing, to others that are completely useless," Mr. Stone at Daiwa Securities said. "And that makes it hard to value. How can you figure out what an empty parcel of Arizona desert is worth? Is it 5 cents on the dollar or 10?"
The biggest single asset on the block is the Banning-Lewis Ranch, 35 square miles of unimproved land that has been annexed to the city of Colorado Springs. This parcel, which stretches 14 miles from north to south and is adjacent to the city's municipal airport, has spectacular views of Pike's Peak and is one of the last remaining big parcels of developable land in the Rocky Mountain region.
 
White Elephant Ranch
 Bought in the land boom of the 1980's by a Colorado Springs developer, the Banning-Lewis Ranch was to become a huge residential planned community. But the developer and savings and loan went through $235 million in loans and direct investments before the Colorado economy soured and demand for new houses vanished. When the developer defaulted and the savings and loan failed, the ranch reverted to Resolution Trust.
Now the ranch is a white elephant. Some developers estimate that it will take more than $100 million to develop, with an uncertain market for the houses, shopping centers and office buildings that could be put on it. "You're going to have to put a ton of dough into that property," said Jeffrey Gault, president of the Solus Property Company in Los Angeles, a leading developer. "And you have to ask whether there's the demand for that kind of development in Colorado in 1992."
As a result, the best offer so far for the Banning-Lewis ranch is $24 million -- but it is still tentative and no contract has been signed.
Some of the land in Resolution Trust's portfolio has environmental problems, like a parcel in Northern California that is home to a rare butterfly that lives for only 45 days. Developers will have to wait 10 months to determine whether the butterfly will return this year.
Or there is the uncertainty of the unknown. For instance, will toxic contaminants be found on land the Government has for sale? Or will environmentalists oppose development there? And there are political questions: Will a new local government change the existing zoning on a given parcel?
"Land is the highest form of speculative asset that we have to offer," Mr. Kelly said. "And so far we've been too conservative and it hasn't worked, so we are going to become a lot more liberal."
 
Joint Venture Fund
 One of Resolution Trust's most innovative approaches is a new $2 billion fund called the Land Fund. This is a joint venture between the Government and private investors in which the private investors will be the general partners and Resolution Trust a passive limited partner entitled to a share of any future profits. The private investor group would put up an equity investment of $100 million to $200 million and the Government puts in the land. It is similar, in structure, to many real estate partnerships.
Louis Dubin, the manager of the Land Fund at Resolution Trust, says that investors in the fund can expect a return in the range of 25 to 30 percent a year as the land is developed -- if all goes well. So far, Mr. Dubin said that more than 900 investors had called for information. "There's not a major land development company that hasn't called," he said.
But it remains to be seen whether these calls will translate into offers. "Sure, a lot of people are looking at it," Mr. Gault at Solus Property said. "But someone still has to write a check for $100 million, and that's a lot of money."
 
Avoiding Problem Parcels
 David Porter, head of corporate finance at LaSalle Partners, a real estate firm advising Resolution Trust on the fund, said the Government was screening assets to keep out problem parcels and would allow investors in the fund to "put back" any assets to Resolution Trust that later develop serious problems.
"For the Resolution Trust, this is not a gamble," Mr. Porter said. "After all, they've got the assets already. And for the investor, they are getting the assets at a low price. For them, it's like buying an option way out of the money on future development values."
For investors, the rewards could be as great as the risks, real estate developers say. "The con side for an investor is that this is all speculative," Mr. Gault said. "But the pro side is that you can buy this land really cheap and if the economy rebounds under a Clinton Administration, you could be hitting a home run out of the ball park."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Some Performers In Japan's Slump

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THE once mighty Japanese electronics companies have been in such a bad slump lately that one securities analyst gave a speech here last week questioning whether the industry will become the "Rust Bowl of the 90's."
Big electronics companies have been reporting huge profit drops or even losses and many have announced plans for a gradual trimming of thousands of people from their work forces. 
 But analysts say that if investors look to companies less well known than Sony, Hitachi and other giants, they will find some that seem to be defying the hard times and are worthwhile investments.
Several analysts point to Kyushu Matsushita, which is half owned by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the giant consumer electronics company known for its Panasonic brand.
Kyushu Matsushita has experienced vibrant demand for its cordless phones and for a combination telephone-fax machine. When the company announced its earnings for the first fiscal half recently, it revised its forecast for the year upward and raised its dividend. Many big companies are revising forecasts downward and cutting dividends.
"I don't know anyone else that raised their dividend," said Steven W. Myers, electronics analyst for Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. Since announcing the first-half results, the company's stock has risen more than 20 percent, he said. And some analysts think the stock, which closed Friday at 2,380 yen, a little over $19, can rise some more.
Chuck Goto of S. G. Warburg likes Shinko Elecric Industries, a Fujitsu affiliate that is a Japanese play on the success of the Intel Corporation, the American company that makes the microprocessor chips used in most personal computers.
Shinko makes leadframes, which are devices that connect a computer chip to a circuit board and help dissipate heat from the chip. It designed a special advanced unit that Intel uses with its 386 microprocessor.
The stock, which was traded at 2,200 yen in March, peaked at 3,460 in July but has dropped, closing Friday at 2,840 yen. That decline is on fears that Intel will not use the Shinko technology with its newer 486 chip, which is supplanting the 386 as Intel's best seller, Mr. Goto said.
But he said those fears were unfounded and the stock should rise. "I figure it can go back to the previous peak anyway when people realize that growth will come back," he said. Shinko Electric Industries, he cautioned, is not to be confused with the Shinko Electric Company, a different company, which makes heavy electrical machinery.
The biggest successes of the year are the two video game companies, Nintendo and Sega Enterprises. Nintendo's profits for this fiscal year are expected to exceed those of Matsushita, which is the world's largest consumer electronics company. Sega, which has emerged as a strong competitor to Nintendo in the last year or so, is growing at a breakneck rate despite the recession. Both stocks are well below their yearly highs, and some analysts say they are worth buying.
Most analysts still do not recommend investing in the largest computer and consumer electronics companies. The combination of weak demand in consumer electronics, the lack of new hit products and restructuring of the computer industry will continue to depress earnings for another year if not longer, they said. The only bright spot is that demand for computer memory chips, which these companies also make, appears to be picking up.
But for investors who prefer a big company, Michael Jeremy of Baring Securities thinks the safest stock is Toshiba, which does not have exposure to the ailing mainframe computer business. Toshiba also seems active in preparing for the future of computing, having formed a venture with Apple to make portable video computers and with I.B.M. to make flat computer screens.
Toshiba also has a business in heavy electrical equipment and has received some big contracts for nuclear power plant equipment. "This gives them a little bit more stability than some of the consumer electricals," Mr. Jeremy said. Toshiba's stock has been trading in a narrow range recently while many others have been falling.
Takatoshi Yamamoto, electronics analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo, rates the big industrial electronics companies as "holds," but agrees that Toshiba is the best of the group, which also includes Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC and Mitsubishi Electric. Among consumer electronic companies, he thinks Matsushita might be worth a gamble because its stock price has dropped to the company's book value.
In the poor business climate, Mr. Yamamoto recommends stocks of companies that are "global winners" in their business and can be expected to prosper when good times return. He said Citizen Watch had stable earnings from watches and is expanding into personal computer manufacturing. Another winner, he said, is Canon, which is a leader in printers and color copiers.

HEADLINE: Reviewing the NC-17 Film Rating: Clear Guide or an X by a New Name?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
The NC-17 rating, a rarity since being created two years ago to replace the X rating, has been applied to five films in the last four months, raising questions about the criteria for applying it and its usefulness as a consumer guide to a film's content.
The most visible recipient of the rating is "Damage," a tale of sexual obsession directed by Louis Malle and starring Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche, which is to open on Dec. 23. 
 New Line Cinema, the distributor of the film, appealed to the Rating Appeals Board of the Motion Picture Association of America in New York City this month, but failed to muster the two-thirds vote needed to overturn the decision. New Line's president, Michael Lynne, says his company is now conferring with Mr. Malle to see whether the director will agree to make cuts in the film to qualify for an R rating.
Four other films have also received NC-17's, although two of those ratings were later changed to R. Those changed are "The Lover," based on the Marguerite Duras novel about a 15-year-old girl's affair with an older man, and "Body of Evidence," a courtroom drama that includes sexual scenes between two of its stars, Willem Dafoe and Madonna. Abel Ferrara's "Bad Lieutenant," a gritty morality tale starring Harvey Keitel, which opened in New York on Nov. 20, and "The Wide Sargasso Sea," based on the novel by Jean Rhys, still have their original NC-17 ratings.
Mr. Ferrara and Aries Film Releasing declined to contest the rating for "Bad Lieutenant." Likewise, Fine Line Features, the art-film division of New Line Cinema, has accepted the rating for "Wide Sargasso Sea," which includes male frontal nudity. The film is to open in April.
MGM appealed the NC-17 rating for "The Lover" and won the change to an R rating without making cuts, so it was released as an R. The company is also distributing "Body of Evidence," but decided to forego an appeal and make the necessary cuts to change the rating to an R. The film, which is to open in mid-December, is destined for a wider audience than "The Lover," and it was crucial to the studio that it be acceptable to exhibitors throughout the country.
The varied responses of the producers and distributors affected by the rating suggest the complexity and the ambiguity surrounding NC-17. The rating, which means that no one under 17 may be admitted, was created to allow film makers to turn out films for an adult audience without suffering the stigma of the X rating, which had become a synonym for pornography. Instead, some film makers and distributors say, the stigma has remained and the dividing line between an R and an NC-17 remains unclear. An R rating, for "restricted," means that children under 17 are admitted only when accompanied by an adult.
"There has to be a rating that says this is a mature film, or sophisticated film, and perhaps not for children, but certainly you shouldn't go in and expect to see an overtly sexual or an overtly violent movie: you will see thought-provoking cinema," said Paul Cohen, the president of Aries Film Releasing.
The Motion Picture Association's guidebook on the rating system states that in judging any film, the rating association considers "theme, violence, language, nudity, sensuality, drug abuse and other elements."
Jack Valenti, the chairman of the Motion Picture Association, reiterated his oft-stated position that the NC-17 rating does not make any qualitative judgment about a film or imply that it is pornographic. "This rating means what it has always meant," he said. "It says, This is a movie that is off-limits for children.
"I think most directors know when they are pushing the envelope back."
The economic consequences of an NC-17 rating can be severe. Many theaters refuse to show an NC-17 film, and many newspapers and radio and television stations will not carry advertising for one. Blockbuster Video, Kmart and Walmart, which account for more than half of the video sales in the United States, will not handle NC-17 titles.
Although studios are theoretically free to release an NC-17 film, the industry rule of thumb is that it would be restricted to about 300 theaters across the country and would probably not turn a profit with a budget of more than $3 million. For that reason, the major studios, which count on their bigger-budget films playing in a thousand or more theaters, have invariably chosen to cut films rather than face the dread rating. The only NC-17 film released by a major studio, Universal, is "Henry and June," the first film to be given the rating. It was shown in only 307 theaters and grossed a disappointing $11.6 million.
 
Of 'Baser Instincts'
 New Line had wanted a wide release on "Damage," which is based on Josephine Hart's novel about sexual obsession, but the rating has thrown a wrench in the works. "We did not expect an NC-17," Mr. Lynne said, pointing out that Mr. Malle had never received an X or NC-17 rating.
"Louis Malle does not make films that are pornography, or that pander to baser instincts," said Mr. Lynne.
His reference to "baser instincts" might have been a Freudian slip. Critics of the rating system have long argued that violence is treated more leniently than sex, and that the major studios do not suffer the same scrutiny as smaller independent companies.
"Basic Instinct," an R-rated erotic thriller that could be described as "Damage" plus ice picks and lesbianism, has become Exhibit A in this argument.
Kathie Berlin, the senior vice president for production and marketing at MGM, argued her appeal for "The Lover" with the film's director, a child psychologist and a letter of support from the editor of Seventeen magazine in hand. She also played the "Basic Instinct" card.
"I talked about 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Basic Instinct,' which showed violent lovemaking and lesbianism, and most of the lovemaking is Michael Douglas throwing someone over the back of a chair," Ms. Berlin said.
Ms. Berlin said she was told by the chairman of the ratings board, Richard D. Heffner, "Well, we made a mistake on 'Basic Instinct,' and we can't make this mistake again."
In fact, the producers of "Basic Instinct" submitted the film, or segments of it, for more than a dozen preliminary screenings before the ratings board, each time with additional cuts, to achieve the R rating. (Some gamesmanship is undoubtedly involved, since a film that reaps pre release publicity as a sizzling NC-17 and then trims down to an R gets the best of both worlds.)
 
How Ratings Are Given
 The board that applies ratings, the Classification and Rating Administration, is composed of 10 members and a director appointed by Mr. Valenti. Mr. Heffner has served for 14 years. He and Mr. Valenti appoint the raters to terms of one to several years. The only qualification demanded of the raters is that they be parents. Their names are not made public.
Films are screened before the rating administration, and, by a majority vote, a rating of G (General audiences; all ages admitted), PG (Parental guidance suggested), PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned; some material may be inappropriate for pre-teen-agers), R or NC-17 is applied. Some film makers choose to submit a film for an unofficial screening, receive an unofficial rating and proceed to make changes before submitting the film officially.
The ratings board does not give specific reasons when a film has been judged NC-17 rather than R. Sometimes it is clear that specific scenes of violence or sex are causing the problem. Often, however, film makers are told that the NC-17 is a result of the cumulative effect of scenes, none of them enough to trigger an NC-17 on their own.
"They said 'Ms. 45' had the mood of an X, which sounds like a Duke Ellington composition to me," said Mr. Ferrara, referring to a female-revenge film he directed. "I said, 'I can't edit a mood: tell me which scenes to cut.' " Mr. Lynne said: "You don't get enough information in the process to know why the rating has been decided on."
The maker of a film that receives an NC-17 has two choices: cut or alter the objectionable scenes, or appeal the decision before the Rating Appeals Board in New York City, a 21-member body of representatives from the film industry.
In an appeal, the film is screened for the board. Then the director of the rating board makes his case for the original rating, after which the film maker and supporting witnesses argue their case. A quorum of 11 members is required to hand down a decision, and it takes a two-thirds vote to overturn a ruling by the rating board.
Mr. Cohen, of Aries, said he hoped "Bad Lieutenant," which opened strongly in New York, would focus attention on the problems inherent in the NC-17 rating.
"By labeling a film NC-17, you're associating it with pornography and ultraviolent films," he said. " 'Bad Lieutenant' may put a spotlight on that problem, and help the ratings board achieve a more accurate and articulate representation of the films they rule on, which I believe in their hearts they want to do."
 
Not for Children
 Mr. Cohen agreed that the film, which includes a graphic rape scene, masturbation, profanity and nudity, is not for children.
Ira Deutchman, the president of Fine Line Features, says he is willing to give NC-17 a chance.
"Given the difficulty of trying to be everything to a population as diverse as America's, it's a lot to ask of the M.P.A.A. to be much better than they are," Mr. Deutchman said. "They are making an honest attempt to be representative of the society, and I don't see why we can't accept that there is certain material that is suitable for adults and not for children."

HEADLINE: How They Drove Three-Card Monte Out of the Carnival Circuit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a strategy consultant and adjunct professor of economics, I found your Nov. 11 article on three-card monte too pessimistic. 
 The often-advanced claim that three-card monte is a harmless game of skill between the dealer's dexterity and the bettor's powers of observation is usually a smokescreen. An honest dealer cannot object to the first five strategies suggested below, while a cheat will balk because each gets in the way of making a fast buck.
One can cheat at three-card monte by working four or more cards as three and concealing the target card in the palm or often up a sleeve.
Better known strategies to end the problem include the following:
(1) Publicize how to beat the game. First, insist the dealer keep both hands on the table after laying out the cards, or the deal doesn't count. Second, decide on the card you think is the target card, but don't touch or name it. Third, declare that the two other cards are not it and quickly turn both of them over at the same time. If the dealer hid the target card, he dare not turn over the third card, and you win. There are risks of harm from shills or the dealer, but undercover police could then move in and arrest the dealer and more aggressive shills on obvious charges.
(2) Introduce competition with honest games. One might, for example, provide the popular sites with all-weather three-card monte machines.
(3) License the dealers at very high fees and bar unlicensed dealers.
(4) Sell daily rights to locations for very high fees.
(5) Heavily tax each play.
(6) Arrest and heavily fine anyone playing three-card monte.
The police long ago found the above were effective against dishonest dealers at carnivals, fairs and exhibitions. That's why three-card monte and the shell game have been passe for 30 or 40 years. A new generation may have to pay a premium to learn from experience to respect an accomplished prestidigitator's skills as the price of failing to study now-obscure branches of entertainment history and art. That brings us to the last strategy. Redefine the situation as an educational experience, and let the gullible learn how fast they can be fleeced.
