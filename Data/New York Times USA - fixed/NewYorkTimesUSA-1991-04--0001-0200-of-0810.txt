HEADLINE: Slovak Separatists Proud of Nazi Past

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I must quarrel with your March 19 report on Slovak separatism as inadequate to explain the hostility to be found in Slovak Bratislava toward Czech Prague. Although you cite a plethora of ethnographic figures to demonstrate the complicated admixture of the populations, you entirely neglect the central fact of the Slovak separatist movement. 
 You fail to mention the brief period of independent statehood presided over by the Rev. Josef Tiso under the domination of Hitler, following his post-Munich invasion of Czechoslovakia on March 14, 1939. You ignore Slovakia's wartime collaboration with Hitler. After liberation by the Red Army, wartime collaborators were tried and executed.
Under the tenure of Gustav Husak, a Slovak Communist, as Prime Minister at Prague from 1968, the province received an influx of developmental capital, creating polluting works for making steel, aluminum and chemicals, which, along with a gigantic munitions works, became unprofitable at the end of the cold war. Slovak unemployment rose in the lagging economy, and the separatists blamed the central government.
Last July, the separatists memorialized Father Tiso, placing a plaque in a church of a small mining town, which was blessed by the Roman Catholic bishop of Nitra. The outcry caused the Federal Parliament to set up an investigating commission to examine the history of the separatists, after which the town council ordered the plaque destroyed. Recently, President Vaclav Havel encountered hostility and derision in Bratislava on his investigative trip.
On my sixth visit in six years to Czechoslovakia last November, I obtained several significant interviews on this plaguing subject.
I found that the Slovak separatist leaders are young and vigorous, and wear blinders in pressing their own agenda aggressively. They have never presented an economic program for independence. They are deaf and blind to Prague's concession in creating a federated state of equal Czech and Slovak people, a forerunner of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan for the Soviet Union's minority problems. They represent a small rightist minority among their people, who harbor fervor for their historic traditions.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Volatile Trading In Collectible Cars

BYLINE: By John Holusha

 BODY:
TWO years ago the prices of older exotic European cars like Ferrari, Aston Martin and Jaguar were skyrocketing, often doubling in a few months. Then early last year, the bottom dropped out of the market. Cars went unsold at auctions or were bid on only by owners trying to prop up the market.
"The Ferrari market is shattered," said Ed Jurist, owner of the Vintage Car Store in Nyack, N.Y., and a longtime trader of old, rare cars. "A 1972 Daytona that sold for $400,000 at the peak is only worth about $200,000 to $225,000 now. A 1986 512 Boxer that went for $340,000 is under $200,000 now." 
 Mr. Jurist said the rapid inflation in the value of some exotics had not been fueled by genuine collectors. "The market was pushed to artificial heights by speculators who were selling to each other," he said. "Then one decided he did not want to play and it all collapsed."
"People borrowed $500,000 to buy a Ferrari, expecting to sell it in a year for $1 million," said Dean Tezos, a New York collector. "The interest on that comes to $65,000 to $70,000 a year. That is not much if you are expecting to sell for $1 million, but it is not viable when the market is down."
Prices of many other collector cars, from plebeian Fords and Chevrolets to exotic imports, have softened as well, although not so sharply as for the Ferraris and Jaguars.
"We did a survey of people who dropped their subscriptions," said David Brownell, editor of Hemmings Motor News, which is aimed at collectors. "We found that people were holding off restoring cars because they were unsure of their financial situation or had lost their jobs and were in no position to buy a car."
But a weakened market can mean opportunities for bargain hunters. Mr. Tezos, for example, said he dropped out of the market in 1988 and 1989 but was back buying cars.
Experts in the field said some time-honored rules still hold. One is that "the price goes up if the top goes down." Since collectors typically drive their prized cars only in nice weather, convertibles typically command a steep price premium.
For example, Automotive Investor, a newsletter published by Liebert Inc. in New York, reports that a 1968 Ford Shelby Mustang GT350 in good condition sells for $20,000 to $25,000. A convertible of the same model commands from $40,000 to $45,000. Similarly, a 1957 Chrysler 300-C coupe is listed at $16,000 to $22,000. The convertible is $30,000 to $36,000.
Another rule of thumb is that some older cars represent middle-aged men's teen-age dream machines. One formula is: take the current year, subtract 45 to get back to the birth years of today's middle-aged men and add back 15 to 17 to get the years they fell in love with cars. Thus, interest in cars of the early 1950's is easing, while demand for early 1960's models is picking up.
"We think there is a real opportunity in Karmann Ghia convertibles," said Mary Ann Liebert, publisher of Automotive Investor. "You can get them for under $5,000 today, and we think that could double by the end of 1992." The sports car version of the venerable Volkswagen bug, Karmann Ghias were popular throughout the 1960's.
"There will always be a market for nostalgia cars," Mr. Jurist said. "People want the cars they associate with their youth."
The "muscle cars" of the 1960's are also attracting more interest, and therefore increasing in price. These were relatively modest sedans with huge engines installed to improve their performance.
For instance, a 1969 or 1970 Ford Boss Mustang with the 302-cubic-inch engine is listed by Automotive Investor at $14,500 to $16,500. The same car with a 429-cubic-inch engine lists from $38,000 to $45,000. A 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T with the standard engine ranges from $10,000 to $13,000; with a 426 engine, it is $42,000 to $50,000.
Price quotations are rough, since cars typically trade one at a time and there is no organized reporting mechanism. Collector-car auctions of hundreds of cars provide some indication of the market. But since owners often set minimum prices for cars and sometimes join the bidding to hold up price levels, it is not always clear where the bottom of the market is.
"Auction prices can be fiddled," Mr. Brownell said. "I take 10 to 15 percent off the reported prices."
And since each car is individual, the sale of one for a high price does not necessarily mean similar models will command the same price. "You have to know how many actual bidders there were for a car," Ms. Leibert said. "Maybe there were just one or two people who had to have a car and they bid it up. That does not mean there are 25 others out there.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Dollar Called Important As Factor in Fed Policy

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The dollar, seemingly ignored by the Federal Reserve Board when it was weak, may be rising in importance as a policy consideration now that it is strong, credit market analysts say.
There are good economic and political reasons for the Fed to be concerned. 
 Export growth, one of the lone sources of consistent strength over the last year, is slowing. And the dollar's run-up against the German mark has been so sharp that the Bundesbank may be forced to raise German interest rates, which could push the cost of reunification to prohibitive levels.
 
Two Alternative Courses
 The Fed has at least two alternative courses if it wants to stem the dollar's rise: massively dumping dollars in the foreign exchange markets along with other central banks, or if it decides against intervention, it could ease domestic interest rates again.
"Bringing the dollar down has to have a higher priority" than previously, said Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to Data Resources Inc., the economic forecasting firm. "I am hearing that export orders are starting to slow further, and given the debt overhang we have, the only real stimulus you are going to get from lower interest rates is in exports."
In a weekly letter to clients, William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, wrote that "since the Fed has consistently identified the trade sector as being extremely important to any recovery process in the United States, the credit authorities may now be more willing to lower interest rates to brake the dollar's upward climb" to sustain export momentum.
 
Not All Are Convinced
 Not all economists are convinced that the dollar's rise will have much influence on how the Fed conducts monetary policy.
"Our central bank normally cares about inflation or growth, depending on where we are in the business cycle," said Alan Sinai, president of Boston Company Economic Advisers. "Currency is a tangential concern. The strong dollar makes it easier for the Fed to ease if it wants to, but right now priority No. 1 is the economy."
Although the predominant evidence supports the view that the economy remains in recession, analysts who have been predicting that an upturn would begin by midyear have more reason to believe in their forecast than they did a month ago.
 
Houses and Economic Index
 Recent reports on housing starts and sales suggest conditions in that depressed sector of the economy may have bottomed out.
And Mr. Sinai noted that the increase of 1.1 percentage points in February's index of leading economic indicators was almost certain to be followed by another gain in March, given the run-up in stock prices, the growth in money supply and the sharp rise in consumer confidence that has occurred. Three straight months of gains in the index are almost always followed by an upturn in the economy, he said.
Even the optimists concede that more bad news is coming. And strong dollar or no, Mr. Chimerine and others said that the Fed was not likely to ease policy further unless bond yields fell in the face of additional signs of economic weakness.
Based on Wall Street forecasts, such signs will probably be seen this week, beginning with the March survey of the nation's purchasing managers, which is expected to be released today. Most analysts are expecting the report to show that although conditions in the manufacturing sector improved marginally from February, activity remains at a very low level.
 
Employment Data Due
 The most important news is not expected until Friday, however, when the Labor Department is scheduled to release March employment data. Based on recent trends in initial unemployment claims, John Lonski, a senior economist at Moody's Investors Service, projected that nonfarm payroll employment fell by 225,000 in March, following the February drop of 184,000.
A decline of that size would almost certainly push up the unemployment rate from its current level of 6.5 percent. And some analysts said that if the report also shows little growth in hourly wages, the Fed might be tempted to respond by easing policy further.
That view is far from uniform.
The Fed, which lowered short-term interest rates after the last two employment reports, is not likely to move again until it sees a slowing in broad-based inflation measures like the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index.
Analysts, who have been surprised and perplexed by the resilience of inflationary pressures in the midst of an economic downturn, expect to see an improvement in the March data, which are expected next week.

HEADLINE: Fed Kept Policy Steady in February

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The policy-making body of the Federal Reserve voted unanimously at its February meeting to leave credit policy unchanged, but with a tilt toward lower rates, minutes of the meeting show.
The Federal Open Market Committee agreed "that for now it was desirable to pause and assess the course of the economy and the effect of past policy actions," according to the minutes. 
 Members took into account the "considerable" credit easing in recent months and the discount-rate cut that took place a few days before the meeting, on Feb. 5 and 6. The minutes are released six to seven weeks after the meetings, which are private, are held; the minutes of the February meeting were released on Friday.
The open market committee is made up of the 7 board members and 5 of the 12 regional bank presidents. Only 11 market committee members voted at the February meeting because of a vacancy on the board.
All of the members agreed that the credit policy should remain unchanged, and most expressed a preference for continuing to adjust the policy toward pushing rates lower in the weeks ahead, the minutes said.
The minutes noted that interest rates had fallen but stated that some members thought sufficient time had not passed for the effects to be felt in the economy or in money-supply growth.
A number of members expressed concern that easing credit so soon after a cut on Feb. 1 in the discount rate, to 6 percent from 6.5 percent, would result in "undesirable downward pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets." The discount rate is the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks.
The dollar has firmed since the Persian Gulf war ended. The Fed lowered its target for the free-floating Federal funds rate to 6 percent, from 6.25 percent, on March 8, after the Government reported a steep climb in January in the unemployment rate.
The minutes show that several members at the February meeting wanted the committee to place "a high premium" on avoiding a deep recession.
Those members, the minutes said, "were more concerned about the severe consequences of a potentially deep and prolonged recession than those of a sharp rebound in the economy, especially given current financial strains and fragilities in the economy."

HEADLINE: A Troubled Operation PUSH Struggles to Focus Its Mission

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 31

 BODY:
Operation PUSH, the Chicago civil rights organization founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, is going through a period of upheaval, struggling to reshape its identity in the face of financial troubles and the resignation of its executive director, the Rev. Tyrone Crider.
PUSH leaders say they are reassessing strategy, stepping up fund raising and reorganizing the management of the 20-year-old organization, whose initials stand for People United to Serve Humanity. 
 In January, faced with a deficit of several hundred thousand dollars, the PUSH board announced the layoff of all 12 staff workers. The group has since raised more than $100,000, and officials say they hope to raise $1 million in the next 12 months.
The Rev. Henry Williamson, the new president and chief executive officer, said that PUSH had "put out the immediate financial fires" and that he hoped to rehire the workers soon. Most have continued as volunteers, he said.
 
'Time to Take Inventory'
 Robert T. Starks, an associate professor of political science at Northeastern Illinois University who has followed PUSH, said: "This is a critical period for the organization. Their major mission will remain the same, but it's a time to take inventory."
Mr. Crider resigned this month, citing personal reasons, in what was widely seen as a response to PUSH's problems. The board then created a 20-member team to develop criteria for hiring a new director and reorganizing. PUSH has also begun a nationwide membership drive, with a goal of 100,000 new members this year.
Although these moves seem to have been prompted by Mr. Crider's departure, many who have followed PUSH say the organization has floundered since 1989, when Mr. Jackson relinquished his leadership to move his legal residence to Washington.
Mr. Jackson was in Chicago today to deliver an Easter sermon to more than 1,000 people at the Carter Temple Church, where Mr. Williamson is pastor. Referring to the Crucifixion, Mr. Jackson said, "It wasn't the nails in His hands, painful as they were," but the fact that the people Jesus served had deserted Him. He urged the worshipers to contribute to PUSH.
 
Jackson Seen as the Key
 James Compton, president of the Chicago Urban League, said, "I tend to think that the key to the PUSH situation is the presence or lack of presence of Reverend Jackson."
But some who are familiar with PUSH have said privately that it was losing influence even before Mr. Jackson left. Critics have charged that the group, which has long pressed for affirmative action and other efforts on behalf of minority workers and businesses, caters to middle-class blacks.
Few prominent black Chicagoans will openly criticize PUSH. But a letter published in The Chicago Tribune last fall reflects the views of some detractors. It said, "The fact is that most blacks under 30 think of PUSH, along with several other civil rights organizations, as dinosaurs."
PUSH officials say such charges are untrue. They said PUSH's troubles rose from the downturn in the economy, which has heightened demands for the organization's services at the same time that contributions are down.
"We receive more than 150 calls each day," said the Rev. Willie Barrow, vice chairwoman of the PUSH board. Ms. Barrow said PUSH's financial troubles mirrored those of the corporate world.
 
Public Relations Failures
 But some public relations failures have hurt PUSH. Most prominent was a boycott of Nike Inc., the athletic-shoe manufacturer, over its hiring practices. Several prominent blacks opposed the boycott, which was widely perceived as a failure when Nike officials refused to negotiate with PUSH.
PUSH leaders argue that the boycott, which began in August, has forced Nike, as well as others in the athletic industry, to hire more blacks. Nike has formed an advisory board to review the company's minority recruitment.

HEADLINE: No Budget By Deadline In New York

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 31

 BODY:
As New York State enters a new fiscal year on Monday without a budget, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders are mired in a severe dispute that focuses in large part on taxes -- not just how much more of them there should be but who exactly should pay them.
Even if the Governor and state lawmakers here fulfill pledges to rely on spending cuts to close most of a $6 billion deficit in a $29 billion budget, the gap is so large that they are still likely to approve major increases in taxes and fees for the third straight year. While the general fund budget, which includes mostly state tax revenues, is expected to be around $29 billion, the "all funds" budget, adding Federal money spent by the state, is expected to total about $51 billion.
 
 What divides them is deep disagreement over what tax increases would be least damaging to the state's economy, whose weak condition is closely linked to the state government's budget turmoil.
 
Most Basic Question
 The most basic question is whether new taxes should be broadly spread across the state or whether there is a way -- as many vocal constituencies, including major labor unions and the Legislature's Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, are demanding -- to target wealthy taxpayers and corporations.
Governor Cuomo, to the consternation of some of his usual Democratic allies and the somewhat wary approval of conservative critics, has approached the budget this year determined to make major spending cuts and to reject dramatic tax increases for anyone, including the wealthy.
His budget plan avoids any increase in rates for the state's most familiar broad-based taxes: income, sales and corporate taxes. But it places a patchwork of new levies on items ranging from gasoline (10 cents a gallon) to out-of-state business telephone calls (2 percent surcharge) to snack foods (basically a nickel a package).
The Democrat with whom Governor Cuomo shares control over the budget-making process, Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, has denounced many of Mr. Cuomo's taxes as regressive. People pay the same rates, he says, whether they are rich or poor.
In a move that helped put budget negotiations in chaos because it came just days before the April 1 deadline, Mr. Miller, under heavy pressure from many liberal Democrats in the Assembly, proposed doing away with most of Mr. Cuomo's taxes and replacing them with a $1 billion tempo rary rise in personal income tax rates. That increase, he said, would be more equitable because people in wealthier tax brackets would pay more.
Mr. Cuomo opposes that and other proposals to raise income-tax rates, although he insists that he believes putting much heavier taxes on the rich is a good idea -- if it is done in Washington, not in Albany. "Unlike the Federal Government," he said recently, "states are caught in a rough competitive struggle with one another."
Mr. Miller's budget plan also includes major spending cuts, but the tax increase would be used to soften many of those proposed by Mr. Cuomo, including reductions in aid to school districts and local governments. More starkly, it would divide the tax burden in different ways than Mr. Cuomo has proposed.
 
Tax Bite Compared
 Most lower-income people would wind up paying less under Mr. Miller's plan: those making less than $20,000, for instance, would pay an average of less than $4 more in income taxes, Assembly officials estimate, while under Mr. Cuomo's plan they would on average pay more than that in tax increases on gasoline and other items.
People at the other end of the economic scale would fare better with Mr. Cuomo's plan. Those making between $100,000 and $250,000 a year would pay an average of about $750 more in income taxes under the Assembly proposal, and those with incomes of more than $250,000 would pay more than $5,000 more each.
With the gas tax these same people would pay an additional $100 to $150 a year. And while some very wealthy people would have to contend with increased estate taxes and new taxes on the sale of million-dollar homes in Mr. Cuomo's proposal, it is clear that most upper-income taxpayers would pay less under his plan.
Mr. Miller's plan is not the only one whose proponents assert it is more progressive than the Governor's.
A proposal by the Public Employees Federation, one of the largest unions of state workers, would close some of the gap with $3 billion in new taxes, most of them on businesses. Personal income taxes would rise by nearly $1 billion, but only for people making more than $100,000 a year, who would pay an average of $3,000 more each.
Perhaps not surprisingly, many advocates for social programs who object bitterly to the cuts proposed by Mr. Cuomo describe higher taxes on the wealthy as an obvious and fair way to restore some of them.
"The Governor has abandoned any notion here of progressive taxation," said Russell Sykes, senior policy associate with the State Communities Aid Association, a nonprofit lobbying group. "I think he is painting himself into a corner where he is likely to do greater harm to the people and the economy he is professing to protect than if he was amenable to looking at some of the broader-based taxes."
Mr. Cuomo has presided over a series of major cuts in income taxes, whose maximum rate stood at 15 percent in the 1970's and is now at 7.875 percent, though he also warned lawmakers, including Mr. Miller, that they were going too low when they passed the last major round of cuts in 1987.
Despite that warning, the Governor has remained adamant that any rise in income-tax rates now, during a recession, would do damage because it would increase the flight of businesses and wealthy taxpayers out of the state.
"It's not a threat; it is a fact of life," Gerald C. Crotty, the Governor's chief of staff, said in an interview on Saturday. "It would be devastating to the economy, especially in New York City."
There is little question that tax rates influence businesses' decisions about where to locate, but their importance is difficult to measure against other factors, including the quality of government services like education and infrastructure.
In any event, New York already lags behind most states in creating new jobs and it has the second-highest combined state and local taxes of any state in the nation, after Alaska. Many analysts say raising rates by a significant amount might help close this year's budget deficit, but is unlikely to help in the long run.
Beyond that, trying to direct those taxes specifically at the wealthy is risky. "You may not have to worry about many people leaving the state, but the people you do have to worry about have a lot of economic clout," said Steven D. Gold, the director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York.
For the moment, the Assembly Speaker's proposal has bogged down budget negotiations. While both the Democratic Governor and the majority leader of Republican-controlled State Senate, Ralph J. Marino, have soundly rejected it, Mr. Miller is still pushing to have it considered.
And Mr. Marino, putting a further drag on the talks, has also been critical of the gasoline tax, which would bring in $500 million a year, without yet making clear what alternatives he has in mind.

HEADLINE: Foreign Stocks Gain, But U.S. Investors Lag

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
It was a good quarter for investors in foreign stock markets. But it was not so good for Americans.
Mexico's bourse again led the pack, rising 36.9 percent in local currency, and continuing its recent dominance of world market performance. And stock markets in Europe, even with a relatively weak performance by Germany, outperformed Wall Street, according to the Financial Times index of world markets. European markets rose 15.4 percent, compared with a 14.1 percent rise in the United States. The Tokyo market was up 13 percent in local currency. 
 At the same time, the dollar's rally of the last seven weeks cut into the gains of American investors, especially in Europe. Only in markets where the local currency is tied closely to the dollar or follows it, like Mexico, Hong Kong and Singapore, were investors spared this sharp reduction when gains were converted back into dollars. In dollar terms, Europe's local gain was cut to 3.3 percent and Japan's to 9.1 percent. But Mexico slipped to only 35.2 percent.
The victory in the Persian Gulf war was the common support for all markets. And the hope for an imminent economic recovery in the United States gave a push to Wall Street that seemed to move other markets around the world. Stock markets like France, Spain and Britain also benefited from actual and expected cuts in interest rates.
 
Gyrations in the Markets
 Some gyrations in the markets were the product of sudden shifts in focus. One day investors would look beyond recessions or economic slowdowns in many countries to recoveries. Then on the next day, a set of disappointing earnings would return them to the bad news of the moment.
Germany, where the Financial Times index rose 7.7 percent in marks, was the weakest performer of the major stock markets. For Americans, the dollar's rally turned the modest gain into a 5.2 percent loss. While the Frankfurt market rallied on the war victory, thoughts in Germany quickly turned to the growing economic problems in the former East Germany: rising unemployment and political protests. There is even the possibility now that the German central bank, the Bundesbank, could move to raise interest rates again because of the sharp fall of the mark against the dollar.
After Mexico, which continues to benefit from the opening up of its economy and the possibility of a free-trade zone with the United States, Hong Kong, up 24.8 percent in dollars, and Singapore, up 22.3 percent, were the top performers. Hong Kong has been one of the hottest markets all year. Investment managers plucked what they saw as good values in a market they said was somewhat insulated from the confrontation in the gulf. Singapore also benefited from investors who chose it for its good values and potential growth this year.
The surprise of the quarter was Sweden, a market that many managers were shying away from at the end of last year. But a decline in interest rates, a credible Government budget proposal packed with spending cuts and the victory in the war helped push the market up 17.2 percent in dollar terms.

HEADLINE: Macy Edges Away From Abyss

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS with ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Success is a relative thing, and nowhere is that clearer than at R. H. Macy & Company, the huge retailer, where the financial picture is finally starting to look brighter after more than two years of severe problems.
Once Macy measured success in rising market share and innovative retailing concepts. Now, hobbled by debts and recession and reduced to seeking permission from bankers for moves that its merchants once would have made on their own, Macy measures its success simply in survival short of bankruptcy. 
 By that narrow measure, Macy is looking better than at any time since its ill-advised $1.2 billion acquisitions of Bullock's and I. Magnin in 1988. If Macy does survive, that achievement will be in stark contrast to the bankruptcies of humbled rivals like Federated Department Stores, Allied Stores and Carter Hawley Hale.
 
Wall Street Turns Positive
 Wall Street, leery a few months ago, is now generally positive. "I'm a believer -- the company makes it," said Tom Razukas, an analyst with Fitch Investors Service, a credit-rating agency. He said that even using conservative estimates of future sales, he expected Macy to meet its obligations from its more than $4 billion in debt.
Within the close-knit world of Seventh Avenue's garment center, concerns have also abated. "I think Macy's is making some real progress," said John Pomerantz, the chairman of the Leslie Fay Companies, the New York-based clothing maker. "They're keeping their inventories low and cutting back on price promotions, which hurt gross profits. They're paying their bills on time. I think the worst is behind them."
The decision to cut back on promotions last Christmas improved Macy's profit margins but left it with sales 10 percent below those of the previous Christmas.
Macy needs to bring back customers, and it promises a striking increase in its television advertising starting in April, including sponsorship of New York Mets baseball. And it is working hard to emphasize inventory control to curtail markdowns and to reduce expenses.
Another sign that Macy has begun to get a good hold on its future is that it recently brought in two new finance experts -- Myron E. Ullman, a former managing director of Wharf Holdings Ltd. of Hong Kong, and Diane P. Baker, formerly a corporate finance director at Salomon Brothers. Their assignment, essentially, is to free the company's chairman and chief executive, Edward S. Finkelstein, to focus his attention on merchandising and marketing, areas that are obviously important in the long run to Macy's success.
The company's executives have to find ways to cut the debt left over from Macy's own leveraged buyout in 1986 and the acquisitions two years later. Macy has begun doing so by buying back more than $300 million of its own bonds for less than half their face value. And when it completes a pending sale of its credit-card operations to GE Capital, the General Electric Company's finance unit, "we will have reduced total debt by approximately $2 billion," Macy executives said last month in announcing the latest bond purchases. Macy executives declined to be interviewed for this article.
In an interview two years after the Macy buyout, Mr. Finkelstein looked ahead to taking Macy public again and said he expected that doing so would provide the investors with "a good deal five to seven years hence." That would be in 1993 to 1995. In the process of selling additional stock to other investors in order to buy back high-interest bonds, Mr. Finkelstein's team reduced its percentage of ownership to 13 percent, from 19 percent.
The changing view of Macy has come not so much from its financial results -- Christmas was good only in contrast to a very bad 1989 season -- as from the voice of confidence from the institutional investors that control Macy. When a pending deal is completed, more than $202 million will have been invested in Macy stock since last fall. It is that cash that gave Macy the ability to buy back its bonds.
"Without that equity infusion, the industry might have been reluctant to ship them merchandise after Christmas," said Evan Mann, an analyst at Dillon, Read & Company. "With the equity they got, and the ability to buy back their debt, it will make them a healthier company."
 
The Bond Recovery
Prices Doubled, Even Quadrupled
The view that Macy will succeed is in sharp contrast to the outlook only last October. The pervasive disarray in the "junk bond" market, coupled with worries about Christmas sales in a recession, had sent Macy bond prices plunging. Anyone brave enough to have bought Macy bonds then would have locked up annual returns of 40 percent or more -- provided that Macy lived up to its obligations.
Since then, prices of Macy bonds have doubled and even quadrupled, and yields are back down to around 20 percent. That level, while signaling a brighter outlook, still shows that many investors do not believe Macy is out of the woods.
"They are still showing signs of a prolonged recession," said Mariel Clemensen, a vice president and bond analyst at Citicorp Securities Markets, who thinks the bond market prices reflect excessive optimism.
 
An Optimistic Forecast
 Nonetheless, as Walter F. Loeb, a New York retail analyst, put it: "Macy stores are still some of the most exciting in the department-store field. If the company can just stay ahead of its high debt and get through this difficult period, it will do very well when the retail environment picks up."
Nearly all highly leveraged companies report bottom-line losses, because the heavy interest payments on their debt typically push them into the red. In its case, Macy has not reported an annual profit since 1986, when management, together with institutional investors, bought the company.
But in leveraged companies, investors watch cash flow, which is defined in various ways. The most liberal definition is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, known as Ebitda (eh-BEET-da). In fiscal 1987, which ended Aug. 1, 1987, Macy showed such cash flow at $797 million, though it reported a net loss of $13.8 million.
Cash flow defined this way leaves out some important factors. While highly leveraged companies seldom pay much in taxes, they do pay huge interest bills -- and still need to cover some capital investments. In fiscal 1987, Macy's cash flow was more than enough to cover all those contingencies, if not enough to produce a profit.
 
The Federated Debacle
Losing the Battle Was the Good News
Things were still looking good in the next fiscal year, even though business fell off after the 1987 stock market crash. It was then that Macy got caught up in the bidding war for Federated Department Stores.
The good news for Macy was that it lost the bidding war to Robert Campeau, a Canadian financier, who paid so much that Federated went bankrupt within two years along with Allied Stores, which the Campeau Corporation already owned.
The bad news was that Macy won a consolation prize, acquiring the Bullock's and I. Magnin chains of Federated. That strengthened Macy's position in California, which perhaps became stronger still this year when Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., a leading West Coast competitor, buckled under the heavy debt load it had taken on to avoid a takeover bid and filed for bankruptcy.
Macy has insisted that buying those stores was good for strategic reasons, but there is little doubt it overpaid. "They bought Magnin and Bullock's for 10 times cash flow," said Citicorp's Ms. Clemensen, adding that such stores are now probably worth only five times cash flow.
In the two and a half years since then, for which financial results have been reported, Macy has seen cash flow fall $126 million short of being enough to cover interest expenses and capital spending. It first slashed capital spending, but has more recently increased it.
 
Questions About Bullock's
 Precisely how well Macy has done running the California operations is not clear; Macy does not disclose results by store chain. But there are critics of Macy's decision to put Bullock's under the Macy Atlanta division. Under that change, marketing and merchandising are set in Atlanta for the California stores. "The crisp look and the comprehensive stocks of the old Bullock's under the previous ownership are gone now," said Herbert Mines, a New York retailing recruiter. "The competition loves it because Bullock's isn't the tough rival it used to be."
When Macy was an unquestioned leader in the department store world, much of its success seemed to be a result of its clever use of store brands, where it controlled the design and manufacture of goods and avoided the costs of middlemen. But some people think that with Macy's senior management, notably its chairman, Mr. Finkelstein, focuing on the financial issues of the buyout, the private-label operation was not watched closely enough.
"Macy will try this fall to feature many of the big supplier names in the business as it attempts to reduce much of its private-label emphasis," said Bud Konheim, head of Nicole Miller, the dress and sportswear maker. "They want a lot of high-profile names." He added that private labels were expected to account for 20 percent of sales, half the level that once prevailed.
 
The Challenge Ahead
Cash Flow Unlikely To Meet Expenses
After the disastrous 1989 Christmas season, Macy was determined to avoid having inventories that were too large, and it entered this last Christmas with 16 percent fewer goods on its shelves. With less merchandise to move, it had less need to cut prices, despite the recession in the Northeast, where Macy does most of its business.
Even with the drop in sales, cash flow was up and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to $254 million, from $210 million a year earlier. That gain was enough to leave $32 million on hand after deducting all interest expenses and capital spending.
 
A Sign of Confidence
 It still seems inevitable, however, that this fiscal year, which ends in August, will be the second one in a row in which cash flow will not have been enough to meet all interest expenses and capital spending needs. Last week, Macy's banks agreed to relax some rules on interest payments to insure that Macy will avoid being in default on its bank loans.
One sign that Macy, and its bankers and equity investors, are confident about the future is that Macy has bought back the most junior of its bonds, ignoring its senior bonds. In that way, it was able to retire more debt at a lower cost, because the riskier junior debt had fallen further.
But it did nothing to offset the principal payments that will come due sooner. It is required to pay back $25 million of its $370 million in bank loans in June, and another $175 million by the end of this year. The sale of the credit-card operations will only partly cover that requirement.
Moreover, Macy must begin paying back part of the principal on its most senior bonds in 1994. But instead of buying some of them, it purchased bonds that do not require principal payments to begin until 1997 on one issue and 2002 on another.
Those requirements for debt service emphasize that Macy still faces a challenge, and some people say that Macy may have to sell more assets. Walter K. Levy, a York retail-marketing consultant in New York, speculated that it might seek to sell one or more of its specialty-store chains, and Macy has been seeking a buyer for a California office building it no longer needs.
"It would be good if Macy's could raise more equity or cash by selling a less-productive asset like the Macy Atlanta group," said Joanne Lagomsky, vice president for corporate finance for the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit-rating agency. "The company needs more cash to meet its debt-service requirements."

HEADLINE: Louisiana Farmers, Finding Gold in Alligator Skins, Face a Changing Market

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORKED ISLAND, La.

 BODY:
Raywood Stelly opened the shed door on more than 200 small alligators, releasing their gamey aroma in a gush of suffocatingly hot, moist air.
"That's the smell of money," said Mr. Stelly in his thick Cajun accent as light streamed into the circular enclosure, sending the alligators slithering from their pool into wriggling piles along the walls. 
 In 1977 there were only three alligator farmers in Louisiana. Now Mr. Stelly is one among 126 in the state, putting Louisiana well ahead of Florida and Texas, which also have native alligator populations but fewer than 40 farms in all.
In that time alligator farming has grown through an unlikely combination of profit motive, concern for an endangered species and efforts to preserve the state's coastal marshes and inland swamps.
 
Humble Start, Elegant End
 "It has come from virtually nothing in a decade to amount to half the $51 million a year that the state derives from crayfish," said Larry Michaux, a spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Agriculture. And crayfish have been a staple of Cajun cuisine for more than 100 years.
Alligators are also slaughtered for their meat, but farmers estimate that the skin accounts for 85 percent of the market value, the meat for 15 percent. Of the 300,000 alligator skins sold worldwide each year, the United States produces 150,000, and most of them come from Louisiana.
But now the recession and the alligator farmers' own successes are posing a threat to alligator farming, whose product begins humbly with egg harvesting in swamps and bayous and ends up in glittering showcases like Hermes or Neiman-Marcus.
The market has become saturated with farm-bred skins 4 to 4 1/2 feet long -- the size on which most of the economic assumptions of alligator farming rest. But tanners, most of whom are overseas, are now seeking 6-to-9-foot skins because high-fashion items like handbags and attache cases require larger skins. In the United States such sizes are available only through annual state-regulated alligator-hunting seasons in Louisiana, Florida and Texas.
Prices for the farm-bred product have declined from a high of $35 a foot two years ago to about $23 a foot now, said Jack Montouncet, president of the Louisiana Alligator Farmers and Ranchers Association.
Don Ashley, a Florida-based consultant in the international market for alligator and other skins, said, "The industry is not on the rocks but it is definitely at a crossroads, and the farmers are going to have to adapt or face bankruptcy."
Among other things, Mr. Ashley said, alligator farmers will have to reorganize their farms to allow for a longer growing time, so they can produce a wider range of skin sizes. This will significantly alter the economics of the business.
In their efforts to adapt, the farmers are likely to look for help from biologists at Grand Chenier, where much of the research on techniques for raising alligators in Louisiana was developed. Grand Chenier, a village six miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico, is near the 85,000-acre state-run Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Louisiana and is 40 miles west of Mr. Stelly's farm at Forked Island.
Since 1963, biologists at the wildlife refuge have studied the alligator and devised ways to control the sex of embryos, methods of accelerating growth, the use of controlled environments to reduce stress, and the most efficient and economic regimens for stocking and feeding the animals.
Ted Joanen, a biologist who has worked on the project for more than 27 years, said the most important finding was that somewhere in the first 14 months after the laying of eggs, 83 percent of the eggs or young animals were lost to predators, storms, starvation, disease or other natural causes.
"There is a tremendous natural mortality in alligators," he said, "and so we recommended that that portion which was going to die in the wild anyway be used to build the farming industry."
Beginning in 1977, biologists at the refuge began scouring the treeless marshes by helicopter, looking for the distinctive brown mounds of dried wire grass and switch cane that are alligator nests.
Since that first harvesting of 10,000 eggs 14 years ago, the effort has grown tremendously. Last year nearly 300,000 eggs were harvested from two million acres of publicly and privately owned marshes and swamps, and sold to alligator farmers.
In that time the wild alligator population in Louisiana has increased from fewer than 200,000 to 750,000 today, Mr. Joanen said.
The preservation of the state's marshes and swamps has been another benefit of alligator farming, he said, adding, "We have managed the alligator as a resource and there has been mutual benefit for us, the animal and the environment."
Although alligator farming is by no means universally endorsed, it has generally been accepted and even applauded by many environmentalists. They see it as a way of productively managing the state's alligator population while creating a strong incentive for maintaining ecologically sensitive habitats.
 
On the Brink of Extinction
 Faced with possible extinction, the alligator was declared an endangered species in 1967, and alligator hunting was banned. As its population rebounded, restrictions on killing them were gradually removed, and in 1987 practically all restrictions disappeared nationally.
"There is still a perception in this country of the alligator as an endangered species," Mr. Ashley said . "At one time we had quality tanning and manufacturing facilities in this country, but with the classification of the alligator as endangered, most of them disappeared."
Fewer than 10 percent of the skins raised in the United States are now processed in the three tanneries that continue to operate in this country. Most are tanned and shaped into finished products in Europe. Seventy percent of the market for those products, Mr. Ashley said, is in Europe or Japan.
But now Mr. Stelly and other farmers fear that their salad days are coming to an end. As he walked among the corrugated metal sheds, he talked of what the future might hold.
"It was a pretty good business up until now," he said. "The price has dropped down, but I'm still moving my skins. I just don't know whether that will continue."
 
An Experiment in Diversity
 As a hedge against worse times, Mr. Stelly has begun to experiment with transferring some of the alligators that are being raised in sheds to outdoor ponds to grow for another year or so, until they are 6 to 7 feet long. In this way, he said, he can diversify his skin sizes without the high investment cost of new year-round heated sheds.
Even in this experiment he is relying on research from Mr. Joanen and other biologists at the refuge to determine the most efficient pond size and the number of alligators to place in each fenced-in pond.
The experiment with growing alligators in outdoor ponds could also lead to the development of his own alligator herd, Mr. Stelly said, if he decides to keep enough alligators until they reach 3 or 4 years of age, when they are old enough to breed.
Mr. Ashley said diversifying in this way would help many farmers weather the current downturn. But he added that he was also working with the state alligator farmers' association in developing a market for smaller skins, to be used in making items like wallets, key cases and compacts.
Mr. Montouncet, the president of the association, said that if the farmers were successful they could open up a bigger market for their expensive products in the United States and create the need for more tanning and manufacturing plants in this country.

The state is well ahead of Florida and Texas, with fewer than 40 farms in all, but a slump is forcing farmers to reassess their methods. (Alan S. Weiner for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: New Hampshire Air Base to Close, Draining a City

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEWINGTON, N.H., March 31

 BODY:
Pease Air Force Base, one of the biggest military installations to fall under the Defense Department budget ax three years ago, is about to be the first to close.
The seaside base, which housed 3,700 military personnel and their dependents and employed about 1,000 civilians, will formally close Monday. It was eerily empty last week as the 90 or so people remaining packed to leave. 
 "It feels like a ghost town," said Master Sgt. Steve Campbell, among the last to leave. "It's dead. You go from 9,000 people to less than 100, That feels weird."
Lieut. Col. Harry Mandrose plans a news conference on Monday, his last act as commander of the 4,255-acre base.
 
First to Close
 Pease, which opened in 1956, is the first of 86 military installations nationwide to close under a three-year-old Federal effort to save money. On Monday, the Department of Defense is to make recommendations on closing more military bases, in accordance with a move by Congress last year.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will receive the recommendations and then pass his choices to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. Mr. Cheney is scheduled to announce his list at a news conference on April 11, a Pentagon spokesman said today.
President Bush will have until July 15 to approve the list or return it for changes. When he approves the list, it will then go to Congress for final action.
 
Home Base for Bombers
 After the Air Force leaves Pease, the New Hampshire Air National Guard will operate and maintain its airfield.
Pease has been home to the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor of the 509th Composite Group of the Army Air Forces, which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. Pease has housed B-29, B-52 and B-47 bombers and has deployed KC-135 refueling tankers and FB-111 fighter-bombers.
Eileen Foley, mayor of adjacent Portsmouth, said the loss to the local economy was far beyond the $340 million a year that the base cost the Federal Government.
Two schools shut down because base children accounted for one-fourth the city's student body. Nearby malls miss business and part-time employees from the base, Ms. Foley said.
"It just has been a very traumatic and dramatic experience for the whole city of Portsmouth, and we're going to miss them," she said.
The military personnel either retired or transferred to other bases.
 
Many Chose Base as Home
 Capt. Howard Snarr, who oversaw the closing, said Pease's location, 60 miles north of Boston on New Hampshire's coast, attracted more than the usual number of military "homesteaders," people who go to a base and stay.
Among them was Sgt. Jim Raggiani, 38 years old, who has been at Pease for five years and is now retiring.
"You're not too far from Boston, you got the ocean and you got the mountains," he said. "It's just an ideal assignment."
While Sergeant Raggiani mourns, 26-year-old Sgt. Chris Davis is glad to be leaving for a base closer to his Michigan home.
Sergeant Davis, a base electrician, said closing was toughest on Pease civilians faced with a weak job market.
"They'll walk into a building and look around," he said. "They'll sigh, they'll shake their heads and walk away."
The state is developing plans for the base that include a commercial airport, just one of many options being discussed for the land.
Pease has 1,500 houses and 1.2 million square feet of commercial, office, industrial and warehouse buildings.
All stand empty today as the last airmen brace to watch the base close.
"Some people were glad to leave. Me personally, I'm sad," Sergeant Raggiani mused. "I mean, this is my last assignment. It's my last hurrah."

THE ECONOMY
The easy-riding mountain bike is sweeping the world in popularity and propelling American manufacturers to the front of the pack. The bikes have not only resurrected the U.S. industry; they are upstaging hand-crafted machines of Italian design. [Page A1.]
Economists and planners fear that New York City's shrinking economy and inadequate services and the prospect of higher taxes are hastening the departure of the middle class. [A1] 
 States are setting many important environmental policies, and some industries are pressing Washington for uniform rules. [D1.]
The Fed's policy-making body voted unanimously in February to leave credit policy unchanged, the meeting's minutes show. [D2.]
As New York State enters a new fiscal year without a budget, Governor Cuomo and legislative leaders are mired in a dispute that focuses in large part on taxes -- not just how much more of them there should be, but who exactly should pay them. [B1.]
New Jersey auto insurance premiums will drop $222 starting today with the elimination of a special surcharge. Critics call the reduction a "shell game." [B1.]
 
COMPANIES
Citibank plans to announce a guarantee that people who shop with its credit card will pay the lowest available price. [D1.]
Macy once measured success in rising market share and innovative retailing concepts. Now, hobbled by debts and recession and reduced to seeking permission from bankers for moves its merchants once would have made on their own, it measures its success simply in survival short of bankruptcy. By that narrow measure, it is looking better than at any time since 1988. [D1.]
A group of creditors is seeking to force MGM-Pathe into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. The group claims in Federal bankruptcy court that the studio owes it as much as $20 million. [D7.]

MARKETS
The stock market had one of its strongest quarters since 1980. Of the 3,604 stocks tracked by Media General Financial Services, 3,029 were up in the first quarter and 480 were down. [D1.]
It was a good quarter for investors in foreign stock markets, but the dollar's rally cut into the gains of American investors. [D4.]
 
THE MEDIA BUSINESS
The networks have to deal with some expensive free agents this year, and they have an enormous incentive to work together to keep costs down. Bill Carter: Television. [D1.]
Cable channels are spending heavily on original programs, seeking to attract viewers on the crowded cable systems. [D8.]
Jesus de Polanco is used to being called Spain's Rupert Murdoch or Robert Maxwell, but he dismisses the analogy as inaccurate. For one thing, neither of those men wields as much power in one country as he does. [D8.]
Consumers are popping up far more often as featured players in commercials. But advertisers find it tough to find the right real people. Kim Foltz: Advertising. [D9.] Western agencies' biggest challenge in Eastern Europe is developing strategies for marketing to people who have never seen an American-style campaign. [D8.]
 
TODAY'S COLUMNS
Prices of many collector cars have softened since last year, when the bottom dropped out of the market for exotic European cars like Ferrari and Aston Martin. But a weak market can mean opportunities for bargain hunters. Market Place. [D6.]
The dollar may be rising in importance as a policy consideration, now that it is strong, after the Fed seemingly ignored it when it was weak. There are good economic and political reasons for concern. Kenneth N. Gilpin: Credit Markets. [D7.]

HEADLINE: Middle-Class Flight Feared By New York City Experts

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
With a job at an advertising agency and a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, Matthew Luba settled into the life he had looked forward to. He was a New Yorker.
Now just four years later, he and his wife, Alison, who works in publishing, are settling into a contemporary four-bedroom house with a deck and a hot tub in northern Bergen County, N.J. The outdoor furniture is expected soon. 
 "Although I still enjoy many aspects of Manhattan, I don't see the city as a place I'm proud of," Mr. Luba said.
He does not worry about missing his friends. Many of them, he said, are moving from the city too.
 
Powerful Economic Forces
 New York City has long lured young people starting careers and, especially lately, immigrants starting new lives, two powerful economic forces. But it has always had defectors, particularly parents with children nearing school age and parents-to-be, many with middle- and upper-middle-class incomes.
In the postwar decades, when the suburbs were built, and in the 1970's, when the city's economy all but collapsed, the losses mounted. Now some planners and economists say there is a potential for more losses -- not just to the suburbs but also to places beyond the metropolitan region -- which could weaken the city's already fragile tax base and deprive it of people important for an economic revival.
Conditions seem ripe. The city's shrinking economy has resulted in a loss of more than 100,000 jobs since 1987. City Hall is hard pressed to maintain services many already regard as inadequate. The public school system is facing more spending cuts. And as the city becomes a less desirable place, taxes, especially property taxes, will likely rise, making it more expensive.
"When the economy turns down, it accentuates all of the negatives, providing a greater incentive for people here to move and cutting the incentive for people to move to New York," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The city could be caught, he said, by "both blades of the scissors."
Demography seems likely to play an increasingly important role in migration, though which way it cuts is unclear. In the 1990's, the number of New Yorkers between the ages of 35 and 44 is expected to surge by as much as 500,000, depending on how many of them the city holds and attracts. These are people in their prime working -- and tax-paying -- years, but in past decades the city's appeal to this group has been relatively weak.
 
'City Is Very Vulnerable'
 "If the New York economy doesn't snap back and the other regions do, the city is very vulnerable," said Emanuel Tobier, an economics professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University. "The group that is in its prime years and is very mobile and willing to move is the one most affected by changes in the New York economy. It was sucked in in the 1980's, and it will move out again if the economy doesn't revive."
In the 1970's New York City lost 216,000 New Yorkers between the ages of 35 and 44 to migration, or nearly 24 percent. In comparison, it lost 2.7 percent of the 25-to-34 age group and 12.6 percent of the 45-to-54 age group.
In the 1980's, a Port Authority analysis of Census Bureau and birth and death records found, the 35-to-44 age group lost 223,000 members, or nearly 27 percent. Meanwhile, migration bolstered the 25-to-34 age group by 23.1 percent, or 279,000. The 45-to-54 age group was stable and the city's overall population grew.
In the 1990's, the Port Authority believes the net rate of migration for the 35-to-44 age group will remain about the same, but because the group as a whole will be larger due to an aging population, the city will lose an estimated 267,000 members of that group, 44,000 more than the previous decade.
Rosemary Scanlon, the Port Authority's chief economist, said the agency had factored two recessions into its projection, which also calls for continued strong in-migration of 25-to-34-year olds. She called it a "neutral forecast' based on assumptions that the city's job base would stabilize and that the suburbs were filling up. But, she added, "If structural conditions or worries over crime are really serious enough to affect people's location decisions, then this number is not going to hold."
The Port Authority does not break down its migration projections by race. But migration is a major factor in the shifting racial composition of the city's population, which for the first time, the Census Bureau reports, now has a majority comprised of minority groups.
 
Understates the Trend
 In the 1980's, the bureau found, non-Hispanic whites declined by 14.2 percent, to 43.2 percent of the population. Non-Hispanic blacks make up 25.2 percent of the population, Hispanic residents 24.4 percent and non-Hispanic Asians 6.9 percent.
City officials say that the census understates the trend and that its count missed hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, mostly minority-group members.
The migration rate is a function of two forces, people moving in and people moving out. Economic data from the 1980 census, the latest such information available, illustrate the impact the process can have on the city. From 1975 to 1980, about one million New Yorkers moved away and about 645,000 moved in, leaving a gap of 355,000. About 377,000 of those moving out had household incomes of $25,000 or more, but only 172,000 in that income group moved in. So out-migration was substantially higher among the affluent.
Of the one million people moving to New York State during that time, more than 40 percent were from Puerto Rico or abroad. Many of those people, who tended to have lower incomes, settled in New York City. In fact, the only income group for which more people moved into the city than left it had incomes below $10,000.
 
Two-Income Families
 In the long run, New York City's migration patterns will be shaped by the degree to which its faltering economy rebounds. It may also be that the increase in two-income families will slow departures, since those families might have to sacrifice a paycheck, spend twice as much time commuting or find two new jobs instead of one.
In the short run, the real-estate market seems likely to have an influence. The current weak market may trap New Yorkers in hard-to-sell cooperative apartments, while lower housing prices may lure others to the city. Then again, prices have fallen elsewhere, and the drop in mortgage rates may be an added temptation for city renters.
A compilation of out-of-state moves by nine major moving companies by the Household Goods Carrier Bureau, a trade association, appears to document both the soft real-estate market and the city's declining desirability. The number of moves to and from New York City has actually dropped from a peak in 1987, when there were 18,200 moves out and 13,149 moves in. Last year, there were 14,991 moves out and 8,772 moves in. But the ratio of outbound to inbound moves, which was 1.4 to 1 in 1986, stood at 1.7 to 1 by 1990.
The figures generally reflect moves paid for by corporations and more affluent individuals.
 
'More New York License Plates'
 The city's rising ratio of outbound moves suggests that as the housing market becomes more active, out-migration may have more impact. There may already be hints of this.
"There are a lot more New York license plates in our parking lot on the weekends," said Carol Rothe, vice president of the William F. Higgins agency in Hillsdale, N.J. She says New Yorkers are telling her they have decided to skip the next step -- moving to a larger apartment in the city -- and buy a house outside the city.
She could have been describing Mr. Luba, who lived in Manhattan briefly in the mid-80's, then spent two years in Chicago before returning to New York in 1987. He and his wife plan to have a family.
When the sponsor dropped out of the plan to convert their West End Avenue building to condominiums, they realized there was not enough to keep them in a city that Mr. Luba says is so dirty it "embarrasses him."
 
Did Not Want the Risk
 Even so, economics propelled the move to Bergen County. Having seen the effects of the city's slow real-estate market, the Lubas decided they did not want to risk buying a larger apartment and being trapped in it when they wanted to move a few years from now.
"I think it makes very good business sense," Mr. Luba said. "I'm really buying the house for the long term."
In past decades, the suburbs, which offered better schools and room for families to grow, lured people and jobs from the city. But the Household Carrier Association compilation, which did not include moves within New York State, found that in 1990 the states to which New York City residents were most likely to move were Florida and California. Connecticut and New Jersey ranked 12th and 13th, respectively, and migration rates from both those states have also been rising.
Partly because of its loss of middle- and upper-middle-class residents, the city has kept tax rates on one-, two-, and three-family homes down, at least relative to the burdens on commercial property. New York has held on to its middle class better than some other cities, and its economy flourished even after the exodus of the 70's. But now, there is strong pressure to increase property taxes, and business leaders are already complaining about the city's high costs.
New York City, then, is facing both large budget deficits and unhappy choices. Raise taxes on houses and risk alienating homeowners. Raise taxes on commercial property and risk driving out more businesses and jobs. Cut spending and reduce services and risk making the city even less desirable.
A few weeks ago, Vincent Tese, director of economic development for New York State, released a "worry list" of businesses concerned about conditions and costs in the city, including Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley, Prudential-Bache Securities, Bear Stearns and the Paramount Corporation.
"There are a lot of empty buildings here," he said of New York City. "There's a quiet exodus going on."

HEADLINE: Fight to Save Salmon Starts Fight Over Water

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALMON, Idaho, March 27

 BODY:
A shout away from the point on the Continental Divide where Lewis and Clark crested the Rockies in 1805, another of the American West's wonder creatures is about to become extinct.
Like the bison, wolf and grizzly bear before it, the Pacific salmon has all but disappeared from this part of the country. Last year, only a single sockeye salmon made it to the alpine spawning grounds here, 900 river miles inland from the Pacific. 
 This Tuesday, the Federal Government is expected to propose that sockeye salmon and certain other strains of Pacific salmon be listed as endangered or threatened species, setting in motion a process that could affect electricity rates down the West Coast, economic prosperity in Seattle and Portland and growers of some of the nation's most bountiful agricultural crops.
 
Death in Dams' Turbines
 In simplest terms, the issue is water. The Columbia River, the West's biggest river in volume, was once a passageway for up to 16 million salmon a year. Now the river is backed up by a series of dams that deliver the cheapest electrical rates in the country but kill fish in astonishing numbers.
When mature salmon journey from ocean to spawning ground, they use fish ladders built into the dams to climb from low water to high. But young salmon, trying to make it downstream and out to sea, die by the hundreds of thousands in the dam's turbines, or waste away in the slack water behind the dams because there is not enough current to help them along.
The modern Northwest of airplane factories and irrigated orchards was built with power from Columbia River water. To save the salmon, the Columbia would have to behave like a river again, biologists say, and that could be accomplished by allowing water held back by the dams to flush through in a single surge every spring.
 
Symbol of the Northwest
 More than eight million acre feet of water, or enough to flood four Yellowstone Parks to a one-foot depth, would be needed to help flush the fish downstream during the spring migration, the experts say.
But most of that water is already spoken for, by utilities, farmers, water-skiers, cities. The consortium of public utilities that markets power from the Columbia has said electricity rates could rise by up to 33 percent if it has to greatly change the way it uses the dams.
"The salmon is the ultimate symbol of the Pacific Northwest," said Gov. Cecil D. Andrus of Idaho. "These stalwarts have fought all the obstacles we've put before them in order to return to the spawning grounds of their birth. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves if we can't save them."
The inclusion of five salmon species -- the Snake River sockeye, three kinds of upriver chinook, or king, and one downriver coho -- may be proposed for the endangered list. From California through Washington, nearly 200 strains of wild salmon are facing extinction, but the Columbia River salmon, gloried because of their size and importance to the region, are the first to be considered for an endangered designation.
If the designation becomes formal, a process that can take a year, the National Marine Fisheries Services will be able to order changes in dam operations, new limits on fishing or whatever else it may deem necessary to save the salmon. But officials who hope to avoid a drawn-out fight like the one over the northern spotted owl last year have been trying to devise a rescue plan before one is imposed.
 
'It Will Require Sacrifice'
 "Everybody west of the Mississippi who turns on a light switch is in some ways responsible for what happened and may in some ways end up paying for it," said Rolland A. Schmitten, the Western director of the National Marine Fisheries Services. "This doesn't mean we are going to start closing down dams or shutting down the whole West Coast fishery, but it will require sacrifice."
Worldwide, there is no shortage of salmon. Millions of them are raised on farms and are common in markets and restaurants on both coasts.
But what is at stake here are the huge and mysterious wild Pacific salmon, the source of Indian prosperity for nearly 10,000 years, and a fisherman's dream. In a ritual that scientists have yet to fully understand, but one that Indians consider a miracle from God, the fish return from years in the oceans to the cold mountain streams of their birth, where they spawn and die in the very spot where they were born.
It was one Idaho tribe, the Shoshone-Bannock, that set in motion the endangered species process when it petitioned the Government last year. Guaranteed by treaty the right to fish for salmon, the tribe has seen the fishes' numbers dwindle from the thousands to a mere handful -- not even enough for its annual religious ceremony.
 
'Basically Gone' in a Lifetime
 Here on the Continental Divide, the highest point the fish can reach as instinct drives them relentlessly upstream, sometimes to elevations of 7,000 feet, most Pacific salmon have disappeared.
In this town, thousands of miners used to be fed by the returning hordes of fish, which swam up the Columbia and its two big tributaries, the Snake and Salmon Rivers, to get here. Residents can show old pictures of families gathered around a fresh-caught fish as big as a 10-year-old boy.
"It makes me kind of embarrassed to live in a town called Salmon and manage a lake called Redfish when the things they are named for are basically gone," said Jim Lukens, a biologist with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. "In one generation's time, we've managed to nearly kill this species that lived for 10,000 years."
The fish fascinated Lewis and Clark, who wrote glowing accounts of the Indian tribes here living off the wealth of returning salmon runs, as reliable as the seasons.
 
Dams the Biggest Killers
 Most biologists agree that the decline of certain runs of Pacific salmon could have been avoided. Although salmon are overfished in the ocean, taken by Americans off the coast and Japanese drift netters at sea, the biggest killers are the dams, which are operated by the Army Corps of Engineers.
From 1938 to 1975, eight Federal dams were built on the lower Columbia and Snake Rivers. They provide electricity for all the major cities of the Northwest, at a cost 40 percent below the national average. Heavy runoff from the mountains each spring enables the generation of surplus electricity for sale to Southern California, and the backed-up water is diverted to irrigate about 6.5 million acres in the Northwest that would otherwise be barren of fruits or vegetables.
With every new dam that went up, the salmon runs dwindled. Today, most of the Columbia fish come from hatcheries not far from Portland, Ore. But the future of the hatcheries, which propagate the fish by artificial means, is dependent on the variety of the genetic pool, and the wild upstream stocks of chinook and sockeye salmon are in the most trouble.
The policy makers who have been trying to restore fish runs have "been trying to play God, and now they realize they're not too good at it," said Bill Bakke, director of Oregon Trout, a conservation group.
 
Needed: More Water
 The dams, particularly four newer ones on the Snake River, are "a near-perfect fish-killing machine," said Edward Chaney, a resource consultant in Eagle, Idaho. "The fish are trapped by what is arguably the most costly and socially destructive engineering screw-up in the history of mankind."
Ten years ago, Congress ordered the utilities that use the dams to devise a plan for doubling the salmon runs. A billion dollars later, the companies have not met that goal. Some screens have been put up to keep fish out of the turbines. The Corps of Engineers' preferred method of saving fish has been to transport the young salmon downstream by barge or haul them by truck.
But what is really needed, say biologists, is more free-flowing water to strengthen the current in the spring. Before the 1930's, when the river was undammed, it would take a young fish about a week to make the 900-mile journey from Salmon to the sea, Federal studies found. Now, it takes about six weeks, and up to 97 percent of the fish that leave the spawning grounds die before they make it to the mouth of the Columbia.
In Governor Andrus's view, the ideal solution would be to eliminate certain dams. As a State Senator in 1964, he ceremoniously set off an explosion that blew up an obsolete dam in his state. This year, he proposed lowering the reservoirs of four Snake River dams to strengthen the currents. At a recent conference on the salmon problem -- where states, the Federal Government, utilities, fishermen, barge operators and virtually every other entity with an interest in the rivers was represented -- most participants agreed with the Idaho proposal.
 
Corps Stalls One Plan
 But the Corps of Engineers has refused to even test the plan. "There is no question the dams are a big part of the problem," said Wit Anderson, a corps manager on the Columbia River, "but everybody should have to make a sacrifice, not just us." He said the Snake River reservoirs could not be lowered because they were not designed to operate that way.
The corps's reluctance has drawn angry responses. "The Corps of Engineers continues to hide behind a bureaucratic curtain and pretend that it has no responsibility to change the very operations which are killing these fish," said Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon. "I hope the decision makers in the Corps of Engineers wake up and realize that time is running out." The next migration begins in April.
Compared with the fight over the spotted owl, there has been very little opposition to saving salmon. Surveys and public hearings suggest that a large majority of people are willing to make some sacrifice to bring back the wild fish that used to swim in nearly every western-draining stream in the Northwest.
"This great river here is called the Salmon," said Gary Power, an Idaho Fish and Game biologist. "I hope the name doesn't become Our Mistake."

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Confidence and Will

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The Economist of London reports on the United States with more care and insight than any other foreign journal -- or most American papers. When it analyzes a large subject, it speaks with the sympathy of a friend but the detachment of a realist.
In the current issue The Economist has an extended article on blacks in America. It summarizes its conclusions in this statement: 
 "America is riding high on a wave of post-Gulf confidence, but one part of the country is still missing out: the poverty-ridden ghettos where millions of black Americans live. George Bush cannot afford to ignore them."
During the Persian Gulf war, some of us wondered aloud why it was that the United States could bring so much energy and commitment to war and so little, comparatively, to domestic problems. A President who had fumbled or avoided challenges at home was utterly decisive in the gulf conflict. An inert public became engaged.
Such comment was dismissed on the political right as the thinking of wimps or sob-sisters. But it is not so easy thus to dismiss The Economist, a magazine with a conservative outlook that expressed few doubts about the war.
The survey of black America begins with some statistics. They are familiar but still chilling.
The unemployment rate for blacks last year was 10.5 percent, twice that of whites. The leading cause of death among young black men in America is murder. By the official definition of poverty, 43 percent of black children are born poor. Two-thirds of black babies are born to unmarried mothers.
There is also a great black success story. In the last 30 years a black middle class has developed, growing from a tenth to more than a third of the black population.
The Economist does not explore how that happened, but it was undoubtedly the result at least in part of the removal of racial barriers. Blacks are welcome now in law firms and banks and other places where they were hardly ever seen before.
But while a middle class has grown, the picture has not improved at the lower end of the scale. About a third of all blacks live below the poverty line, a proportion unchanged for 20 years. An underclass made up in considerable part of blacks lives in decayed areas of America's inner cities.
One feature of ghetto life has grown strikingly worse in the last generation. The old Harlem had among its residents lawyers and businessmen and other leading figures: role models for the young and poor. Now they have virtually all left for desegregated middle-class neighborhoods.
That point was first made to me by Roger Wilkins, who contrasted growing up among authentic leaders as he did with the hopelessness and crime that are pervasive today. The Economist quotes William Julius Wilson of the University of Chicago to the same effect.
Poor inner-city neighborhoods, Professor Wilson says, now lack even the basic social models of responsibility and work. There are few jobs available, and vogue ideas such as enterprise zones seem to have little lasting effect.
The ghettos are a world apart, its young people growing up physically and psychologically separated from the American mainstream. But they deeply affect that mainstream, the quality of urban life, the economics of our cities and states. We are all in the same country.
Liberal and conservative Americans, white and black, probably agree more than they realize now on how to approach the daunting problems of the ghetto. Most would put more emphasis on jobs and job training and work incentives. Most would reject the ideas of black separatism. Most would do more for the health of poor children, and for their education in ways that work, like Head Start.
Why, then, is there no national commitment to fight the ills of the ghetto and the underclass? It cannot just be a shortage of money; we found money for the gulf war. It cannot be that wars have more definite objectives and neater endings; we are finding out in Iraq what a delusion that is.
No, the reason we do so little about our greatest domestic problem is a lack of political will: of courage. Perhaps our political leaders can take advice better from a friend abroad. Here is the way the Economist article ends:
"The slums in America's great cities are shameful. They are a damning indictment of the richest country in the world. The problems that fester in them are not peripheral; they constitute America's main domestic challenge today. . . .
"George Bush could now cash in on the country's post-war confidenceby launching another war on the black home-front. America cannot afford to let down its blacks for much longer."

HEADLINE: Price Fixing Isn't Always Gouging

 BODY:
Should a manufacturer ever be allowed to stop a retailer from cutting prices? No, said the Supreme Court in 1911, declaring any such attempts automatically illegal. No, say many consumers, fearing the demise of their favorite discounter.
But over the past decade many economists, and lately the Supreme Court, have come to a different conclusion: Minimum prices imposed by manufacturers -- known as vertical price restraints -- can sometimes help consumers by encouraging dealers to provide valuable information and services. 
 In two decisions during the 1980's, the Supreme Court ruled that efforts by manufacturers to prevent price cuts by dealers were not always illegal; in some circumstances, the question of whether the practice discriminated against the consumer was to be answered on a case-by-case basis.
Senator Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat, is pushing a bill that would again make vertical price restraints illegal in virtually every case. At one time this page favored Mr. Metzenbaum's bill. But recent studies suggest that a blanket prohibition could be legislative overkill.
Vertical price restraints can be anti-consumer when rival dealers conspire to fix prices and use manufacturer-imposed price restraints to enforce the deal. Price restraints can also be used by rival manufacturers jointly to keep prices high. But these practices aren't common and would violate the antitrust laws with or without the Metzenbaum bill.
If manufacturers were trying to jack up prices, they wouldn't ordinarily use vertical price restraints. All they would need to do is charge all their dealers more. The purpose of vertical price restraints is to encourage better service to customers.
Buyers of products like computers and cameras need advice and information before making the purchase. Dealers who provide that service do so at considerable expense and risk. Consumers, educated for free, are then tempted to make the actual purchase, for a bare-bones price, from discounters who provide no such information. That can drive full-service dealers out of the market.
Manufacturers can help full-service dealers -- to the extent the law allows -- by prohibiting price cutting. That leaves dealers no other option than to compete for customers with better service. Yet not many manufacturers sell products that require extensive pre-sale services; most will continue to profit from sales to discount stores.
Mr. Metzenbaum argues for a blanket prohibition because a case-by-case review of vertical price restraints would be too impractical. Customers would not suffer, he claims, because the bill would not forbid manufacturers from requiring all dealers to provide information and marketing services. But case-by-case review of such non-price restraints would be every bit as difficult, probably harder.
Discounters have thrived despite the Supreme Court rulings. The system isn't broke; consumers aren't threatened. There are, however, circumstances when manufacturers have legitimate grounds for protecting full-service dealers. They should have the right.

HEADLINE: New York Can Handle Cuts Better Than Taxes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New York State and City are running in place on their budget gaps, you report (news article, March 19). You quote "analysts" as saying -- straightforwardly, I would add -- that there is no comprehensive strategy for dealing with the budget crisis. On the contrary, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget makes difficult choices that nevertheless leave the essence of the state enterprise intact. 
 Yet some of the arguments that have crept into the debate are more insidious, masquerading as one thing and actually promoting an entirely different agenda. For example, the Citizens Budget Commission manages to sound responsible on the surface, but read carefully, its arguments show the bias of a group that is essentially anchored in Manhattan and does not represent the interests of the entire state. When Charles Brecher, research director for the commission, states, "Solving the Governor's budget problem with aid cuts is simply passing the problem onto the city and other localities," and "We should be shifting more of the tax burden onto a statewide basis," the real message is: let the rest of the state help keep New York City's real estate taxes down.
It's important to remember that any strategy raising broad-based income, sales and business taxes would damage the state's competitiveness in the long run, and on top of city taxes, would be particularly ruinous for New York City. Even with the cuts proposed by the Governor in his budget, New York will remain among the top five states in school spending; it will continue to have one of the best and most affordable systems of higher education in the country, and it will continue to be the most generous state in the country with total assistance to the arts.
The proposed spending cuts are painful, but the alternative of increasing broad-based taxes is downright dangerous.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rose Broadly in Quarter

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The stock market just completed one of its strongest quarters since 1980. Investors, who stood on the sidelines after Iraq invaded Kuwait, gleefully dived back into the equity markets in the first quarter, which ended last week, after the American-led assault in the gulf seemed a success.
"This was the fourth-best quarter in the last 11 years," said Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of the Wall Street research house Birinyi Associates. "Given the kind of breadth, momentum and other indicators we have seen, you are not talking about a short-term or trading rally -- you are talking about a sustained market rise." 
 While a number of investment strategists do not believe that Wall Street's bears have been driven away by a stampede of bulls, there is a strong sense among traders and other experts that the market may have bottomed out amid the tension preceeding the Persian Gulf war.
 
Widespread Gains
 The rise was almost everywhere. Of the 3,604 stocks tracked by Media General Financial Services, 3,029 were up in the first quarter, while 480 were down and 95 were unchanged.
New York Stock Exchange issues were a strong beneficiary. Media General said that among the Big Board stocks on its list, 1,272 were up, with 165 down and 22 unchanged. The over-the-counter market also did well, with 1,400 stocks higher at the end of the quarter, 259 lower and 64 unchanged.
The performance of issues on the American Stock Exchange was similar. Media General said 357 issues on the Amex rose while 56 issues fell and 9 were unchanged.
But unlike many winners of the last decade, the gainers' success stemmed more from the fundamentals of the companies than from potential takeovers.
"The most pleasant aspect of the market's performance is that companies once again are being valued on their worth as performers, as operating companies, rather than on their vulnerability to a leveraged buyout or a takeover," said Jack A. Sullivan, a principal with Van Kasper & Company, a San Francisco-based investment bank and brokerage. "Good company performances are being rewarded no matter what the sector, and that is a very pleasant and healthy sign. At the same time, bad performances are being punished, and that also is a healthy sign."
Several trends emerged. A number of companies benefited either directly from business from the gulf war or from perceptions that they would get business because of the conflict.
Another trend was the rapid growth in companies involved in health care, including the top five performers on the American Stock Exchange. The gains reflected the generally frothy trading in health-care issues. While there were only 28 initial public offerings in the quarter, 5, totaling $112.9 million, were for health-care concerns, according to the Securities Data Company.
The big winner on the New York Stock Exchange was a retail company that survived the takeover battles of the 1980's. Venture Stores, once a division of the May Department Stores Company, operates more than 75 retail discount stores in the Midwest. The company has benefited from a trend toward discount stores, and its sales increased 10 percent in February compared with February 1990.
Despite the company's strong fundamentals, much of the gain came in a flurry of trading last week. Company officials said they had no corporate news to account for the advance.
One winner from the Persian Gulf war was Martech USA Inc., which provides a range of environmental cleanup services. The company, based in Anchorage, is known for its oil-spill response services. After the huge spill in the Persian Gulf, speculation swept the marketplace that the company could get contracts for cleanup work. The predictions proved correct.
The biggest loser on the Big Board was Laidlaw Inc., a solid-waste-services company that was hit by a flurry of bad news in the quarter. In March, company executives said that earnings for the second quarter would likely decline by more than 50 percent from the 1990 period, partly because of a slowing economy.
But Laidlaw, based in Burlington, Ontario, had other serious problems. Its waste-management subsidiary was accused of uncompetitive business practices by the Canadian Government. Canada's Bureau of Competition Policy said the contracts in question were unenforceable.
At the same time, Donald Jackson, president of Laidlaw, was reported to be facing civil charges of breach of trust. Trimac Ltd., based in Calgary, Alberta, was said to be suing Mr. Jackson for $20 million (Canadian), or $17.2 million (United States), for his handling of the 1986 sale of Trimac's waste-management subsidiary to Laidlaw.
At the American Stock Exchange, the biggest winner for the quarter was Medco Research Inc., a Los Angeles-based drug research and development company. Medco, which moved to the Amex from the over-the-counter market during the quarter, introduced a drug that it hopes will be used to replace cardiac treadmill tests for some heart patients, Medco also expects its first European sales this fall.
In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company showed that the rise in price occurred even as two corporate insiders were selling a combined total of more than 70,000 shares in the company.
Also, at the beginning of the quarter the company reported that the S.E.C. was conducting an informal fact-finding inquiry into the trading of Medco's stock on the over-the-counter market. In the filing, Medco said it had also asked the S.E.C. to investigate the activities of short sellers of the company's stock. Short sellers sell borrowed stock in anticipation of buying back an equal number of shares later at a lower price, thus making a profit. The filing did not elaborate on either inquiry.
 
A Biotech Winner
 The American exchange's biggest loser was Winthrop Insured Mortgage Investors II, a limited partnership, which agreed during the quarter to sell all of its remaining assets. The assets, six federally insured mortgages, were purchased from the partnership by the First Boston Corporation. The sale will result in a distribution of cash to shareholders, and the fund will be terminated.
On the over-the-counter market, the biggest winner was again a company in the health-care industry, Interpharm Laboratories Ltd. That Israeli company develops and produces biotechnology products for the health-care industry. The company showed strong earnings at the end of last year, compared with a loss in 1989.
The strong performance was spurred by penetration for its products in Italy. Also, the use of a new growth hormone manufactured by Interpharm, which is used in children with hormonal deficiencies, has soared in recent months.
Perhaps the biggest mystery of the quarter involved a company that was one of the biggest losers on the over-the-counter market. The Y & A Group, a St. Louis-based engineering concern specializing in electric utilities, saw its stock tumble when its president and chief executive, Malcolm Cheek, disappeared in March.
The disappearance, which prompted an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, came three days before the company disclosed that it expected a loss of $7 million for 1990, including $1 million of nonrecurring costs and up to $4 million of write-offs. The company had been profitable in 1989.
The news at Y & A came after the company decided in October to dismiss Deloitte & Touche as its independent accounting firm. In December, the firm hired KPMG Peat Marwick as its auditor.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 3, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about the performance of stocks in the first quarter misapplied The Times's guidelines in citing two stocks among the worst performers on the American Stock Exchange.
The prices of both Winthrop Insured Mortgage L.P. and GW Utilities fell because of extraordinary dividend payments, and investors in the companies did not suffer large losses. The Times's practice is to take such large payouts into account, removing companies from the lists.

Uneasy Caribbean Islands Warm to Motherlands

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORANJESTAD, Aruba

 BODY:
In 1986, this small, scrubby island just off the coast of Venezuela broke away from an association of self-administered Dutch Caribbean possessions and confidently set out on a path expected to lead to full independence within 10 years.
But five years later, for all their satisfaction in having their own Governor, Prime Minister and flag, few among Aruba's 68,000 mostly prosperous residents, including the leaders of the governing party, now say they are prepared to see their island leave the Kingdom of the Netherlands in a final step toward complete autonomy. 
 Aruba's reluctance to become fully independent, far from an isolated case, reflects a sharp change in attitudes that has swept the Caribbean region, where the greatest number of the world's remaining nonindependent territories are clustered.
In all of the region's remaining European dependencies, including Aruba and its five former sister islands of the Netherlands Antilles, and Britain's six remaining islands, the cry for independence, for decades an unquestioned goal in third-world politics, has given way to an open desire to remain somehow attached to a colonizing power.
"What we are witnessing is the unraveling of a whole mental mindset," said Anthony P. Maingot, an expert on Caribbean politics at Florida International University in Miami. "Independence was once looked at in a linear way, with the assumption that everyone would seek it. Now, rather than a birthright, people are seeing it as a remedial right used to redress specific grievances like racism or oppression, and clearly not everyone out there wants it."
 
Idea 'Has Become Pretty Old'
 In the French departments of Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana, whose incorporation by Paris in 1946 once faced loud, sporadically violent opposition, powerful independence movements have also lost much of their steam.
"The idea of independence has become pretty old here," said Jean-Pierre Chardon, a professor of geography and economics at the University of the Antilles and Guiana, in Martinique. "No one demands independence with any violence or urgency anymore."
While advocates of independence remain active in many of those islands, almost everywhere in recent years their cause has become politically unpopular. In many cases, the only remaining pressure for independence these days is the discreet, occasional prodding of colonial administrators in London and The Hague eager to trim expenses, which has provoked stiff resistance from their possessions.
"The British Virgin Islands will not be bullied, provoked, coerced or sweet-mouthed into independence," Ralph T. O'Neal, deputy chief minister for labor, said at a United Nations conference on decolonization last year in Barbados, capturing the mood of many islands that are not independent.
 
Some Expenses Are Spared
 For each of the French departments in this hemisphere, it has been estimated that well over half of all revenues come through Government employment or aid.
Like the Dutch dependencies, all of the British territories are spared expenses in areas like defense, education and anti-drug efforts by extensive cooperation programs with the colonizing power.
Diplomats in Britain say some of its dependencies, like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, have per capita incomes that rival many developed countries and receive no direct financial aid. Others, like the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla, receive modest financial support.
The United States Senate recently killed a bill that would have authorized a referendum on the future of Puerto Rico, allowing the people there to choose between statehood and continued Commonwealth status -- according to opinion polls, the two most popular options -- or independence. Opinion surveys in the neighboring United States Virgin Islands, an unincorporated territory, have suggested that support for outright independence there is weak too.
Faced with the uncertainties common to thinly diversified economies and wary of threats as varied as takeover by drug cartels or violent coup attempts, residents of many islands throughout the region see continuing close ties with the colonizer as a bulwark against instability and decay.
The experience of Aruba, which last year successfully lobbied the Netherlands to cancel an agreement that would have automatically led to independence in 1996, reflects that of many of the region's territories.
Shortly after breaking away from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986, the island's leading employer, an Exxon oil refinery, closed, suddenly depriving Aruba of about half of its income. While the island has largely recovered by aggressively promoting tourism, its brush with insolvency created lasting doubts about going it alone in the world.
 
Close to the Ideal
 For the left-leaning Aruban Government, which already enjoys broad autonomy over political and fiscal matters, leaving responsibility for foreign affairs, defense and judiciary appeals to the Dutch approaches the ideal.
"To put it as simply as possible, we would like for the time being for things to remain as they are," said Franklin Oduber, the spokesman for the Aruban Government and brother of the Prime Minister. "I don't think many Arubans are anxious to get rid of the Dutch."
In Britain's seven remaining possessions in the region, including Bermuda, which is in the Atlantic Ocean, north of the Caribbean, independence movements have also fizzled.
Tony Thorndike, a Caribbean expert and chairman of the department of international affairs and politics at Staffordshire Polytechnic in England, said the remaining British dependencies "look at the post-independence experience of the surrounding islands, like Grenada, with its revolutionary violence, and Antigua, which is scandal-ridden, and don't particularly like what they see."
"Seek ye first the political kingdom has become rather passe," he said.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Too, Auto Sales Sag

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 1

 BODY:
Executives of Europe's major car manufacturers speak of the Germans these days with reverence, and for good reason: The booming German market is all that separates the European car industry from disaster.
Those who speak most reverently are executives of Volkswagen A.G. and the General Motors Corporation, whose companies are the strongest there. But with sagging markets elsewhere, those companies depending on the rest of Western Europe for most of their sales are threatened with a tough, if not terrible, year. 
 Industry executives expect 1991 car sales to fall by a range of 400,000 to 600,000, to about 12.9 million, for the first decline since 1984. Weakness was already evident last year, when sales rose by just 20,000, although the total of 13.42 million was a record. Excluding eastern German sales of 200,000, the count would have been off 1.6 percent.
 
Further Drop in Profits
 Price-cutting has hurt profits. Philip N. Ayton, an analyst at London-based Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd., estimates that the combined European income of the Big Six producers -- Volkswagen, Fiat, Peugeot, General Motors, Ford and Renault -- fell by 27 percent in 1990, to $6.07 billion. "Profits could drop by 35 to 40 percent more this year," he said.
Car sales outside Germany fell 15 percent for the first two months of the year. "Margins are under pressure," said Giuseppe Perlo, vice president for marketing and product development at Fiat.
Profits from Europe are crucial for General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, which are expected to have huge losses in the United States this year. General Motors Europe reported record net income of $1.91 billion last year, ousting Ford as the fourth-largest seller of cars there. Ford of Europe -- plagued by a weak British market, strikes, a rough introduction for its new Escort and a loss of about 50 million ($96 million) at its Jaguar unit -- saw its net income plunge by nearly 88 percent last year, to $145 million.
Some analysts expect Ford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars this year. But L. Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, predicts his division will earn more than in 1990. "I don't expect any phenomenal surge in finances, but I expect it to be a better year," he said.
Mr. Halstead said Ford remained committed to Jaguar's ambitious plans to develop new models, although Jaguar executives said they would delay some capital expenditures rather than ask Ford for more money.
G.M. is faring better, helped by a 17.9 percent market share in Germany last year that was second only to Volkswagen's 26.8 percent. Of the six major car makers in Western Europe, "we and Volkswagen are the only people whose factories are running full out," said Robert J. Eaton, president of General Motors Europe. G.M.'s two major European brands are Opel on the Continent and Vauxhall in Britain.
 
Saab Drain on G.M.
 With orders for more than 300,000 cars in Germany, G.M. executives hope to have nearly as good a year in Western Europe as in 1990, when they sold a record 1.6 million cars.
Mr. Eaton hesitated to predict higher earnings this year, but said that Saab Automobile A.B. would "very definitely not" drain G.M. as much as in 1990. G.M.'s half-ownership of the floundering Swedish company reduced G.M. Europe's earnings by $430 million last year.
Total new car sales in Germany, which totaled nearly 3.3 million in 1990, are now zipping along at an annual rate of 3.8 million to 4 million, said Louis R. Hughes, chairman of G.M.'s Opel division.
The German market's strength comes from monetary union and reunification, which allowed former East Germans to convert their savings into West German marks and buy Western cars. Although few eastern Germans can afford new cars, they have been snapping up used cars from western Germans, who, in turn, are buying new cars with a passion. The small Volkswagen Golf hatchback and G.M.'s small Opel Kadett are the nation's two biggest sellers.
Volkswagen's chairman, Carl Hahn, said his company had a five-to-six-month backlog of orders in Germany and had been increasing VW's share of several other markets. "It is always dangerous to forecast, but I daresay that our production to the end of the year is already sold," he said.
The German market is expected to cool in the second half of the year, a result of tax increases and rising unemployment in eastern Germany. By then, car executives hope for a rebound in the rest of Western Europe that will continue into 1992.
Executives hope the Persian Gulf war's end will bolster consumer confidence. "The gulf war had a dramatic effect on sales," said Frederic Saint-Geours, deputy director general of the Peugeot car division of France's Peugeot S.A. Executives also hope that high interest rates in Britain, Spain, Sweden and other nations will continue their recent declines.
 
Sales Plunge Not Ruled Out
 Some analysts are far more pessimistic. John Lawson, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd., said this year could turn into a catastrophe. Sales could plunge by 9 percent, or 1.2 million cars, he said. "Normally a drop of 6 or 7 percent is as bad as it gets," he said.
Even if other, weaker markets do rebound, it may come too late for those heavily dependent on markets outside Germany. Fiat, Peugeot, Ford, Renault, Volvo and Jaguar have all announced or begun production cuts, affecting more than 130,000 workers. Analysts predict lower earnings or large losses.
Many of these companies are also suffering from increased sales by the Japanese, who have more than 10 percent of the market. Toyota and Nissan have plants in Britain, while Ford and Mazda have formed a partnership to produce cars in Germany.
Outside Germany, car companies are battling for customers with rebates, low- and even no-interest loans and free optional equipment. And analysts say these wars could intensify as those who have been reluctant to join the fray decide they have no choice.
 
Fiat's Uncertain Fate
 "We had been very cautious on incentives but we recently decided to be more aggressive not only in Spain, France and Italy but everywhere in Europe," said Patrick Bessy, a Renault spokesman.
Industry executives and analysts continue to wonder whether Fiat, which has held merger talks over the years with a slew of major car makers, will be able to survive alone for long. The Italian company depends heavily on its home market, which accounts for 60 to 70 percent of its car sales.
While the Japanese are limited by quotas that allowed them only 2.1 percent of the Italian market last year, others are attacking. Fiat's share has sunk to about 48 percent, from 60 percent four years ago.
It also remains to be seen whether Volvo's alliance and cross investments with the larger Renault will enable both to survive independently. The share of the West European car market held by Renault, the state-controlled French company, dropped below 10 percent last year, as its worldwide earnings plunged 87 percent, to 1.21 billion francs ($236 million), from a record 9.29 billion francs ($1.61 billion) in 1989.
Volvo, hurt by the high costs of concentrating its plants in Sweden, is weaker, competitors say. Heavily dependent, like Saab, on the depressed American, British and Swedish markets, Volvo's car operations lost 855 million kronor ($149.5 million) last year and the division plans to cut its work force by 15 percent, or 4,500 people.
Many companies worry that their best days are past. Virtually everyone is optimistic that the unification of the European market will stimulate demand and that Eastern Europeans will eventually buy far more western cars.
But many in the industry say that everyone is invading everyone else's turf. Competition, capacity expansions and mounting Japanese ambitions in Europe could prevent the Big Six auto makers from enjoying the benefits of a growing market.
"I feel we are about to be bottoming out but we are quite hesitant to predict what kind of recovery there will be," said Dan Werbin, a Volvo executive vice president.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Hospital Pacts With Specialists

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
STATE courts have been redefining the professional rights of specialist physicians who have been barred from hospital facilities when their exclusive contracts were ended. The hospitals have usually prevailed but some state courts have sided with the doctors.
Hospital executives say they have the right, like any business, to award or cancel exclusive franchises for services, typically to run hospital operations like laboratories, X-ray facilities and emergency rooms. But the doctors say they, too, have rights, under the medical staff bylaws adopted by hospitals, which govern the appointments and professional activities of doctors in hospitals. 
 The court cases have pitted radiologists, anesthesiologists, pathologists and emergency room physicians against hospitals seeking to increase their share of the lucrative revenues that flow to the specialists. Until the mid-1980's, these physicians were usually employees of the hospitals. But then most hospitals encouraged them to become independent contractors as a business tactic, when the Federal Medicare program changed the basis of paying for hospital care.
Dr. Howard L. Lang, chairman of the hospital medical staff section of the American Medical Association, said physicians were increasingly concerned about hospitals that used economic criteria in deciding whether to let doctors use their facilities. Dr. Lang, a Greenbrae, Calif., obstetrician and gynecologist, said some hospitals even seemed to be refusing credentials to doctors viewed as poor business prospects because they had too many elderly or poor patients.
In other cases, hospitals have cut off doctors who compete with the hospital for patients at outside clinics and other hospitals, which the doctors sometimes own.
In one closely watched case, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled last month against the Republic Health Corporation, a hospital chain based in Dallas. Republic had barred David Alfredson, a radiologist, from using diagnostic equipment in the Lewisburg Community Hospital, where he had worked under contract from 1981 to 1985.
The court said the hospital ended Dr. Alfredson's exclusive radiology agreement "without cause" on Jan. 1, 1986. The court held that the hospital had violated Dr. Alfredson's contract because it had "significantly reduced" his ability to work in the hospital without granting him a hearing as required under the medical staff bylaws.
Peggy Taylor, one of Dr. Alfredson's lawyers, said last week that the doctor would seek damages for the years he was barred from working in the hospital. Although the Republic Health chain only recently emerged from bankruptcy hearings, Ms. Taylor said that both Lewisburg and the hospital had prospered because of the new Saturn automobile plant in nearby Spring Hill.
Jeffrey D. Moseley, a lawyer for the Lewisburg Community Hospital, said the decision "really undercut" the institution's ability to make "a business judgment." And Frederick Entin, the general counsel of the American Hospital Association, said the Tennessee case "tells all hospitals and their attorneys to be careful" when they draft exclusive agreements with doctors.
Thomas W. Greeson, a lawyer with the American College of Radiology, a professional group that supported Dr. Alfredson, said state court decisions had been split over whether the medical staff bylaws protected a doctor, whose livelihood might be threatened by the loss of access he or she formerly had to a hospital facility.
Indeed, the Ohio Supreme Court recently declined to hear the case of a doctor barred from the emergency room at Good Samaritan Hospital in Dayton after his contract there was not renewed. Thomas Knoth, a lawyer for the hospital, said most courts had held in such cases that the medical staff bylaws applied mainly to questions of professional competence or misconduct, not to business arrangements with doctors.
In other recent cases, a New York court dismissed a lawsuit against Winthrop-University Hospital, in Mineola, L.I., that was brought by a group of Great Neck radiologists whose exclusive contract had been ended. And a group of California anesthesiologists lost their suit seeking reinstatement and damages from the Fresno Community Hospital and Medical Center.
In Florida, lawyers for American Medical International, a hospital chain based in Los Angeles, will go before an appeals court in West Palm Beach later this month to try to overturn a $19 million jury award to Dr. Zbigniew Scheller, a pathologist. He sued the hospital company when his contract, which granted him a percentage of laboratory receipts, was not renewed.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.N. Council Closer to Approving Iraq Resolution

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 1

 BODY:
The Security Council moved closer today to approving a tough new resolution that could officially end the gulf war later this week and allow the withdrawal of all remaining allied forces from southern Iraq, Western diplomats said.
The central question in its negotiations, however, is whether Iraq will accept onerous military and economic conditions in the American-sponsored draft of the resolution. 
 The United States appears to have the nine votes needed to approve the measure, these diplomats say. But the proposed resolution provides for a formal truce only after President Saddam Hussein of Iraq agrees to be bound by all its provisions.
Tonight, the United States representative to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, said the Council could vote on the resolution as soon as Tuesday. But Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar predicted that the final vote would come Thursday.
 
Iraqi Is Hardly Pleased
 Iraq's United Nations representative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, described the draft as "very objectionable," saying there is "a limit to the amount of coercion one country can apply to another." But he added that only the highest Iraqi leadership could decide what the nation's attitude will be if the Council adopts the resolution.
Asked what would happen if Iraq refuses to obey the resolution, Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, said trade sanctions would remain in force "doing great and continuing damage to Iraq," but he made no prediction as to whether the allied forces would go home.
The resolution requires the Baghdad Government to destroy its most dangerous chemical and biological weapons and to compensate Kuwait for the damage its forces caused, while continuing to ban all sales of arms and dangerous military technology to Iraq for the indefinite future.
 
Food and Other Essentials
 It allows Iraq to start selling oil on the world market again, but earmarks an unspecified portion of these earnings for war reparations. And it continues to ban all nonessential imports like cars and television sets until the Council is satisfied with "the policies and practices of the Iraqi Government, including implementation of all relevant resolutions of the Security Council."
The draft allows Iraq to freely import food, promises rapid approval of requests to send other items for humanitarian purposes, and says that even before oil sanctions are fully lifted, Iraq may sell enough to pay for such essential imports.
The United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- the five permanent Council members with a veto on decisions -- have already agreed to this tough draft, although it is unclear whether China will vote in favor or abstain.
Iraq has accepted all previous Security Council demands, agreeing to return stolen Kuwaiti property, send back prisoners of war and detainees, and accept financial liability for the damage caused by its invasion. But it did so at least in part because it wanted to stop the fighting.
While acceptance of the draft resolution's terms will bring an immediate cease-fire, ending any possibility that the allies might intervene to support the Iraqi rebels fighting in both the north and south of the country, it requires Iraq to accept a disputed 1963 border agreement it made with Kuwait before the United Nations would sendits peacekeepers and the allied forces would withdraw.
 
Frequent Review Process
 The Council will review the ban on civilian supplies every 60 days in the light of Iraq's policies.
While no one seriously doubts that the draft will be adopted, some objections have been raised.
On Sunday, for instance, the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram, which sometimes reflects Government policy, criticized the provision requiring Iraq to destroy its special weapons, saying this should happen only in the framework of a general agreement to rid the entire region of such arms.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges by 32.67 to Close at 2,881.19

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices sank yesterday in sluggish trading as investors expressed concern that the economy was sagging badly.
The smaller stocks performed considerably better than the rest of the market. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 32.67 points, or a bit more than 1 percent, to 2,881.19, and a broader measure, the Standard & Poor's 500, dropped about the same.
Two measurements of smaller stocks, the Nasdaq composite index and the American Stock Exchange's market-value index, slid about a third as much.
 
Trading Falls Off
 Trading fell yesterday to 144 million shares, down from an anemic 150.8 million on Thursday, the previous trading session; the exchanges were closed on Good Friday. Declines led advances about 5 to 3, and while 2 stocks dropped to new lows, 75 reached new highs.
One was United States Surgical, a producer of surgical staplers, which rose 4 1/2, to a new high of 115 3/4, after Kurt Kruger of Hambrecht & Quist recommended the stock. Robert Goldman of Dean Witter Reynolds had recommended it earlier.
Showing that the smaller stocks were holding up extremely well for the most part, even in a down market, the Russell 2000, the small-stock index, fell only four-tenths of a percent, to 170.31, down 0.69.
While new highs set during the day, rather than at the close, are not recognized for record-keeping purposes, the Russell index rose to a 1991 new high during the day, at 171.02. It had ended the Thursday session at a new high of 171.01.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said heavy computer-driven selling lopped nearly 14 points off the Dow blue chips.
Hugh Johnson, chief strategist for the First Albany Corporation, attributed the market's slide largely to the economic index released yesterday by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The group reported that the index of economic activity rose to 40 percent last month from 38.5 percent in February.
Mr. Johnson called the figure "not particularly encouraging."
H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist for Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, said the index's first-quarter average of 38.7 was "consistent with a deep recession," though he added that he did not think the economy was in a deep recession.
Signs of a weak economy would typically be good for the stock market, prompting the Federal Reserve to pump money into banks to lower interest rates and strengthen the economy. But Mr. Heinemann argued that the purchasing managers' index by itself "is not going to have much influence on Fed policy." He maintained that the Fed would be "more apt to respond to a sharp decline in March employment, if there is one." The employment rate will be reported on Friday.
Mr. Heinemann said the Fed "has been moving very slowly and cautiously to date and hasn't done a great deal to counter the recession."
He added: "With the exception of today, the dollar has been extremely strong, suggesting that the dollar is in relatively short supply. If dollars were plentiful, they wouldn't be going up so rapidly. That's confirming evidence that money's not that easy yet."
 
Gains for Gold
 Gold prices jumped $3.30 an ounce yesterday, lifting gold shares broadly, if only a little. ASA Ltd., which has big South African interests, rose 1 1/8, to 45 5/8.
Chemicals, drugs, insurance, food and technology all posted large declines.
Digital Equipment slumped 4 1/4 in heavy trading, to 63 7/8, after analysts trimmed their earnings estimates. The computer maker said the recession had hurt its business.
I.B.M., which said last week that it would eliminate 14,000 jobs, fell 1 5/8, to 112 1/4, also in heavy trading, after IBM Japan Ltd. said profits fell 18.8 percent last year.
CBS fell 3 1/2, to 162 1/4, after The Wall Street Journal said the network might lay off 400 to 500 people. Time Warner slid 4, to 103 3/4, although except for the market's general weakness there did not appear to be news to account for the drop.
Mr. Johnson of First Albany said the purchasing managers' report suggested that the economy not only did poorly last month but had also continued to be weak.
He said the rise in stocks over the last few months had "promised us a recovery in the economy and in earnings." But, he added, "if you're looking for signs of a recovery, you probably won't find it -- and that's a little troubling."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Cutbacks by Network News Ground Bush's Press Plane

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
In a symbol of the financial retrenchment taking place throughout the network news business, the press plane covering the President of the United States was canceled by the White House for a trip last weekend after the networks significantly reduced their staffing on the Presidential fishing vacation.
Joe Peyronnin, the vice president of CBS News, called it "a sign of the times in network television." 
The cancellation of the press flight was the latest example of changes and reductions in news coverage at the networks, much of which are coming in reaction to enormous budget deficits rolled up by the news divisions during the war in the Persian Gulf, from both the cost of the coverage and the loss of advertising revenue during special broadcasts.
Each of the network news divisions has undergone a thorough review of staffing and capital expenditures in the wake of the losses, NBC alone estimated its losses at $55 million. Layoffs of correspondents and other news employees are expected to be announced in the next several weeks, especially at CBS, which is facing companywide budget cuts that one senior network executive said would total $150 million.
Next week, the networks will begin a monthlong cost-cutting experiment with CNN in pooling camera crews covering the President's daily activities. That pooling will extend to at least some of the President's travel schedule. Although CNN is planning to expand its worldwide coverage, it too is looking for ways to hold down spending.
The television news organizations decided independently last week that the President's weekend fishing trip to Isla Morada, Fla., could be covered by a greatly reduced staff using a pool crew. That decision indirectly led to the cancellation Friday of the charter flight of reporters that traditionally accompanies the President when he travels out of Washington. A representative of the White House travel office said it was the first time the press plane had been canceled in the 30 years he had helped schedule those flights.
The three broadcast networks have already cut the size of their news staffs by several hundred people each in the last five years and have reduced the number of their domestic and foreign bureaus. NBC News, for example, which had 1,362 staff members in 1986, is now down to 1,033, despite having more news programs on the air. And ABC, the leading network news division, has closed domestic bureaus in Boston, Chicago and Dallas and foreign bureaus in Frankfurt, Prague and Budapest -- consolidating them into one bureau in Berlin.
"It's all part of the same picture," Mr. Peyronnin said. "It is all a matter of economically prudent management trying to spend its dollars in a cost-effective way."
But Steve Friedman, the executive producer of the "NBC Nightly News," said. "We're doing this to save money, yes, but our role is changing, too. We're not in the overall killer-coverage business anymore. We're in the program business."
 
'One Picture of Bush'
 Mr. Friedman said the networks would increasingly cover stories based on the needs of specific news programs and less as a means of insuring that every event had a separate network presence. "We all had the one picture of Bush fishing in Florida if anybody wanted to use it," Mr. Friedman said.
Another senior network news executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the trip was not expected to make news. "This was a dog trip anyway," he said. "Nobody wanted to go on it." The executive said the decision to pull back from covering the President's trip was not setting a precedent.
But Jack Nelson, the Washington bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times, said reporters from print publications who had intended to take the press charter could not do so because, without full network participation, the trip became prohibitively expensive. News organizations pay for the seats on the press plane for their reporter or reporters, but unlike on a commercial airliner, the price per seat depends on the number of passengers. The fewer the passengers, the higher the cost per person.
 
More Than First Class
 The cost of the press flights has generally averaged out to about 50 percent more than it would cost to fly a commercial flight in first class, Mr. Peyronnin said. He added that the extra cost was used by the White House to set up telephones, copy speeches and perform other general services for the press.
Sean Walsh, an assistant White House press secretary, said that 70 to 80 journalists typically flew on the press plane that follows the President. Network news employees usually make up close to half that total.
This past weekend, Mr. Walsh said, the networks had signed up for only eight seats on the plane. Mr. Nelson of The Los Angeles Times said the White House first said the trip cost for each reporter would increase to about $2,000. But as print organizations declined to ride because of the cost, the amount continued to go up, he said, eventally reaching $16,000. At that price all organizations dropped out.
 
Flew on Commercial Flights
 News organizations then arranged to fly reporters to Florida on commercial flights. The network news organizations also sent additional crews to Florida, some from New York, some from the network's local television stations in Miami.
Mr. Peyronnin said the networks "are reviewing the costs of everything" in the wake of the war and what he called "changes in the television economy." The networks have all suffered from a soft marketpace for advertising.
Part of that review of costs, Mr. Peyronnin said, was the fact that the networks have been "all but underwriting the costs of the press planes because we have always assigned so many people to cover the President."
Mr. Friedman said the shrinking staffs and declining number of bureaus made it "much harder to do the job than it used to be in the old days when we had a complete menu to choose from." He said the new strategy was to fly correspondents to stories.

HEADLINE: German Economic Aide Slain; Red Army Faction Suspected

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DUSSELDORF, Germany, April 1

 BODY:
Detlev Rohwedder, who headed the agency charged with privatizing the economy of the former East Germany and was a leading German manager, was shot to death in his home tonight, the authorities said.
An anonymous caller asserted responsibility in the name of the Red Army Faction, a far-left terrorist group. 
 Mr. Rohwedder's wife, Ehrgard, was wounded in the shooting, which occurred about 11:30 P.M., a German television station reported, quoting the police. It said her injuries were not life-threatening.
 
History of Killing
 Since its founding in the 1970's, the Red Army Faction has taken responsibility for the killings of more than 60 people, including many prominent Germans. Its victims include Alfred Herrhausen, chief of the Deutsche Bank, who was killed by a bomb in November 1989.
On Feb. 13, Red Army gunmen fired more than 250 shots at the United States Embassy in Bonn, but caused no injuries.
Rolf Hannich, a spokesman for the German federal prosecutor's office, said the claim of responsibility had been received by the Paris office of Agence France-Presse. The caller made no effort to explain the slaying.
 
Rebuilding a Static Economy
 Mr. Rohwedder, who was 59 years old, had the monumental task of reorganizing the eastern German economy. In the next few years, more than 8,000 former state companies are to be privatized. More than four million people are expected to lose their jobs in the process.
Mr. Rohwedder had gained prominence as one of West Germany's most capable managers as head of the Hoesch steel company, which he helped pull out of financial difficulties in the early 1980's.
The privatization organization headed by Mr. Rohwedder has been criticized by many eastern Germans for being too quick to shut down businesses, throwing people out of work, rather than trying to rescue the companies. Mass protests have shaken eastern Germany in recent weeks because of rising unemployment and a lack of improvement in living standards.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Will Lay Off 2,600; Agencies to Close 2 Days a Month

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 1

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said today that the state would begin sending layoff notices to 2,600 employees, or about 5 percent of the state work force, on Tuesday and that he would order most state agencies to close their doors two additional days a month beginning in July.
Mr. Weicker, appearing grim at a rare evening news conference that was broadcast live on local television stations, said the layoffs and other cuts were made necessary by the failure of unions representing state employees to offer long-term cuts in benefits and wages and by the state's huge deficit, which he said had to be addressed immediately, regardless of the pain. 
 "This isn't just a speech," Mr. Weicker said. "The layoff process is starting, unfortunately."
It will be the first emergency layoff of state workers in Connecticut since 1975, when Gov. Ella T. Grasso dismissed 500 state employees, and the largest layoff since at least the early 1950's, state officials said. The layoffs will save an estimated $62 million. Some workers will receive as little as two weeks' notice, though most will have four to six weeks' notice.
 
Union Talks to Continue
 Mr. Weicker said that talks with the unions would continue and that if some accommodation could be reached, those laid off could be called back to work. All of the layoff notices will be out within two weeks, the Governor's office said.
The two-day agency shutdowns, intended to save $26 million, will not affect agencies involved in health and public safety, like the state police, the Correction Department or the Departments of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. But some of the agencies most visible to the average state resident will close two extra days a month, like the Motor Vehicles and the Environmental Protection Departments.
More than 7,000 people work for the agencies involved and would lose pay if they were scheduled to work those days, Mr. Weicker said. It was unclear how the closings would be structured, but some require union negotiation. A spokesman for the group representing the employee unions, Robert J. Krzys, said the layoffs and two-day closings would be felt by the public and "deplored by the state employees."
"This announcement will make reaching an agreement much more difficult," he said.
The layoffs and department closings are part of a nine-part plan that includes some elements already announced by the Governor's office. Most require no legislative action, although the largest single provision -- a change in accounting procedures for the state pension system to save about $130 million next year -- requires a law change unless the unions simply renegotiate contracts under the new formula.
 
Estimated Savings
 The overall plan would save Connecticut about $276 million over the next fiscal year, or about $125 million less than what Mr. Weicker sought from the unions when he presented his budget in February.
The plan also includes $29 million in savings that Mr. Weicker said would be sought from union members whose contracts are about to expire. Most of the savings sought in Mr. Weicker's budget would have come from reopening negotiations with unions whose contracts have already been settled.
Another $14 million would come from a pay freeze and one-week-a-year unpaid furloughs for all managers, commissioners and deputy commissioners.
Mr. Weicker's budget seeks to cut about $1.2 billion in state spending and already includes 938 layoffs that were to begin July 1 but are now to start immediately. It would also overhaul most of the state's revenue system and would impose for the first time a 6 percent flat income tax on wages.
Connecticut faces a shortfall of $784 million in a $7 billion budget for the year ending June 30 and a gap of $1.7 billion in the preliminary budget for the next year, according to figures released today by the State Comptroller's office.
The projections represent a rise of nearly $80 million in the deficit in just the last month, mainly from declining collections from the taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains and increased Medicaid and welfare expenses attributed to the recession.
The precise effect of the layoffs on services is speculative. The agencies most severely affected include the University of Connecticut, which would lose 300 people out of 2,860 paid from the state's General Fund. The Transportation Department would lose an additional 295 workers beyond the 268 already included in the initial budget plan. The Historical Commission would lose 4 more of its 23 employees beyond the 2 already due to be dropped.
Other states have set even more painful goals. In New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed laying off 7,000 state workers and eliminating 11,000 other state jobs. Massachusetts has announced plans to eliminate 7,600 jobs. Rhode Island began last month the first of 10 unpaid furlough days.

HEADLINE: GAMBLING RETURNS TO THE MISSISSIPPI

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBUQUE, Iowa, April 1

 BODY:
The stern faces of blackjack players, the whoops and shouts of winners and the resigned side glances of losers returned to the muddy water of the Mississippi River today for the first time since hard-drinking roughnecks ruled turn-of-the-century paddle wheelers.
Three floating casinos, packed with thousands of crap-shooting, roulette-playing Midwesterners, plied the Iowa side of the river in a grand attempt to revive Iowa's river cities, an experiment that is being closely watched by officials in Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois, where moves are under way to emulate it. 
 But instead of the career rogues of Mark Twain's day, the gamblers aboard these vessels are farmers and factory workers and great-grandmothers like Helen Callahan of Dubuque, Iowa.
 
More Than Plain Farmers
 "People think Iowans just grow corn and raise pigs," the 76-year-old retired school teacher said. "But we have a lot of good, intelligent people. We know a little bit about gambling."
She then joined the crowd in the shiny new Dubuque Casino Belle and headed for the slot machines, where she said she could hold her own.
Del Hildebrand, a factory worker, got up at 2 this morning to drive from just outside Milwaukee to Dubuque to make it in time for the maiden voyage of the Casino Belle.
"I figured the slot machines would be loose," he said. For him, they were. He won $150 in his first few minutes on board before the river boat had even left the dock.
The millions spent on gussying up the side-wheeler, a model of a 19th-century riverboat, with faux marble columns and waitresses in bustles and feathers, mattered little to people like Mr. Hildebrand. "I didn't come for the scenery," he said. "I don't care about the decor. They could stay at the dock and people wouldn't care."
The view from the three casino decks aboard the Casino Belle is mostly trees and brown water, and the hourlong cruise is essentially a journey to nowhere in particular, just eight or 10 miles south of Dubuque and back. So when the riverboat began to edge away from its dock, no one at the boat's 500 slot machines, 21 blackjack tables, two dice tables and the roulette wheel appeared to even look up.
"I didn't know we were moving," said Bob Gates, a Wisconsin logger in a red-checked flannel shirt and baseball cap, sitting at a blackjack table, neither losing nor winning, when told that the boat was in the middle of the Mississippi.
For all the intensity and slightly desperate hoping-against-hope that is typical of gamblers, state officials have sought to insure that gambling here is under control and that Dubuque and Davenport and Bettendorf, cities with casino gambling, do not turn seedy.
 
Strict Limits Are Set
 For one, gamblers are permitted to wager no more than $5 a bet and can lose no more than $200 a trip. Not-for-profit companies run the casinos, contracting out the management of hiring and maintenance of the boats to local private river boat operators. The managing companies determine how the casino profits will be divided between the city in which the license is held and charity. The state expects to reap about $50 million from the gambling.
State officials insist that Iowa will still be wholesome and clean. They say that compulsive gamblers will not like the Disneyland feel of Iowa gaming.
"This gives people a chance to take a cruise on the river," said Representative Jim Nussle, a Republican. "This is more than just sitting in a dark room playing cards."
This is also a chance for Iowa's river cities to blossom, as they did during the boom times of a century ago, when the Mississippi was their lifeblood and as many as 800 paddle wheelers visited their landings.
 
Hard Economic Times
 The last few decades have been particularly tough for cities like Dubuque, a city of 65,000 that saw its farm and construction equipment industry collapse with the state's farm economy in the 1980's and unemployment rise to nearly 25 percent.
"Industries held on to the riverfront land figuring someday it would be worth something to somebody," Mayor James E. Brady of Dubuque said. "Now we have a whole new industry. Our future is the Mississippi River.
Cranes now rise at the foot of Dubuque's steep bluffs and a new hotel and office building are going up. The city hopes that riverboat gambling will attract 2 million visitors a year to the three cities and that this will mean improved highways and more business, as well as money for its coffers. The city is hoping that people like Jim Fuegen, a corn and dairy farmer from Springbrook, just keep coming to take their chances on the riverboat.
Mr. Fuegen, for one, knows he will be doing well if he breaks even. But, he says, "The way prices are going, I'm gambling anyway, so I might as well have fun losing." He then pulled the lever on the slot machine and watched the green and yellow and pink symbols sort themselves out.

HEADLINE: Realtors' Ads To Protest Rise in Taxes

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Led by major realtors and landlords, an unusual coalition of New York City property owners is about to start a million-dollar advertising and direct-mail campaign urging taxpayers to write Mayor David N. Dinkins and other officials to oppose the Mayor's proposal for higher real-estate taxes.
The campaign, the first by one of the city's most significant and depressed industries, amounts to a declaration of war on the municipal government and an attempt to ignite a tax revolt from the top down by tapping the grass-roots anger of homeowners and small businesses. 
 "Don't be fooled into thinking the city has no choice," reads an advertisement prepared for newspapers. "While you worried about your job, the city added 5,000 people to the public payroll last year. So the tough talk about budget cuts is just that . . . talk."
 
Ads Raise Fears for Home and Job
 The ads, to be printed in newspapers and broadcast on radio, warn that the Dinkins administration's plan for nearly $1 billion in higher property taxes to balance its budget and finance its anti-crime plan would mean increases of more than 20 percent in some taxpayers' bills and would force businesses and residents out of the city.
"This tax hike will cost you hundreds of dollars a year, lower the value of your home and maybe even cost you your job!" one ad reads. The tag line is "Don't take a hike. Say 'NO!' to higher taxes."
"The magnitude of these taxes is literally like throwing gasoline on a fire trying to put it out," said John J. Gilbert 3d, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a major landlord group. He is helping to lead the campaign with Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. Both said it was the first such broad campaign the industry had sponsored.
The organizers plan to begin the campaign on April 15, re-enacting the Boston Tea Party by dumping "an environmentally acceptable equivalent of tea" some place along the Manhattan waterfront, Mr. Gilbert said.
Mr. Dinkins's acting press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said the administration was striving to balance the pain of budget cutbacks and new taxes fairly as it faced a projected gap of more than $3 billion for the fiscal year that starts on July 1. "Everyone has First Amendment rights, and we understand that everyone is feeling the pain," he said. "Those voices are coming at us from all sides."
In the past, large landlords and apartment owners complained that the City Council, which has the power to fix property tax rates, shielded small homeowners from higher taxes. But this year, the effects of a state law that requires a redistribution of the tax burden among different types of property, and the sheer size of the proposed increases, have drawn big and small owners into a new alliance.
 
30 Groups Allied, Organizer Says
 Mr. Spinola said he had sought to organize the group, which calls itself Taxpayers for an Affordable New York, because he did not believe most New Yorkers realized the real size of the proposed increases, which are embedded in a complex mix of proposals. So far he said, more than 30 groups have been signed up, from the Harlem Taxpayers and Property Owners Association to the Queens Chamber of Commerce.
To put pressure on politicians, a direct-mail packet to 750,000 property owners and co-op dwellers will include three prepared postcards addressed to Mr. Dinkins, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and the local Council members, saying, "If you want to keep New York affordable, keep essential services and cut the waste."
Mr. Spinola said the campaign had resulted from dissatisfaction with the city's response to its complaints. "We were talking logic to the administration, and no matter how good our arguments, they were getting a lot of pressure from other interests," including labor unions, to raise taxes instead of cutting jobs or services, he said.
The state Public Employees Federation, one of the largest state workers' unions, is currently spending at least $1 million on television ads. They urge the Legislature to pass higher state income and sales taxes to maintain services and restore some of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget cuts.
Mr. Spinola said the coalition wanted the city to work harder to save money by reducing the work force, trimming fringe benefits for workers, cutting unnecessary programs and generally making do with less, something he said the recession had forced private industry to do. He said the Council leadership's proposal to raise only about one-third of the property taxes Mr. Dinkins was seeking was "a dramatic statement, but it doesn't go far enough."

HEADLINE: From Journey's End to a Commuter Stop

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
It's enough to throw the New Yorker magazine's made-up railroad maven, E. M. Frimbo, into a tizzy. When the Rip Van Winkle chugs out of Grand Central Terminal on Saturday night, the Beaux-Arts landmark -- which once billed itself as the gateway to a continent -- will turn into just another commuter station: the gateway to Pelham and Poughkeepsie.
In the name of efficiency, Amtrak is switching all its long-distance trains from Grand Central to Pennsylvania Station. Amtrak says that will let passengers from Washington and points south who want to go on to Albany and points north do so by merely going across a train-station platform, not an entire town. 
 Amtrak has spent $100 million to make this possible. It has built a new tunnel under Penn Station and has renovated a century-old bridge at Spuyten Duyvil. It has rebuilt miles of tracks beneath Riverside Park, which run past a squatters' colony of old cinder-block bunkers.
 
'A Thousand Dramas Daily'
 Rail buffs insist that things will not be the same in majestic Grand Central, where the cameras rolled as they rolled out the red carpet for stars like Fred Astaire and Carole Lombard and John Barrymore. "Crossroads of a million private lives! Gigantic stage on which are played a thousand dramas daily!" boomed a deep-voiced announcer on an NBC radio soap opera in the 1930's titled -- what else? -- "Grand Central Station."
A generation later, network television news shows originated right there in Grand Central and quiz-show hosts told viewers to send away for studio-audience tickets to Madison Avenue addresses that sounded quite fancy to out-of-towners.
But now Alex Trebek presides over "Jeopardy," "Concentration" and "To Tell the Truth" from Burbank, Calif., asking contestants when they moved west as if they were a bit dim for not having done so sooner.
"The world won't end over this," Kent S. Barwick, the executive director of the Municipal Art Society and a leader in the fight to save the terminal in the 1970's, said of the switch to Penn Station, "but who would have thought that in one fell swoop they could saw off Grand Central Terminal from the rest of America?"
Well, not exactly. Metro-North trains will continue to come and go from Grand Central. But they will be short-haul commuter runs: the 5:03, not the big-name long-distance trains like the 20th Century Limited or the Lake Shore Limited.
Train buffs have already reserved spots along the right-of-way from which to photograph what they consider a mournful bit of history: the final Amtrak trains to and from Grand Central. And redcaps who have worked there for years don't want to follow their passengers to Penn Station.
"I don't like it," Phil Williams, an Amtrak redcap who has worked in Grand Central for 23 years, said of Penn Station. "It's just generally depressing and claustrophobic." He said he had applied for a job with Metro-North rather than risk being assigned to Penn Station.
Thomas Henry, after six years at Grand Central, slandered Penn Station with the ultimate redcap epithets: "congested and hard to get around in."
Beyond the old iron gates, out on the concrete platforms where huffing-and-puffing locomotives once came to a halt with an ear-splitting blast of steam, there is already a certain nostalgia, though Amtrak is not gone yet.
 
The End of an Era
 "Personally speaking," said Tom Campbell, an Amtrak conductor who lives in Half Moon, N.Y., "I'm going to miss it. This is the station."
Frederick Palmer went a step farther, calling the end of Amtrak service at Grand Central nothing less than the end of an era. He is the superintendent of Grand Central. His father and grandfather worked there. And he remembers riding in as a youngster and seeing the New York Central trains, shined up and lined up and ready to head west.
"It was really something to see," he said, "the crispness of it, the fact that the crowd was headed someplace or arriving in a great terminal in a great city. You don't feel that way in airports."
Airports do not have eavesdropper's delights like the Oyster Bar, where a whisper comes in loud and clear all the way across the room. And airports do not have the grandeur of Grand Central -- something that 4 1/2-year-old Sasha MacDonald noticed the moment she set foot in the place on her way to visit her grandmother.
 
No More Slumbercoaches
 "She thought it was a church," said her father, Robert MacDonald, a Manhattan photographer.
No more Amtrak service from Grand Central means no more slumbercoaches on the trains that are making the change. Slumbercoaches are Amtrak's economy sleeping cars. For reasons that even Mr. Black described as complicated, there is no way to operate them on the new route. So slumbercoach passengers will have to ride to Albany in regular upright seats and wait for the slumbercoaches to be tacked onto the train before they can be tucked into their fold-down beds.
For passengers, the change to Penn Station will be a double whammy. The first train to Albany, on Sunday, will roll out of Penn Station on the very morning that Eastern Standard Time gives way to Daylight Savings. Hardly anything could be more confusing than remembering to reset one's watch and go to Penn Station instead of Grand Central.
"Wonder how many people will show up at Grand Central next Monday morning wondering where the train to Albany is," said Philip A. Lentz, the press secretary to Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, who lives in Manhattan and commutes to the State Capitol on Mondays. "It might delay the budget for another week."

HEADLINE: LOW MEDICAID FEES SEEN AS DEPRIVING THE POOR OF CARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Medicaid, the health program for poor people, pays doctors much less than either Medicare or private health insurers for the same services, and as a result many doctors are refusing to take Medicaid patients, a Federal advisory commission said today.
In a report to Congress, the panel, the Physician Payment Review Commission, said Medicaid paid doctors 69 percent of what Medicare paid, and an even smaller proportion of what private insurers paid. 
 Forty-four states have problems getting doctors to participate in Medicaid, and "low fees were cited as the most common factor in discouraging participation," the commission said.
 
Political Power a Factor
 Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 33 million elderly and disabled people, has a much stronger political constituency than Medicaid, a Federal-state program for 27 million low-income Americans, including 13 million children.
While doctors have often complained informally about the level of Medicaid payments, the study by the nonpartisan commission is the most systematic attempt to date to measure the disparities. The study, conducted with the help of the National Governors Association, was based in part on a survey of state Medicaid programs, which reported data on actual fees for services commonly used by Medicaid beneficiaries.
Another reason for the disparities in doctors' fees under the programs is the way the programs are financed. Medicare has its own trust funds, composed of payroll taxes, premiums and general revenues. Medicaid, by contrast, depends almost entirely on general Federal and state revenues.
 
Close to Market Rates
 The Federal Government decides how much to pay doctors under Medicare and has normally guaranteed that physicians receive fees close to market rates. But states have wide discretion in deciding how much to pay in doctors' fees under Medicaid. State Medicaid agencies set the fees, often in consultation with the legislatures.
States often fail to increase doctors' fees to take account of inflation. In some states, Medicaid pays less than it costs to perform certain services.
The commission found "very large differences" in physician payments. New Jersey and New York were among the lowest-paying states. New Jersey's Medicaid fees were 50 percent of average Medicaid fees for all states, and New York's payments were 53 percent, the commission said.
In 1989, New York's Medicaid program typically paid doctors $240 for a total hysterectomy, or 17 percent of what Medicare paid ($1,448), the commission said. New Jersey paid $257 for that procedure, or 22 percent of what Medicare paid ($1,163). For a typical visit to a doctor office's, Medicaid paid $11 in New York, or 35 percent of what Medicare paid ($31.68).
 
Effects on Patients
 In West Virginia, Medicaid paid $330 for normal delivery of a baby, or 38 percent of the average claim submitted to private insurers for that service ($860).
Missouri and Rhode Island were other low-paying states. The highest-paying states included Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia and Indiana, where Medicaid payments to doctors slightly exceeded Medicare payments.
The low Medicaid fees affect patients in several ways, the commission said: Medicaid recipients are less likely than other people to have a continuing relationship with a doctor, less likely to receive care in a private office and more likely to receive basic care in a hospital emergency room or clinic.
In addition, the panel said, doctors who choose to treat Medicaid beneficiaries may be at a "substantial economic disadvantage relative to their peers."
Doctors are not required to take patients under either Medicaid or Medicare, but many find it profitable to take Medicare patients.
The commission plans to make recommendations later this year for changes in how Medicaid pays doctors.
 
Action From Congress
 The 13-member commission, made up of doctors and other health-care experts, was created five years ago to advise Congress on paying doctors under Medicare, and Congress has enacted most of its recommendations. Its mandate was expanded last year to include Medicaid.
Dr. Philip R. Lee, chairman of the commission, said there appeared to be a trade-off in some states between the level of Medicaid fees to doctors and the generosity of Medicaid programs to beneficiaries.
Thus, he said in an interview, while Medicaid payments to doctors are relatively low in New York, the state's program has liberal eligiblity rules, offers a wide range of optional benefits and pays for large amounts of longterm care.
By contrast, the Indiana Medicaid program pays higher fees to doctors, but eligibility for benefits is stricter.
"Poor people have limited access to private physicians in New York City because Medicaid payments are often less than what it costs the physician to provide the service," said Dr. Lee, who is director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California at San Francisco. "But New York City has a well-developed system of public hospitals and outpatient clinics that assure access to health care for Medicaid beneficiaries and other poor people."
 
Inner City vs. Rural
 The commission said that fee increases might improve access to health care for some poor people by drawing more doctors into the program. If Medicaid increases payments to doctors, beneficiaries would be more likely to receive care in doctors' offices than in hospital emergency rooms, the panel said.
But James W. Fossett, a political scientist at the State University of New York in Albany, who has analyzed Medicaid claims data, said: "An increase in Medicaid physician fees would probably not improve access to health care for poor people in inner-city neighborhoods because there is a severe shortage of doctors in such areas. Higher fees could improve access to some types of care for residents of rural areas."
Dr. Lee warned that if the Federal Government required a substantial increase in Medicaid payments to doctors, states might try to offset the cost by restricting eligibility or limiting the scope of Medicaid benefits.
Medicaid is one of the fastest-growing items in state budgets, primarily because health-care costs are rising, but also because Congress has repeatedly required states to expand benefits and eligibility.
 
Trouble Finding Doctors
 Rather than simply mandating that all Medicaid doctors' fees be raised to a certain level, it might make more sense for the Government to require increases for selected services, like obstetrics and pediatrics, or increases for doctors in underserved areas, the commission said.
The commission estimated that it would cost $1.3 billion in Federal and state money a year to raise Medicaid doctors' fees to the level of those for Medicare. Federal and state agencies spent a total of $3.4 billion for doctors' services to Medicaid patients in 1989.
Twenty-six states said they had difficulty recruiting doctors to serve Medicaid patients in rural areas. New Jersey, Maine, Nebraska and Washington State said they had problems finding doctors for urban areas.

The City of Birmingham likes its Symphony Orchestra so much that it has built a brilliant new concert hall it hopes will be the best in England when it opens on April 15.
"It's an honest hall," said the orchestra's 35-year-old music director, Simon Rattle. "The better we play in it, the better we'll sound." 
 The move from the early-19th-century neo-classical temple of Town Hall, where Mendelssohn's "Elijah" and Elgar's "Dream of Gerontius" were first performed, is something of an emotional wrench for the orchestra.
What it gets in exchange for moving up the street to Birmingham's new glass and stone international convention center is a $48.1 million, self-contained amphitheater seating 2,211 people, 450 more than Town Hall.
But this hall has been designed with better sound, not bigger box- office receipts, in mind. It has thick, heavy walls, offstage resonating chambers, a huge, movable, cantilevered canopy over the stage, and on the walls, reflecting surfaces of hardwood and plaster polished with marble chips and beeswax.
The entire 400,000-ton structure is mounted on rubber shock absorbers, in hopes of keeping out rumbles from the nearby underground British Rail line.
The British architects, the Renton, Howard, Wood Levine partnership, have worked closely with Artec Consultants of New York City to try to create the same warmth and resonance found in such great 19th-century houses as the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna or Symphony Hall in Boston.
Like them, the new hall is high, longer than it is wide, and built not in broad, sloping ramps but with tiered balconies, the rear one rising so steeply that some concertgoers may feel they need crampons to get safely to their seats.
Russell Johnson, a New Yorker who is the acoustical designer of the Birmingham hall, said it bears some resemblance to the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center auditorium in Dallas, which his company also worked on. I. M. Pei was the architect there.
The Birmingham auditorium, with its hard maple floors and light-colored walls, broken by removable red absorbent panels to soften the hall's acoustics when it is used for meetings and lectures, will have variable resonating periods of 1.4 to 2.8 or 3.2 seconds, Mr. Johnson said. "That's not cathedral resonance, but it's like a large church or a pre-1910 concert hall," he said.
Why so many modern concert halls, including Royal Philharmonic Hall or Barbican Hall in London, sound so dead by comparison is a subject that sends Mr. Johnson into paroxysms he prefers not to have described. He has been here almost continuously since Jan. 8, he said, and expects to remain for some months to make sure the hall turns out the way he and the orchestra want it.
"He has managed to make an extraordinary mixture of clarity and warmth," Mr. Rattle said. The Royal opening of the hall, with Mahler's Symphony No. 2 as the highlight ("the work that made me decide I wanted to conduct," Mr. Rattle says) will be on June 12. But the hall will open to the public in April.
So on April 15, between champagne receptions, the orchestra will play two major scores in one evening, Stravinsky's "Firebird" and Ravel's "Daphnis et Chloe," with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra chorus.
Birmingham council officials have made the arts an integral part of their plan to try to raise a service economy from the ashes of the 19th-century industrial age. Getting Simon Rattle to resist siren calls from other orchestras in recent years may even be one reason for the city-built concert hall.
"We're very fortunate that the city adopted the orchestra as a sort of flagship," Mr. Rattle said. But he continued: "I stay here because the orchestra is so good. One day they'll need someone else, but I think it would be irresponsible to leave now."
The orchestra has already begun an ambitious, decade-by-decade survey of 20th-century art and music, called Toward the Millennium, that will run until then. This year, the orchestra is examining Sibelius, Stravinsky, Elgar, Schoenberg and other composers of the first decade of the century, with other cultural organizations in Birmingham and the London Sinfonietta participating.
"Audiences in Birmingham have gotten used to this kind of programming," Mr. Rattle said. "They almost expect it, to the point where I sometimes think we could be hoist by our own petard and people could get sniffy about coming to a Beethoven cycle."
With a head full of salt-and-pepper curls, Mr. Rattle looks even younger than he is, and there's an appealing kind of modesty in the way he describes feelers he got from the Berlin Philharmonic after Herbert von Karajan's death: "There was a kind of approach. I'm sure that if they'd been in their right mind, they wouldn't have appointed me. Too young. There's time."
He grew up not in Birmingham but in Liverpool. "I didn't learn until afterward how good the Beatles were," he lamented. But as a child, the son of a jazz band leader, he went down another route, playing jazz drums for a while before becoming a student of a Liverpool pianist, Douglas Miller. "He was a friend of Rachmaninoff, remembered very well Grieg playing, and had turned pages for Webern in a concert," Mr. Rattle said, recalling that he had found the experience a bit intimidating.
Mr. Rattle's wife, the American soprano Elise Ross, a composition student of the avant-garde composer Luciano Berio, will sing with the orchestra in Schoenberg's "Pierrot Lunaire" in a program of music from 1911-13 called "The Revolution of Expression." The orchestra plans to take the program to Boston, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco next year.
The only thing lacking in the new concert hall is a pipe organ. A handsome case for a four-manual, 69-stop instrument to be built by the Johannes Klais firm in Bonn is there, but the city hasn't yet voted the funds for the rest. "It'll take two or three years, not more," Mr. Rattle said. "I love Janacek's 'Glagolitic Mass,' and we can't perform it without the organ."

HEADLINE: Using Fewer Pesticides Is Seen as Beneficial

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
AMERICAN farmers have long maintained that using fewer pesticides would result in greater crop losses and increased food prices. But a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and costs of the present heavy dependence on chemical methods of pest control strongly suggests otherwise.
Yields would not decline and food prices would rise less than 1 percent if half the chemicals now applied to crops were replaced by other control techniques, Cornell University researchers have concluded after reviewing data on crop yields and pesticide use from hundreds of scientists at university laboratories and Government agencies. 
 The findings support growing consumer concerns about pesticide pollution and underscore suggestions that a more organic approach to agriculture would be beneficial.
A 30-page summary of the study, directed by Dr. David Pimentel, was published earlier this year in the "Handbook of Pest Management in Agriculture," a three-volume, 2,300-page handbook from CRC Press of Boca Raton, Fla. Dr. Pimentel, an entomologist and ecologist at the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell, worked with 10 graduate and undergraduate students who compiled and analyzed nearly 300 scientific references.
Dr. Robert Metcalf, an entomologist at the University of Illinois, said that "if anything, Dr. Pimentel's estimates are conservative," adding, "Large-scale pest management studies have shown that pesticides could be reduced by half, three-fourths, even 90 percent in some cases without adversely affecting yields or the cost of food."
But John McCarthy of the National Agricultural Chemicals Association, which represents the pesticide industry, said: "We think Dr. Pimentel has drastically underestimated the impact on the price of food of reducing pesticides by 50 percent. The assumption that yields wouldn't decrease needs to be critically examined. Most people who've looked into this have reached a different conclusion."
 
6,000 Cancer Cases Cited
 The Cornell study suggests that a net economic benefit would result from a 50 percent reduction in pesticide use because there would be less damage to fish, wildlife, crops, trees, water supplies and human health.
Currently, for example, about 45,000 people each year report accidental poisonings by pesticides and, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates, 6,000 Americans, most of them farm workers, are afflicted with pesticide-induced cancers. Government efforts to monitor and control pesticide pollution cost at least $150 million a year, the report states.
Furthermore, the findings suggest, heavy dependence on chemicals to control weeds, crop diseases and insect infestations long ago reached the point of diminishing returns. Since the 1940's, there has been a 33-fold increase in the amount of pesticides used and at least a 10-fold increase in their potency, but 37 percent of crops are now lost to pests, up from 31 percent in the 40's.
 Currently 700 million pounds of pesticides are used annually in American agriculture at a cost of $4.1 billion, and nearly another $1 billion is spent to counter environmental damage and public health effects of pesticides, the analysis found.
 Dr. Pimentel and his collaborators advocate a return to practices that in some cases can increase yields while decreasing pesticide use. These include rotating cash crops to prevent a buildup of destructive pests. For example, corn might be grown in alternate years with soybeans.
"In 1945, when all corn was grown in rotation and no insecticides were used, only 3.5 percent of the crop was lost to insects," Dr. Pimentel said in an interview. "But today, corn is the largest user of pesticides in the nation and 12 percent of the crop is lost to insects, which indicates that the loss of crop rotation has been counterproductive."
 
Well-Tested Alternatives
 The study also indicated that by combining crop rotation with the planting of insect-resistant varieties of corn, only one-fifth of the insecticides now used would be needed and less of the crop would be lost to insects.
Other well-tested alternatives to spraying pesticides on a set schedule, as is usually the case, include "scouting" systems to detect pest problems early and analyses of weather forecasts to help farmers predict more precisely when chemical treatments are needed.
Dr. Pimentel said that modern methods of pesticide application have worsened the problem of environmental contamination. He explained: "Airblast sprayers used in orchards and vineyards spread 35 percent of their chemicals into the environment. Even under ideal conditions, only half the chemicals sprayed on crops from aircraft lands on the target area. And with the new ultralow-volume spraying, only 25 percent hits the target; 75 percent goes into the environment." The low-volume technique uses concentrated pesticides that have been broken into minute particles, which drift badly when sprayed from crop-dusting planes.
Instead, he suggested spraying under umbrella-like units that drape over vines and row crops and that collect and recirculate excess chemicals. For weed control, rope-wick applicators can deposit herbicides directly between rows of crops.
 
Price-Support Suggestion
 Other recommendations to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides include denser planting patterns to crowd out weeds, the use of lures to trap insects and "insect vacuums" to remove insects from crops and the planting of varieties that resist disease or mature before pest populations are ready to attack.
The Cornell researchers urged increased use of biological weapons and called for changes in Government regulations that set cosmetic standards so high that pesticides must be used to keep foods marketable.
"People are already eating insect parts in their fresh and processed foods," Dr. Pimentel said, adding that the amount of these contaminants would increase only slightly if fewer pesticides were used.
The most controversial suggestion in the report is a revision of the Government's price-support programs for several crops. These income guarantees have generally limited what farmers in the program can grow and have enabled crops to be produced in areas where they are subject to heavy pest attack and require costly control measures. A revision of the price-support program could save billions in Government payouts without reducing farmers' net income, Dr. Pimentel said.

HEADLINE: The Day the Eating Stopped

 BODY:
Everybody's got a story about why it happened. For one person it was the small plop of risotto with baby shrimp listed as a "starter" for $25. For another it was the 30 minutes he spent cooling his heels near the coat check at the place where he'd reserved two weeks in advance. For a third it was the plonk that was the cheapest thing on the wine list at $25 a bottle. For all of them, though, it was the day the eating stopped.
Once upon a time in New York City -- in the decade of the Big Hunger -- restaurants proliferated like mushrooms. Or rather, like porcini, cremini, Portobellos, shiitakes, chanterelles and morels -- which is what everybody who was anybody and everybody who aspired to be somebody was eating in those days. Then came a recession and its companion, guilt, and suddenly investment dining had about it the smell of . . . excess. 
 "Connoisseurship is being lumped together with 'nouveau riche' as some embarrassing 80's remnant," a restaurateur told a Times reporter last week. "We are in real trouble."
A lot of fancy spots have closed, and about 7,000 fewer people are washing dishes, poaching fish and speed-talking the list of today's specials. Not only that but those who are still eating high on the hog are at the same moment dying of shame. "I'd be real embarrassed if one of my friends who's been laid off saw me here," said a lawyer as he crept into the Rainbow Room.
There may be another factor, though, to people's being fed to the teeth: boredom. It's boring to be forever dazzled by what the chef thought to do with monkfish. Boring to have food be the raison d'etre rather than the backdrop to an evening. "I don't want to see any more celebrities," says a bonne bouche who has sworn never to dine more than three blocks from home and preferably in a place with checked tablecloths and chianti bottles for candleholders. "I want to see the neighbors!"

HEADLINE: Combination Trucks Benefit the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The March 12 letter from San Francisco Teamsters' Joint Council 7 strives mightily to smear the safety record of longer combination vehicles. Consider the following:
* Longer combination vehicles are safe. They have the best safety record of any truck combination. They have been operating for 30 years, and no state has prohibited their use after allowing them to operate. Last year longer combination vehicles were involved in only four fatalities, although they traveled 500 million miles. 
 * Motor carrier insurance companies do not increase rates for longer combination vehicles.
* Longer combination vehicles may be used only by permits issued by the state, and these permits specify routes on which LCV's may travel and under what conditions.
* Longer combination vehicles are permitted in 17 states -- including New York, where they travel the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway -- giving these states an economic advantage over those that do not permit them.
* Longer combination vehicles reduce congestion, pollution and pavement wear by carrying more freight in fewer trucks.
* Longer combination vehicles lower the cost of moving freight and thus can save consumers $4 billion a year, according to a Congressional study.
* The trucking industry's accident fatality rate has decreased 40 percent in the last decade.
The key issue is economic competition in a global economy. American Trucking Associations -- which represents every type and class of motor carrier in the country (for-hire and private, regulated and exempt) -- believes longer combination vehicles are safe and are needed to help keep America economically healthy. The Federal Government should allow the 33 states not authorized to operate longer combination vehicles to determine for themselves if they want to permit them.

HEADLINE: Children of Empire Outdo Britannia's Own

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It hardly requires lowered admission standards to broaden student diversity at Oxbridge -- the name by which the British call their venerable universities of Oxford and Cambridge collectively -- as you imply in your report from Cambridge on British higher education (March 4).
I participated last year in a study visit to urban primary and secondary schools in England, and it became clear to me that a disproportionately high number of the most motivated, highest achieving students in the state-supported schools are from families that emigrated from India and Pakistan. 
This observation is reinforced by newly released figures from researchers at the London School of Economics and the London University Institute of Education. They examined the scores students in London achieved on the tests of the General Certificate of Secondary Education and found that Indian and Pakistani students excelled beyond their English, Scottish and Welsh classmates. African-Caribbean and Bangladesh students trailed everyone else.
Thus, at least for students of Indian and Pakistani background, Oxford and Cambridge should not find it in the least difficult to increase diversity without compromising admission standards.

HEADLINE: Martha Graham Dies at 96; A Revolutionary in Dance

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF

 BODY:
Martha Graham, a prime revolutionary in the arts of this century and the American dancer and choreographer whose name became synonymous with modern dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.
Miss Graham died of cardiac arrest after being treated for two months for pneumonia, said Ron Protas, general director of the Martha Graham Dance Company. Miss Graham had become ill in December after a 55-day tour of the Far East with her troupe. She entered the hospital on Jan. 15 and returned home two weeks ago. 
Frequently ranked with Picasso, Stravinsky and James Joyce for developing a form of expression that broke the traditional mold, Miss Graham was initially acclaimed as a great dancer.
 
Masterworks and Invention
 Yet ultimately her genius -- universally recognized as she became the most honored figure in American dance -- was embodied in her choreographic masterworks and her invention of a new and codified dance language.
The Graham technique, which is now used by dance companies throughout the world, became the first enduring alternative to the idiom of classical ballet. Powerful, dynamic, jagged and filled with tension, this vocabulary combined with Miss Graham's distinctive system of training to set her above other dance innovators.
Although such achievements were part of Miss Graham's multi-faceted pioneering role in helping to establish modern dance outside the older ballet tradition after the 1920's, she continued to amaze her public for more than 60 years. She choreographed more than 180 works. The most recent was her self-mocking "Maple Leaf Rag," which had its premiere on Oct. 2 with the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York.
Throughout her career, Miss Graham's fundamental tenet was that dance should reach audiences through a visceral response rather than an objective image that registered upon the intellect. "Out of emotion comes form," she said, and then proved that out of form she could re-create the same emotion onstage.
She never wavered in her belief that movement could express inner feeling. Miss Graham sought to give "visible substance to things felt" and to "chart the graph of the heart." These celebrated Graham phrases became the metaphors central to her art.
Miss Graham's dances spoke elo- quently against the crushing of the human spirit, and one of her frequent themes was the condemnation of intolerance, especially toward nonconformists.
Her own life as a creative artist epitomized the independent spirit with which she so frequently imbued her dramatic heroines. The figure conquering sexual fear in "Errand Into the Maze," the woman looking deep into herself while preparing for an unnamed fate in "Herodiade" and the American pioneer brimming with optimism in "Frontier" could also be Clytemnestra or Jocasta, antiquity's queens who -- in the Graham canon -- emerged from crisis through the sheer force of self-understanding. Miss Graham usually cast herself at the center of these works until 1969, when she gave her last performance and retired reluctantly from the stage at the age of 75.
Because she rarely met conventional expectations about dance, she was both misunderstood and acclaimed. She was surrounded by debate throughout her career; few remained indifferent to her. Acknowledgment of Miss Graham's role as a dominant force in all the arts at first came from painters, writers, musicians and the acting profession. Gregory Peck and Bette Davis were among the many drama students she taught over the years at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Eleanor Roosevelt invited Miss Graham to perform at the White House in 1937, and in 1976 Miss Graham became the first dance personality to receive, from President Gerald R. Ford, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.
Nonetheless, Miss Graham's highly intense dancing and choreography were not intended to soothe the spirit and did not find ready acceptance.
 
Quest for Inner Reality, But Never for Realism
Like Picasso, she was concerned with an inner reality. "For me, dance is theater," she wrote. But she never resorted to a realistic theater. More often than not, her choreography presented a dancer's body as distorted or dislocated, an assemblage of forms aligned into maximum expressiveness.
Audiences throughout the world were often disturbed by Miss Graham's frank acknowledgment of human sexuality, especially in her famous cycle inspired by Greek myths. Miss Graham's Medea, Jocasta, Phaedra and Clytemnestra gave vent to their lust and hate, baring the passions that few humans liked to recognize in themselves but that Miss Graham exposed with the unflinching scrutiny of a 20th-century Jungian analyst.
For Miss Graham, dance became a collective memory that could communicate the emotions universal to all civilizations: mythology, she felt, was the psychology of the ancients.
Miss Graham's encyclopedic approach to dance -- a creative wellspring from sources as varied as American Indian rituals to the Bible -- often carried several levels of meaning and startled a public that defined dance in linear or pictorial terms. Miss Graham, for her part, said she wanted her dances to be "felt" rather than comprehended in the usual manner.
In 1944, John Martin, dance critic for The New York Times, wrote of the emotional effect that the Graham dance theater could have upon the viewer. He warned that "Deaths and Entrances," the choreographer's study of turbulent passions inspired by Anne, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, the 19th-century English writers, was "un-understandable through the usual organs of understanding" and "slips in through sensory perceptions."
 
The Graham Technique Is Based on Breathing
 In general, Miss Graham saw art as a reflection of its time inseparable from life. "My dancing," she said, "is not an attempt to interpret life in the literary sense. It is an affirmation of life through movement."
Even the dance technique that she hammered out on her own body and then transferred to her school and company derived from the most organic aspect of human life: the act of breathing. That act was formalized and dramatized in the idiom's most basic principle, called contraction and release -- intensified moments of exhalation and inhalation. Miss Graham said her aim was "to increase the emotional activity of the dancer's body so that you are teaching the body, not teaching the mind."
The contraction, originating in the dancer's pelvis, created the percussive angular movement and sexual tension that invariably startled a newcomer to the Graham repertory. But it is the Graham idiom as a whole that can look strange to those who expect more of a continuum in dancing.
 
Being 'the Thing Itself' Instead of Portraying It
 Above all, she said, "Dance is not representational." Miss Graham recalled in later years that as a young dancer about to embark upon an independent career in 1922, she had chanced upon a nonfigurative painting by Wassily Kandinsky -- a slash of red against a field of blue. "I will dance like that," she said.
Like other modernists, Miss Graham rejected literal imagery in favor of abstraction. Form for form's sake, however, held no interest for her. Instead she focused on abstraction in its strict sense, that of extracting the essence of a quality of emotion. A celebrated example was "Lamentation," the 1930 solo in which Miss Graham, encased in a tube of stretch jersey, created sharply angular shapes on a bench. She did not dance about grief, but sought to be what she called "the thing itself" or the embodiment of grief.
Miss Graham's gift for the distilled image ranged over her entire career. In "Cave of the Heart" (1946), her Medea was the personification of hate, consumed by the venom of jealousy as visualized in snakelike contours.
The quintessential Graham could be found in "Frontier" (1935), one of the choreographer's pieces on overt American themes. The solo initiated her 32-year collaboration with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi.
The set for "Frontier" was a fragment of a fence seemingly anchored by a rope behind. It had the same spareness and economy of Miss Graham's solo and the score of her music director and mentor of that time, Louis Horst. Noguchi noted in general that he had found in Miss Graham "a drive that motivated her to strip the dance to its stark rudiment."
 
Noguchi's Sets Sought 'A Limitless Illusion'
 Both artists shared an affinity for forms that looked abstract and were resonant with multiple meanings. Writing in 1984, Noguchi said that for "Frontier" he had "thought to catch the essential sculpture of space -- a limitless illusion." He continued: "This is the path I continued to investigate whenever Martha would call on me to rise to the occasion. She is the one who always came to me with her requirements and the myth she wished to encompass. My role was to respond."
Miss Graham's work revealed an integrated vision. She began using contemporary scores for the company she formed in 1929. After 1934, she tended to use commissioned music and was guided here by Horst, a composer who insisted that dance had a life independent of music and did not derive from it. Miss Graham herself, sometimes accused of using dance as mere aural decor, often said that she did not seek to interpret another art form -- that is, music.
Among the composers who wrote scores for Miss Graham were Samuel Barber, William Schuman, Gian Carlo Menotti and Aaron Copland, whose score for her 1944 classic, "Appalachian Spring," won the Pulitzer Prize.
Martha Graham, the eldest of three daughters, was born on May 11, 1894, in Allegheny, Pa., to George Graham, a physician who specialized in mental disorders, and the former Jane (Jenny) Beers, a descendant of Miles Standish. In 1908, the family moved to Santa Barbara, Calif.
 
Started Dance Training At 22, After Father Died
 In 1916, after the death of her father and after graduation from a junior college, the Cumnock School, Miss Graham enrolled in the Denishawn school in Los Angeles and then joined the Denishawn Company. Denishawn, organized by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, was then the only major dance company that worked outside the classical ballet tradition, and it became the incubating ground for such pioneering talents as Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Miss Graham herself.
John Murray Anderson saw Miss Graham with Denishawn and hired her for his Greenwich Village Follies in 1923 and 1924. But in those two years Miss Graham realized that neither Denishawn, with its exotic pretexts for dances, nor the commercial theater was right for her. At the invitation of Rouben Mamoulian, she joined the dance division of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she taught dance.
On April 18, 1926, she made her concert debut at the 48th Street Theater in New York with works that still showed the influence of Denishawn. "The idiom," the critic Robert Sabin recalled in 1953, "was still prevalently romantic and eclectic, but the spirit was new and as bracing as a salty sea wind."
Miss Graham taught in the early years in her studio at 66 Fifth Avenue, near 13th Street, and at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She assembled a company of women. Because the members had to support themselves, they would work on new works for nine months, then give a few recitals in New York and go on tour.
From her group, augmented by men in 1938 to 1939, came the next generation of modern dancers, choreographers and teachers: Anna Sokolow, Sophie Maslow, Pearl Lang, May O'Donnell, Erick Hawkins, Merce Cunningham and later Paul Taylor and John Butler. Miss Graham, who had a long-term relationship with Horst, was married in 1948 to Mr. Hawkins. They separated in the early 1950's and were later divorced.
 
Received Financial Help From Many Individuals
 Before World War II, Miss Graham took on outside assignments. In 1930, she was the Chosen One in Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski and choreographed by Leonide Massine. A few years later she collaborated on dramatic productions with Blanche Yurka, Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, and Archibald MacLeish.
Troubled by the recurring financial problems that were endemic to an art form struggling for acceptance, Miss Graham was helped over the years by individual patrons. Among them were Frances Steloff, founder of the Gotham Book Mart, whose $1,000 loan made the initial 1926 concert possible, Miss Cornell, Bethsabee de Rothschild, Lila Acheson Wallace and, most recently, Halston. Mrs. Wallace made it possible for the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary Dance to acquire the building at 316 East 63d Street, where the Graham school is situated.
In the early years, Miss Graham costumed herself and the women in her troupe in stretch jersey. She later referred to this time as her "long woolens" period. Her dances were spare and stark, testimony to her deep interest in ritual, and she was strongly influenced by the ceremonial Indian dances she had witnessed in the Southwest. These experiences were reflected in such works as "Primitive Mysteries" and "El Penitente," which remain in her company's repertory.
 
From American Themes To Ancient Mythology
 In the 1930's, Miss Graham was known for her American themes. "We must look to America to bring forth an art as powerful as America itself," she said, and produced such works as "American Document," "American Provincials," "Appalachian Spring," "Letter to the World" and "Salem Shore."
After 1946, she immersed herself in Hebrew and Greek mythology with "Cave of the Heart," "Night Journey," "Errand Into the Maze," "Judith," "The Witch of Endor," "Phaedra" and, most powerfully, the full-evening "Clytemnestra" of 1958. She picked up historical personages with legendary qualities, the Bronte sisters for "Deaths and Entrances" and Joan of Arc for "Seraphic Dialogue."
As the years progressed, Miss Graham was loath to leave the stage. Since she was the central figure on that stage, she eventually began to create roles for herself that were less physically demanding. After her retirement from dancing, her new works rarely focused on a protagonist.
Repeatedly acclaimed as a choreographer, she always considered herself a dancer first. After relinquishing her roles to younger dancers, she continued to direct her company. She made triumphant tours to the Far East and Europe under Government auspices and, in her 80's and 90's, increasingly traveled abroad with her company. Her tour last fall took in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.
 
Congressional Propriety Offended by 'Phaedra'
 It was on a European trip in 1962 that she ran afoul of two United States Representatives, Edna Kelly of Brooklyn and Peter Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. They saw "Phaedra" in Bonn and, apparently not knowing the Greek legend of a queen's passion for her stepson, protested that the work was too explicit to be a proper cultural export for the United States.
Although Miss Graham was identified with a new art form that initially rejected classical ballet as being inadequate for contemporary expression, she collaborated with ballet's leading personalities.
In 1959, the New York City Ballet presented "Episodes," consisting of two sections to Webern's music. George Balanchine choreographed one half and Miss Graham the other. In 1975, just before Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev appeared as guests in her company, she declared, "The war has ended," alluding to the perceived conflict between modern dance and ballet. Further proof came when Mikhail Baryshnikov appeared as a guest with her troupe from 1987 to 1989.
Among Miss Graham's awards were the first Guggenheim Fellowship given to a dancer; the Kennedy Center Honors; the Aspen Award in the Humanities; the Capezio Dance Award; the first Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance Festival Award to honor achievement in modern dance; the Meadows Award in the performing arts; the Handel Medallion of New York City; the Henry Hadley medal for contribution to American music, and the first National Medal of Arts.
In 1987, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave Miss Graham the Ingenio et Arti medal, a rarely awarded honor and her country's highest distinction for contributions to the arts and sciences. Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, personally decorated her in 1984 with the Legion of Honor at the Paris Opera. She received a number of honorary degrees, from Yale, Harvard and other universities.
Miss Graham liked to emphasize that her work and private life were separate. "I have always fought against any dramatization of my peculiarities or my personality," she said. Writing for The New York Times, Thomas Lask noted it was through her work "that she had, in William Faulkner's apt phrase, put a scratch on the face of eternity."
Martha Graham was living proof of her own adage: "No artist is ahead of his time. He is his time; it is just that others are behind the time."
Miss Graham leaves no immediate survivors.

Dwight Gooden: Video Star

BYLINE: By George Vecsey

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.

 BODY:
What with Fernando Valenzuela and Bo Jackson going down, it was refreshing to see the Mets finding room for one of their venerable heroes with a bit of a price tag to him.
Most clubs are scuttling older players before their contracts become official for the entire season at 2 P.M. today. But the Mets found it within their hearts and within their pocketbooks to retain good old Dwight Gooden, age 26. 
 And retain him in style. Gooden will be guaranteed an average of $5.15 million per year for 1992-93-94. This contract is much like those legendary trades "that will help both teams" in that it gives Gooden the money he deserves and it allows the Mets' officials to live with their own ideology.
The Mets have zealously fought off the dreaded four-year contract as if they were unilaterally protecting the national economy.
They could go to sleep last night assuring themselves that Roger Clemens is still the highest-paid player in the land at $5.38 million per year on a four-year contract they have labeled "incomprehensible" and "irresponsible."
But Gooden could actually pass Clemens in income if he pitches 500 innings in the next three years, cashes in a few clauses for winning personal awards -- and comes up with a hit video.
That is correct. The Mets will guarantee Gooden $250,000 per year for the rights to a video. He would get 20 percent of the profits.
Resplendent in matching silk black-and-tan walking shorts and top, Gooden attended the press conference, mulling over the possibilities.
Will he carry a synthesizer with him on the road to work on some rap music? Peering out from his ever-present sunglasses, Gooden said he would have artistic control of the video.
"If I don't like it. . . ." he said, not needing to finish the sentence.
There have been so many highlights, and Gooden has been such a monumental figure, that one could ask: What took the Mets so long?
They had "the heart and soul of the franchise," in the words of Al Harazin, executive vice president, looking good, and still they waited until the last week of spring training to sign him for figures they would have said were preposterous only a few weeks before.
Were they waiting to see if his hip fell apart, as Jackson's did, or his arm went dead, as Valenzuela's did?
"You think about it," Gooden said, "but you just have to stay within yourself."
When negotiations fell apart a month ago, Gooden recalled, his mother had urged him to sign for the Mets' price.
"You know how moms are," he said yesterday.
But Gooden and his agent, James Neader, could only assume the Mets would not lose Gooden the way they had calculatingly let Darryl Strawberry walk last fall.
"I talked with Darryl," Gooden said yesterday, "and we figured it was really two different things. After it broke down last season, Darryl didn't think they really wanted to sign him. He was gone."
But Gooden wanted to stay. The Mets had supported him in every way when he needed a rehabilitation clinic early in 1987, and he looked sincere when he said, "They think about my family, not just me." He added, "If you go somewhere else, maybe you like the organization, and maybe you don't."
When the players heard that chairs were being lined up for a press conference, they were relieved. "He deserves all he gets," Howard Johnson said.
Rarely is a player as respected as Gooden. In baseball, one thinks of Mickey Mantle on days when he was feeling well, and his grin and his confidence and his power inspired all the Yankees. But this is a pitcher, who rarely works more frequently than every fifth day.
"He can handle the bat and he can field his position," said Hubie Brooks.
"He's our Roger Staubach, or maybe our Doug Williams," said Howard Johnson. "Late in the game, he's the one guy you want out there."
One of the most elusive things about Gooden is his sense of humor. With Mantle, it was the coarse remark, shouted across the clubhouse. With Gooden, it is the sly remark on the bench, making teammates giggle.
"He has this way of walking through the clubhouse, talking to Tim Teufel and saying, 'Tuff, what's your game plan for today?' " said Daryl Boston. "Just having fun."
There have been weeks when Frank Viola was impossible to hit, and there is a school of thought that says, "Are you kidding? David Cone is absolutely the best pitcher on the team," and Sid Fernandez may be the best five-inning pitcher in baseball. But Gooden is the man.
"When you think about the Mets, you think about Doc," Brooks said. "He's one of those players you identify with a team."
And now the Mets will have their identity through 1994, coming soon at a video store near you.

HEADLINE: Pressed Private Colleges Reining In Tuition

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Squeezed by the recession and a shrinking number of high school graduates headed for college, private colleges and universities are trying to attract students by keeping tuition increases to their lowest levels in more than 15 years.
A few colleges are also making novel offers of financial aid. George Washington University will award scholarships based on admission test scores, Union College will cancel loans for graduates who take public service jobs and Wittenberg University is offering fixed-rate tuition. 
 But even with financial aid, many highly qualified students cannot afford to pay the private institutions' tuition rates, which can amount to $20,000 a year at some schools. Instead, these students are applying in increased numbers to public institutions where, despite increases forced by state budget deficits, tuition and fees can amount to less than $7,000.
 
Shift in Applications
 All colleges are essentially competing for the same pool of students, which has been steadily shrinking since the mid-1980's. This year applications dropped at many of the private institutions, while public universities reported increases, an indication of the shift toward less expensive institutions.
Joyce E. Smith, associate executive director of the National Association of College Admissions Counselors, said that with fewer applicants selective colleges might have to consider accepting students with weaker qualifications.
"It has been increasingly a challenge to enroll the size, academic quality and diversity of the class the university is looking for," said James J. Scannell, vice president of enrollments, placement and alumni affairs at the University of Rochester, where tuition will rise 6.6 percent for the fall semester while applications rose less than 1 percent. He said the inflated cost of private higher education -- in September it will cost $20,900 to attend Rochester for one year -- has become "a competitive disadvantage and a perceived barrier."
Applications to private institutions generally declined 5 percent to 15 percent from last year, although there are exceptions, like the Johns Hopkins University, Bard College and the University of Dayton, which say they showed substantial increases.
By contrast, applications were up this year at many public institutions, including the University of Kentucky, the University of Connecticut at Storrs and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Many colleges, private and public, have tried to make up for the declining number of high school applicants by recruiting nontraditional students. These include students a few years out of high school, adults looking to change careers and the elderly.
Private colleges have tried to limit increases in tuition. Throughout the 1980's tuitions rose about 10 percent a year, but this year many private colleges have limited the increase to about 6 percent, roughly the rate of inflation.
 
Fixed Costs and Inflation
 College administrators said fixed costs and inflationary increases kept them from forgoing tuition rises.
But Brown, Lehigh, the University of Chicago, St. Joseph's in Philadelphia and many other private institutions slowed the rate of tuition increase to their lowest levels in more than a decade. One exception is the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Mass., which kept its $20,045 yearly cost unchanged and says it will trim budgets and administrative expenses instead.
But even a slower rate of increase means that tuition in nearly all private institutions will rise substantially. Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pa., is raising its comprehensive fee -- tuition, room and board and student fees combined -- for the 1991-92 academic year by 4.5 percent, the smallest percentage since 1963, when a year's tuition cost $2,150. But the increase of $850 brings the total cost to $19,475 a year.
For students and their families, the joy of being accepted at such colleges sometimes lasts only until the bills start to show up.
"It was a total shock," said Kathleen I. Hunter of Wallingford, Conn. That was her reaction when she found out it would cost $21,850 for her daughter, Kathleen, to attend Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., next fall.
 
Deducting Financial Aid
 Rensselaer offered the Hunters $9,400 in financial aid, and when Miss Hunter applied for outside scholarships to help cover some of the remaining $12,000 yearly costs, she was surprised to find that the institute would deduct whatever she was awarded from what they had already offered her in aid.
Rensselaer officials said outside scholarships are always deducted from the institute's financial aid package, so that money can go to the students with the greatest need.
That did not assuage the Hunter family. Mr. Hunter is an electronic technician at a steel-finishing plant, and his wife cares for children at home. Their combined income is $50,000.
"The way the system is set up," Miss Hunter said, "if you're poor you get more aid, if you're rich you have the funds to pay for it, but if you're in the middle, like we are, you just don't get the money you need."
While private colleges wrestle with tuition and financial aid, public instititions reeling from severe budget cutbacks are raising their tuition higher and faster than at any time in the past decade.
Despite this, public systems remain far less expensive than private institutions and this year most received more applications than last year. In many cases, the students applying to the public schools were more qualified than in recent years, university administrators said.
In response to the shift in applications, and to the curtailment of Federal support for financial aid grants, private institutions are becoming more creative in offering financial support of their own. Many of the new programs focus on merit rather than financial need and therefore may benefit middle-income families.
George Washington University in Washington will award a $5,000-a-year scholarship to students who get a combined math and verbal test score of 1,200 out of a possible 1,600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test college admissions exam and who are in the top 20 percent of their class, and $3,000 a year for students who score 1,100 and rank in the top 25 percent of their class. The comprehensive cost of attending George Washington for a year is $22,833.
Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, is offering students a guaranteed four-year tuition rate of $13,658 annually, as against the uncapped rate of $12,792 for next fall. Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., has offered to cancel financial aid loans at the rate of 20 percent a year for students who work in public service jobs after graduation.
Starting in the fall, St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vt., where applications were off 15 percent from last year, will allow incoming students who graduate from two parochial high schools -- Rice High School in South Burlington and Mount Saint Joseph Academy of Rutland -- to deduct the $2,500 per year they paid for high school tuition from their $16,000 yearly college bills.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Is at 3-Week High; Oil Prices Also Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of copper futures jumped to a three-week high yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Traders seemed to be buying on the expectation of an economic recovery, which would presumably result in stronger demand for copper.
Copper futures settled 2.05 cents to 3.4 cents higher in New York, with the contract for delivery in April at $1.093 a pound. That was the highest close for the spot contract since March 13. 
 The burst of buying defied the market's fundamentals, which include high production and slack demand. Fred Demler, metals economist with Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said copper traders were "taking a longer-term view," expecting an economic recovery later in the year.
Oil prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange, largely on speculation that the nation's supply of gasoline would keep falling.
A weekly American Petroleum Institute report released after the close confirmed that expectation, but the decline of 478,000 barrels in American gasoline stocks was smaller than the market had anticipated.
The institute also reported a higher-than-expected 6.7-million-barrel rise in crude oil stocks and a 39,000-barrel decline in heating oil stocks -- a smaller decline than the market had expected.
Crude oil futures were 21 cents to 41 cents higher, with the May contract at $19.70 a barrel; heating oil was 0.63 cent to 0.78 cent higher, with May at 54.23 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.2 cents to 1.62 cents higher, with May at 67.72 cents a gallon; natural gas was 1.1 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with May at $1.42 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Silver futures also rose on the Commodity Exchange, extending the gains posted in the two previous sessions. Silver was 4.9 cents to 5.3 cents higher, with April at $3.989 an ounce.
Grain and soybean futures fell moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade in a move that analysts viewed as an inevitable correction after the sharp gains of the previous session.
Wheat futures were 2 cents to 3 1/2 cents lower, with May delivery at $2.9025 a bushel; corn was one-half cent to 1 cent lower, with May at $2.565 a bushel; oats were one-half cent lower to one-half cent higher, with May at $1.3125 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents lower, with May at $5.945 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops a Second Day; Interest-Rate Outlook Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar dropped for the second straight session yesterday amid speculation that interest rates might continue to fall in the United States.
Gold prices were mixed, falling in New York after rising overseas. Gold fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $358.50 an ounce, down $1.90 from Monday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $357.20, off $1.55. 
 Analysts said dollar traders feared that with March unemployment figures scheduled to be released on Friday, interest rates could be reduced again. If the jobless numbers show continued weakness in the economy, the Federal Reserve will be under more pressure to cut rates to stimulate business.
The dollar is supported by higher interest rates, so the prospects of lower yields are a bearish signal for the American currency.
Mike Faust, a foreign exchange analyst with MMS International in Chicago, said the Fed was also concerned about inflation and might choose to wait until March wholesale price figures were released.
But if the employment figures are weak enough, the Fed could act on interest rates immediately after the report is issued on Friday, he said.
Worries about interest rates helped end, at least temporarily, the recent surge in the dollar.
Mr. Faust said the dollar was also hurt by market rumors that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was concerned about the dollar's high levels.
The British pound advanced to $1.778 in New York, from $1.7685 late Monday. In earlier London trading, the pound rose to $1.7675, from $1.738 late Thursday.
The dollar slumped to 137.85 Japanese yen in New York from late Monday's 139.35. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 139.13 yen, down 1.47 yen from the late Monday rate, which had been its highest close there against the yen in nearly seven months.
Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 138.45 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.6705 German marks, down from 1.6725; 1.4185 Swiss francs, down from 1.4255; 5.6615 French francs, down from 5.66975; 1,245.5 Italian lire, up from 1,244.5, and 1.15515 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15785.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.6805 German marks, down from 1.7055; 1.426 Swiss francs, down from 1.455; 5.697 French francs, down from 5.782; 1.893 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9222; 1,253.25 Italian lire, down from 1,269.25, and 1.1563 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1585.

HEADLINE: Declining C.D. Yield Slows

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts have fallen for the fifth consecutive week. But the decline was less for the period that ended yesterday than in the previous two weeks.
New York banks, which have led most of the country in cutting the yields on certificates of deposit, are now cutting them by less, falling in stride with other markets. 
 Some analysts say that C.D. yields, which had been falling faster on indications that the economy was still slowing, have begun to fall by less because of mixed economic signals. The analysts say the mixed signals are preventing the Federal Reserve from easing short-term interest rates further.
 
3-Month Bill Down
 At the Treasury Department's weekly auction of short-term bills, which was held on Monday, average discount rates slipped after rising in the previous week. The results of the bill auctions often indicate the rates that many banks will eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
The three-month bill fell 6 basis points, to 5.8 percent, while the six-month bill fell 5 basis points, to 5.79 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The rates are at their lowest levels since early 1988.
In its weekly survey of New York-area banks, The Bank Rate Monitor noted anew that the larger cuts in yields continued to come from the savings institutions, with the spread between savings institutions and commercial banks narrowing each week.
The largest yield changes for the the New York area this week was at the Chemical Bank, which cut 32 basis points from its money market account, to 5.39 percent. First Nationwide, which had cut its money market account in the previous week, last week cut its three-month certificate by 25 basis points, to 6.25 percent, and its six-month certificate by 20 basis points, to 6.55 percent.
Commercial banks this week lowered money market accounts by 5 basis points, to 5.57 percent, and lowered three-month certificates by 3 basis points, to 6.01 percent. The six-month certificate was cut 2 basis points, to 6.17 percent.
At savings institutions, the average yield for a money market account was cut by only 3 basis points, to 5.8 percent, while a three-month C.D. was cut by 8 basis points, to 6.4 percent, and the six-month C.D. by 5 basis points, to 6.61 percent,
Yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area and around the country show the average money market account yield down 2 basis points, to 5.46 percent, with the average yield for a six-month certificate unchanged at 6.15 percent.

Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, April 3, 1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: A Better Economic Mood;
Many Say the Gulf Crisis Shook Confidence And Foresee a Recovery as Hope Revives

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The current recession may be the first in memory that can be attributed to a case of nerves. And now that confidence has come roaring back, signs are that an economic recovery is not far behind. But will the recovery be nearly as strong as the dramatic lift in consumer spirits?
 While other recessions since World War II resulted from knockout blows to income, like the 1973 Arab oil embargo, or overexuberant business and consumer spending, or blundering economic policy makers, this one seems to have started when the Persian Gulf crisis last August shook Americans' confidence in prospects for business and jobs. Consumers responded by cutting back sharply on big-ticket purchases, like cars and appliances; businesses slashed inventories and laid off workers.
 
Business Is Optimistic
 Success in the gulf has dispelled the gloom. Investors have been bidding stocks and the dollar sharply higher. The Dow Jones industrial average soared yesterday by 63.86 points, to 2,945.05, just 54 points from its record high. Several broader indexes, however, set records. [Page D1.] Business executives are optimistic about future sales. More important, consumers' expectations about future economic conditions have soared. One sign of that renewed faith: Consumers flocked back into the housing market in February. 
 None of this means that the economy will bounce back as smartly as confidence has. In fact, economists are expecting a modest recovery in line with a recession that many thought would be shorter and shallower than average. What's more, the recovery will have to wait until business stops slashing jobs and starts hiring again. That is not likely to happen before the summer, said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, He expects Friday's unemployment report to show that employers are still retrenching.
Pinning hopes of an economic revival on the recovery of nerve makes sense for the great many who believe that when the economy stumbled, psychology was the main culprit.
To be sure, the nation's eight-year economic expansion had already turned sluggish a year or so before Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait. The economy was thus more vulnerable to sudden swings in mood.
But in retrospect, many economists say the recession was not inevitable. "It wasn't necessary to have a recession," said Martin S. Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan.
Inventories were lean. Inflation was not speeding up. "None of the usual financial predecessors of recession have appeared to this day," said Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University. The gap between the yields on safe investments like Treasury bonds and riskier ones like commercial paper, which typically double or triple before downturns, never did widen much, for example.
Until August, most private forecasters expected the economic expansion to continue. And it was December before the Bush Administration, the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund concluded that the economy could not avoid a recession.
"Had we not run into the sharp contraction in consumer confidence, the odds were a good deal better than 50-50 that we would have skirted a recession," Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress in February. A traditional, shorthand definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of zero economic growth.
During the summer, the economy expanded. The G.N.P. rose at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Industrial production was up at a 3.6 percent rate. Private payrolls did not peak until August. And consumer income and spending kept climbing until October.
But faced with soaring oil prices after the Kuwait invasion, as well as the prospects of war, consumer confidence plunged to the lowest level in a decade between August and October.
As one Administration official put it: "The last two oil-supply disruptions -- the Iranian revolution and the Arab-Israeli war -- led to rapid inflation and sky-high interest rates. So people thought, erroneously as it turned out, 'Uh oh, here we go again.' "
Roger Brinner, director of research at DRI/McGraw-Hill, said, "If consumers hadn't panicked there wouldn't have been a recession."
 
Inventories and Jobs Cut
 Business panicked, too, helping make the slump a self-fulfilling prophecy. Companies slashed their inventories at the steepest rate in years. Manufacturers and service establishments alike laid off workers sooner than usual, which contributed to consumers' fears and also squeezed incomes.
In the view of many economists, neither higher oil prices nor the Administration's or the Federal Reserve's economic policies toppled the economy last fall. If anything, the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep a lid on inflation before the gulf crisis contributed to what most economists insist is the relatively shallow and short nature of this recession.
And the surge in oil prices turned out to be more of a shudder than a shock. "It was too small and lasted such a short time," said Richard Farmer, an economist at the Congressional Budget Office. "It didn't cause the recession."
Some economists have cited the deficit-cutting budget deal between the Administration and Congress in October as the source of the recession.
"Signs of a bear market emerged before the Persian Gulf crisis, but after Bush capitulated on taxes," said William C. Dunkelberg, dean of the School of Business Management at Temple University, in a recent Cato Institute discussion paper.
But the new taxes -- including a 5-cent increase on gasoline -- did not take effect until the end of the year. "Government policies can exert very bad influences, but they usually don't reach backward in time," said Norman B. Ture, director of the Institute of Research on the Economics of Taxation, in Washington.
What is more, the deal may have helped to haul down bond yields. "The confidence-restoring effects of the budget deal were positive," said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist at the World Bank.
 
Bank Regulators Criticized
 Other people blamed overzealous bank regulators who frightened bankers out of making loans. To be sure, real estate developers, home builders and small businesses -- especially in New England -- had trouble getting money. But weak commercial and industrial lending last year mostly reflected sluggish demand, said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
And borrowers relied more heavily on non-bank sources, like finance companies and commercial paper.
"The tightening of credit standards restricted the flow of credit from banks, not throughout the economy," said William Niskanen, president of the Cato Institute, a conservative research center in Washington. Private nonfinancial debt expanded 5.6 percent last year, about as fast as the economy.
Even the complaints about the Federal Reserve Board are not all that compelling. True, in July 1989, Mr. Greenspan made it clear that the central bank was attempting to wring out inflation by cooling off the economy.
Further, the money supply stagnated after the spring. "There would have been a recession with or without Kuwait," said Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University. "The Fed had put the economy in harm's way."
 
Rates Were Dropping
 But the timing of the recession demonstrates that the Federal Reserve was not to blame.
"The slowdown in money growth from June to the end of last year would not have had an effect in 1990," said Mr. Feldstein, the former chief economic adviser. And unlike other periods leading up to a recession, interest rates were heading down.
"The decline started more than a year before the business cycle peak, a pattern unique in postwar experience," Mr. Greenspan told Congress last month.
More to the point, bondholders may well have resisted efforts to push short rates down faster by bidding up yields on long-term bonds.
"The dollar was weak and interest rates were very low compared to European countries," said Robert J. Barro, an economist at Harvard University. "That makes it hard to blame the Fed."
Some economists, including Mr. Feldstein, fault the Federal Reserve for not easing credit more aggressively after the slump began. But many also give the central bank credit for preventing a more severe recession.
Consider the following: Inflation doubled in the year before the 1973 oil shock and reached 9 percent just before the 1979 shock. This time inflation was running around 4.5 percent, where it had been for several years. The fact that it was not raging out of control when oil prices took off meant that the Federal Reserve did not have to adopt the harsh policies of 1980 and 1981 that sent short-term interest rates as high as 20 percent.
"If we keep our recessions as mild as this one, we should generally deem our policy extremely successful," said Gregory Mankiw, an economist at Harvard University.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Up Slightly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Expectations that employment data to be released on Friday will show that the economy weakened further in March helped push prices of Treasury securities up modestly yesterday.
The gains, which were recorded across the maturity spectrum, came on thin volume. 
 "The whole market is starting to price in a pretty negative employment number," one government bond trader said.
"It also seems as if the market is getting a sense that because of the dollar's strength, the Fed may ease more readily than they otherwise might," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
After trading higher overseas, the dollar moved sharply lower against key currencies like the German mark in domestic trading.
 
Nonfarm Employment Data
 Estimates on the employment report vary, but most economists are projecting that non-farm payroll employment fell by around 200,000 last month. An increase in the unemployment rate, currently at 6.5 percent, is also expected.
Such numbers would seem to cast doubt on the prospects of a nascent rebound in the economy, in contrast to recent reports on housing and consumer confidence that have raised hopes among some analysts that the worst of the recession is over.
That view is not universally shared, however.
"I don't think we are as close to coming out of this as many people would like to believe," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at the Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corporation. "Most of the data pointing to recovery are soft, peripheral or indirect" indicators, he said. "We have gotten a small bounce, but it seems awfully flimsy to paint a recovery scenario on."
Market participants said that prices were also influenced by the issuance of a number of new corporate debt deals.
As a hedge, underwriters sold Treasury issues as the corporate bonds were priced, and then bought the Treasuries back later as the new corporate securities were purchased by customers.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 7/32, up 13/32, to yield 8.21 percent, down from 8.26 percent late Monday.
 
Treasury Note Issues
 Among Treasury note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 6/32, up 1/4 point, to yield 8.01 percent. And the 7 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 10/ 32, up 2/32, to yield 6.95 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.74 percent, down three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.75 percent.
Among the issues priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market was a $300 million issue of three-year notes offered by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation.
The 8 percent notes, which mature April 1, 1994, were priced at $99.833, to yield 8.063 percent, 84 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 7/8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Two Wall Street firms also priced new issues.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for an offering of $200 million worth of seven-year notes for Salomon Inc., its parent.
The 9 3/8 percent notes, which mature April 15, 1998, were priced at $99.75, to yield 9.425 percent, 1.48 percentage points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-2 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
Morgan Stanley Group offered $200 million of five-year notes through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company, the firm's principal subsidiary.
The 8 7/8 percent notes, which mature April 1, 1996, were priced at $100, or par, 1.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the State of Georgia offered $274.5 million in general obligation bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Chase Securities Inc. won the issue.
Bonds with maturities from 2002 to 2011 were not reoffered.
Series B bonds were reoffered with yields from 5 percent on securities maturing in 1993 to a maximum of 5.60 percent in 1996.
Maturities on series C bonds range from 1993 to 2004. Yields on those securities range from 5.10 percent to 6.50 percent.
Investment bankers involved in the transaction said that as of late yesterday just under $70 million worth of bonds remained unsold.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated Aaa by Moody's and AA+ by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by 1/4 point to 3/8 point in fairly active trading.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal issues said that prices of most widely quoted bonds were essentially unchanged.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
BUSH NOT PRESSING KUWAIT ON REFORM

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMORADA, Fla., April 2

 BODY:
Although frustrated by the slow pace of political and economic revival in Kuwait, President Bush believes there is little he can do to force democratic reform and is not putting any heavy pressure on the Emir, Administration officials said today.
Troubled at first by the fact that the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, took so long to return to his country after the fighting stopped, American officials are now somewhat embarrassed by his resumption of his opulent way of life, a problem made more acute by news reports that the Army Corps of Engineers has helped refurbish a palace for him in Kuwait City. 
 American military and diplomatic officials have been pressing the Kuwaiti Government to prevent further attacks against Palestinians like those that occurred in the first weeks after the end of Iraqi occupation, American offiials say. [Page A8.]
 
Gentle Prodding
 Administration officials say they believe the Emir must make some reforms to calm the political turmoil in his country. But Mr. Bush is anxious not to appear to be meddling in Kuwait's internal affairs and has therefore confined his advice so far to gentle prodding in private correspondence, the officials said.
The issue is so sensitive, they said, that Mr. Bush avoided using the word "democracy" in his most recent letter to the Emir, which was sent about a week ago. Instead, the letter talked about the need to pursue "political reconstruction" as well as economic reconstruction of Kuwait, officials said.
White House officials, in this Florida Keys resort for Mr. Bush's vacation, confirmed that the President had written to the Emir, but refused to discuss the contents of the letter.
The United States has tried not to make too much of the issue of political changes in Kuwait, to avoid focusing attention on other Arab allies, like Saudi Arabia, which has political issues similar to those of Kuwait. With Iraq already inflamed by civil warfare, the United States also does not want to do anything that could destabilize the Kuwaiti Government, officials said.
Beyond that, the United States does not want to be seen as interfering, officials aid. "You can't pick out one country to lean on over another," one official said. "We've already said we're not going to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs, and they're the ones we fought the war with."
Another official added, "Of all the countries not to mess around in, Kuwait is at the top of the list. After all, the war was fought over that very issue: another country forcing its will on Kuwait."
 
Resentments Among Kuwaitis
 But Administration officials acknowledge that just by its presence the United States is already deeply involved in the future of Kuwait, despite the Administration's efforts to present a public image of not interfering.
The political situation in Kuwait is one of several challenges facing Mr. Bush as he struggles to turn the military victory in Kuwait into a diplomatic success, and has become something of an international and domestic political puzzle for the Bush Administration.
American concerns about Kuwait have been heightened by the obvious resentment of many of those who stayed in Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation toward Kuwaitis who fled, including the Emir. The capital has been marked by unrest and political turmoil since the war ended, adding a sense of urgency to longstanding calls for making the country more democratic.
Since the early days of the gulf crisis, Administration officials have been acutely aware that the Kuwaiti political system would be a difficult political issue for Mr. Bush. For months, they have taken pains to counter arguments that the United States was sending American troops into combat to restore an absolute ruler to his throne, asserting instead that there were larger issues of international law at stake.
But to satisfy public opinion domestically and in Arab countries like Egypt, where the division between rich and poor in the Middle East has long been a political sore, the Administration has established a policy of encouraging political reform in Kuwait.
"It's not at the top of our list of priorities, but it is important to us," said one Administration official.
From a political standpoint, the White House is aware that the situation in Kuwait could become one of the tests by which Mr. Bush's "new world order" is judged.
 
Bush Stressed Dual Emphasis
 Shortly after American and allied forces drove the Iraqi Army from Kuwait and then stopped the fighting Feb. 27, the Emir wrote to Mr. Bush to express his thanks. Mr. Bush responded about a week ago with a letter that, although it was not immediately made public, seemed intended to address more than one audience.
"The letter said that the President understands that Kuwait has difficult problems of political and economic reconstruction that it faces," one official said. "He stressed the need for Kuwait to move forward on both fronts at once. The word 'democracy' never entered into it as I recall."

HEADLINE: Higher Fees for Doctors May Not Help Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
When Medicaid was established, many members of Congress assumed it would supplant charity care provided by doctors at no charge. But now 26 years later, Medicaid fees lag so far behind the costs of providing care that some doctors offer free care without bothering to file Medicaid claims and others do not serve Medicaid patients at all.
Medicaid, which finances health care for poor people, and Medicare, for the elderly, were created by the same law. But Congress views the two constituencies in completely different ways, and so do doctors. 
 A report this week by a Federal advisory panel, the Physician Payment Review Commission, documented huge disparities between Medicaid and Medicare payments to doctors. The report helps lay a foundation for Congressional efforts to increase reimbursements to doctors, especially for basic health services like maternity and child care.
But the solutions are not easy because the problems are deeply rooted in the history of the Medicaid program, which serves 27 million Americans at a cost of $51.5 billion for the Federal Government and more than $39 billion for the states this year.
 
A Rule Not Enforced
 From the beginning, the Federal Government stipulated that doctors should be paid their usual fees under Medicare, but there was no such requirement under Medicaid, which gives wide discretion to the states. Since 1979, the Federal Government has required that states pay doctors enough to assure that their services are available to Medicaid recipients to the same extent as to the general population. But the Government has not enforced this rule. The failure suggests that Federal and state officials do not see the disparity in payments as a serious problem and feel little pressure to resolve it.
Congress and doctors have always been ambivalent about Medicaid, unsure whether it is a health or welfare program, and this confusion about purposes and goals has hobbled the program.
"It's just not economically feasible" to see Medicaid patients, said Dr. Isaac Novick, a 44-year-old Brooklyn dermatologist, who reported that he gets $62 for an initial office visit with a patient under Medicare, as against only $12 under Medicaid. "The gap between the two programs has widened," he said.
Medicaid has always been a stepchild of the nation's health care system. Barbara D. Matula, director of the Medicaid program in North Carolina, said that even when a little extra Medicaid money is available, many states distribute it to hospitals and nursing homes, rather than to doctors.
Gary J. Clarke, director of the Medicaid program in Florida, said: "Doctors aren't really interested in seeing Medicaid patients. As a result, they don't lobby their state legislatures for fee increases. Hospitals and nursing homes do lobby to assure they have adequate payment."
In a strange way, it may make sense for some states to funnel money to hospitals or clinics without increasing Medicaid fees for doctors.
James R. Tallon Jr., leader of the Democratic majority in the New York State Assembly, said: "In many states, the privately practicing physician is not the central or most likely source of care for a Medicaid patient. The Medicaid patient more often gets his or her care through an institutional provider, a community health center, a hospital outpatient department or, regrettably, an emergency room."
Medicaid payments to doctors thus become "a secondary political question," said Mr. Tallon, who has devoted much of his legislative career to work on health care issues.
Gail R. Wilensky, who supervises both Medicaid and Medicare as head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, said the lower Medicaid payments to doctors were apparently not having an adverse effect on Medicaid recipients' access to care.
 
Politics of Health Care
 "Medicaid recipients use health care at rates comparable to the general population, or higher, but not always in the same place," she said, observing that poor people often go to a clinic or a hospital rather than to a private doctor's office for their care.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, a leading architect of Medicaid, said today that the commission report showed that "Medicaid is grossly underpaying doctors in many states." But Mr. Waxman, a California Democrat, said he was reluctant to mandate higher fees for doctors because he feared that states would "make up for that cost by cutting back on eligibility."
The politics of health care are tricky. Much as they may wish to improve health care for poor people, lawmakers see no need to increase doctors' income. Doctors' net earnings from the practice of medicine averaged $155,800 in 1989, the American Medical Association says.
Governors and other state officials who worry about the cost of Medicaid insist that higher payments to doctors would not necessarily improve access to health care for poor people. Sara Rosenbaum, a health policy specialist at the Children's Defense Fund, agreed. "Even with a dramatic increase in fees, private physicians will play a very limited role in care of the poor," she said.
The American Hospital Association says that nine out of 10 hospitals lose money caring for Medicaid patients. Medicaid paid about 90 percent of the cost of such care from 1980 to 1985, but payments now cover less than 78 percent of costs, the association says.
Dr. John M. Eisenberg, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, suggested that "if we cannot provide an across-the-board increase in Medicaid payments to doctors, it might be desirable to offer a bonus to those who have a large proportion of Medicaid patients in their practice." Medicare already pays extra to hospitals serving "a disproportionate share" of low-income patients.
But Dr. Eisenberg, a member of the Physician Payment Review Commission, said, "We should not be so naive as to think that if we raise Medicaid fees to the Medicare level, we will suddenly get a group of doctors going to practice in the inner city who are of the same caliber as doctors practicing in wealthier locations."

HEADLINE: On Connecticut Tax Plan, Town Mutters, What Next?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMDEN, Conn., April 2

 BODY:
Sandy Maloney's outrage at the idea of a state income tax is passionate and personal, aimed at the man she believes is nothing less than a turncoat: Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
"Whatever day he wants to come and watch my kids, that will be fine with me," said Mrs. Maloney, who says she will have to give up staying home with her two small children and go back to work if Mr. Weicker's proposed income tax becomes law. The tax, she said, would cost her family $1,000 a year, money she says they do not have. 
 But like so many other voices in this town and others like it across Connecticut, Mrs. Maloney's mixes anger with anxiety and confusion. She has seen stores close, and one of her relatives was in the now moribund construction business. She does not know how much worse things might get, or what actions by the state would push things one way or another.
"As much as I'm concerned about the income tax," she said finally, "I'm more concerned about the economy."
Hamden, an older suburb of about 52,000 people just north of New Haven, has the economic jitters, a malady with its own implications as towns like it consider Mr. Weicker and his budget proposals.
In the last six months, Hamden has lost more than 35 businesses, mostly stores. Fifteen others are operating "month to month," Mayor John L. Carusone said.
Welfare cases have increased fivefold in the last year, to 130. More than 500 tax liens have been filed against homeowners who cannot meet their property taxes -- double the usual amount in a 12-month period.
Concern over jobs has been compounded by the proposed deep cuts in state aid to towns that are part of Mr. Weicker's budget package. Hamden would lose about $3 million, in a budget of $90 million, requiring higher property taxes or local budget cuts.
 
Worried About Layoffs
 On Monday, the picture darkened further when both New Haven and the state announced layoffs that are sure to be felt here; New Haven cut 220 workers, the state 2,600. More than 600 state and New Haven employees live in Hamden, according to the Greater New Haven Labor Council.
In such an environment, the income-tax proposal is just one more thing to worry about for many people here.
"There's so much confusion now, and that's what's bad," said Mayor Carusone, a Democrat who has served in Town Hall for the last four years. "Everybody's in the dark."
Some people believe that the Weicker strategy counted on diffusing anger over an income tax by cultivating anger and confusion in other parts of the budget package.
"What Lowell has done is cut all the emotional stuff," said State Senator Philip S. Robertson, a Republican who represents part of Hamden.
 
Complaint of the Moment
 In the last few weeks, he said, his mail has shifted away from tirades over the income tax -- though he still receives some -- to tirades over Mr. Weicker's plan to eliminate local subsidies that have helped towns pay bus transportation costs for parochial and other private schools.
"You get people to yell and scream and say, 'You can't cut that,' and you make an income tax even bigger than the one proposed," Mr. Robertson said.
At Town Hall -- where "The Impossible Dream" rang out from the bell tower at noon during the week before Easter -- Mr. Carusone said he wants everyone to blame Hartford, if not Mr. Weicker, for the problems in town.
But he tilts in the opposite direction of many residents: He thinks Mr. Weicker's income tax does not go far enough, and he has announced his support for a progressive income tax, similar to New York's, with a rate that would rise with income.
A progressive tax, he argues with any resident who will listen, would raise even more money for the state, thus allowing property-tax relief to towns like Hamden. Mr. Weicker's plan calls for a flat 6 percent tax on all income over $25,000 for a family or over $12,500 for an individual.
To a certain extent, business leaders and political leaders also seem to be at each other's throats over the implications of Mr. Weicker's plans. The Democratic majority on the 15-member legislative council in Hamden, for example, is "pretty well fractured," said one member, Pasquale Corso, a Democrat who opposes Mr. Weicker's income-tax plan, not to mention the Mayor's.
Some business executives have expressed tentative support for the Governor's income-tax plan, echoing the view of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce, which includes Hamden. That group has endorsed the Weicker plan on the condition that it carries through on its proposals to cut business taxes and spending.
 
Income Tax Called Inevitable
 "I think most of the business people here would support what Weicker is trying to do if the cuts are left alone," said Edward Fred Hirsch, a retired executive who is considered a sort of dean of Hamden's business community. "The people I deal with all feel that the income tax was inevitable."
Mr. Weicker, who was inaugurated in January as a third-party governor with no members of his own fledging Connecticut Party in the General Assembly, quickly proposed a plan to overhaul the state's fiscal system, erase a huge budget deficit and stimulate business in a single throw of the dice.
His program would lower the sales tax, the corporate profits tax and the taxes on income from dividends, interest and capital gains. An income tax would make up the difference. Mainly because of the lowered sales tax, which would be cut to 4.25 percent, from 8 percent, and because state income taxes are deductible from itemized Federal tax returns, state budget officials say that people earning $40,000 or less would be better off, at least initially.
"In my district, a middle-class district, the vast majority I feel would gain substantially," said Representative Ronald L. Smoko, a Democrat who represents the south end of Hamden.
But he acknowledged that many people here simply do not believe that. "They're telling me seven- and eight-to-one, 'Representative Smoko, I don't want it,' " he said.
Mr. Smoko, a member of the Assembly's joint Finance Revenue and Bonding Committee, which will have to vote on some sort of budget plan this month, said he had not decided which side he would take. Intellectually, he said, he favors some tax-reform measure, though not necessarily the Governor's. Does he vote his conscience or do what his constituents tell him?
Fatalists here say it does not much matter. "Once they start talking about something like that, you know eventually it's going to happen," said Yvon Theriault, owner of the Sandwich Board, a breakfast and lunch restaurant. But he said that if the General Assembly were to lower the sales tax "and keep it there," people would put up with an income tax.
Others say that the surge of activity in Hartford is in itself a signal of hope, and that almost any direction is better than the feeling of drift that persisted here before Mr. Weicker's bombshell.
"Everyone has gone on with the feeling of, 'Well, what will happen?' " said Richard M. Nemergut, owner of The Bike Rack. "It's almost better to see it happen than to get ready for it."

HEADLINE: Woman Cleared After Drug Use in Pregnancy

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 2

 BODY:
A Michigan appeals court today ruled that a women should not stand trial on charges of delivering cocaine to her newborn son through the umbilical cord in a case that civil libertarians said could set the tone for future cases involving pregnant women who abuse drugs.
In a unanimous decision, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the state's argument that Kimberly Hardy, a 24-year-old unemployed factory worker from Muskegon, passed cocaine to her son Areanis in a way that constituted criminal delivery of drugs. The charge arose from Ms. Hardy's use of crack just hours before her son's birth. 
 The court decision overturned a lower court ruling that had ordered Ms. Hardy to stand trial. It was the highest level ruling yet on the question of whether a mother's drug use during pregnancy and it's effect on a child should be criminal matter, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
"Today's decision should effectively put an end to a vicious and counterproductive prosecutorial tactic," said Howard Simon, executive director of the Civil Liberties Union in Michigan. "The practical effect of this kind of prosecution is to drive pregnant women from prenatal care. That is a horrible consequence."
 
'Health Care Crisis'
 Tony Tague, the Muskegon County Prosecutor, stood by his 1989 decision to charge Ms. Hardy in the autumn of 1989, and said he would appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court.
"This is a major health care crisis, and we must use whatever means we can to reach a solution," said Mr. Tague. "When the drug war is making casualties out of newborn children, it requires action."
Drug abuse by pregnant women has become a volatile reproductive rights issue. Since 1987, about 60 criminal cases have been set in motion in 19 states and the District of Columbia against women for abusing drugs during pregnancy. The charges include criminal child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and manslaughter.
Ms. Hardy was charged with criminal delivery of drugs, which is normally applied to drug traffickers. Walter Connolly Jr., the lead defense lawyer, argued that the law was wrongly applied to Ms. Hardy.
"People were not put on notice that pregnant women could be prosecuted," Mr. Connolly said. "The legislature never intended it to be applied to pregnant women."
Civil libertarians argue that the main problem with such cases is that pregnant women are often ineligible for the very drug treatment programs that would prevent the abuse prosecutors are aiming at.
 
'Pregnancy Police'
 "This is an attempt to punish and make examples of women who can't get help for their addiction problems," said Lynn Paltrow, a senior staff counsel on the A.C.L.U.'s Reproductive Freedom Project. "Prosecutors say they are protecting babies and are tough on drug abuse, when all they're doing is harassing women, punishing them for not getting treatment that is not available to them in the first place. We're creating pregancy police."
Last year, Jennifer Johnson, a Florida woman, became the first woman charged and convicted on a drug-delivery charge involving a baby. She was sentenced to a year in a drug treatment program and 14 years of probation, including court-supervised prenatal care if she ever becomes pregnant again. Her case is now being appealed.
Ms. Hardy, who entered a drug treatment program shortly after her son's birth, says she has been drug-free for 18 months and her son and two other children have been returned to her after months of foster care. She expressed relief at the decision, but also misgivings.
"If I'd had known things would have turned out this way I would have taken the easier, softer way out and not told anybody," said Ms. Hardy, who admitted crack use to her doctor. "What woman wouldn't be afraid to tell her doctor if she had the threat of prosecution hanging over her?"

HEADLINE: Grumman Will Cut 1,900 Jobs, and L.I. Will Be Hit Hardest

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
The Grumman Corporation announced yesterday that it would eliminate 1,900 jobs, about three-fourths of them on Long Island, because of cuts in defense spending and a need to trim expenses to become more competitive.
The aerospace and transportation manufacturer, based in Bethpage, L.I., said the reductions amounted to 7.4 percent of its work force of 25,600. The development dealt another blow to the metropolitan area's economy, since Grumman is Long Island's largest private employer, with 14,600 workers there. 
 The company, which builds the Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter and A-6 bombers, said that 1,200 to 1,300 employees would be laid off in an action affecting virtually all of its manufacturing groups. The remaining 600 to 700 jobs will be eliminated through attrition.
 
Layoffs Start This Month
 Several hundred layoffs will take effect this month, Grumman said, and the rest will be spread throughout the year. It is the first major job reduction by Grumman since December 1988, when it moved to eliminate 3,100 jobs.
In a letter to all of Grumman's employees, Renso L. Caporali, the company's chairman, said that Pentagon spending cuts had led to fewer orders for its aircraft and other products. Among other things, he said, there are no new orders for the F-14 in the Federal budgets for fiscal 1991 or 1992.
At the same time Mr. Caporali said that Grumman needed to lower the prices of its products to remain competitive. The company had revenues of some $4 billion last year.

HEADLINE: Rights Movement in Struggle For an Image as Well as a Bill

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 2

 BODY:
As Congress prepares to reconsider civil rights legislation vetoed last fall by President Bush, groups pressing for passage of the bill find themselves facing a second and ultimately more crucial battle: one to define the image, agenda and relevance of the civil rights movement itself.
Heads of traditional civil rights organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference are increasingly concerned that for many whites, "civil rights" now means preferential treatment for minorities rather than equality under the law. Even some supporters of the movement worry that to focus on the civil rights bill, with its legalistic tangles, is to distract attention from the more urgent issues of poverty and despair afflicting minorities and the poor. 
 Supporters of the measure bitterly dispute that it is a "quota bill," as President Bush said when he vetoed a nearly identical bill last year. The current bill, meant to overturn six Supreme Court rulings that made it harder for workers to win employment discrimination suits, expressly outlaws quotas. But critics say the only way for employers to avoid lawsuits would be to use de facto race and sex quotas.
The current argument over the civil rights bill -- and the defensive posture of its supporters -- symbolizes the difficulties the civil rights movement has faced since the 1970's in enunciating a clear, compelling moral message able to mobilize minorities without alienating whites.
"The power of the civil rights movement under Martin Luther King was its universalism," said Cornel West, head of the African-American studies program at Princeton University. "Now, instead of the civil rights movement being viewed as a moral crusade for freedom, it's become an expression of a particular interest group. Once you lose that moral high ground, all you have is a power struggle, and that has never been a persuasive means for the weaker to deal with the stronger."
There is ample evidence that quotas have become less popular with Americans.
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said polling for his group indicates strong support for the traditional civil rights agenda, including affirmative action, as long as it does not include quotas.
New York Times polls indicate that support for any preferential employment practices has slipped significantly. When respondents were asked in May 1985 if they favored preference in hiring or promotion for blacks in areas where there had been discrimination in the past, 42 percent said "yes" and 46 percent said "no." Asked the same question in December 1990, 32 percent said "yes" and 52 percent said "no."
 
'At a Crucial Juncture'
 As many civil rights veterans prepare to meet here on Thursday to mark the 23d anniversary of the death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and to plot strategy for the future, there is widespread recognition that the movement has image problems, particularly among whites.
"I think we're at a crucial juncture in terms of how we think about civil rights as a country," said Geoffrey Garin, a Washington poll-taker who recently did research for the leadership conference. "If civil rights is defined as quotas, it's a losing hand. It it's defined as protection against discrimination and efforts to promote opportunity, then it will remain a mainstream value in American life."
The question has received increasing attention over the past year because of Mr. Bush's veto and the prominence of quotas and racial preferences as issues in the political races of State Representative David Duke in Louisiana and United States Senator Jesse Helms in North Carolina.
Some civil rights figures say the current environment is in keeping with the nation's historical attitudes.
"I don't think America was ready to end segregation," said Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the N.A.A.C.P. "I don't think it has ever been ready to extend full equality. I can't think of anything we've gained as black people that has not come without a struggle."
But many in the movement acknowledge it now faces daunting obstacles. It faces a White House and a Supreme Court hostile to much of its agenda. It faces a tough economic climate in which many whites feel gains by minorities may come at their expense.
Perhaps most important, it faces problems that are national, not regional. They are problems that lack the clear solutions and obvious villains of the civil rights movement 30 or 35 years ago in the South.
"The issues in the 1950's were very simple -- whether you sit in a restaurant or whether you can vote," said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which spearheaded the civil rights movement under the leadership of Dr. King. "And the opposition was defending the indefensible and doing it by very offensive means. Now we have to find a way to simplify very complicated issues, and we haven't been able to do it yet."
Mr. Neas said many of the current problems of the civil rights movement reflect the degree to which its critics are trying to shape perceptions of the movement.
"The right wing has not been able to defeat civil rights bills on their merits, so they have always attempted to convert the debate to a debate over quotas when all these issues have nothing to do with quotas," Mr. Neas said.
He pointed to a broad array of bills passed over the past decade and by the most recent Congress, including legislation for the handicapped and bills on child care, the minimum wage and family leaves for workers as evidence of a broad-based movement whose agenda goes far beyond concern about discrimination. Supporters of the current civil rights bill are emphasizing its protection for women and other potential discrimination victims.
But he said its message has been distorted by opponents to the point that a bill that forbids quotas is labeled a quota bill; a far-ranging agenda of social, legal and economic programs is invariably debated in terms of affirmative action and racial preferences, and the considerable gains in civil rights legislative over the past decade are often ignored.
But critics, including conservative blacks, say the movement has lost touch with the most important issues affecting blacks and minorities. They say it was civil rights groups, not their critics, who made the civil rights bill their main legislative priority for this session of Congress.
"Mark Twain once said that if the only tool you have is a hammer then all problems look like nails," said Robert Woodson, a black conservative who heads the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise. "They are confronting a massive deterioration of the moral interior of the black community and instead of addressing the issue, they're assuming all the problems result from a retreat on civil rights. The civil rights agenda has nothing to do with the deterioration of life for low-income black people."
And others say the perceptions of civil rights stem from the degree to which the movement has come to rely on race-based remedies that in practice, if not in theory, often result in preferential programs.
"The insistence on quota-type remedies by the civil rights lobby is what keeps that issue alive," said Clint Bolick, the white director of the Landmark Center for Civil Rights, a conservative legal group in Washington. "Ben Hooks created David Duke, and we're going to see a lot more David Dukes until we finally move away from that issue."
 
Main Agenda Appears the Same
 There are few signs that the traditional civil rights groups are rethinking their main agenda. In pushing for the bill, many say racism is so deeply imbedded in American life that aggressive measures in the workplace to overcome both its legacy and continuing aspects of discrimination are essential. They say the movement cannot afford to sit back and allow the Supreme Court to take back hard-fought gains that affect millions of workers.
"Racial fairness in this country is essentially counter-cultural," said Roger Wilkins, the longtime commentator on racial issues, who teaches history and American culture at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "Because of the weight of our history, for institutions and individuals to be racist is kind of like water flowing downhill. And in order to make water not flow downhill you have to make a dam. You have to do something counter-cultural to stop people from doing something that is not the normal, easy thing to do."
Many in the movement say it is the degree of resistance from conservatives in the White House and elsewhere that is draining attention and resources from the most pressing problems now afflicting minorities and the poor.
"The principal tragedy of the past 10 years has been that we've had to spend so much time on rear-guard actions, refighting battles won in the 1960's and 1970's, we haven't been able to fully address the economic justice issues that are the ones we need to address today," Mr. Neas said.
And many in the civil rights movement accuse the critics and the news media of unfairly focusing the debate on the concerns of aggrieved whites.
"We have had preference programs in this country, and we still have them, and the preferred are white men," Mr. Wilkins said. "But somehow in the debate all the victims are white men worried that black people are going to take their jobs. The only place in America where blacks have taken jobs in a major way from whites is the National Basketball Association."
 
Change in Focus Is Sought
 But some publicly and privately lament the degree to which the movement has failed to dramatize the most pressing problems of the poorest of the poor.
"I would want to focus more on the plight of children, more on the plight of the elderly, more on the plight of workers experiencing downward mobility," said Professor West of Princeton, who said he supports the civil rights bill but thinks it is not the most effective focus for the movement. "I would want to know what Bush says about the fact that one of two black children are poor and one of five in America. Those are fundamental issues that lend themselves to a moral force far beyond that of the black middle class trying to get into the mainstream."
Still, even bitter critics of the civil rights organizations, like Mr. Woodson, say opposition to the civil rights agenda rings hollow unless the opponents can offer other ideas to address the continuing inequities in American life.
"Conservatives don't have a legitimate right to complain unless they come up with an alternative," Mr. Woodson said. "Many of them opposed a lot of the civil rights legislation in its infancy, and now suddenly they're for a color-blind society. That doesn't hold much water."

HEADLINE: Dow Rises To 2,945.05, Up by 63.86

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
The prospect of lower interest rates plus rising hopes for an economic recovery helped to push stocks sharply higher yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 63.86 points and many broader averages reached record highs.
There were reports of heavy buying by American and foreign institutional investors. 
 Increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve Board may act to reduce interest rates drove bond prices higher and carried over into stocks. Traders also said that new confidence in the economy, bolstered by the recent surge in the dollar, was a big factor in the gains.
The jump in the bellwether Dow average, the top-30 blue chips, represented a 2.2 percent increase and was its biggest rise, in both point and percentage terms, since mid-February. The average closed at 2,945.05, which is less than 55 points from the magical 3,000. Many people on Wall Street view that level as something akin to the peak of Mount Everest.
 
Other Gauges Soaring
 Although the Dow came up well short of its record 2,999.75, reached last July, all-time highs were set by the New York Stock Exchange composite index, the New York Stock Exchange industrial index, the Nasdaq composite, the Nasdaq industrial index, the Standard & Poor's 500 and the S.& P. industrial index.
Except for the American Stock Exchange, where the advance was much less than 1 percent, prices were strong almost everywhere.
The Russell 2,000, basically a small-stock index, did not break its record of 180.78, established in October 1989, but did set a 1991 high of 172.64.
Trading volume jumped to a strong 189.5 million shares from 144 million the day before. Advancing stocks led declining ones by more than 2.5 to 1.
"The market's alive with speculation and gossip about a Fed easing," said Robert T. Falconer, senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, the government-bond house.
The speculation was prompted, he said, by the expectation that new employment figures due Friday would be disappointing. Some have said the report could show job losses of 200,000 to 250,000.
"Frankly, I disagree with it; I don't see the same decline in payroll," Mr. Falconer said.
About the flood of milestones, William M. LeFevre, market strategist for Tucker, Anthony Inc., the brokerage, said: "This is an important event. People who track this stuff are more cheered when the broader indexes set records than when it's just the Dow."
"Historically," he said, "April is the cruelest month for the stock market, but it isn't going to be this time."
 
Strong European Buying
 He attributed yesterday's strong gains in part to the fact that many European traders who had been on holiday on Easter Monday were back at work yesterday.
Other European houses in New York said they had not seen particularly heavy foreign buying. But Mr. Lefevre, noting that Tucker, Anthony has its own overseas offices, pointed out that Philip Morris had jumped 2 7/8, to 69 1/2 in heavy trading, that General Electric had climbed 2 3/8, to 72 1/8, again in heavy trading and that Merck had moved ahead 3 1/4, to 108 3/4 -- and that "these are the kinds of stocks Europeans like to own."
"I think there was European buying," he said.
Bonds, he said, no longer offer competition "and literally hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term parking places are looking for some place to go."
 
Changing Attitudes
 Asked about foreign buying, Edwin Walczak, chief investment officer for Vontobel U.S.A., the American arm of Swiss banking interests, said that while he had not seen strong buying, the economic slowdown in Germany was strong enough to raise investor interest in the United States.
"The main thing that's changed," Mr. Walczak said, "is their attitude. They see the U.S. now as a place they can play. They think the economy is going to recover, and that makes them more confident on the dollar." 
John A. Conlon Jr., head of stock trading for Rothschild Inc., the American arm of the British investment firm, remarked, "You had the whole world looking for a decline, based on yesterday's decline."
 
Competing Influences
 But at the same time, he said: "You've got a strong seasonal consideration -- new pension money coming in at the start of the quarter. When you have bearish expectations combined with new cash, you've got an explosive combination that takes the market up."
Birinyi Associates, which tracks such trading, said that in spite of two selling spurts, eight waves of program buying lifted the Dow blue chips a cumulative 23 points throughout the day. The heaviest wave came just after noon.
The tenor of the market seemed to gain almost from the start. By 9:45 the Dow was ahead 15 points; by 10:30 it had climbed 25 and by 1 P.M., 35 points. At 3:31, the New York Stock Exchange invoked its 50-point rule, preventing program traders from buying whenever the previous price was higher than the one just before that, a strategy to prevent their dealings from exaggerating the advance. In a declining market, the rule works in the opposite direction.
The Dow continued, nevertheless, to move ahead for the rest of the day.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Down In February

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Orders received by factories in the United States fell for the fourth straight month in February, the Commerce Department said today.
The department said orders fell five-tenths of 1 percent, which was steeper than most economists expected. The consensus forecast was for a three-tenths of 1 percent decline from January levels. The drop followed a revised 1.6 percent decrease in January, which had originally been reported as 1.7 percent, and declines of four-tenths of 1 percent in December and 5.8 percent in November. 
 Despite the overall decline in orders, several analysts said interest had now shifted to the prospects for an economic rebound, however weak it might be, once the full extent of the first-quarter decline in economic output was finally known.
"We're all now becoming very impatient for the first sign recession is coming to an end, and the evidence so far is very, very, very fragmentary," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Mr. Robertson said that at the least the rate of decline in orders for some goods was easing, raising some hope that the economy's slide was beginning to stabilize.
 
Deep Recession Still Seen
 However, Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said, "The decline in manufactured goods orders, although somewhat less serious than the previous month's figures, confirms that the economy is still deep in recession."
The Labor Department will issue March employment figures on Friday. Unemployment is expected to rise to 6.7 percent, from 6.5 percent in February, when it hit a four-year high.
The National Association of Manufacturers, which represents most of the big companies surveyed in today'ss report, said the recession might be prolonged because orders kept slowing, but stocks of unsold goods were not shrinking.
"The failure of inventories to decline under these circumstances raises the possibility that the economy will be caught with an inventory overhang in the coming months," Mr. Richards said.
Manufacturers' inventories of all types of goods were unchanged in February after falling one-tenth of 1 percent in January.
Producers have been holding down stocks of unsold goods, which economists say should speed recovery when consumer spending eventually picks up.
A key component of factory orders, durable goods, fell three-tenths of 1 percent in February after skidding 2 percent in January. Durable goods are big-ticket items like refrigerators and automobiles expected to last at least three years.
Military orders, a volatile category made more so by the Persian Gulf war, rose 2.5 percent in February after gaining 12.3 percent in January. Excluding military items, factory orders fell six-tenths of 1 percent in both months.
The main area of manufacturing strength has been in industries that sell most of their goods overseas, like commercial aircraft makers.
Transportation orders overall fell one-tenth of 1 percent in February after a 6.1 percent fall in January, but orders for aircraft, missiles and parts for commercial and military planes were up 13.8 percent after a 28.3 percent fall in January.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The High Cost Of Low Savings

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT'S morning in America, say two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- the morning after. Since the mid-1980's analysts have been quarreling over the consequences of the free-spending ways of Americans. Now, Ethan Harris and Charles Steindel have produced what may be the definitive study of low savings and its impact.
Their article in the latest issue of the bank's Quarterly Review acknowledges the joys of eight years unbroken by recession, but they nevertheless believe that the 1980's consumption boom cost the economy dearly. If America had merely maintained the rate of capital accumulation of the earlier postwar decades, the two economists estimate, national output would have been $250 billion larger in 1990. Should the low savings rate of the 1980's persist through the 1990's, they project that the annual loss will reach $750 million. 
 The study's computer simulations suggest that getting back on the old growth track would not require onerous sacrifice: A five percentage point shift from consumption to savings would do the trick. But like many economists, Mr. Harris and Mr. Steindel find it improbable that tax breaks or exhortations from Washington could convert the shop-till-you-drop generation to the gospel of savings. Their own fix, huge Federal budget surpluses that would free hundreds of billions of dollars for private investment, seems only slightly more plausible.
One reason economists disagree about what happened to the savings rate in the 1980's is that they cannot quite pin down what savings is. For example, should capital gains from the run-up in stock prices in the late 1980's count as savings? The wow in the Dow certainly made a lot of people richer. However, if the gain merely reflected shareholders' expectations of what the next sucker would pay, it had no direct effect on productive capacity.
Mr. Harris and Mr. Steindel prefer a clean (if conceptually imperfect) definition that goes to the crux of the growth issue: savings available to augment productive capital. This, they reckon, is the inflation-adjusted change in household wealth, excluding holdings of government bonds and residential real estate. Corporate net worth, rather than stock prices, is used to value stocks.
Measured this way, the savings rate is worrisomely feeble. From 1953 through 1973, it averaged 8.7 percent of gross national product. But from 1980 through 1989, the rate slipped to just 4 percent. And in the last half of the 1980's, it averaged a still more meager 3.4 percent.
Foreign savers did make up part of the difference, in the process transforming America from the world's largest creditor to the largest debtor. Part, but not much: Savings from foreign and domestic sources fell to 5 percent of G.N.P. from 8.4.
The economists estimate that by 1989, this cumulative dip in savings had reduced the nation's stock of capital by 15 percent, and cut the G.N.P. by 5 percent. Extrapolating to the year 2000, the G.N.P. gap reaches 10 percent -- more than Washington currently spends on defense and Social Security.
A five percentage point shift from domestic consumption to savings would narrow the current G.N.P. gap in short order. It would also restore America's status as an exporter of capital, gradually paring foreign claims against future output. And while there would be no gain without some pain, consumption would approach the pre-1980's growth path within a decade.
Conceivably, households could make the transition with only a little help from Uncle Sam. But not likely: Tax carrots that increased private savings would also add to government deficits, partly offsetting the savings gain. In any case, even the truest believers in expanded individual retirement accounts and tax preferences for capital gains would have trouble conjuring a $100 billion-plus increase in private savings.
A more likely source for part or all of the extra savings is the Federal budget itself. The deficit, which reduced savings by 2.5 percent of the G.N.P. in the 1980's, is already slated under last year's budget accord to fall to just eight-tenths of 1 percent of the G.N.P. by 1995. If Washington had the will to push the budget two or three percentage points into surplus, the national savings drought would be history.
That, unfortunately, is a lot to ask from politicians who scatter like quail at the sound of the T-word. Raising government savings (or reducing dissavings) by a single percentage point of G.N.P. would require tax increases or spending cuts of $60 billion. But as the economists' simulation makes all too clear, the meter is running: Every year of delay makes the recovery more expensive.

HEADLINE: Plan to Create Jobs to Cut New York Welfare Rolls

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 2

 BODY:
In reaction to growing political pressure to trim New York's welfare rolls, the state's Social Services Commissioner proposed a program today that would pay private employers to create long-term jobs for welfare recipients.
National experts on welfare said the program would be the first in the country to use tax dollars to subsidize the creation of private-sector jobs for recipients of home relief, which pays benefits to low-income people who are not caring for children. It would extend a national trend that has seen welfare recipients increasingly required to earn their benefits by seeking either work or job training. 
 Under the plan, which was proposed to the Legislature by Cesar A. Perales, the Commissioner of Social Services, the state would pay up to 90 percent of the home-relief grant to an employer who agrees to hire a home-relief recipient for one year and who makes "a good-faith commitment" to continue employment after that. The employer would be required to pay the difference between the subsidy amount and the prevailing wage for the job, which would be at least half of the worker's total salary.
The new employees, Mr. Perales said, would receive a paycheck rather than a welfare check.
The plan would be mandatory for all employable home-relief recipients who have stayed on the welfare rolls for six months without finding work. Those who refused the offer of a job at that point would be removed from the welfare rolls for 75 days.
Mr. Perales acknowledged that the proposal was controversial, but said it would send a strong message about the direction of New York's much-maligned welfare program. "We literally want to take the taxpayers' money and give it to employers," he said. "A lot of people are going to look askance at this idea. But we want to communicate the idea that if you are able-bodied, home relief is transitional. We've never communicated that, and that's why home relief has such a bad name in some quarters."
Some legislators and advocates for the poor expressed concern that employers would take advantage of the state's subsidy for a year but then might dismiss the worker when the subsidy ended.
In New York City, where the home-relief grant is $353 a month, this is how the subsidy would work: An employer would have to pay the difference between the prevailing wage and $318, which is 90 percent of $353. The minimum four-week wage for a 40-hour-a-week job is now $680, meaning that an employer would pay $362.
After starting employment, the worker would be removed from the home-relief rolls. The employer also would be required to pay for the worker's health benefits if the job normally carried them. That would save the state the cost of insuring the home-relief recipient under Medicaid.
 
Training and Experience
 Mr. Perales said he believed that the plan would allow home-relief recipients to receive the job training and experience they needed to escape the welfare rolls permanently while also making it easier for businesses to expand employment during the recession.
Under Mr. Perales's proposal, local governments would have the option of participating in the program. If they did, it would be up to local social services departments to recruit potential employers and match home-relief recipients with jobs.
Of the Perales plan, Barbara J. Sabol, the Commissioner of New York City's Human Resources Administration, said, "We haven't received any written proposals, but we think it has some promise,"
The plan would require legislative approval, and Mr. Perales spent much of the day trying to persuade legislative leaders to support it. After speaking individually with Mr. Perales, the heads of the social services committees in the Assembly and the State Senate both said they agreed with the philosophy behind the plan but had reservations about its structure.
 
Cuomo Hasn't Seen Plan
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has not yet seen the proposal. But his deputy secretary for human services, Michael J. Dowling, said it would build on existing state programs that divert parts of the welfare grant for job training.
Home relief is the welfare program for poor people who do not qualify for aid to families with depedent children. It is the fastest-growing component of the state's welfare system, largely because the home-relief caseload is highly sensitive to downturns in the economy. Although home relief constitutes only one-fourth of the state's welfare caseload, it accounted for nearly three-fourths of the growth in the caseload last year.
Because it has grown so quickly, the home-relief program has come under harsh political attack, particularly from the Republican-led Senate. The Senate has proposed placing strict limits on eligibility for home relief and on the duration that benefits can be received.
Unlike aid to families with dependent children, which is financed jointly by the Federal, state and local governments, home relief is subsidized solely by the state and local governments.
Most of the state's 315,000 home-relief recipients have physical or psychological disabilities, are dependent on drugs or alcohol, or are otherwise deemed unemployable. But 115,000 are categorized as employable, and they are the focus of Mr. Perales's proposal.
Some officials with business and social-services groups found fault with what they said was the plan's underlying proposition -- that home-relief recipients seeking self-sufficiency only need a job and not training in both social and employment skills.
 
Preconceived Notions
 And some managers of the types of businesses that might be asked to employ home-relief recipients expressed ambivalence about the proposal, suggesting that it might be difficult for employers to abandon preconceived notions about welfare recipients.
"My first feeling would be it would never work out," said Danny Varracato, manager of the Jefferson Market at 455 Avenue of the Americas, between 10th and 11th Streets, in Manhattan. "You'd think that just as soon as some of these people get some money in their pocket, they'd just go back to drugs.
"But if somebody shows they could do a good job, then why not help them out? It's kind of like the state would be paying you to take a chance on them, and I guess that's fair."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Panama Agree On Access to Bank Data

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
United States and Panamanian negotiators have reached an accord that will open bank records in Panama for American criminal investigators to develop evidence on money laundering and drug crimes, Administration officials said today.
The officials said the agreement, reached on Saturday in Panama City, appeared to end a bitter dispute that moved Congress to freeze $84 million in economic assistance to Panama since early last year. 
 They expressed satisfaction that the treaty, the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement, would help Federal and state efforts prosecute those involved in a broad range of crimes.
 
'An Excellent Arrangement'
 "Finally, the United States will realize we want to cooperate," said a senior Panamanian official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Still, American officials cautioned that the accord was not a panacea that would completely cleanse Panama's banks or eliminate illicit drug trading involving Panama. One official said the agreement would "be useful, though not decisive" in the war on South American cocaine traffickers. The treaty requires the approval of the Senate and the Panamanian National Assembly.
Some American law enforcement officials have said that opening a window into bank accounts may provide only limited assistance in tracking down money launderers, because Panama's corporation laws act as a virtually impenetrable shield that prevents the identification of the true owners and managers of companies.
Money laundering is a process by which illegally earned money is deposited in bank accounts or in other legitimate businesses, and is then withdrawn as "clean money." A 1989 Senate report listed Panama as one of the six nations most widely used to launder illegal profits.
Negotiations on the agreement began almost immediately after the invasion of Panama by United States forces in December 1989 and the replacement of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's military dictatorship with President Guillermo Endara's civilian Government. A preliminary draft was initialed in August, but Mr. Endara rescinded his support for the accord under intense pressure from Panamanian bankers.
Executives of Panama's 120 banks then argued that the treaty would neutralize the benefits of secrecy laws that give them a competitive advantage over other regional banking centers like the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas. Panamanian banks contain deposits of more than $15 billion and play a pervasive role in Panamanian society, forming the glassy skyline of Panama City and employing 10,000 workers.
United States and Panamanian officials noted that several influential bankers had reversed their position on the accord in recent weeks and had encouraged Mr. Endara's negotiators to sign a draft almost identical to the August version.
The final details were worked out when the chief United States negotiator, Michael Kozak, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, made a visit to Panama City last week.
Senior Panamanian officials have said that they expect a formal signing of the treaty by April 11.

HEADLINE: California's Fiscal Crisis Tests Government's Role

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 2

 BODY:
Facing a budget shortfall wider than ever before encountered by a state, the government of California has been plunged into a deep crisis that many lawmakers say could force a fundamental restructuring of government in the nation's most populous state.
Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, huddled with legislative leaders of both parties today at the Capitol in Sacramento to confront a gap of $12.6 billion between spending and expected revenue in the state's budgets for this fiscal year and the next. 
 The deficit is larger than the general funds of all but four other states: New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and Texas. It is 23 percent of the Governor's proposed $55.7 billion budget for 1991-1992.
 
In Dire Straits
 California could not balance its budget, Mr. Wilson said last week, even if all state universities and prisons were closed and all state employees were laid off.
"It's catastrophic," said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, Democrat of San Jose. Mr. Vasconcellos is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and is one of several lawmakers trying to put together a combination of additional taxes and spending cuts to balance the budget, as required by law.
Senator Kenneth L. Maddy, a Fresno Republican who is the Senate minority leader and one of the lawmakers in today's meeting with the Governor, called for a thorough restructuring of the way services are delivered. "There is not enough political support to raise taxes to a level anywhere near $12.6 billion," he said in an interview.
Sacramento was awash this week with competing proposals, among them raising income tax rates in upper brackets, freezing the salaries of state workers, consolidating school districts and giving responsibility for some health programs to the counties.
The fiscal crisis, which began when Mr. Wilson announced the new deficit estimate on Friday, has stirred a bitter statewide battle over whether the Legislature should suspend a constitutional amendment that, in effect, guarantees public schools and community colleges about 41 percent of the state's general fund. Schools were fearing deep cuts, and the powerful California Teachers Association, a union, was organizing a rally for Wednesday at the Capitol.
 
30 States Struggling With Gaps
 In all, 30 states are grappling with budget shortfalls this year. While California's is by far the largest in amount, it is not the largest in percentage terms. Connecticut is trying to bridge a gap of $2.4 billion, about 37 percent of its general fund expenditures. New York has a potential shortage of $3 billion, or 10 percent.
For California, the situation represents a dramatic reversal of fortune in a state that returned a surplus to taxpayers as recently as 1987. Lawmakers attribute the current problem to a dozen years in which taxing and spending authority was limited and tax rates were cut while the state experienced huge growth in several areas, including population, prisons, immigration and AIDS cases.
Just after he took office in January, Mr. Wilson estimated the shortfall at $7 billion and called for cuts in welfare grants and school spending and for some additional taxes.
But by last Friday, he said, "a marked decline in economic activity" had raised the projected gap to $12.6 billion, $1.9 billion of which is for the current budget year and the remainder for the new budget year that begins July 1. Bank and corporation tax collections are running 14 percent behind last year's; schools have had to enroll 235,000 more pupils than last year in an increase of about 5 percent; the prisons have had to absorb 12,000 more convicts, or about 13 percent, and 47,000 clients have been added to the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, for a rise of 7.3 percent.
"So while the demand for services grows, our ability to pay for them shrinks," Mr. Wilson said. He cited a drop in housing starts, a slump in the state's once-prosperous military-contracting industry and the effects of a recent freeze and a drought.
The Governor offered no new plan, but asked the Legislature to come forward with proposals and to pass a new budget by May 1. He met today with Willie L. Brown Jr., Speaker of the Assembly; David A. Roberti, President Pro Tempore of the State Senate; Ross Johnson, Republican leader in the Assembly, and Mr. Maddy.
"There will have to be something that combines revenue increases and expenditure reductions," said Thomas J. Dooley, the chief deputy legislative analyst. "It is impossible to solve this just by cutting expenditures."
Because spending on the public schools and on health and welfare accounts for 70 percent of the state's general fund, the people who would cut spending were scrutinizing those programs. In particular, Republicans and even some Democrats were pressing to suspend the constitutional amendment passed in 1988 that guaranteed a minimum financing level for the schools.
Many lawmakers say the amendment, Proposition 98, has hobbled them, tying up 41 percent of the money available for programs, or about $17 billion this year. Because of the 1978 measure limiting local property taxes, Proposition 13, schools here depend mainly on the state for their money.
The provision can be suspended by a two-thirds vote of both houses in an emergency. Mr. Wilson favors such a suspension. But Proposition 98 has some powerful backers, including Speaker Brown; Bill Honig, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the influential 232,000-member California Teachers Association.
Pressure also built this week for an increase in state income tax rates. Democrats were talking about undoing a reduction, passed in 1986, that cut rates for taxpayers in the highest bracket, to 9.3 percent from 11 percent. The bracket includes single taxpayers earning more than $100,000 and couples earning more than $200,000. It is estimated that the change could raise more than $1 billion a year.
Assemblyman Vasconcellos said he could not live with a solution by which half the shortfall is made up with spending cuts.
 
Veto Is Threatened
 But today, Governor Wilson, reflecting views expressed by many Republicans that increases in taxes would drive away business and thus worsen the state's fiscal condition, threatened to veto such a bill.
Amid all this, many lawmakers of both parties have begun to question the very basis on which California government operates. The huge growth in population, with its attendant demand for services, conflicts with the the 1979 measure that imposes ceilings on increases in government spending.
Senator Maddy said he was considering steps like eliminating county school superintendents, imposing a statewide teacher salary scale and freezing the salaries of state employees at last year's levels.
The state Constitution sets a June 15 deadline for passing a budget for the next fiscal year.

HEADLINE: The Bolshoi Summer Tour Rescued From Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
The financially threatened summer season of the Bolshoi Opera and the Royal Ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House and a planned 31-city tour of "Stars of the Bolshoi Ballet" were rescued by legal maneuvers in bankruptcy court yesterday.
Judge Francis Conrad of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan approved the sale of contracts from the defunct Entertainment Corporation USA, the British-owned production company that had originally arranged for the tours, to Satra Entertainment Corporation, an American branch of Satra Ltd., another British corporation. 
 "We are very grateful to Ara Oztemel, Satra's owner, for believing in us in providing the necessary investment to assure that these companies will appear as scheduled," said Charles Dillingham, former president of the Entertainment Corporation USA, which declared bankruptcy on March 20.
Mr. Dillingham will serve as producer for Satra Entertainment.
Mr. Oztemel, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., has been engaged in industrial trade with the Soviet Union for 40 years through his corporation.
 
The Summer Schedule
 The Bolshoi Opera is to make its first appearances in the United States since 1975, at the Metropolitan from June 25 to July 6 and at Wolf Trap Farm Park in Vienna, Va., from July 11 to 15. The "Stars of the Bolshoi Ballet" tour is to open on April 11 in West Palm Beach, Fla.
In an earlier effort to save the tours, the Entertainment Corporation USA conducted negotiations with James L. Nederlander, the Broadway theater owner and producer, in the hope that Mr. Nederlander might become a production partner at the Metropolitan and at Wolf Trap Farm Park. But last month Mr. Nederlander dropped out of the negotiations.
Peter Brightman, who will serve as executive producer of Satra Entertainment Corporation, said the financial problems arose because of the recession in both Britain and the United States, and because of the recent cancellation of tours by the Red Army Chorus in Britain and the Georgian State Dancers in the United States.

Looking at History With a Military Slant

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
The Lessons of History
By Michael Howard
217 pages. Yale University Press. $27.50.
 Reading "The Lessons of History," by Michael Howard, against the backdrop of the war in the Persian Gulf, it becomes all too evident that any study of modern history is inseparable from military history. That is one of the main points emerging from Mr. Howard's eloquent book of essays on the nature of armed conflict. Much as we might prefer to read about the forward march of civilization on the eve of the 21st century, the author forces us to ponder whether a world without war is possible in the near future. 
 Mr. Howard, professor of military and naval history at Yale and president of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, is sympathetic to the aspirations of people everywhere. But he says that aspirations can lead to convulsive reactions in the streets and, eventually, on the barricades and battlefields. He admires some heroic revolutionary leaders, as well as pragmatic technocrats from Moscow to Beijing, who are struggling to make their societies work. He finds it quite possible that war, in the sense of armed conflict between highly developed societies, may not recur. He even foresees that a stable framework for international order could become firmly established.
Still, looking down the shell-pocked road of history, the author cautions: "Nevertheless violence will continue to erupt within developed societies as well as undeveloped, creating situations of local armed conflict often indistinguishable from traditional war and requiring the continuing exercise of military skills. We have, for better or worse, not yet reached a state of social development when the soldier will find no opportunity to exercise his profession and warrior values have become obsolete."
Professor Howard wrote this two years before camouflaged American warriors fought in an alien desert and Scuds and Patriots began flying over the Middle East, but the picture he draws is all too familiar. After two World Wars, it's hard to distinguish local wars from large-scale wars, particularly when major powers find themselves engaged in ancient feuds between tribal nations that pump oil instead of growing rice or bananas.
So the reader hopes for lessons from this distinguished military historian who knows of war from personal experience. He fought with the Coldstream Guards in the mountains of Italy during World War II when Fascism was crumbling and the dream of a more peaceful world was in the air. It's something of a disappointment not to find ready answers in the book, a disappointment not necessarily in the author but in the brutal realities of the world he describes:
"We are left with a West whose wealth provides no relief from anxiety and turbulence; a socialist world which has now recognized with astonishing unanimity that its God has failed; and a third world which nothing can spare the strains and conflicts inherent in modernization. These are not exactly the 'broad, sunlit uplands' of which Winston Churchill once spoke, but the least that historians can do is to remind the world that there are no such uplands -- or rather that when we do find them, we will find also deeply shadowed valleys full of misery and despair. Each new generation is presented with new problems and new challenges, and analogies drawn from the past are likely to be more of a hindrance than a help in solving them. If the past has anything to teach us it is humility -- and suspicion of glib formulae for improving the lot of mankind."
Well, then, what comfort is there in reading "The Lessons of History"? Nothing less than the pleasures of encountering a challenging mind, supported by a great store of information, delivered in graceful language. The essays in the book cover Prussia in European history; empire, race and war in pre-1914 Britain; the Edwardian arms race; Europe on the eve of World War I; the finest hours of Prime Minister Churchill and why he did not keep up with the changing times; the era that ended after the nightmare of Hitlerism and the Holocaust of World War II, and social change and some of the root causes of war.
Rather diffidently, Professor Howard says, "History is what historians write, and historians are part of the process they are writing about." Still, he shows that a historian can indeed draw upon the past to foreshadow the design of coming events. In an essay written in 1988, which made the point that territory still remained a factor that could lead to war, he was prescient: "The one place in the world today where a global conflict might still conceivably originate is the Persian Gulf, without whose oil resources the West would be economically crippled."
In "The Lessons of History," Professor Howard does hold out some hope for those who envision progress without warfare. He writes that there is a continuing obligation to insure that "nowhere in the world should poverty, illiteracy and grinding hardship" deprive people of opportunities for physical improvement and moral growth. And, in the end, he says that history can count: "The historical process, through the very challenges it poses and the responses it evokes, itself creates the morality of mankind. That seems to me a very good reason for studying it."

HEADLINE: Where Old Havana Plays, Exiles Fear Another Revolution

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
FOR Liliam Martinez, the impulse to sing is overwhelming as she listens to musicians playing sultry Latin tunes in the darkened lounge of the Big Five Club. She rises from her table near the bar, takes a microphone from one of the professional singers and slips into an old Cuban torch song accompanied by a single guitar player. For 15 minutes, her dusky voice seems to peel away the years and transports her husband and other middle-aged club members back to old Havana.
She ends with the mournful ballad "La Gloria Era Tu (You Were Heaven)" and the words flood the interior of the Miami area's most prestigious Cuban-American social club with a powerful longing, not only for lost lovers but also for a homeland abandoned more than three decades ago after Fidel Castro seized power. 
 Sentiment for a touch of pre-Castro Havana and a desire to perpetuate the old social order were the motivating forces and glue behind the creation of the Big Five Club back in the 1960's, when the exile community reluctantly confronted the harsh reality that Castro could not be easily dislodged. After the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and the standoff of the Cuban missile crisis, the exiles came to see that they would not be going home any time soon -- if ever.
In sinking new roots, former members of five of Havana's elite yacht and golf clubs bought a piece of palmetto scrubland in what was then the unincorporated boondocks west of Miami and established the Big Five Club. At first the club was little more than a rustic retreat for family barbecues and picnics. But over the years, it grew into a 30-acre compound of clubhouses with ballrooms, an Olympic-sized swimming pool and athletic fields. New housing occupied almost completely by Spanish-speaking families now fills the surrounding area on the edge of the Everglades.
Like the land, the club and its membership have been transformed by the remarkable prosperity of Cuban-Americans, now numbering 625,000 in the Miami area and perhaps America's most successful immigrant group in rising within a generation to economic, political and social power.
Given this panorama of flourishing suburban life and Cuba's stagnant economy, it may seem that the real Cuban revolution took place in Miami, not Havana. But success and the Americanization of the Cuban community have spelled trouble for the Big Five Club, which with its membership list of 1,600 families, including hundreds of lawyers, physicians and bankers, has no peer among Spanish-speaking social clubs in the continental United States.
"Our young people, teen-agers and those in their 20's, are not too interested in a club," said Juan Torres, the 52-year-old president of Big Five, who owns a commercial printing company. "The ones born in this country feel they are more American than Cuban."
The Big Five is experiencing what other elite clubs in this nation have already learned. When people under the age of 35 mention clubs, they mean health clubs or discotheques. Traditional exclusive clubs, with high initiation fees and dues, don't hold the appeal they once did, especially in a high-voltage city like Miami with its outstanding restaurants, beaches and other attractions. Young Cuban-Americans, like their non-Cuban counterparts, tire easily of too much reminiscing about the old days, so part of the Big Five's problem is embedded in its strengths.
From the beginning, the Big Five was an exile's club with the exile's sense of loss and tragedy. Bar and dinner conversations, in the speeded-up tempo of the Cuban idiom, cover a variety of topics and are full of wit and friendly insults. Yet inevitably they turn to the latest rumor on Castro, like the one that he was ready to grant haven to Saddam Hussein.
And the spell of a glass of whisky or intoxicating nostalgia ignites a special memory of the ever-distancing days of "la gloria" of Havana, a land of childhood dreams, schoolboy triumphs and romantic conquests. It is a memory fiction-encrusted by age but kept alive by a passion for the land left behind and still denied.
If clubs are a home away from home, then the Big Five sheltered its wards by preserving their culture in a timeless context that could never be truly shared by those who had not experienced the old ways. "This is Cuba before Castro took over," said Angel Soler, 55, with a sweep of his hand around the club's restaurant.
In the lounge, Mrs. Martinez, the president of a Spanish foods company who came to Miami in 1960 at the age of 17, offered another view. "We come here to forget all the tensions of American life," she said, and one way she does it is by singing old Cuban love songs long into the night. "No other place in the world would I feel comfortable doing it."
From the start, young children and their grandparents were as much a part of the club as the dues-paying generation. "It's a place where you can drop children off at 10 in the morning and pick them up at 6 in the evening without worrying about them," said Manny Morales Jr., 37, whose father was instrumental in the club's formation. Children have access to organized athletic activities, games and a playground with the Disneyesque name "Big Five Land."
In a spacious card room in the clubhouse, older women play canasta, a rage in Cuba as well as the United States in the 1950's. In the time-capsule ambiance of Big Five, it is still the game of choice. Members over 65 pay greatly reduced monthly dues of $13 and those over 75 pay none, compared to about $75 for most.
The club has a 22-team softball league and four green-coated concrete courts, each with three high walls on which men play Cuban squash, which resembles jai alai with tennis racquets and balls.
Over the years the club has become more democratized, a condition of exile and intermarriage, opening membership to a few non-Cubans, though not to those who cannot speak Spanish. Like many private clubs in the Miami area, it has an official policy of nondiscrimination on basis of race. But longtime members cannot recall ever seeing blacks there, though the Cuban community includes sizable numbers of blacks.
Where originally a family was considered for membership only if there was a connection to the five old clubs in Havana -- the Biltmore Yacht and Country Club, Havana Yacht Club, Miramar Yacht Club, Vedado Tennis Club and Casino Espanol -- time and a new class of Cubans who made their wealth here ended that policy. But some former members of the Havana clubs express disdain for those who recently joined the Big Five.
A former member of the Havana Yacht Club who lives on Key Biscayne groused that the newcomers were O.K. to hang out with but that they were "not really one of us." He insisted on anonymity to protect his livelihood; he works as a business consultant.
The old guard is dying out, however, and since there is only a trickle of older people coming in from Cuba and elsewhere, the Cuban-American community's net growth since Mariel, when 125,000 people arrived, has been slow. Half of Greater Miami's population of 2 million is Hispanic, according to the 1990 census, but the major gains in the 1980's came in immigration from countries like Nicaragua and Colombia, creating the most ethnically diverse Hispanic community in the nation.
Besides having the highest household income of any major Hispanic group, Cuban-Americans whose families arrived before 1980 are much closer to non-Hispanic whites in terms of education, time of marriage and birth rate than they are to other Hispanic Americans.
"Our hope is that when our young do marry and raise families they will come back to the club to place their children in a wholesome atsmosphere free from drugs and other problems," said Fausto Diaz Oliver, 56, a former Big Five president who is a plastic-container manufacturer.
To encourage the process, the club will reduce its usual $4,000 initiation fee to $1,500 for any new member with children under 24, and it plans to add racquetball courts and a disco.
But like Castro's eventual fate, few dare predict the future course of the club in a land that has always looked to tomorrow, not yesterday.

Mets Deal Looks Doubtful to Viola

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., April 2

 BODY:
Unique. Innovative. Special.
Officials for the Mets used the words over and over again on Monday during their news conference announcing Dwight Gooden's $15.45 million contract extension. 
 Frank Viola heard those words, and he expects to hear them again and again. Indeed, the accomplished left-hander for the Mets said today he was all but certain the words would haunt his dealings with the Mets on a contract extension. It was Viola's opinion that while the words reflected the organization's affection for Gooden, they also amounted to a strategic groundwork for negotiations with him.
"Dwight's different from me in their eyes," Viola said.
 
Viola Perceives Limits
 And so the offered terms of endearment, Viola suspects, will not be nearly as lavish as the $5.15 million the Mets are now obligated to pay Gooden for the 1992, 1993 and 1994 seasons. In that light, Viola perceived the team's structuring of Gooden's deal -- $750,000 of the guaranteed money comes under an agreement for rights to make promotional videos featuring Gooden -- and the club's underlining of its "unique" aspects as tactics designed to limit Viola's asking price for a base salary.
"I don't see it happening," Viola, the 30-year-old left-hander who won 20 games for the Mets last season, said of a satisfactory deal with the Mets. "I don't know why that is. I am actually lost as to what they are thinking.
"But in the final analysis, it doesn't matter one way or the other. All of it -- Roger Clemens's contract, Dwight Gooden's contract -- is going to help in the long run. Now or later. Here or elsewhere."
The Mets have made only one formal offer to Viola, a three-year proposal for $12.5 million. Viola promptly rejected it, and Craig Fenech, his agent, countered last week with a deal for four years and roughly $20 million.
"Our position is that one judges the Mets by what they do and not what they say," Fenech said when asked about the organization's portrayal of the Gooden package. "From my point of view, the deal with Gooden means the Mets have recognized what fair market value is. They have de facto accepted the market place."
 Certainly, the Mets, who had long termed Clemens's average annual salary of $5.38 million as "incomprehensible" and a threat to the financial health of the industry, wound up making huge compromises in their negotiations with Gooden. That deal was a leap of more than a million dollars from their proposal of two weeks before.
"From their standpoint, they had to sign Dwight, and I understood that from the start," Viola said. "They couldn't have lost Darryl Strawberry and then Dwight Gooden. They would have been dead in New York. But I'm not considered New York."
Gooden said the Mets ought to consider Viola a vital part of the future success of the franchise, although he declined to say whether Viola was worth the money the Mets will now have to pay him.
"It's important they get a deal done with him," Gooden said. "He's a big part of this staff."
Fenech, meanwhile, would have no part of the organization's previous claims that affording both Gooden and Viola would be financially problematic.
"There is no doubt in my mind that the Mets have the wherewithal," Fenech said. "And anyone who doubts that hasn't taken a look at the economics of baseball.
"As for whether Frank is worth what Dwight got, I think it's unfair to the athletes to make the comparison and it's irrelevant to our negotiations. This is not an arbitration case. We don't have to go in there with reams of computer data comparing Frank to Dwight. The Mets will pay us what we consider to be fair market value or we will take our case to the rest of baseball at the end of the season."
As of late this afternoon, the Mets and Fenech had not spoken since Gooden signed, although there were still plans for several conversations. On Monday, Al Harazin, the executive vice president of the Mets, who handles contracts, attempted to avoid addressing the Viola situation.
"We want badly to sign him," Harazin said. "And we will offer him a handsome amount of money."

HEADLINE: Not Too Late for Albanian Democracy

 BODY:
The contested election that took place Sunday in Albania, Europe's last Communist tyranny, was more than a historical curiosity. Not long ago, everything seemed to be forbidden in Stalinist Albania -- attending church, owning a car or murmuring a single critical syllable about Enver Hoxha, the cheerless party boss from 1945 until his death in 1985. So the mere fact of what appears to have been a free vote is more striking than the outcome -- a Communist victory over the newly formed opposition party, the Democrats.
President Ramiz Alia did not embrace democracy; it was forced upon him by bursting discontent, underscored by Mr. Alia's loss of his own seat in Parliament. Albania is Europe's poorest country; if Albanians are denied any form of democratic expression, popular anger and frustration could burst into widespread violence. Protests that began in Shkoder, in northern Albania, yesterday have already claimed 3 lives and wounded 30 people. 
 Desperation has caused 80,000 mostly young Albanians to flee the country since last June. Following an ancient exit route, thousands of refugees have packed ships bound for Brindisi, on Italy's heel. Even this comparative trickle provoked a Cabinet crisis in Rome, where politicians fear newcomers will flood the job market and otherwise burden Italy's economy.
Albania's other neighbors, Greece and Yugoslavia, have political reasons to fear a huge exodus across hard-to-police frontiers. Both worry that an influx of Albanians will heighten ethnic rivalries rooted in ancient quarrels. Promoting democratic values and stable politics in Tirana is thus in Europe's interest, and America's too.
Albania has for the first time endorsed the Helsinki Accords, which commit all signers to freedom of worship and travel. And it is seeking full membership in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which would end decades of total isolation.
These are important tokens of change, and now that elections have actually been held, Albania deserves encouragement from Western democracies -- conditioned, that is, on Mr. Alia's fidelity to his liberalizing promises.

Iraq: Drawing the Line

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
An Iraqi Shiite who has devoted his life to opposing Saddam Hussein visited me on Monday. "I know what you would not do," he said over bagels and coffee. "You would not intervene with military force in my country's civil war. I disagree, yet I understand. But what do you think the United States should do" to stop the killing of Shiites and Kurds, short of such intervention?
 His distinction is important. I still believe that the worst thing for Americans and Iraqis is for the U.S. to be drawn into the tribal and religious warfare there. But the second-worst thing would be to do nothing at all. 
 President Bush, in his zeal to avoid the prime sin of military intervention, is committing the second sin of almost total passivity.
 Passivity dangerously and erroneously signals a willingness to live with Saddam Hussein. It also suggests a cynical indifference toward Kurds and others after having incited their rebellion.
 At a minimum, Mr. Bush should enforce the strictest interpretation of the cease-fire agreement with Baghdad. That means shooting down Iraqi aircraft and helicopters. The loophole that allows the use of helicopters for administrative purposes has become a general license. Mr. Bush promised to destroy armed helicopters, and he should keep that promise.
 As for destroying Iraqi tanks and artillery, that leads into the civil war quagmire. It goes well beyond the U.N. mandate and would embroil American forces directly in ground combat.
 There should be no illusion, however, that firing on Iraqi helicopters will level the battlefield between Baghdad and the rebels. Iraq's forces vastly outnumber and outgun the rebels. But strong action in the air would send a critical signal to the Iraqi military.
 It would remind them that everything will be harder if Saddam stays in power. That signal has grown far too faint. Iraqi military leaders could read faintness as a change in Washington's course, as a new policy that only Saddam can keep Iraq whole.
 The nightmare of Lebanonization has to be avoided. But Mr. Bush and his coalition partners have carried this credo too far -- to the point of almost dropping the anti-Saddam ball. The Arab League compounded the signaling error last weekend by letting Saddam's Government participate in its Cairo meeting.
 There is another allied signal to Iraqi military leaders that needs strengthening: You will be held responsible for your brutality. Let them worry about what that may mean in personal accountability and future economic hardships.
 The Administration's failure to warn Iraq is shocking. The State Department practically achieves rhetorical orgasms of condemnation every time Israel deports Palestinian terrorists. It rarely condemns the killings of Kurds and Shiites.
 Silence fills the halls of the U.N. The Security Council surprised itself by authorizing war against Iraq. It surprises few today by returning to form and scampering away from all responsibility for postwar Iraqi turmoil.
 The U.N. does not mix into the internal affairs of its members. To be sure, such intervention would open a vault of troubles.
 Yet the U.N. has intervened with peacekeeping forces in the Congo and Cyprus and proposes to do so now in Cambodia. True, it always has been at the invitation of the host government. But regional organizations have been known to act without an invitation. Several West African states sent forces recently to impose a cease-fire on warring Liberians.
 My Iraqi visitor wants no similar involvement from Iraq's neighbors, whom he rightly fears. He knows well the U.N.'s reluctance to intervene. Still, he asks for some help from the U.N., some notice, some aid for refugees, some words of warning to the butchers. The U.N. can and should provide all. Maybe yesterday's French and Turkish initiative, though stalled, can produce some action.
 Above all, he prays for U.S. military intervention. But unlike the Savonarolas of intervention who preach that American guns are the easy answer to civil war, he also realizes the magnitude of what he asks of Washington.
 He smiles and offers one last story about a Kurd who said to a Palestinian: "I envy you. When you die, at least the Arabs, the United States and the United Nations complain."

HEADLINE: Brooklyn's Boulevard of Broken Promises

 BODY:
Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Eastern Parkway was once the Champs Elysees of Brooklyn, a grand, tree-lined thoroughfare and a model for urban boulevards throughout the nation. Now, four years after New York City awarded a $59 million contract to restore the parkway's faded 19th-century elegance, the avenue and its once parklike pedestrian malls are in shambles -- a trash-strewn symbol of the failure of city government.
How did it happen? The Bronx-based company the city hired for the restoration was supposed to complete the work by last August. Then in December 1989 the business, Naclerio Contracting Company, was barred from bidding on new city contracts for three years as punishment for filing false invoices on other city jobs. Its cash flow problem greatly aggravated, Naclerio filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection; construction, already behind schedule, slowed nearly to a halt. 
 Instead of taking swift action to void the contract and replace Naclerio with a responsible business, as newly streamlined contracting procedures permit, the city's Transportation Commissioner, Lucius Riccio, is trying to coax the bankrupt company along by spoon-feeding it with frequent installment payments. It's a losing strategy. The project is still moving at a slow pace. And Mr. Riccio's effort to prop up a plainly inadequate business sends a message of bureaucratic weakness to taxpayers and other city contractors.
Mr. Riccio argued that the job could be done quicker by avoiding legal entanglement in Naclerio's bankruptcy proceeding. He also feared that hiring a new contractor would lead to higher costs. But coddling Naclerio isn't getting the job done. Furthermore, it shouldn't be all that difficult, given the present recession, to find a contractor eager to complete it at a reasonable price. Mr. Riccio has ample reason to revoke the contract.

HEADLINE: Albany Republicans Seek Fairness to Suburbs in School Cuts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Lessons From a Budget Crisis" (editorial, March 23) neglects to acknowledge my position on the New York State budget and many of the alternatives State Senate Republicans have advocated. 
 I agree with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that $51.9 billion is sufficient to meet the immediate needs of this state. This does not represent a budget cut, but a slower growth rate more in line with inflation. There is more than $3 billion in new spending in the Governor's budget, much of it for interest on the state debt and matching costs for social service programs.
A 10 percent cut in state aid to education, as suggested by the Governor, does not sound unfair until you examine the lopsided distribution of those cuts. Suburban communities are being asked to bear a higher share, with the proposed reduction for some school districts as high as 67 percent, or 20 percent of their total budget. This cut needs to be minimized by shifting money in the budget or restructured to provide greater fairness and equity statewide.
Senate Republicans are also concerned about the magnitude of local aid reductions, and we support lifting costly mandates on local government. We propose lowering matching costs for Medicaid; limits on home relief benefits for people who are employable; prompt payment for local government and not-for-profits; relieving counties of costs associated with mental health patients held in state facilities, and reducing unnecessary maintenance standards for low-volume roads.
We agree with your call for a restructuring of Medicaid. Restructuring all social welfare programs should be a major focus of government because of the explosive cost of these programs, with little progress in reducing client dependence.
State Senate Republicans have proposed greater use of health maintenance organizations to deliver medical services to the needy. Our alternative Medicaid proposal and other related reforms can save taxpayers about $450 million more than has been suggested by the Governor.
Senate Republicans do not like the Governor's 10-cent increase in the gas tax. We are opposed to using the gas tax as a way to bail out the state treasury. But we recognize the need to provide a steady stream of funds to finance road and bridge repairs and ordinary maintenance.
Senate Republicans are opposed to increasing the state income tax. We believe that any effort to hold the budget hostage to an income tax increase is a waste of time and a disservice to the people we represent.
The way to avoid revenue increases is to spend no more than $51.9 billion. We do not favor gimmicks that allow for the appearance of holding the line on spending only to delay payment into the next fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Business, Not Bombs, Will Unite Ireland

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "The Bullet and the Ballot Box" by Padraig O'Malley (Op-Ed, March 2), I would like to ask Irish-Americans who support Noraid and indirectly the Irish Republican Army: What must happen before Britain will consider serious negotiations on home rule? 
 Doesn't the I.R.A. realize its power base lies in the Irish Republic and in the millions of Americans, Canadians, Australians and British of Irish descent? These people are conservatives who are embarrassed to support so-called terrorist activities. But they would support peace initiatives and territorial discussions if the I.R.A. changed its tactics.
The Irish Republic has wisely cast its vote with the European Community. By encouraging its population to study engineering and computer science, Ireland is attracting outside investment. Ireland doesn't suffer from pompous delusions that are the underlying cause of labor unrest. Ireland's friendly business environment will attract increased investment. Manufacturing will transform Ireland from an agrarian economic colony of Britain to an industrial power able to compete in the new world order. The future will bring the day when British officials arrive in Dublin begging for investments. That day will also be the first day serious home rule negotiations take place.
If Irish-Americans really want a united Ireland they should invest in Ireland and encourage their companies to do so.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The High Cost Of Low Savings

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT'S morning in America, say two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- the morning after. Since the mid-1980's analysts have been quarreling over the consequences of the free-spending ways of Americans. Now, Ethan Harris and Charles Steindel have produced what may be the definitive study of low savings and its impact.
Their article in the latest issue of the bank's Quarterly Review acknowledges the joys of eight years unbroken by recession, but they nevertheless believe that the 1980's consumption boom cost the economy dearly. If America had merely maintained the rate of capital accumulation of the earlier postwar decades, the two economists estimate, national output would have been $250 billion larger in 1990. Should the low savings rate of the 1980's persist through the 1990's, they project that the annual loss will reach $750 million. 
 The study's computer simulations suggest that getting back on the old growth track would not require onerous sacrifice: A five percentage point shift from consumption to savings would do the trick. But like many economists, Mr. Harris and Mr. Steindel find it improbable that tax breaks or exhortations from Washington could convert the shop-till-you-drop generation to the gospel of savings. Their own fix, huge Federal budget surpluses that would free hundreds of billions of dollars for private investment, seems only slightly more plausible.
One reason economists disagree about what happened to the savings rate in the 1980's is that they cannot quite pin down what savings is. For example, should capital gains from the run-up in stock prices in the late 1980's count as savings? The wow in the Dow certainly made a lot of people richer. However, if the gain merely reflected shareholders' expectations of what the next sucker would pay, it had no direct effect on productive capacity.
Mr. Harris and Mr. Steindel prefer a clean (if conceptually imperfect) definition that goes to the crux of the growth issue: savings available to augment productive capital. This, they reckon, is the inflation-adjusted change in household wealth, excluding holdings of government bonds and residential real estate. Corporate net worth, rather than stock prices, is used to value stocks.
Measured this way, the savings rate is worrisomely feeble. From 1953 through 1973, it averaged 8.7 percent of gross national product. But from 1980 through 1989, the rate slipped to just 4 percent. And in the last half of the 1980's, it averaged a still more meager 3.4 percent.
Foreign savers did make up part of the difference, in the process transforming America from the world's largest creditor to the largest debtor. Part, but not much: Savings from foreign and domestic sources fell to 5 percent of G.N.P. from 8.4.
The economists estimate that by 1989, this cumulative dip in savings had reduced the nation's stock of capital by 15 percent, and cut the G.N.P. by 5 percent. Extrapolating to the year 2000, the G.N.P. gap reaches 10 percent -- more than Washington currently spends on defense and Social Security.
A five percentage point shift from domestic consumption to savings would narrow the current G.N.P. gap in short order. It would also restore America's status as an exporter of capital, gradually paring foreign claims against future output. And while there would be no gain without some pain, consumption would approach the pre-1980's growth path within a decade.
Conceivably, households could make the transition with only a little help from Uncle Sam. But not likely: Tax carrots that increased private savings would also add to government deficits, partly offsetting the savings gain. In any case, even the truest believers in expanded individual retirement accounts and tax preferences for capital gains would have trouble conjuring a $100 billion-plus increase in private savings.
A more likely source for part or all of the extra savings is the Federal budget itself. The deficit, which reduced savings by 2.5 percent of the G.N.P. in the 1980's, is already slated under last year's budget accord to fall to just eight-tenths of 1 percent of the G.N.P. by 1995. If Washington had the will to push the budget two or three percentage points into surplus, the national savings drought would be history.
That, unfortunately, is a lot to ask from politicians who scatter like quail at the sound of the T-word. Raising government savings (or reducing dissavings) by a single percentage point of G.N.P. would require tax increases or spending cuts of $60 billion. But as the economists' simulation makes all too clear, the meter is running: Every year of delay makes the recovery more expensive.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 4, 1991, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column in Business Day yesterday misstated a projection by two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the annual loss in national output if the low savings rate of the 1980's persists through the 1990's. It is $750 billion, not $750 million.

Chairman of Polaroid Plans to Retire May 7

BYLINE: By Eben Shapiro

 BODY:
William J. McCune Jr. plans to retire as chairman of the Polaroid Corporation on May 7 after the company's annual meeting, the company has announced. Polaroid said I. MacAllister Booth, its president and chief executive, is expected to be given the additional post of chairman.
Mr. McCune, who is 75, has been associated with Polaroid for 52 years and succeeded the company's founder, Edwin H. Land, as chairman. A 1937 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he joined Polaroid in 1939, two years after the company was founded by Dr. Land, who died on March 1 at the age of 81. Mr. McCune's first job was to establish the company's quality-control program. 
 During World War II, Mr. McCune worked with Dr. Land on Polaroid's guided-missile project. After the war, he worked with Dr. Land on the development of the original Polaroid Land camera and film.
Mr. McCune was appointed president and chief operating officer in 1975, and was elected to the board. He was named president and chief executive in 1980 and became chairman in 1982. Mr. McCune continued to serve as chairman when Mr. Booth assumed the position of chief executive in 1986. Mr. McCune has not been actively involved in the company's management since then.
As the first chairman after Dr. Land, Mr. McCune was a transitional leader at Polaroid, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. Analysts said Mr. McCune performed a tough balancing act, moving the company away from the paternalistic approach of Dr. Land to a more business-like approach. Still, some analysts asserted that Mr. McCune did not go far enough to instill a bottom line focus at Polaroid.
In 1976, there was a kidnapping attempt made against Mr. McCune on a street a few blocks from his Cambridge office. Mr. McCune foiled the abduction by fighting off an armed attacker, taking away his shotgun and chasing the assailant away.
In 1991, Polaroid's operating profit is expected to be constrained because of the weak economy and costs associated with product introductions. Analysts estimate that the company will earn about $2.10 a share, compared with $2.20 a share in 1990.
Polaroid's stock closed yesterday at $25, unchanged, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Panel Confirms Stangl As Chief of the M.T.A.

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
When a Metro-North Commuter Railroad train arrived at Grand Central Terminal after skipping the 125th Street Station, Peter E. Stangl, the railroad's president, ordered the train's crew to return to Harlem and apologize to passengers.
"That was just Peter being Peter," said Thomas M. Downs, New Jersey's Commissioner of Public Transportation and a longtime friend of Mr. Stangl's. For Mr. Stangl, the incident in 1989 was "no big deal." 
 The State Senate yesterday confirmed Mr. Stangl as the new chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the umbrella agency that oversees the largest and oldest public transportation system in the country.
The appointment came after the committee, in an odd confirmation process, had first approved his nomination and then had withdrawn its approval. The flip-flop came when members found out that Mr. Stangl was in the cab of a Metro-North train while a friend, Myron Schuster, operated the throttle and brakes during a ride in October between the Croton-Harmon station and Beacon, N.Y.
 
Reprimand and Regret
 Federal and state investigations into the incident cleared Mr. Stangl of any wrongdoing and of jeopardizing the safety of passengers. After reprimanding him, committee members decided his lapse of judgment was an aberration, a conclusion that many friends, colleagues and Mr. Stangl support.
"I wish it had never happened obviously, and as I've said, it was a mistake," he said. "It was not an easy thing to go through, that's certainly true, but on a very personal level, it probably strengthened me."
Mr. Stangl will need that additional fortitude to contend with the problems facing the M.T.A.: a loss of riders, deficits in operating budgets, labor negotiations and uncertainty over whether the Legislature will help the agency finance its $11.7 billion, five-year capital program scheduled to begin next year.
"It's the worst possible time to take on this job, because of the economic situation," said Richard Ravitch, who raised money for the authority's first capital program when he was chairman of the M.T.A. from 1979 to 1983.
 
A 'Brass Ring' Job
 Friends, family and colleagues deny that Mr. Stangl has a masochistic streak but nonetheless wonder why he wants the job.
"It's the brass ring in public transportation in this country, I guess," said Thomas Glynn, general manager of Boston's transit system, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. "But you couldn't call it a plum, because that connotes it's some kind of reward, which it isn't."
"Maybe because it's an enormous challenge, and Peter likes a challenge," said Richard C. Leone, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a friend of Mr. Stangl's.
Mr. Stangl said he wanted the job for both reasons.
"This is an institution that serves millions of people every day," he said. "I like the idea of knowing that on a daily basis, how we deliver a service affects millions of lives."
The job will cap a career spent rescuing many of the region's faltering public transit systems from years of abuse, neglect and political stalemates.
As assistant commissioner for public transportation in New Jersey, Peter Eugene Stangl helped integrate the state's transportation system, which eventually became N.J. Transit. He later helped to increase riders and improve on-time service at Metro-North.
Although he has weighty credentials for administering the country's largest public transit system, Mr. Stangl insists that his career is an accident.
"I never grew up wanting to be a lawyer or a doctor or a reporter or an electrician," he said. "I was just basically looking to do something that was interesting and that I would feel good about when I got home at the end of the day."
In fact, after he left New Jersey state government in 1978, he took 10 months to contemplate his future from behind an eight ball. "I just shot pool for 10 hours a day," he said. "I've played a little golf, and I like tennis, but no other game I've played requires the mental discipline of pool."
Mr. Stangl, who was born on July 14, 1941, spends his leisure time with his wife, Barbara, at their house on the Moses Taylor estate in Westchester County. The house was built in 1792 and once served as a chauffeur's home. The Stangls have no children. Mr. Stangl has pretty much given up pool, but he continues to play poker and tennis.
"He has an awful fast, cannon-ball hard serve that I sometimes don't even try to return, lest it kill me," said Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff, the regional administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, who met Mr. Stangl when they both held office in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay in the early 1970's. "He's just like that serve: energetic, almost kinetic, driven and tough to beat back."
The odds were against Mr. Stangl when Mr. Ravitch appointed him to head Metro-North in 1981. The railroad was losing riders, only 81 percent of its trains were on time, and many of them were famous for running their heaters in the summer and air-conditioners in the winter.
"Metro-North was a real big mess, but Peter brought in new ideas and energy and made it a success story in New York and gave people in the mass-transit business around the country hope," Mr. Glynn said. "Peter is really seen as the single individual who led the charge, and he won."
The economy worked with him during that battle, but the recession has made Albany, where his major campaign to get financing for the capital program will be fought, more thrifty. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who nominated Mr. Stangl for the chairman's job, has proposed cutting state spending on mass transportation by $6 million, a decrease that the city would match.
Legislators point to the $16 billion already spent overhauling the M.T.A. network and ask why they should allocate $11 billion more. The network is made up of Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City Transit Authority.
Mr. Stangl must "build a coalition of legislators, M.T.A. board members and the body politic that can get the money together to fund that capital program at a time when everyone is counting every penny," Mr. Sidamon-Eristoff noted.
 
In Touch With Riders
 During Metro-North's metamorphosis, his candor and accessibility disarmed critical politicians and their constituents.
He often startled irate riders by inviting them to his office for coffee and a chat about the railroad's problems and how he might solve them. He became a familiar fixture at town meetings and public hearings in the counties served by Metro-North, listening to passenger complaints and explaining how he planned to address them.
But as president of Metro-North, Mr. Stangl also established a reputation for independence, running the railroad relatively free of interference from the M.T.A. chairman and board. He said he intended to run the M.T.A. in a collegial fashion, consulting with board members to plan long- and short-term goals.
"We will have differences, we will have debates, that's what boards do," Mr. Stangl said. "But we need to be together on the big items, and part of my job is to get us together so we can agree on what our goals are."

HEADLINE: In the Right Hands, The Lowly Meatloaf Finds It's a Star

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
THE way Sharon Moore talks about meatloaf, one would think she was describing the latest creation from the kitchen of the Four Seasons in New York.
"The first thing you need to know about meatloaf is that it can be served to the finest of company," Mrs. Moore said. Her recipe for blue-ribbon loaf blends ground pork and veal with crumbled blue cheese. "Can you imagine anything more beautiful, anything more elegant?" said Mrs. Moore, a food and wine writer and editor. 
 If she seems passionate about meatloaf, there is good reason. Mrs. Moore has just written a cookbook devoted to the subject, and not just to the blobs of oven-baked ground beef that have been the nemesis of children all over America.
Her book, "Meatloaf" (Clarkson Potter, $10.95), includes recipes for wild-game meatloaf made from venison, rabbit and pheasant; ethnic meatloaf, like a meatloaf stroganoff with mushrooms and sour cream; company meatloaf made primarily with smoked ham, and regional meatloaf, like Tex-Mex loaf with chili powder and kidney beans or Corn Belt loaf with ground beef, pork, sausage and crumbled cornbread. There is even a recipe for a California sushi loaf that relies on shrimp and crabmeat rather than red meat.
All this is a far cry from the bulbuous ground-beef loaves most Americans envision. If a cookbook devoted to meatloaf seems at first blush silly, nearly 10,000 copies of "Meatloaf" have been sold across the country since the book was published in January, and not just in the Midwest, where meatloaf has long been a staple. The publisher says "Meatloaf" is selling especially well in the Northeast and in California; so much for the two coasts as great spawning grounds for new ideas in cooking.
Yet to Mrs. Moore, "Meatloaf" was an idea whose time had come. In the current recession, she said, with families watching their pennies, meatloaf is a less costly alternative to other meatdishes. Fewer households have someone at home all day to cook, she added, and meatloaf freezes beautifully. Then there is the growing interest in "comfort food" -- pot roast with mashed potatoes, for instance -- as an occasional departure from low-fat, low-sodium, low-cholesterol, low-calorie cuisine.
"More and more, people are looking for easy-to-make foods that remind them of childhood," Mrs. Moore said. "Meatloaf fits that bill."
Dorothy Rosenbaum of Evanston, Ill., often ate meatloaf as a girl in the Pennsylvania Dutch country. "Meatloaf is earthy and basic," she said. "It may not have a gourmet element, but it conveys a sense of warmth and of family. And it is always served in generous portions. I love it."
Not everyone is.
A cartoon in a recent food magazine showed a flight attendant serving meatloaf to her passengers. "In case of a water landing," the flight attendant said in the caption, "your meatloaf can be used as a flotation device."
In "The Sting," Robert Redford nearly is sickened after ordering the blue-plate special. "I should have ordered the meatloaf," Mr. Redford tells the waitress behind the counter.
"It's not any better," the waitress responds.
Even to some purveyors of comfort food, meatloaf is simply too plebian. "We considered putting it on the menu but concluded that it was too borderline," said Linda Terczak, an owner of Terczak's , a comfort-food restaurant in Chicago. "People associate meatloaf with diners."
But Mrs. Moore holds that meatloaf approaches gastronomic nirvana -- and not just because it evokes childhood. Purists would maintain that meatloaf has to be made from red meat and some kind of filler like oatmeal and bread crumbs. Mrs. Moore takes a more expansive view: "Anything that has meat in it and is shaped into a loaf can be called meatloaf."
Indeed, her book "has 42 different recipes, only about one-third of which include ground beef," she said. She went on: "Most of the recipes use chicken, turkey, lamb or some other meat besides beef. The California sushi loaf is mostly shrimp and crabmeat, but it also includes fillers like brown rice and avocado.
In writing "Meatloaf," Sharon Moore's daily routine consisted of rushing home to her kitchen in Forest Hills, Queens, to prepare a different meatloaf recipe almost every night. All told, it tooks six weeks to try out the different meatloaves. The joke around the Moore household is that in writing "Meatloaf," she gave her husband, David, a coronary.
"My poor husband; he loves meatloaf and he ate all 42 loaves gladly, but two years ago he developed high cholesterol and needed a bypass operation," she said.
Basic meatloaf made from hamburger and filler is hard to ruin, but more advanced varieties require more care. So Mrs. Moore offers this advice for first-time meatloaf cooks:
First, use your hands and mix the ingredients well to avoid clumps.
Second, don't overcook your meatloaf. It can get as dry as sawdust.
Finally, allow the meatloaf to cool slightly before cutting it. Longtime meatloaf lovers call this allowing the meatloaf to "rest" so the flavors can blend.

HEADLINE: 6% of U.S. Teen-Agers Report Trying Suicide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Six percent of American teen-agers say they have tried to commit suicide and 15 percent say they have "come very close to trying," according to a poll conducted for Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield by the Gallup organization.
Three out of five of those surveyed said they knew a teen-ager who had attempted suicide and 15 percent said they knew one who had succeeded. But when asked to identify the "single greatest problem you face," suicide did not rank among the top 22 problems the teen-agers listed. The list was headed by grades in school, career uncertainties and problems in growing up, said George Gallup Jr., president of the Gallup organization. 
 Of the teen-agers who said they had tried or come close to trying suicide, nearly half cited family problems or problems at home. Other reasons included depression, problems with friends, feelings of worthlessness, and boy-girl relationships. Some gave more than one reason.
The poll, conducted nationwide from November to January among 1,152 people 13 to 19 years old, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Forty-one percent of the teen-agers polled said their school was providing counseling or seminars on suicide prevention. And a fifth of them said their communities offered a suicide telephone line, counseling or seminars. Twenty-eight percent said their church or synagogue had suicide prevention programs.
But more than 80 percent felt that communities, schools and religious institutions should offer programs to help teen-agers handle their problems.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Up in U.S. After Declining Overseas

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher yesterday against most major currencies in domestic trading after falling overseas as traders awaited the release of United States employment figures.
Gold closed higher, with the April contract on the Commodity Exchange in New York rising $1.80 an ounce to close at $360.30. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $359.20, up $2 from late Tuesday. 
 Analysts described foreign exchange trading as quiet in advance of the March employment report, which is scheduled to be released tomorrow.
 
Weak Data Expected
 Earl I. Johnson, a foreign exchange analyst with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said the job data were expected to show a further weakening in the economy, forcing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The dollar tends to fall with interest rates because it, like all currencies, is supported by higher rates.
Mr. Johnson said the Fed might delay any action until after the release of the inflation figures next week. If inflation appears to be accelerating, the Fed might decide against any interest rate moves.
The dollar surged higher last week, partly on the belief that the economy was beginning to strengthen and that interest rates would remain stable. Now, Mr. Johnson said, "there's a feeling that some of the euphoria about the economy rebounding is not coming true and that says the dollar probably overshot itself last week."
He predicted the dollar would trade in a narrow range until the employment figures were released.
The British pound lost ground to the dollar in New York, falling to $1.7735, from $1.7780 late Tuesday. In earlier trading in London, sterling was higher, rising to $1.7805, from $1.7675 late Tuesday.
But the dollar fell against the Japanese yen in New York, falling to 137.30 yen, from 137.85 late Tuesday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.35 yen, to 137.78, and it was quoted later in London at 137.35.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, were: 1.6750 German marks, up from 1.6705; 1.4205 Swiss francs, up from 1.4185; 5.6795 French francs, up from 5.6615; 1,247.00 Italian lire, up from 1,245.50, and 1.15565 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15515.

HEADLINE: For Now, Pride Is Enough for These Ohio Voters

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, March 29

 BODY:
Flags are still flying along the neat blocks of bungalows on the border of Cleveland and Euclid. Shops still carry signs urging all who pass to "support our troops."
And for the moment, at least, George Bush seems to be a part of the patriotic tableau, an ominous sign for the Democrats. Even some who yearn for a stiff challenge to President Bush are hard put to name the Democrats who could provide it. 
 "He stood up for what I would have done," said Michael Brewer, a 48-year-old technician in Euclid who did not vote for Mr. Bush in the 1988 Presidential election. Cary Wayne, a 42-year-old executive recruiter, a Democrat who voted for both Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush, said the President "made me very proud to be an American, not that I wasn't before."
 
Postwar Glow Lingers
 Interviews with about 20 people in this working-class area found an edginess about the faltering economy, but also the expectation that Mr. Bush would now turn his attention to problems at hoe.
Richard Stegh, 33, who was laid off from his job at a fiberglass products factory, said he understood that the war in the Persian Gulf "had to take a front burner."
But Mr. Stegh, whose house was decorated with one of the larger flags in the neighborhood, said he hoped that now "things are stable enough in the Middle East that he can start in on unemployment and education." And the father of two children -- "I'm playing Mr. Mom," he said, watching the children while his wife was at work -- had nothing but praise for Mr. Bush.
A great unknown in politics these days is how long Mr. Bush's postwar glow will last, how long he is seen as part and parcel of yellow ribbons and national pride. Democrats note that Presidential approval ratings can be extraordinarily volatile, that the 20 months between now and the 1992 election is a lifetime in politics and that domestic worries will only grow. Republicans contend that the war has brought lasting benefits to Mr. Bush.
"The message that working-class people in Ohio had was, This is not going to be another Vietnam, that we're going to do it right this time," said Brian Berry, executive director of the Ohio Republican Party. "It was a very clear message."
 
Behind Bush '100 Percent'
 Indeed, in Muldoon's Saloon and Eatery and Buettner's Bakery, on street corners and stoops, people often responded with patriotic fervor when asked about the President. "I have two brothers in the service, and when he decided to do this I was behind him 100 percent," said Laura Barry, a 30-year-old homemaker with two children and a husband who is a fireman. "You can't let somebody like that take over a country," she said, referring to Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein.
The Democrats, Mrs. Barry said, seemed "passive.'
Mike Lynch, a 22-year-old employee of an appliance service shop who voted for Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988, said of Mr. Bush: "I think he's shown his ability to lead in the gulf. Everything else, I really haven't thought that much about."
This is an area where many people are accustomed to voting Democratic in state and local races and Republican for the President. Tim Hagan, a Democrat who is a Cuyahoga County Commissioner, said, "These people are very, very patriotic and would rally to the flag and to the President." The glow from the war, he said, "has not diminished dramatically."
Still, there is some concern here that the war may not be completely over, or that the allied forces may have stopped too soon. "They should be going after Saddam," said Mary Szasz, behind the counter of Northshore Video. "What I thought they should have done is gone all the way to Baghdad."
And many people here voiced the discontent with conditions on the the home front.
Ed Savol, a 40-year-old manager of a Sunoco service station who voted for Mr. Bush, said the allied success left a lot of good feelings here. But he was quick to respond when asked what Mr. Bush should be doing now.
"Take care of his own," Mr. Savol said. "Take care of his own people. Come up with an educational program, a job program. Take care of the people here."
 
A 'Forgotten Party'
 The Democrats hope to capitalize on Mr. Bush's domestic shortcomings. But their weakness was apparent here.
For instance, Glynn Douglas, the vice president of United Auto Workers Local 2262 and a fierce critic of Mr. Bush, nevertheless had some difficulty listing the Democrats who could beat him next year. "I hate to say this, but in all honesty, I don't see anybody on the horizon right now," he said, adding that he still had hopes.
Nelson Whales, a 51-year-old machinist, said: "It seems like the Democrats are turning into a forgotten party, almost a joke. Like, 'Who are they going to come up with this time?' "
Mr. Whales, who considers himself a Democrat, said with a trace of sadness: "Democrats have always been blue-collar worker, gung-ho. And it seems like nobody's there anymore."
And Ann Shaughnessy, a 39-year-old sewing machine operator, said she worried about jobs' going to foreign workers; the trade issue was probably where Mr. Bush would lose her vote, she said.
But Mrs. Shaughnessy, an 18-year employee of the General Motors Corporation, added that the Democrats "haven't offered me anybody yet."
"Give me somebody who shows me they're going to help people who want to work," she said.

HEADLINE: Wringing More Costs Out of Wall St. Firms

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The falling ax on Wall Street has become as commonplace as the rising Dow. But now, with the most obvious cuts of employees and expenses out of the way, investment houses are picking up the scalpel in hopes of completing a historic and complex reorganization of the back office, one of the least understood aspects of their business.
Some major firms are considering merging their underused back offices, through which stocks, bonds and other financial instruments are moved to the account that purchased them and cash is moved to the seller. Some plan to sell part or all of the operations to outside contractors and then lease them back, or move pieces of the back offices out of Manhattan -- even to third-world countries -- to reduce overhead and labor costs.
 
Accompanying Layoffs
 "The cost pressure on Wall Street generally is encouraging people to look at lowering costs through changes in their back office and support systems," said Rick Adam, the partner in charge of global operations and technology at Goldman, Sachs & Company. 
 If any of the mergers come to pass, analysts predict there will be yet another wave of dismissals on top of the 60,000 jobs lost since the October 1987 market crash. "If joint ventures do occur, the number of people laid off in the back office will go up substantially," said A. Michael Lipper, president of the Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation. "An additional 25,000 dismissals would not surprise me."
Too many people and too much capacity highlight the back office difficulties. "As a general matter, cost cutting is a No. 1 priority throughout the service economy," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist with Bear, Stearns & Company. "If you need any convincing, you just need to look at employment numbers in recent months, which are hemorrhaging badly in that area."
The back office is the nerve center of a Wall Street firm. Most back offices are huge operations with whirring computers in climate-controlled rooms and few paper shufflers. While some paper still flows through back offices -- monthly statements, dividend checks and the like -- an enormous amount of the work has been turned over to computers, which match the buyers and sellers of securities electronically.
The potential for savings in merged back offices is between 20 percent and 40 percent of fixed costs, securities industry consultants said. "The beauty of merging the back offices of two major firms is that the economies of scale are phenomenal," said Stephen G. Racioppo, a managing partner with Andersen Consulting.
After years of being criticized for short-term thinking, Wall Street tried the long view in the giddy 1980's, by laying out billions of dollars for more back office computers and employees in a bet that customer orders would keep climbing.
They were wrong. Now, Wall Street is paying dearly for its failed fling with long-term planning.
The buildup was rapid. Lipper Analytical said that by early 1985, Wall Street firms had 118,522 employees who did not produce income, most of them in back offices. By December, there were 140,951, and by late 1987, 168,226.
 
Still More Than 1985
 Since the 1987 crash, back office staffs have been cut, to 138,763 employees now, although that is still more than in 1985.
In the last year, virtually every major firm has looked hard at its back office. And the discussions are "creating interesting bedfellows," said DuWayne J. Peterson, executive vice president of operations systems and telecommunications at Merrill Lynch & Company.
"These changes are not only a capacity issue, but an investment issue," Mr. Lipper said. The firms "are looking at significant increases they feel are required for investing in new equipment, and so are considering ways to decrease their existing fixed costs."
One of the more aggressive planners is Salomon Brothers Inc., several Wall Street executives said. Over the last two years, Salomon has negotiated -- albeit unsuccessfully -- to merge its back office with Goldman, Sachs's; hired an outside company, Andersen Consulting, to maintain and operate computer programming, and agreed to move its back office to Tampa, Fla., from Manhattan. Recently, Salomon has also reportedly been considering providing back office services for other Wall Street firms. Thomas W. Strauss, Salomon's president, declined to comment on its back office plans.
"The time is becoming ripe for collaborative ventures and other moves to make fixed costs lower." said Jean Louis Lelogeais, who specializes in capital markets at Booz Allen & Hamilton, the consulting firm. "That is the name of the game."
Wall Street executives say efforts to cut back on the costs are being hampered by the egos of some executives, as each investment house tries to make sure that no matter what savings are made, it will stay in control.
Part of that desire for control is driven by bitter experience. Until the 1960's, no one paid much attention to the operations until the 1968 stock market boom surpassed the capacity of back offices to keep up with trades, resulting in one of the most dramatic technical failures in the history of financial services.
As a result, trading in the stock markets was suspended one day a week, which had not happened since the crash of 1929. And a number of firms, unable to match buy and sell orders, teetered on insolvency or failed.
After that experience, Wall Street firms developed extensive back office abilities, which they are still wary of surrendering. "If you share the back office, you lose absolute control," said Samuel Hayes 3d, a professor of investment banking at Harvard University. "And the investment banks remember well the late 1960's, when the back offices got out of control."
But the pressures on Wall Street profits are forcing new thinking at a number of firms. The First Boston Corporation, for example, is in separate talks with Morgan Stanley & Company, Shearson Lehman Brothers, and Goldman about possible mergers, Wall Street executives said. Similar talks between Shearson and Prudential Securities Inc. broke off last month after the resignation of George L. Ball, Prudential Securities' chairman, who was driving the effort.
Shearson's data-processing operations have since been combined with the Information Services Corporation, a subsidiary of the American Express Company.
 
Talks Break Down
 Wall Street executives said a number of other firms had also been talking seriously about merging their back offices. Goldman and Morgan Stanley began talks in 1989 but the negotiations stalled when neither firm was willing to cede control. Securities industry executives said that each firm essentially wanted to run the operation and keep the other as a customer.
When the talks with Morgan collapsed, Goldman began new talks with Salomon Brothers. But these talks also broke down over differences, people involved in the discussions said.
Andersen Consulting has already taken over the maintenance of computer programs at Salomon Brothers while working on a long-range plan to build new systems. And First Boston recently asked for bids in a deal to sell its data-processing operation and lease it back.
Wall Street executives added that some firms, including Wall Street's largest investment houses, are looking into using technology to move their back offices to countries like Thailand and India, where salaries are significantly lower than in the United States.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Market Fund Yields Mixed for 5th Straight Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the fifth consecutive week, ending yesterday.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's point to the current flatness in money market yields, which they say is a result of the market finally dropping to the level of the last easing by the Federal Reserve Board. Fund managers continue to hold securities with longer maturities in their portfolios without fear of interest rates rising. 
 "The markets, which are usually ahead of any Fed action, are not anticipating any further moves by the central bank," the analysts said. Even if tomorrow's employment report shows a sizable loss of jobs, there is no guarantee that the Fed will act, they added.
Tax-exempt money funds for the seven-day period that ended yesterday were higher for the fourth consecutive week. The average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios was unchanged at 50 days. Assets declined by $645 million, to a total of $90.2 billion.
 
New Issues Outpace Demand
 The average seven-day compounded yield for the period that ended yesterday was 4.47 percent, up 3 basis points, while the 30-day compounded average yield rose 7 basis points, to 4.33 percent. Analysts said yields were up because the supply of new issues outpaced demand.
The taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-exempt yield is 6.20 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, and 6.67 percent for those in the 33 percent bracket.
Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million, which are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund produced the best return on investment for the second straight week. It had a yield of 5.38 percent, or about 91 basis points more than the seven-day compounded yield. The fund is managed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. in Milwaukee.
Assets of taxable funds fell by $4.3 billion, to $458.4 billion. Institutional assets fell $2.5 billion, to $110.8 billion, while consumer assets declined by $1.8 billion, to $347.6 billion. The declines are the result of investors finding more attractive returns in stocks and bonds as taxable money market yields slip.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by a basis point, to 6.21 percent, while the 30-day yield fell 5 basis points, to 6.26 percent. The fund with the best return on investment for the second consecutive week was the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market fund, with a yield of 7.14 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds, fell 2 basis points, to 5.51 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Iran Will Accept Iraqi Kurds, and It Asks for Aid

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, April 3

 BODY:
Iran said today that it would welcome Kurdish refugees seeking shelter from Saddam Hussein's troops and made a rare request for international aid to help it house and feed the influx it now expects.
The announcement was made by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati at a news conference tonight in the capital with the Foreign Ministers of Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, as the past, present and future presidents of the European Community. 
 "Our doors are open to all these refugees," Mr. Velayati said.
He declined to say how many Kurds were expected to cross the border into Iran or how much assistance Teheran was requesting from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Red Cross.
 
Trade-Off on Hostages?
 At the news conference, Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister and the current president of the European Community, said the release of the 12 Western hostages being held in Lebanon had been discussed with Iranian officials. The hostages are believed to include six Americans, three Britons, two Germans and an Italian. The longest-held is Terry A. Anderson, a correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped six years ago.
"I've made it very clear on behalf of the E.C.," Mr. Poos said, "that we are against hostage-taking. It is a criminal act."
Asked whether the three officials had coordinated their hostage discussions with the Swiss Foreign Minister, who was also in Teheran today, Mr. Poos said they had not, that the two visits were coincidental.
Teheran radio said that the Swiss official, Rene Felber, met today with President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran and discussed refugee problems.
Although Mr. Felber's three-day visit here was long planned, his arrival in the capital set off speculation that hostage release might be imminent. Switzerland has represented American interests in Teheran since the United States and Iran broke diplomatic relations in 1979 after the takeover of the American Embassy here and the seizing of the American diplomats as hostages.
 
Pressure on Israel
 Iranian officials have consistently linked the release of Western hostages to that of six Iranians, Palestinians and Lebanese being held by Israel. The Western hostages are believed to be held by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim factions, including the Party of God, which is said to have particularly close ties to Teheran.
In Beirut, the newspaper Al Diyar reported today that the United States and Iran had reached an agreement on the release of hostages before April 15, according to reports reaching here.
Quoting unidentified informants in Christian East Beirut, the paper said the settlement would involve American aid to Teheran and was reached "in direct contacts" carried out by an American diplomat "who paid secret visits to Teheran last week." However, the paper has been inaccurate on hostage-release reports in the past.
Envoys in Damascus, the Syrian capital, and in Teheran have maintained near-complete silence about the hostages' situation. A longtime diplomat said only that the talks were "enormously complex, involving many parties," and that speculation and false reports would only complicate the effort to secure their freedom.
At tonight's news conference, Mr. Velayati said he would welcome United Nations relief teams and other international representatives to Iran so that they could better assess the needs of the refugees and the burden they would place on Iran's war-battered economy. He said that the aid organizations would be invited to work with the Red Crescent and other Iranian domestic relief organizations.
 
Already Carrying Big Burden
 Until today, Iran had seemed intent on feeding and sheltering refugees on its own. Mr. Velayati said his country had already provided food, shelter and other necessities for more than two and a half million refugees, most of them Afghans.
The Kurds would be the third wave of refugees Iran has absorbed since the Persian Gulf crisis began on Aug. 2. Soon after Iraq invaded Kuwait, thousands of Kuwaitis sought and received refuge here. Next came Iraqi Shiites Muslims, at least 40,000 of them, as well as Asians who were fleeing gulf states or Iraq.
An Iranian official conceded today that the continuous influx of refugees has placed a severe economic burden on his country, which only three years ago agreed to a cease-fire with Iraq after a highly destructive eight-year war.
The decision to seek international help reflects the size of the influx expected in northern Iran, which the Iranian authorities say could not possibly be managed for long. And the request for help is yet another indicator of Iran's desire to end its diplomatic isolation.
Earlier today, President Rafsanjani accused the American-led coalition against Iraq of showing indifference to the plight of the fleeing Kurdish refugees. And he suggested that Iran would let them cross the Iranian border if foreign nations addressed the underlying cause of their flight.
During his meeting with Mr. Felber, President Rafsanjani called on the International Committee of the Red Cross to aid an estimated 500,000 refugees seeking safe havens. But more important, he said, were efforts to eliminate "the causes of the flight."

HEADLINE: Banks Say Stiff Credit Is Easing

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The credit drought that some worry will cause the recession to drag on may not be over but there are signs that it is easing. "The risk that credit problems would prevent a recovery appear to have declined," William Brown, chief economist at J. P. Morgan & Company, said.
The number of banks tightening credit is declining, the Federal Reserve's latest survey of senior bank loan officers shows. The survey of 58 American and 18 foreign-owned banks, taken in mid-March, was issued yesterday. 
 Just over a fifth of the banks surveyed said that they had imposed stiffer terms on business loans in the last six weeks, compared with a third in January and half last November.
 
Caution on Results
 Stiffer terms might be anything from lower credit limits and wider margins to higher collateral requirements. "If there was a credit crunch, it looks like it has flattened out," said Anatole Balbach, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
The Federal Reserve's March survey was taken just six weeks after the previous survey, half the usual interval. "That makes the results harder to interpret," cautioned Thomas F. Brady, who directed the poll.
But there are other straws in the wind. After stagnating for months, the nation's money supply -- an indicator, if an imperfect one, of banks' ability to lend -- has been climbing rapidly again. Nearly every source of bank funds -- from large time deposits to money market deposits -- has been expanding this year. Indeed, the money supply has been growing at a 9.5 percent annual rate since early February, putting it in the Federal Reserve's upper target range.
 
Slide in Loans Slows
 "That's presumably because the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal funds rate starting late last fall," Mr. Brown of J.P. Morgan said. "If M-2 had continued to languish, one would have been increasingly concerned that credit problems were having a broad effect on the economy." M-2 consists of cash, savings and checking accounts, and small certificates of deposit.
The slide in actual business lending has slowed. Commercial and industrial loans, which fell sharply in January, merely edged down in February. "That typically signals the end of a recession," said Herbert L. Baer, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
T. Waite Rawls, vice chairman at the Continental Bank, said, "Not a whole lot has changed, but if we get signs in the next couple of months that the recession ended with the war, things will loosen up some."
Indeed, in the first quarter, many corporations took advantage of lower interest rates to refinance debt. They retired short-term bank debt and issued long-term bonds. Some economists interpreted the surge as a sign that plenty of money was available for business.
Banks are not clamping down so much on consumers, either. According to the Federal Reserve's loan officer survey, half as many banks as in January reported that they were imposing stricter conditions on residential mortgages, and two reported that they were easing up.
Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported that applications for mortgages had tripled since December and that more than a third of all mortgage applications were from homeowners who were refinancing existing mortgages. With mortgage rates lower than last year, many borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages are trying to switch to fixed-rate mortgages.
Consider the recent experience of Banc One, the large regional bank with headquarters in Columbus, Ohio. Business lending is still off, as it has been since last year. But consumer loans have jumped 15 percent since the start of the year. "The consumer is coming back," said John B. McCoy, the bank's chairman. "That's a precursor of industry coming back. We can't do anything for G.M. unless somebody wants to buy cars."

Silver Higher for 4th Day As Hopes Rise on Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of silver futures rose for the fourth straight day yesterday as hopes for an economic recovery helped lift the metal's value to its highest level in nearly three weeks on New York's Commmodity Exchange.
On other commodity markets, cocoa futures tumbled; oil futures fell; grain and soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
 Silver futures settled 7.2 cents to 7.8 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in April at $4.063 an ounce, the highest settlement for a spot silver contract since March 15. Silver has now risen by 24.9 cents, or 6.5 percent, in four days.
Analysts attributed the gains in silver and platinum to perceptions that an economic recovery -- with an attendant increase in industrial demand for those metals -- is near.
 
Sharp Decline in Cocoa
 Cocoa futures plummeted on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, largely in reaction to rumors that the Soviet Union sold 20,000 to 30,000 metric tons of cocoa that it bought about a month ago. The implication that the Soviet Union could not afford the cocoa dashed hopes for larger-scale Soviet buying.
Cocoa production has outstripped demand for seven consecutive years, and reports of good growing weather in West Africa have stirred fears of another surplus season. Cocoa settled $21 to $43 lower, with May at $1,100 a metric ton.
Gasoline futures led a decline in the petroleum complex on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Light sweet crude oil settled 17 cents to 28 cents lower, with May at $19.47 a barrel; heating oil was 0.31 cent to 0.95 cent lower, with May at 53.28 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.35 cent to 1.75 cents lower, with May at 65.97 cents a gallon, and natural gas was 0.5 cent lower to 0.1 cent higher, with May at $1.417 a thousand cubic feet.
Prices for most soybean and wheat futures fell while corn futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat settled 1 1/2 cents lower to 1 1/2 cents higher, with May at $2.89 1/4 a bushel; corn was 1/2 cent to 2 1/2 cents higher, with May at $2.57 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 1/4 cents lower, with May at $1.30 1/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 4 1/2 cent to 7 1/2 cents lower, with May at $5.87 a bushel.
Cattle futures ended slightly higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after traders failed to bid the April contract above Tuesday's record intraday high of 82.70 cents a pound. Weaker cash prices weighed on pork futures, which ended lower.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Fall in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped in light trading yesterday, as dealers took profits following Tuesday's mini-rally.
Despite the decline, market participants said there was no pattern to the trading. Dealers and investors remain focused on the release of March employment data tomorrow, they said. 
 The report is almost universally expected to show that the economy remained weak last month. But traders said they did not expect a weak report to lead the Federal Reserve Board to move immediately to ease monetary policy. The Fed did exactly that in January and again in early February.
Although short-term interest rates fell after the Fed's last move, bond traders, fearful of the inflationary implications, pushed up long-term bond yields.
"I think the Fed very much wants the market to lead, not the other way around," one government-bond trader said.
James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, said, "If the employment number is really weak and the Fed doesn't react to it, the market would be very happy."
Mr. Capra and other market participants said that in the eyes of the bond market a further cut in short-term rates by the Fed would not be viewed as appropriate until evidence of moderating inflation appeared. Producer and consumer price data for March are expected to be released on Thursday and Friday of next week.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 95 31/32, down 1/4 point, to yield 8.23 percent, compared with 8.21 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 1/32, down 6/32, to yield 8.04 percent. And the 7 1/8 percent two-year notes dipped by 1/32, to 100 9/32, to yield 6.97 percent.
Late yesterday the Treasury announced it will sell $8.5 billion of new seven-year notes next Wednesday.
In when-issued trading following the announcement, the securities were offered at a price to yield 7.94 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose modestly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.76 percent, up 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.77 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.88 percent.
A number of new issues were offered in the investment-grade corporate bond market. The second quarter is only three days old, but issuance so far this week suggests there has been little slowdown from the near-record pace recorded in the first three months of 1991.
New issues of convertible and non-convertible corporate debt totaled $44.6 billion, according to statistics compiled by the Securities Data Company Inc., as 288 issuers decided to take advantage of a highly favorable interest rate environment. The figure is the highest since the record posted in the second quarter of 1986, when just under 400 issues totalling $45.9 billion were sold.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues were narrowly mixed. Prices of short-term securities rose slightly, while most long-term bonds eased by about 1/8 point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in fairly active trading. Dealers said investors, acting on the hunch that a weak employment report would push down bond yields, were buying up lots of longer-dated securities.

New York to Lose 4,000 MetLife Jobs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company said yesterday that it would transfer or eliminate 4,000 jobs from its New York headquarters.
About 3,000 workers will be relocated in other cities during the next two years as the company prepares for a $150 million renovation of one of the three Manhattan buildings that house its offices. 
 Another 1,000 who are expected to refuse transfers will be offered early retirement or severance pay, said Charles Sahner, a spokesman.
Although MetLife based the decision on its need to renovate its headquarters, transferring operations to less-expensive cities would also reduce costs, Mr. Sahner said.
"Competitive considerations played a part in picking the new sites," he said. "There are advantages to having a headquarters in New York City, such as being at the center of the financial community, but there are other operations that can function as well in other places."
MetLife will transfer workers to Denver, Indianapolis and Atlanta, and to Tampa, Fla.; Rensselaer, N.Y., and several cities in New Jersey.
Most will work in MetLife offices in those cities. But about 1,200 will go to a new administration center planned for Bridgewater, N.J., and others will be assigned to a new computer center in Rensselaer, near Albany.
The renovation is expected to be completed by 1996, when MetLife will decide whether to bring workers back to New York, Mr. Sahner said.
Eliminating 1,000 jobs, a small fraction of MetLife's 54,000-member work force, will have less effect on costs, Mr. Sahner said. Nearly 5,000 employees, including corporate executives, will remain in the city.
New York City has lost 100,000 jobs, out of a total work force of 3.6 million, since the stock market crash in October 1987, said John L. Wieting, an economist with the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.

HEADLINE: New York Pension Funds Buy Israel Bonds

 BODY:
New York City pension funds have purchased $12 million in Israeli bonds, Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman announced yesterday.
"This is a rock solid investment with a 100 percent Federal guarantee and no risk to the pension fund," said Ms. Holtzman, who is a trustee and chief investment adviser for the pension fund. For the first time since the 1970's, the United States agreed to guarantee some Israeli bonds as part of an aid package, her office said. 
 The bonds will yield 8.5 percent -- a high rate of return -- and will mature in 15 years.
Mayor David N. Dinkins commended the pension funds.
"By purchasing these bonds, New York City, which has the largest Jewish community of any city in the world, is again demonstrating its solidarity with the people of Israel," he said.
Ms. Holtzman said the bonds are designated to finance construction of housing for Jewish immigrants to Israel, such as Soviets and Ethiopians.
New York City pension funds have more than $38 billion in investments, Ms. Holtzman's office said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.N. VOTES STERN CONDITIONS FOR FORMALLY ENDING WAR; IRAQI RESPONSE IS UNCERTAIN

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 3

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council overwhelmingly approved a resolution today that offers to end the gulf war and progressively lift most sanctions against Iraq if President Saddam Hussein accepts a series of tough military and financial conditions.
But there was no immediate indication whether the Iraqi leader would agree to the Council's terms, which require him to renounce terrorism, pay billions of dollars in compensation for damage caused by the invasion of Kuwait, and accept borders that Iraq negotiated with Kuwait in 1963 but rejected just before invading and annexing Kuwait last August.
 
Kurdish Situation Addressed
 The resolution also requires Mr. Hussein to allow the destruction of all his chemical and biological weapons as well as his Scud and other ballistic missiles, and to pledge never to acquire such armaments again. 
 In an action separate from the adoption of the resolution, Britain and Belgium called today for the Security Council to take further action on the plight of the Kurds, some of whom have fled to Turkey, Iran and border regions after being defeated in fierce fighting against Government troops in northern Iraq. France and Turkey asked for similar considerations for the Kurds on Tuesday.
Thomas R. Pickering, the American representative at the United Nations, said the fate of the Kurds was under discussion, and he would make no comment on the American position.
 
Further Talks Planned
 No formal action was taken on the Kurdish measure, although the five permanent members of the Council -- the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- discussed the issue privately tonight. They issued no statement, and diplomats here said the full Council would hold further informal talks on the Kurdish question Thursday.
As soon as Baghdad accepts all the resolution's terms, a cease-fire will automatically come into effect with the allies, formally ending the war to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
But if Baghdad refuses to cooperate, it will remain barred from exporting its oil or importing anything other than the bare necessities of life for an indefinite time.
Iraq's representative to the United Nations, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, addressed the Council today but failed to give a clear indication on whether his nation's leadership would cooperate with the terms of the resolution.
He was critical of the resolution, though, arguing that disarming Iraq alone would increase instability in the Middle East and strengthen Israel. He said the Security Council has no right to fix Iraq's boundary with Kuwait. And he accused the United States of manipulating the Council to create "a new colonial period."
Mr. Anbari also called Mohammed A. Abulhassan, the Kuwaiti representative here, "a man with no identity or nationality," and he described his remarks to the Council today, in which he recounted the events of Iraq's aggression against his country, as "obscene."
Twelve of the Security Council's 15 members voted in favor of the measure. Only Cuba voted against it, while Yemen, the only Arab member, and Ecuador abstained. All previous resolutions adopted by the Council on the gulf crisis have also been supported by at least 12 members.
Mr. Pickering, the American delegate, called the resolution "tough but fair" and said it contained trade-offs that would gradually produce a return to normal conditions in the region. But he warned that Iraq's active cooperation with the Council would be essential.
 
Soviet Remarks
 The Soviet representative, Yuli M. Vorontsov, called the measure "a serious warning to all those who might be tempted to commit agression," adding that the "the international community has finally learned the lessons of the 30's."
On the Kurdish issue, Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, cited the civil warfare in Iraq and said, "My Government believes it will be impossible for Iraq to rejoin the family of civilized nations while Saddam Hussein remains in power." He said the Security Council must see what action it can take to aid those fleeing, but that the Secretary General and individual agencies must provide humanitarian relief, as well.
Diplomats say the Security Council can address the issue of the Kurds only if it believes that Iraq's repression of them has become a threat to international peace and security rather than an internal Iraqi matter.
The Soviet Union, which faces severe internal disorders of its own, is being cautious, not wishing to set a precedent that would allow the Council to review its handling of the Baltic republics and other pro-separatist areas, diplomats say. China, moreover, is always sensitive about United Nations interference in its affairs.
On Tuesday, France circulated proposals for a possible Council resolution, or a statement by its President, condemning Iraq's repression of the Kurds and calling for a dialogue between the Baghdad Government and Iraqi ethnic groups. It also asked the Secretary General to continue his humanitarian mission in Iraq and report to the Council on the condition of the Kurdish people.
In Paris today, President Francois Mitterrand told the French Cabinet that "the political and moral authority of the United Nations" would be badly damaged if the Security Council failed to condemn Iraq's onslaught against the Kurds.
 
Observer Force to Be Sent
 The resolution adopted today would send a force of United Nations military observers to keep watch over the Iraq-Kuwait frontier, and it commits the United States and its allies to withdraw their troops from southern Iraq once these United Nations soldiers are in place.
The resolution bans the sale of all weapons to Iraq for at least four months and links a lifting of this prohibition to Iraq's conduct, as well as progress toward regional disarmament. And it continues the ban on the sale of nonessential civilian goods like television sets and cars until the Security Council is satisfied with Iraqi Government policies and practices.
But the mammoth, 4,000-word document, by far the longest the Council has ever adopted, does not address the repression of the Kurdish uprising or the fate of the thousands of Shiite refugees now being cared for by allied forces in the south.
Although Iraq has accepted all previous Security Council demands on the war, agreeing for example to return stolen Kuwaiti property and accept financial liability for the damage the invasion caused, it may have done so only to secure an end to the fighting.
The new resolution binds the Iraqi leader in a complex web of humiliating new restrictions, designed to prevent him from ever terrorizing his neighbors again. In exchange, it offers a gradual easing of the United Nations trade embargo as well as a formal end to the war and withdrawal of foreign forces from the region.
 
Stage-by-Stage Compliance
 The Security Council frames this offer in the form of a 120-day timetable, setting dates for Iraq to accept its conditions and for the Council to ease various restrictions in return.
As soon as Iraq unambiguously accepts all the provisions of the resolution, a formal cease-fire will come into effect between the United States and its allies, and Iraq.
In addition, the resolution imposes other, more general obligations on Iraq outside the the 120-day timetable.
For instance, the Iraqis will not be allowed to sue foreign companies that failed to fulfill obligations because of sanctions or the war. Iraq must return stolen Kuwaiti property. And it must cooperate with the Red Cross on the repatriation of Kuwaitis and other missing foreigners.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Japan, the Trade Gap And America's 2 Minds

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
As consumers, Americans are happy enough to buy cars, television sets, videocassette recorders and all kinds of other things from Japan. As producers, they live in constant fear of the threat to themselves that their own appetites present. And after a decade in which Americans bought $350 billion more from Japan than Japan bought from them, these conflicting impulses are fully reflected in seemingly contradictory Administration policies.
On Thursday, President Bush meets Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan in Newport Beach, Calif. 
 Mr. Bush is expected to press for Japan to open its markets to American rice, construction materials, computer chips and other goods. Implicit in the pressure is a threat of trade retaliation if Mr. Kaifu doesn't oblige.
Closing American markets to Japanese goods would protect producers. Mr. Bush is also expected to reassert his commitment to free trade, which means no trade curbs, to protect consumers.
The President's chief trade negotiator, Carla A. Hills, who deals with these issues every day, is especially practiced in leaps across the seemingly unbridgeable consumer-producer gulf.
The barriers to the Japanese market have been "substantially diminished in the past 26 months," she observed recently. She "wouldn't want to ban our exports or put artificial inhibitors on our trade," she said. Implicit: no retaliation.
Yet almost in the same breath, Mrs. Hills pointed with feeling to the "enormous irritation in this country to have the second largest industrialized market in the world enjoy such access and remuneration in our market and for us not to have parity of opportunity." Implicit: retaliation.
But the toughest talk recently has come not from the Janus-faced negotiator but the new Agriculture Secretary, Edward R. Madigan, fresh from a seat in the Illinois Congressional delegation, which has strong agricultural and commodities interests.
Here is how he expressed his outrage after American rice producers, trying to display bags of rice at a trade exposition in Tokyo last month, were threatened with arrest because they were violating a rice import ban. He reminded the Japanese Minister of Agriculture, Motoji Kondo, that many American farmers "drive pickup trucks made by Isuzu and Toyota which were shipped from Japan." Did Mr. Kondo want two million American farmers to "band together against buying Japanese products?" he asked.
There is still some distance between Washington's talk and Government action. But Congress has been working to narrow the gap. Responding to lobbying from producers who see markets contracting from Japanese competition, the lawmakers have made it more difficult for the President not to take retaliatory steps.
Nothing illustrates America's state of mind about Japan more than the split between Congress and state governments.
Even as Congress is threatening curbs on Japanese investment, all 50 states are fighting each other all the way to their promotion offices in Tokyo for pieces of the Japanese purse.
When Gov. James J. Florio of New Jersey was a Democratic Representative in Congress, he joined in writing the Exon-Florio law that helps the President check Japanese investment. Today New Jersey is among the most aggressive seekers of Japanese investment to generate more jobs in the state.
Detroit presents another manifestation of the same phenomenon. Chrysler's president, Lee A. Iacocca, wants the United States to cut Japanese car imports. This may be good for Chrysler, but the benefits for the Chrysler-Mitsubishi joint venture in Normal, Ill., are less clear -- and even less so for buyers of Japanese cars and dealers selling those cars.
At the root of the growing sense of frustration about Japan, experts in psychology as well as trade say, is that its success here often reflects American failures. It still takes six years to develop an American car, 42 months for a Japanese car.
Nathaniel B. Thayer, director of Asian studies at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, puts it another way. The Japanese, he says, are now so entrenched in the United States economy that "by fighting the Japanese, we are really fighting ourselves."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Decision Not to Help Iraqi Rebels Puts U.S. in an Awkward Position

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Having decided not to intervene further in Iraq, the Bush Administration found itself today in the awkward position at the United Nations of seeming reluctant to back appeals for strong action to halt the repression of the Kurds.
Many political figures and foreign policy experts argue that the position taken by the Administration in recent weeks is morally indefensible, and in the long run may not produce the stability in Iraq or the Persian Gulf region that the White House says its policy is designed to encourage. 
 But the Administration, which based its gulf military operation in part on upholding the principle of self-determination for Kuwait, appears determined now to put other considerations ahead of self-determination for Iraqi religious and ethnic communities.
 
Bush Deplores Slaughter
 "I feel frustrated any time innocent civilians are being slaughtered," President Bush said today. "But the United States and these other countries with us in this coalition did not go there to settle all the internal affairs of Iraq."
Administration officials say their priority is to prevent Iraq from fragmenting and to speed the withdrawal of American troops from the region. They believe those ends can best be realized by not intervening in the Iraqi civil conflict.
Nevertheless, the apparent crushing of the Kurdish and Shiite rebellions this week by the Iraqi Army, and the stream of refugees produced by the fighting, have left the Administration on the defensive. Some Democrats and conservative Republicans are calling the Bush policy a betrayal of American principles, and the issue is likely to generate more political heat when Congress returns to work next week after its Easter recess.
"It's not just a tough call, it is a perfect dilemma," said Robert W. Tucker, a historian of international relations. "The Administration's policy has its own logic, but there is an equally strong sense that by doing nothing it will be viewed as a betrayal of values that we have always seen ourselves as championing."
Foreign-policy experts say the Administration is understandably hesitant about using American troops to back the Shiite and Kurdish uprisings in Iraq, considering that these rebellions could lead to Iraq's disintegration.
But many contend that the long-term moral and diplomatic implications for the United States of doing nothing, particularly after Mr. Bush made the gulf war a test case for a new world order, are great. They say the Administration must find some way to handle the outcry in some quarters for the United States to support the forces challenging Saddam Hussein, who were inspired in part by America's own appeal to topple the Iraqi leader.
Publicly, neither President Bush nor Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has given the American public any detailed explanation of why staying out of Iraq's civil war is in the best interests of the United States and how it is consistent with the principles upon which America's gulf policy originally rested.
 
Principles in Conflict
 Administration officials explain, however, that they found themselves torn between two principles of American foreign policy. Both principles were used to justify the effort to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the officials said, but they had to choose between the two when it came to dealing with Iraq after the war.
One principle is that the territorial integrity of nations must be respected for the sake of world stability, no matter what kind of Governments happen to rule within those borders. This justification was cited by the Bush Administration for rescuing the Kuwaiti monarchy, and American officials now find themselves using it to justify nonintervention in Iraq.
The other principle is America's longstanding commitment to human rights and self-determination. In the Iraqi civil war, this principle would seemingly dictate support for the Kurds and Shiites.
 
Preserving Iraq, Ousting Hussein
 The Administration is telling reporters that it can have it both ways. Administration officials say their policy is to allow President Hussein to restore the central Government's control over Iraq in the short run. Afterward, they say, the United States can use an arms embargo and economic pressures built into the United Nations cease-fire resolution to encourage Iraqis to replace Mr. Hussein with a more mainstream figure.
Many experts argue that such an approach is flawed. Laurie Mylroie, a visiting Iraq expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Studies, said that if Washington does nothing about the situation in Iraq, "Why should it protest when the Soviet Union suppresses dissent in the Baltics or within Russia? And how can the Israelis take seriously American criticism of the expulsion of four Palestinians when America -- the dominant military power in the region -- tacitly accepts the annihilation of tens of thousands?"
A political theorist at Harvard University, Michael J. Sandel, said that a broader moral issue exists. In trying to assemble international support to oust Iraq from Kuwait, President Bush used both the argument about upholding international borders and the argument about the right of all peoples to self-determination. But he never really sorted out which took precedence -- and because of the nature of the war over Kuwait, he never had to.
The Administration's ultimate response to the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war will greatly influence how the United States' intervention in the region is perceived and remembered.
 
'Maintaining the Status Quo'
 "If, as it appears, we decide that the most important thing is to uphold Iraq's territorial integrity, even at the price of maintaining Saddam's dictatorship, then what we are really saying is that the gulf war was about maintaining the status quo and nothing more; but then its moral authority will be diminished," said Mr. Sandel. "If we decide that we cannot simply stand by and watch while the Kurds are brutally suppressed, but must help them, then we are saying that the principle of self-determination is the value we hold most dear."
Many experts have argued that the Administration's approach is based on the seemingly contradictory assumption that President Hussein can be allowed to remain in power for now to hold Iraq together, but can be toppled in the long run when his domestic iron fist is no longer needed.
"It is rather anomalous to say that Saddam is going to fall in the long run, even if he is allowed to crush his opposition in the short run," said Peter W. Rodman, a fellow of the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute and former member of the Bush Administration's National Security Council staff.
 
'A New Lease on Life'
 Assuming Mr. Hussein "beats back this challenge, it speeds his political recovery," Mr. Rodman added. "He will have defied the odds, and the American occupation. He will have a new lease on life."
Many experts also dispute the Administration's assumption that it can calibrate the diplomatic and economic pressures on Mr. Hussein to make them harsh enough to encourage his ouster, but soft enough not to break Iraq apart. This, say veteran Middle East observers, is like trying to fine-tune a volcano.
If Mr. Hussein is left with a free hand to suppress his domestic opponents, said Elie Kedourie, an Iraqi-born Middle East historian, "sooner or later he will be able to reestablish himself as a power in the area and we will again be on the same merry-go-round."
"I think that it is very foolish to think that an arms embargo can be maintained for months on end," he added.
 
Obstacle to Mideast Talks
 One reason that the Administration's efforts at following up the Persian Gulf war with Arab-Israeli peacemaking have gotten nowhere so far is that all of the important nations involved are waiting to see what happens to Mr. Hussein before they make any committments. The Arab nations are worried that Mr. Hussein will denounce them for any concessions they make to Israel, while the Israelis, still smarting from Iraqi missile attacks, are unlikely to consider serious concessions while Mr. Hussein remains in Baghdad.
"We can't generate any momentum for the Arab-Israel question while everyone is waiting to see how the gulf situation shakes out," said William Quandt, the Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution.
Finally, many experts argue that the United States could have taken steps short of an American occupation of Baghdad to show greater support for those seeking to topple Mr. Hussein. For instance, even if the United States does not want to shoot down Iraqi helicopters, it could easily adopt a more ambiguous public posture on this subject so that Mr. Hussein would not feel that he has a green light.
Others advocate meetings with the Iraqi opposition. After initially spurning any contacts, the State Department today invited in a few Iraqi dissidents for talks with the Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs, John Kelly. But officials quietly emphasized that this did not mean any change in its hands-off policy on Iraq.
"I would say that at this point we could still be more forceful about what we will or will not tolerate," Mr. Quandt said. "We don't want to feed the illusions of the Iraqi people but we simply cannot appear to be neutral toward a regime that has no respect for the human rights of its own people. The thing I find least appealing is that we have shifted from a rhetorical stance that Saddam is Hitler to one that says what happens inside Iraq doesn't really matter to us."

HEADLINE: Ravaged City on Mississippi Floundering at Rock Bottom

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill.

 BODY:
A river and a world away from the glass towers and preoccupied hum of St. Louis lies a charred skeleton of a town that is perhaps the starkest example of a near-total collapse of an American city and the forces that are supposed to keep it afloat.
East St. Louis, with its acre upon acre of burned-out hulks that were once houses, its sad tales of backed-up sewers and of police cars that run out of gas, of garbage piled so deep that entire streets are rendered impassable and of books so poorly kept that no one can calculate its debt, has become a textbook case of everything that can go wrong in an American city. 
 "Take any urban ill in any city in this country and you will find all of it in East St. Louis, and you will find it compounded because it is concentrated and isolated," said Ronald Bean, executive director of the Illinois Development Finance Authority and a member of a board appointed by the state last fall to oversee the city's finances. "There is a serious question as to whether you can turn a community like this around. It's a tragic situation."
The city chose a new Mayor in an uncontested election on Tuesday, but few expect him to reverse a decline that has reached crisis proportions in the last two years. The city's slide into a kind of economic quicksand has confounded state officials, who in the last few months have been assigned to save it and who are only now beginning to quantify its desperation.
They are working without a road map or much precedent. While there has been no comparative research on East St. Louis and cities like it, economists can think of few if any places outside perhaps rural Appalachia or the Deep South where the problems are so pervasive and extreme.
The decline of East St. Louis has been so rapid that virtually anyone who could afford to leave has moved away. The city has gone from a peak of about 82,000 residents, mainly white, in 1960 to about 41,000 residents in 1990, nearly all of them black and poor. Fully half the city's residents are unemployed and 75 percent of them receive some form of public assistance.
Around the country there are several small, predominantly black towns that stand in the shadow of major cities -- Camden, N.J., and Gary, Ind., for instance -- all struggling with high unemployment and a host of urban ills. But most are much larger towns with a broader tax base and have managed to keep some of the industry that once made them great cities.
But East St. Louis is a city at rock bottom, a partly inhabited ghost town whose factories and theaters and hotels and auto dealerships and gas stations and half its schools are mostly burned-out shells.
The city was once a prosperous and brawling blue-collar town of stockyards and meat-packing plants, railroads and speakeasies and neat frame houses along the Mississippi River. Residents fondly remember when there were flowers in Jones Park, and when, as Willie Reese, an Alderwoman said, "you didn't mind for your relatives to come and visit you."
 
Tax Base Slips Away
 But advances in technology made the old meat-packing plants outdated; most of them closed by the 1970's, taking with them other industries and the city's tax base.
"I can't think of any city of its size that has as little to work with," said Charles L. Leven, a professor of urban economics at Washington University in St. Louis.
"It's a ghetto neighborhood that by historical accident is a town unto itself," he said. "That very separateness means that nothing good can spill over the boundary from St. Louis."
The result has been fiscal chaos of such proportions that the city cannot provide the most basic of services. The city has not collected trash for four years, forcing people to pay for private collection services, to burn garbage in their backyards or to dump it wherever they can. The city's decaying sewer system has spewed raw sewage into homes and schools. City police officers must sometimes patrol the city in their own cars because the city's police cars have broken down.
 
Giving Away City Hall
 Last year, unable to satisfy a court judgment against it, the city had to give away City Hall as part of a settlement that made East St. Louis a national symbol of municipal hard luck.
"You don't see anything like that in America in 1991," Mr. Bean said. "You could take pictures of Kuwait or Beirut or Baghdad and hold them up to a picture of East St. Louis and you could not tell the difference."
For the past 12 years, East St. Louis has was run by Mayor Carl E. Officer, a brusque and flamboyant third-generation funeral director who inherited a city weakened by corrupt administrations, most of them white-led machines influenced by organized crime.
But conditions only worsened during his administration as the city suffered embarrassment after embarrassment and the Mayor attributed the problems to white state and county officials who he said had abandoned the city, trying to take control rather than to help.
It was under his watch that the city had to give away City Hall, one of the few buildings not a shambles, to a prisoner who who was beaten by a fellow inmate in the city jail. In the last year or two, the city has had many of its basic powers -- like running the local housing authority or putting together a city budget -- taken over by the state or Federal Government.
And in perhaps the biggest debacle of the Officer administration, a grand scheme to turn the flood plains on the East St. Louis side of the Mississippi into luxury condominiums, ended in court rather than in the riverfront revival Mr. Officer had promised. The city was awarded $7 million to be paid by the Wall Street investment firm of Matthews & Wright for defrauding the city out of millions of dollars.
 
Judge Doesn't Trust City
 But the Federal judge who made the ruling did not trust the city with the money and set up a foundation to control it. Meanwhile, the riverfront remains a weed-filled wasteland, and Mr. Officer is under investigation for his role. Mr. Officer declined to comment on the case or the city.
In February, residents voted Mayor Officer out of the City Hall he gave away and chose Gordon Bush, a former City Treasurer who has a master's degree in urban planning, as their nominee in the Democratic primary. The 48-year-old Mayor-elect, who will take office May 1, had no opponents in the April 2 general election.
His election is being seen as a turning point for a city on the brink. In the campaign, voters walked up to Mr. Bush with desperation in their eyes. One told him, "If you don't pull it off this time, I'm selling my house and leaving."
While mayoral candidates in other cities may debate such things as zoning laws or corporate tax incentives, Mr. Bush won by just promising regular trash pickup. That is perhaps the most glaring problem in a city, whose trash-fueled fires make it look as if it has been bombed.
Carlos Harris, 16, stood outside his house the other day and watched yet another fire raging virtually in his backyard. This time someone set some tires on fire. "It doesn't scare me anymore," he said. "I'm used to it now."
Not far away, Mario Johnson, an Army veteran, surveyed the rubble that has accumulated in the charred and gutted house next to his. The old frame house has become his block's dumpsite. Its roof is in the front yard, collapsed and burnt, along with umbrellas, milk cartons, tires, old radios and television sets, mounds of debris and a lipstick-red sofa, which a man dumped there not too long ago in broad daylight.
 
'The Prettiest House'
 "That used to be the prettiest house on the block," Mr. Johnson said. "I get tired of cleaning it up. I saw the man when he dumped this couch here and told him to stop. He pulled a gun and did it anyway. There was nothing I could do. You have to go four or five miles before you see cleanness, and that's another city."
Just about the only sign of life is along Collinsville Avenue, the city's faded main street. There, wig shops and a Woolworth's compete for customers and a check-cashing business attracts so many welfare recipients on check day that vendors set up shop inside the office doors to sell cheap jewelry and incense to a ready market.
The problems are so severe that many people are wondering what difference a new Mayor can make.
Unlike Mr. Officer, who was considered abrasive and suspicious of outsiders, Mr. Bush is seen as a bridge builder. Still the city will need more than good will to climb out of the hole it is in. "They've got about the same resources as the South Bronx," Professor Leven said. "It's like going to Roxbury in Boston and saying, "You're on your own."
But East St. Louis has few places to turn for help. The state has its own problems. Jim Edgar, the new Governor of Illinois, a Republican, has already ordered $500 million in cuts from this year's state budget and will probably not have much to give East St. Louis.
Last year, the state lent the city $4 million to get it through the current fiscal year. A state-appointed financial board is now trying to restructure a debt that members can only guess at because the city has not been audited since 1985. Current estimates put the debt at $50 million.
Many local residents are looking to Mr. Bush as a possible savior, but some economists envision spotty improvements at best. Others see hope in the 40,000 people left in the city. "You can go down a block that is devastated and find one family hanging on," said Craig Howard, an urban planner who is a consultant to the city's court-appointed foundation. "We have to find a way of rebuilding on those people."
Residents suggest that there may be a lesson in one of the city's few success stories -- the hometown football team, which has led the state since 1983, with almost nothing to work with. The Flyers are considered so formidable that many teams refuse to play them.
"We know we don't have the money or the equipment that the people we compete against have," Bob Shannon, the coach said. "We don't taunt or talk on the field. We don't say we got cheated, because nobody wants to hear that. We win with class and lose with class."
There have been times when the Flyers did not have the money to launder their uniforms and team members showed up for championship games with holes in the seats of their pants. But they play anyway and usually win. They have a gut-deep incentive.
"They know if they play football well and do their lesson," the coach said, "they have a chance to get out."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Mexico Pact Faces Hurdle on Tuna Fishing

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 3

 BODY:
With the North American free-trade agreement at a critical stage, the United States and Mexico are locked in a dispute over the environmental damage caused by Mexico's tuna-fishing fleet.
The fishing disagreement, which has already provoked a United States embargo on imports of Mexican tuna, pits American environmentalists with wide public support against one of Mexico's largest and most powerful export industries, which traps and kills tens of thousands of dolphins in its tuna nets each year. 
 With international support growing to halt the killing of 80,000 dolphins each year by foreign fishing fleets like those from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, the dispute threatens to force President Bush into an emotional trade battle with the Mexican Government at the very moment he is courting and defending Mexico as a major trading partner.
 
Mexico Turns to GATT
 Faced with further losses or potential sanctions for its $450 million export fishing sector, Mexico has begun proceedings against the United States at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.
But the presentation of arguments in the GATT complaint, scheduled for May, are expected to coincide with a Congressional fight over the renewal of Presidential authority to negotiate a continentwide free-trade accord.
Mexican critics of the free-trade accord have already seized upon the conflict as an example of what they say will be American domination under any such pact. American conservation groups have cited the behavior of the Mexican tuna fleet to emphasize what they say is the need for tough environmental scrutiny of all aspects of a free-trade accord.
"In terms of sheer numbers, Mexico kills the most dolphins of any country by far," said David Phillips, executive director of the Earth Island Institute, an American conservation group that has played a leading role in forcing a ban on Mexican tuna.
At the heart of the dispute, experts say, is an unexplained natural affinity that causes dolphins and the yellowfin tuna to swim together in large schools. The air-breathing dolphins remain near the surface, breaking out of the water in spectacular jumps that help fishermen locate tuna schools from boats or helicopters.
Although the dolphins have no commercial value, they are often captured with the tuna in milelong nets that are used to encircle the schooling fish. The nets are drawn together with winches, crushing or drowning tens or even hundreds of dolphins in the course of a single tuna catch.
The United States Marine Mammal Protection Act and other environmental laws have sought to reduce the number of dolphins killed each year by imposing increasingly tough commercial sanctions on fleets that use the so-called dolphin encirclement technique.
 
Provoking Challenges
 But foreign fleets, including those from Mexico, Venezuela and other Latin American countries, continue to use the encirclement method, provoking challenges from environmentalists.
Last August the groups won a court-ordered embargo on all Mexican tuna imports under provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The embargo was upheld on appeal in February, and then broadened March 26 to include Venezuela and the tiny island republic of Vanuatu.
The embargo has been enforced reluctantly by the Bush Administration, which has insisted that Mexico is trying to reduce the number of dolphins killed by its fleet. The measure has also provoked bitter denunciations in Mexico as an example of American economic coercion.
But Government and environmental experts say that for offending countries like Mexico, which exported $56 million in tuna last year, the costs of the tuna conflict will grow dramatically if no attempt is made to abide by the American restrictions.
Since the largest American tuna canners, as a result of public pressure, have refused for a year to buy any but "dolphin safe" tuna, the embargo has thus far had only a limited effect on American tuna imports.
Under the provisions of the law, the embargo will automatically be extended after 90 days to tuna imports from all intermediary countries that buy and process tuna from the offending fishing fleets. After six months, experts say, it may be extended to cover other fish products from the violating countries, potentially affecting some $400 million in other Mexican fish exports.

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
LOSING a job tests the mettle of a family. The emotional effects, felt by children and spouse alike, can be as severe as the economic problems that result.
One of the challenges faced by parents is to tell their children what has happened. It is a task many parents dread. Yet psychologists and others who work with families in this situation say that parents' concerns about their children's reactions are often overblown. 
 "This sort of stressful situation can actually improve the relationship and communication between parents and children," said Dr. Bruce Roselle, a counseling psychologist at Personnel Decisions Inc. in Minneapolis, who works with middle- and senior-level managers who have lost jobs.
"The key is communication," Dr. Roselle said. "If you let your children know that you're sad, angry or afraid, they'll see you more as a real person instead of a white shirt and tie who heads off to work every morning. They'll see your feelings, but they'll also see that you're not overwhelmed by those feelings."
When Tom Vande Hei lost his job a year ago, among his first concerns were his children: one adult son, a boy and girl in college and a 12-year-old daughter at home. The issue was compounded two months later when his wife, Mary, was laid off as well.
"I wanted to protect them from having to worry," said Mr. Vande Hei, whose job as director of communications at a health maintenance organization in Minneapolis had been eliminated. "Yet I found that it was only creating more worry for the children because they didn't know the emotions I was experiencing. Once I started sharing that with them, there was a degree of insight and cooperation from them that I hadn't experienced before."
Once children feel confident that they are not in any immediate danger and you will not abandon them, they will try to understand what losing a job means. A child who is in preschool or early elementary school, for example, might ask if you lost your job because you were bad. "To them, it's as if you were sent to the principal's office," Dr. Roselle said.
They might also ask about ways they can help. "For older children, taking a cut in allowance, even if it's only a few dollars a week, makes them feel they're contributing to the family instead of being a burden," said Dr. William Roiter, a counseling psychologist at Hurst Associates in Boston, which runs employee assistance programs for corporations.
Not sharing information with children does not always mean blissful ignorance. Children tend to let their imaginations run wild. They interpret their parents' silence as confirmation of their fear that the situation is so disastrous that it cannot even be whispered about.
"I hear parents say that they don't want to tell their children they lost a job because they want to protect them," Dr. Roselle said. "But that usually means that the parents are trying to protect themselves from their children viewing them as failures."
Dr. Roiter described a banker who consulted him out of concern over changes in his 14-year-old daughter's behavior. The father had recently lost his job. He told the child little about the incident. He did not mention that because he worked at the bank for 20 years, he received a year's salary as severance and the family was in no immediate financial danger.
The girl assumed that she would no longer be able to attend college. Without telling her parents, she reluctantly changed her track in high school from precollege to secretarial. She also started avoiding her old friends because she was embarrassed about what she perceived as her family's plight.
"She became depressed because she was concerned about her parents and didn't want to burden them," Dr. Roiter said. "They became concerned about her because of her depression."
Remember that children will take cues from their parents as to how confident or upset they should be. "Children are resilient and adaptable," said Dr. Jerry M. Wiener, the chairman of the department of psychiatry at George Washington University in Washington. "They do enormously well when they feel their resources and contributions to the family are respected."
 
IN TELLING THE FACTS, IT'S TIMING THAT COUNTS
PARENTS who have lost a job can help their children come to grips with the situation.
Tell your children, but not necessarily immediately.
The first reactions to being dismissed are often shock and distress. It may take the better part of a week before you gain a realistic perspective. "Get your act together before you talk to your children," said Dr. William Roiter, a counseling psychologist in Boston.
Don't overwhelm children with information.
Tell them enough to reassure them and satisfy their curiosity, but not so much that they become confused and worried.
"With a preschooler, you simply reassure the child that things have changed, but that disaster has not struck," said Dr. Jerry M. Wiener, the chairman of the psychiatry department at George Washington University. "Children that age need reassurance that things are going to be O.K."
Older children might need some idea of what you will be doing to find a new job, and roughly how long you think it might take.
Let your children help plan the changes ahead.
This is especially important if your life style and finances will change dramatically. Suddenly telling children that you won't be able to go the movies or eat dinner out, if the family is used to doing those things, will leave them angry and perhaps worried. But those feelings can be eased if they feel they have even a small say.
"By involving your children in coming up with such things as a new family budget, they'll feel empowered," said Dr. Bruce Roselle, a psychologist in Minneapolis.
Don't allow children to feel a sense of shame.
Young children may feel that you are out of work because you, or they, did something bad. "It's very important to talk to your children about what they can tell their friends, so they don't feel they have to hide a family secret," Dr. Roiter said. "Encourage them to talk to one or two close friends about it so they don't feel isolated. Let them see and hear you talking to your close friends."
Allow your children to help.
Teen-agers may want to cut allowances or get after-school jobs. Younger children need to know they can help by cleaning their rooms or setting the table, so you can focus on your job search.

Social Conscience

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
The nuns who run The Nurturing Place here will never forget what Freddie said at the seashore. Almost none of the kids had ever seen the ocean before; their faces, when they came over the dunes and saw the water spread before them in all its fractious glory, were something to see. But Freddie captured the undercurrent of all their little lives after they went out to dinner and came back to the beach. The first one over the crest of sand, he turned to say triumphantly, "It's still there."
There are 52 kids at The Nurturing Place, an early childhood education program that is part of the York Street Project. Some of them are the children of the women who attend Kenmare, the project's high school for female dropouts. Some are the children who live in St. Joseph's Home, its residence for homeless women and their children. And many are children who suspect that if you find something wonderful, it will disappear if you turn your back. 
 All are 5 and under.
There are other children at the York Street Project. They are the teen-age children of the middle class, who come here to work with kids who may never in their lives have had a permanent address. In the soft glow of the aquarium they rock the little ones at nap time, or sit at tiny tables and spoon macaroni and cheese into tiny mouths. The little kids feel loved. And the teen-agers, who in middle-class America risk thinking that a bad perm is a personal tragedy, gain a social conscience.
Any adult who attended Catholic school remembers pagan babies. The name makes me cringe. We scraped together nickels in an intramural rivalry to see which class could send more money to children in Africa and South America, children we named Bernadette and Thomas.
We are no longer so ham-handed, but the chance of our children believing that the world is composed largely of people like them remains great. Many of us raise our families in communities that are homogeneous economically and racially, gazing in a mirror. "South Bronx, South Africa" I saw spray-painted on a wall in the South Bronx, and it would have seemed hyperbolic had I not just ridden on a subway train whose passengers were all African-American once north of Manhattan.
The girls from Mount St. Mary or Immaculate Heart Academy are crossing some lines at The Nurturing Place. At 17, many of them know more about the homeless than most adults. They know that the bundle of rags in a doorway is only one part of the problem, and that thousands of homeless Americans are children.
They know that when those kids first arrive at The Nurturing Place they never stop eating, because they have known hunger so profound. They know that by the last week of every month, those whose mothers rely on welfare will be ravenous at breakfast. And so they know what most of America does not: that the welfare allotment is woefully inadequate.
They also know that the homeless are lovable.
The students who come to The Nurturing Place are kids a parent could be proud of. Some are fulfilling school requirements in Christian Service, and some just like working with toddlers. During spring vacation they could have been hanging out at the mall, scoping out potential romance.
Instead they rise at 5 A.M. in pleasant homes on pleasant streets to serve juice to children who believe the ocean will disappear because no good things last. "I usually feel guilty when I get home," says one young woman. "I go into my room and I look at all my stuff."
This is a terrific thing, this acknowledgment of blessings. It is why The Nurturing Place is benefiting the big kids as well as the little ones. It is why more arrangements like this could benefit us all. While we work to give our children Reeboks and ski trips and concert tickets, sometimes what gets lost is social responsibility and an understanding of the humanity of people who have less.
It's hard work to raise the kids at The Nurturing Place. But it's hard work to raise kids in other places, too. And if they grow into adulthood bright and healthy and selfish, blind to the dark places right next door to their sunny suburbs, then they are half-people and those of us who are their parents are failures.

HEADLINE: A Fast -- and Prosperous -- Track

 BODY:
Congress confronts two chances, one monumental, to boost prosperity through freer trade:
*The five-year Uruguay Round of international trade talks is, barring catastrophe, about to produce a reverberating agreement slashing trade barriers and thereby adding trillions to the world's economies by the year 2000. 
 *Mexico and the U.S. have vowed to negotiate a free-trade pact, which should provide modest advantages to both countries' economies.
But before any of this happens, Congress must first approve an extension of fast-track legislation that requires it to vote on trade agreements promptly and without amendments. Otherwise each agreement will be prey to killer amendments pressed by special interests. Freer trade is one way Congress can spur the sluggish economy. Fast-track is the necessary first step.
The Uruguay Round is designed to cut tariffs and open foreign markets to exports of agriculture, services and intellectual property -- all vital to the U.S. economy. Negotiations are bogged down over protectionist farm policies of the European Community, but it has recently indicated some flexibility. The stakes are huge, especially for underdeveloped food-exporting nations.
The case for a Mexican free-trade pact is less compelling. For starters, bilateral agreements are inherently discriminatory: favored access to the U.S. market for Mexican textiles means unfavored access for Brazilian textiles. But in this instance, trade diversion will be small.
More troubling is opposition by organized labor, which says the pact would cost millions of U.S. jobs. This fear is exaggerated. Freer trade will bring more jobs and cheaper consumer goods. As Mexico has dismantled protective rules, U.S. exports of high-tech products have doubled.
Mexican manufacturing workers earn one-seventh the going U.S. rate, but much of the difference is due to higher U.S. productivity. Yet some of the wage disparity results from bloated costs hiding behind protective trade barriers. With a free-trade pact, workers in textiles and steel will be laid off.
The compassionate remedy is not to impose billions in higher prices on all Americans. It is to provide generous assistance and retraining for the few thousand affected workers.
Labor has a stronger case when it says Mexican employers must provide safe, humane working conditions. Mexico has already adopted international standards, but enforcement is weak.
Environmentalists fear that U.S. companies will flee to take advantage of Mexico's lax enforcement of pollution regulations. As The Times recently reported, pollution routinely leaks into rivers that carry it to the U.S. But the trade pact wouldn't worsen the problem.
Mexico is special; the common border and its program of economic reforms warrant President Bush's commitment. The Administration has addressed legitimate criticism by promising to negotiate working conditions and environmental protection separately.
The upcoming fast-track vote will cover both agreements. This raises the danger that opposition to the Mexican pact will scuttle the Uruguay Round. If that peril develops, prudence dictates separating the two votes; the Mexican pact isn't important enough to risk losing the Uruguay Round. But otherwise the best outcome for Americans is for Congress to give fast-track authority to both pacts.

HEADLINE: Save Libraries, and New York's Future

 BODY:
When Andrew Carnegie gave New York City the money for its branch library system, his intent was "to help those who will help themselves; to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so."
Carnegie suspected that access to books could reshape lives dramatically, particularly among the city's impoverished new immigrants. Millions who grew up in these libraries know how right he was. 
 The library system is now on the verge of collapse, reeling from budget cuts forced by the city's mounting fiscal problems. A few private citizens and philanthropists have come forward. But more help is needed, lest the libraries wither and die, taking part of the city's future with them.
The public library system is actually three systems. The New York Public Library covers Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx. The Brooklyn Public Library covers its own borough, as does the Queens Borough Public Library, which has the busiest circulation desks in the nation.
When Carnegie's last branch library opened its doors in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx in 1929, hungry readers immediately swept its shelves clean of books. The appetite for libraries is equally voracious today. The immigrants still stream in and expect to be taught everything: how to read English, get a driver's license, take a college entrance exam, run a small business.
The budget cuts have taken a toll. Children's services are being eliminated. The literacy programs that last year taught reading to 5,000 adults are being shut down. Entire branches are shut for parts of several days each week. And book collections that never recovered from the last fiscal crisis are once again dying.
On average, only about 1 percent of the money for branch libraries comes from private sources. The three library systems are struggling to improve on that. The New York Library, for example, has developed the Adopt-a-Branch program, a public-private partnership to which two donors have pledged $500,000 each to renovate two needy branches in the Bronx. This effort merits further support -- and replication.
New York's fiscal crisis will ease one day. Neglected roads and bridges will be repaired and deferred projects revived. But to wait for full economic recovery to help the libraries is to risk incalculable damage to New York's human capital. Government cannot escape its responsibility. But the spirit of philanthropy that created the libraries is urgently needed to keep them alive.

HEADLINE: Padding the Gulf War Bill

BYLINE: By Lawrence Korb; Lawrence Korb, a Pentagon official in the Reagan Administration, is a fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When the U.S. decided on military action against Iraq, it made two decisions about financing. First, the costs of the operation would be off- budget, and thus not counted in the deficit. And second, our allies would be asked to pay 80 percent of the costs.
When our generals expected the war to last months and result in tens of thousands of casualties, the Pentagon projected the cost of deploying and redeploying the forces and waging war at about $70 billion. And the Administration sought and received $56 billion in pledges, primarily from Germany and Japan. 
 Fortunately, the military's estimates of the casualties and the war's duration proved to be highly inflated. This circumstance, however, has not led the Pentagon to revise its estimates accordingly. Gen. Colin L. Powell and senior Administration officials still argue that the war costs will be around $70 billion.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost at $40 billion -- some $15 billion less than the pledges already made. When an economist for the opposition Social Democratic Party in Germany cited the lower Congressional estimate and urged Bonn to pay less than it had pledged, Senator John Warner lambasted the party and the Germans for talking about money when there were 329 gulf-related U.S. deaths. The German Finance Ministry promptly paid in full. Congress, meanwhile, threatened retaliation against any nation not fulfilling its pledge.
The 1990 Omnibus Reconciliation Act, which put the war off-budget, specified that the supplemental budget should not be used to finance costs the Pentagon would normally experience. The Pentagon has violated the spirit of this act in several ways.
First, it has switched funding for the war's glamour missiles from its regular budget to the supplemental budget. The baseline budget for fiscal 1992 was supposed to buy about 6,500 Patriot, Tomahawk, Hellfire and Harm missiles. When that budget was presented to Congress in February, the Pentagon requested funds for only 1,500 of these four types of missiles. But it sought to purchase almost 6,000 with the supplemental budget, even though we used fewer than that number in the gulf and would have bought them anyway.
Second, the military wants the allies to pay for normal wear and tear of equipment. From 1986 through 1990, the Navy lost more than 230 planes to accidents -- about four a month. Replacing planes lost at this rate is factored into the normal military budget. In the nearly two months of combat, the Navy lost seven planes to enemy fire -- about four a month. Seeking to replace these planes is really double counting.
Similarly, the Navy and Marine Corps deployed 190 F/A-18 Hornets in the gulf. They flew an average of about 67 hours a month from August through February -- only slightly more than they normally fly on routine peacetime deployments. Yet the Pentagon estimates that the operations and maintenance costs will increase by more than 50 percent.
The supplemental request also ignores that by 1995 the structure of the armed forces will be 25 percent below that of 1990. Instead of 36 tactical air wings in the Air Force, there will be only 26. Since there are about 100 planes in each wing, the Air Force will have 1,000 fewer planes in its inventory by the middle of the decade. Does it make sense to seek special funding for the 18 aircraft the Air Force lost in the gulf war?
In the ground war, the Army used up equipment stocks placed in Europe for the six Army divisions that were to have been deployed in the event of a Warsaw Pact attack. With no more Warsaw Pact, why replace all this equipment?
From the beginning of the conflict, the Pentagon tried to use this off-budget and foreign-funded account to offset the reductions mandated by last fall's budget agreement. If we want our allies to fund the war in full or pay us for spilling our blood, we ought to say so.

HEADLINE: Poland's Plans to Use Debt Relief

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I appreciate your support of the idea of a significant debt write-off for Poland in "Eleventh Hour for Polish Capitalism" (editorial, March 5) and would like to follow up on it.
There are at least two approaches to debt repayment. In the first, the lender attempts to collect his debt by any means, including annihilation of the debtor. In the other, a more imaginative banker has interests that span beyond the initial loan to larger investments, greater profits and longer term commitments to the client. With the perspective of the second, more creative money lender, Poland is asking for a program in which the portion of the debt forgiven would not be consumed by society in general, but be invested in programs to improve environmental quality and the Polish infrastructure, creating more attractive and secure conditions for further investment. 
 The Polish Ministry of Environment has recently drafted a proposal, "Redirecting Debt Service for Environmental Recovery Purposes," in which it proposes using money from a major debt write-off to finance programs for environmental recovery. This idea developed from Polish-American projects on environmental protection and sustainable development at the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs in 1988-90.
The Polish Government has established and prioritized domestic environmental policies for the most urgent problems, related mainly to (1) the supply of safe drinking water; (2) air quality, through promotion of technologies that reduce environmentally damaging emissions from coal burning; (3) hazardous waste management, to reduce the health risks, and (4) safe food production, through conversion of contaminated lands to nonfood crop production.
The Polish Government has also established activities to reduce its contribution to global environmental degradation, including (1) abatement of long-range transboundary air pollution by means of reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions; (2) reduction of contamination and eutrophication of the Baltic Sea; (3) reduction in release of greenhouse gases by improving energy efficiency, increasing carbon retention and reducing nonpoint methane emissions, and (4) preservation of biological diversity through environmentally sensitive development in those regions that contain some of the most valuable natural assets in Europe. The proposal calls for a trust fund -- fed by money redirected from a portion of foreign debt service -- to be allocated to specific projects of international importance.
As American society has shown strong support for the political and economic reforms that Poland is pioneering among former Communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe, it is important to point out the critical link between the environment and these reforms. Poland cannot
sustain political changes and improve economic conditions in the face of dropping life expectancy, growing morbidity and mortality, increasing poisoning of air, soils and waters.
For that very reason, Poland, deteriorated but liberated from Communism, needs to be treated at least as well as the United States treated its former enemies at the end of World War II. Debt forgiveness for Poland should also be regarded as an investment in further democratization and political stability in Eastern Europe, as well as in a healthier global environment.

HEADLINE: Soviet TV Viewers Want Public Affairs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You provide a good overview of some of the changes taking place in Soviet television programming in "Soviet TV Reflects the Kremlin's Grimmer Picture" (front page, Feb. 8). You write that the official rationale for cutting back on public affairs programming and increasing entertainment programming is public opinion, conveyed through polls.
Certainly, Soviet television has neglected entertainment shows, for economic and political reasons, and that imbalance is likely to be righted in the future. However, if public opinion is to be taken account of, then the most overwhelming and decisive judgment of the public should also be noted. 
 In a national survey in the Soviet Union, in which I participated, it was the program "Vzglyad" ("Viewpoint") that was the clear favorite. This contentious and bold investigative reporting showcase -- now suspended -- was put among the top five favorite programs by 67 percent of the Soviet citizens in seven republics (where 88 percent of the population lives).
The next most popular show gained 40 percent.
Moreover, "Vzglyad" was the favorite for 71 percent of those younger than 60, 73 percent of the college educated (and 71 percent of those with high school diplomas) and 62 percent of the members of the Communist Party. These are impressive figures, and they should be used if ratings are to drive programming.
In addition, you note that parliamentary debates have now been relegated to late-night hours.
Actually, that practice was initiated much earlier: after the 1989 live coverage of these lively and often searing sessions, there was a 20 percent drop in Soviet production, as the viewers were glued to their television sets. It was then that the change took place.

HEADLINE: Graham Greene, 86, Dies; Novelist of the Soul

 BODY:
Graham Greene, the British author whose novels of suspense and moral ambiguity plumbed the sordid politics of the modern world and the inner torments of mankind, died yesterday at La Providence Hospital in Vevey, near Lake Geneva in Switzerland. He was 86 years old.
The official cause of death was not immediately known, but his daughter, Caroline Bourget, told Reuters that her father died of a blood disease. Mr. Greene lived in an apartment in Antibes, France, but had traveled all over the world in search of subject matter during his 60-year writing career. 
 Among Mr. Greene's 24 novels, many of which were adapted into films, were "The Power and the Glory," "The Heart of the Matter," "The Third Man," "The Quiet American," "Our Man in Havana," "The Comedians," "The Honorary Consul" and "The Human Factor."
 
27 Languages, 20 Million Copies
 His plays included "The Living Room," "The Potting Shed" and "The Complaisant Lover," and he wrote dozens of short stories. His work was translated into 27 languages and sold more than 20 million copies in hard-cover and paperback editions.
He also wrote travel books, essays and children's stories, and two autobiographies, "A Sort of Life" and "Ways of Escape." An occasional contributor to newspapers and magazines, he even found time to write strong letters to the editor on political and literary matters.
That Mr. Greene never received the Nobel Prize in Literature was a source of regret and astonishment to many readers and publishing professionals.
In his outspoken comments on world affairs in fiction and in fact -- including criticism of American military intervention in Vietnam and in Central America -- Mr. Greene felt an obligation to express his views first and foremost as a moralist. He was a convert to Catholicism but not, he asserted, a Catholic writer.
"I think a writer ought to be a bit of grit in the state machine," he once said. "That applies to a democratic state machine, a socialist state machine or a Communist state machine."
Mr. Greene was a superb storyteller with a gift for provoking controversy by writing topical novels in political settings. But many of his deepest concerns were spiritual: a soul working out its salvation or damnation amid the paradoxes and anomalies of 20th-century existence.
Spiritual problems, however, were frequently overshadowed, especially for readers in this country, by Mr. Greene's distaste for what he regarded as American hypocrisy and materialism. "The Quiet American" (1956) and "The Comedians" (1966), for example, offended some readers because of their criticism of United States policies in Vietnam and Haiti.
Besides serious fiction, Mr. Greene also wrote what he described as "entertainments." These -- "Orient Express," "This Gun for Hire," "Brighton Rock" and "Our Man in Havana," for instance -- were first-rate novels of crime and intrigue. But they, too, showed a profound interest in the interplay of morality and abnormal behavior. "Brighton Rock," he wrote in his 1980 autobiography, "Ways of Escape," was "perhaps one of the best I ever wrote."
In addition, Mr. Greene was often labeled a Roman Catholic writer, a description that annoyed him but that nevertheless colored understanding of his work. He was indeed a convert to Catholicism and he did deal with doctrinal issues, but he insisted that he was not a church publicist.
 
Roman Catholic Ideas But Church Objections
 "Only a few of my books have a religious emphasis -- 'Brighton Rock,' 'The Power and the Glory,' 'The End of the Affair' and 'The Heart of the Matter' -- but I don't consider myself a Catholic writer, but a writer who took characters with Catholic ideas as his material," Mr. Greene said in an interview with Alden Whitman of The New York Times in Paris in 1967. "After all, one of my novels, 'The Power and the Glory,' was condemned by the Holy Office in 1951."
That book, in which the cult of the spiritual holds back the people, whose true enemies are the priests, shocked many Catholics. "I was not upset," Mr. Greene said in 1967. "In a private audience, Pope Paul told me he had read the novel and liked it. 'Parts of your novels will always offend some Catholics, but you should not bother,' the Pope said."
Later, in a 1978 interview, Mr. Greene acknowledged a lingering skepticism about religion, and particularly Catholicism:
"I don't like many English Catholics," he said. "I don't like conventional religious piety. I'm more at ease with the Catholicism of Catholic countries. I've always found it difficult to believe in God. I suppose I'd now call myself a Catholic atheist."
The Catholic-writer label was first affixed when "Brighton Rock" was published, and then more firmly after the publication of "The Heart of the Matter," one of his most popular books with both critics and public, though Mr. Greene said he thought it flawed. After the book came out, he wrote in 1980, "at a stroke I found myself regarded as a Catholic author in England, Europe and America -- the last title to which I had ever aspired."
 
At His Works' Center, A Sense of Evil
 Yet Mr. Greene did not deny that he viewed the world through a moralist's eyes. This was also the conclusion of many critics. One critic, Richard Church, a Briton, summed up the prevailing attitude:
"He sees his characters, and the scenes in which they make their penance, with an eye that elongates them and draws them into gestures made in a garish light. He delights to expose the raw nerves of evil, showing it as a force in the world, a skeletonlike figure working visible mischief in the ordinary everyday affairs of men and women and children."
Mr. Greene's writer's appeal, however, extended beyond readers concerned with good and evil to encompass those who liked a good story. He had some of the narrative flair of Robert Louis Stevenson, to whom he was related. He had, moreover, a talent for depicting local color, which he gathered at first hand; a keen sense of the dramatic; an ear for dialogue, and skill in pacing his prose.
Mr. Greene's backgrounds and situations often grew out of his own wanderings. In the late 1930's, he wrote, "a restlessness set in then which has never quite been allayed; a desire to be a spectator of history, history in which I was concerned myself."
Again and again in his autobiography, Mr. Greene stressed this desire to be on the edge of danger; writing of his visits to Indochina, he mentions being attracted by the women, the evening light and, "above all, by the feeling of exhilaration which a measure of danger brings to a visitor with a return ticket."
 
Prose That Traveled Too Swiftly to Stall
 "The average Greene novel," wrote the critic Adam de Hegedus, "seems to be based on a theory which is not unlike that principle of aerodynamics according to which the aircraft must maintain a specific speed or else it would tumble down. This speed Greene achieves by a masterly selection of detail, by a splendid economy of language and by swift and frequent changes of scene."
Mr. Greene had a somewhat puffy face and eyes that looked down warily from his 6-foot 2-inch height. His manner was generally affable but shy. In talking, he had a tendency to skip over his R's.
He had an obvious fondness for order and quiet that contrasted with his adventurous life. Born Oct. 2, 1904, in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England, he was one of four sons of Canon Charles Henry Greene and the former Marion Raymond Greene, who were cousins. Graham attended Berkhamsted School, of which his father was headmaster, and then Balliol College, Oxford. His childhood, he said, was unhappy.
 
The Deadliest of Games Becomes a Habit
 The biographer Norman Sherry, in "The Life of Graham Greene, Volume I: 1904-1939" (Viking, 1989), described a crisis that the future author went through in his second-to-last year at Berkhamsted: two classmates persecuted him -- among other things, for being bad at games -- and he suffered a nervous collapse.
His family then sent him to a psychoanalyst in London, prompting an experience that in the long run, Mr. Sherry wrote, "may well have established his life's pattern of escaping from the impossible or the boring into unknown and dangerous environments which would stimulate, offer fresh experiences and also provide copy for his novels."
Mr. Greene himself wrote later that "the psychoanalysis fixed the boredom as hypo fixes the image on a negative." So he took to playing Russian roulette with an elder brother's revolver.
"I slipped the bullet into a chamber and, holding the revolver behind my back, spun the chambers round," he recalled. "I put the muzzle of the revolver to my right ear and pulled the trigger. There was a minute click, and looking down the chamber I could see that the charge had moved into place. I was out by one."
Mr. Greene took the revolver with him to Balliol and continued to play Russian roulette until he found that "I was beginning to pull the trigger about as casually as I might take an aspirin tablet."
Later on, Mr. Greene experimented with opium, marched across Liberia and went, in wartime, into Malaya, Kenya and Indochina.
Out of Oxford, where he had briefly been a member of the Communist Party, Mr. Greene worked as a copy editor on The Times of London from 1926 to 1930. "I am journalistically minded," he once said. And he fiercely took issue with those who questioned the journalistic accuracy of his fiction, especially in "The Quiet American."
"Some critics have referred to a strange violent 'seedy' region of the mind (why did I ever popularize that last adjective?) which they call Greeneland, and I have sometimes wondered whether they go round the world blinkered," he wrote later. " 'This is Indochina,' I want to exclaim, 'this is Mexico, this is Sierra Leone carefully and accurately described. I have been a newspaper correspondent as well as a novelist. I assure you that the dead child lay in the ditch in just that attitude. In the canal of Phat Diem the bodies stuck out of the water. But I know that argument is useless. They won't believe the world they haven't noticed is like that."
 
His Fiancee's Religion Becomes His Own
 It was just before he joined The Times that he became a convert to Catholicism from Anglicanism. Summarizing the experience, the psychiatrist and author Robert Coles wrote in 1989, in The New York Times Book Review, that it came about through Mr. Greene's relationship with his future wife, Vivien Dayrell-Browning, herself a convert to Catholicism. Her "moral and religious preoccupations became very much his," Dr. Coles wrote, and "at the age of 22, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church."
In an interview published in 1983, Mr. Greene said a first step in the process was the day when, while attending a Catholic service, "I slipped a note into a collection box, asking for instruction because my fiancee was Catholic.
"I wanted a better grasp of the nature of her faith. I had no thought of becoming a convert myself."
His subsequent conversion, he said, "was purely intellectual," because of the arguments of a priest, a Father Trollope, "which persuaded me that God's existence was a probability."
On another occasion, Mr. Greene wrote that it was not until years later, when he had first traveled to Mexico, that he found "emotional belief" as opposed to intellectual acceptance of his religion.
A year after his conversion, Mr. Greene married Miss Dayrell-Browning. The couple had a son and a daughter and then separated in the 1960's. His daughter, Caroline Bourget, lives in Jongny, Switzerland. His son, Francis, lives in Devon, England.
Mr. Greene's first two novels, "The Man Within" and "The Name of Action," were written while he was on The Times. He left that newspaper in 1930 to become a movie critic, first for the periodical Night and Day and then for The Spectator, for the next 10 years. Early in this period he began his entertainments ("The difference between an entertainment and a novel is about 20,000 words") with "Orient Express," which was titled "Stamboul Train" in Britain.
This thriller almost immediately became popular, as were most of his in that genre. His reputation as a novelist soared with "Brighton Rock," published in 1938, which deals with homicide in the British resort town of Brighton. International renown came in the years after the war, especially with "The Heart of the Matter" in 1948.
The scene of this novel, considered among his best, is in West Africa, where Mr. Greene did intelligence work for the British Government during World War II. The protagonist is Maj. Henry Scobie, an essentially commonplace man capable of pity to the point of obsession. It is pity that does the major in. Although a Roman Catholic, his sympathy for, and understanding of, his wife and his mistress lead him to commit suicide to keep from hurting their feelings. The burden of love proves too much for him.
 
'The Quiet American' Is an American Success
 Among Mr. Greene's big successes in this country was "The Quiet American," published in 1956. The novel is a tart study of an American Government do-gooder in Saigon during the anti-French uprisings of the mid-1950's. The writer insisted that he was not anti-American and that his novel recorded only what he saw in Saigon, where he was the correspondent, in 1954, for The New Republic.
Mr. Greene was especially fond of "The Power and the Glory," a novel published in 1940. It is the story of a manhunt in the jungles and mountains of Mexico. The hunted is the last priest in a state where religion is outlawed: an imperfect priest, prey to alcohol and lust, yet a humble man who loves God.
Many of Mr. Greene's books were made into movies, but he said he felt the movies did not serve him well. "I hate the adaptations of my books, except when I do them myself, and then I don't always like them," he said.
Once he had attained success, Mr. Greene spent much of his time traveling. But he worked during these journeys, too, dictating and revising. "I like writing after breakfast," he explained, "and revising after a good dinner, when I have Dutch courage."
He was a steady writer who was not afraid to discard projects, even when they were well advanced, if they failed to satisfy him. "I hope I'm an artist," he told a visitor in 1967; on another occasion, in a bleaker mood, he remarked, "I have no talent; it's just a question of working, of being willing to put in the time."
 
The Effects of Place And of Henry James
 Mr. Greene was often asked what other writers had influenced him, and for this he had a ready reply:
"What one reads doesn't influence one as much as where one is. Still, a great many writers have had their effect on me. The serious ones, I guess, were Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad and Henry James. He was my idol, but to say he influenced me is a bit absurd -- like saying a mountain influenced a mouse."
Mr. Greene's structuring of his novels seemed ideally suited to the camera and the stage. "I have a theatrical mind," he once said. But his own plays -- including "The Living Room," "The Potting Shed," "The Complaisant Lover," "Carving a Statue" and "The Return of A. J. Raffles" -- were not outstandingly successful.
Mr. Greene's long writing career made him wealthy as well as famous. He was little affected, because he preferred privacy to basking in adulation. He enjoyed his income, nonetheless, for it permitted him to live in considerable comfort and to eat well.
Of his many works, "The Honorary Consul," he said, was especially hard to write, and "perhaps the novel I prefer to all the others," while "Travels With My Aunt" was "the only book I have written for the fun of it." "Travels With My Aunt," which came out in 1969, is a lighthearted novel about a retired bank employee traveling around the world with 75-year-old dowager who has a black lover named Wordsworth.
Mr. Greene's literary fame was recognized formally in 1966, when he was named by Queen Elizabeth II as a Companion of Honor. In 1986, he received one of the highest British honors, the Order of Merit.
Critical enthusiasm waned for Mr. Greene's later works. "The Honorary Consul" (1973), "The Human Factor" (1978) and "The Captain and the Enemy" (1988) all received uneven reviews.
Mr. Greene himself had long since taken a detached view of questions of literary success or failure. Striking the understated note of guilt and gloom that was catnip to his loyal readers, he told an interviewer in 1971: "One fails in all sorts of ways in life, doesn't one, which are much more important than writing books. In human relations and that sort of thing."
But another estimation of his feelings about his work came in "Ways of Escape," when he wrote, "Writing is a form of therapy; sometimes I wonder how all those who do not write, compose or paint can manage to escape the madness, the melancholia, the panic fear which is inherent in the human situation."
 
Opening Words on the Moral Anxieties of an Anguished Century
In the course of a career that spanned more than six decades, Graham Greene wrote 24 novels, along with many short stories, essays and plays and two volumes of autobiography. Here is a sampling from the opening chapters of some of his novels and a list of some major works.
 Mr. Tench went out to look for his ether cylinder: out into the blazing Mexican sun and the bleaching dust. A few buzzards looked down from the roof with shabby indifference: he wasn't carrion yet. A faint feeling of rebellion stirred in Mr. Tench's heart, and he wrenched up a piece of the road with splintering fingernails and tossed it feebly up at them. One of them rose and flapped across the town: over the tiny plaza, over the bust of an ex-president, ex-general, ex-human being, over the two stalls which sold mineral water, towards the river and the sea. It wouldn't find anything there: the sharks looked after the carrion on that side. Mr. Tench went on across the plaza.
He said "Buenos dias" to a man with a gun who sat in a small patch of shade against a wall. But it wasn't like England: the man said nothing at all, just stared malevolently up at Mr. Tench, as if he had never had any dealings with the foreigner, as if Mr. Tench were not responsible for his two gold bicuspid teeth.
 -- From "The Power and the Glory" (1940, Viking)
Wilson sat on the balcony of the Bedford Hotel with his bald pink knees thrust against the ironwork. It was Sunday and the Cathedral bell clanged for matins. On the other side of Bond Street, in the windows of the High School, sat the young negresses in dark-blue gym smocks engaged on the interminable task of trying to wave their wirespring hair. Wilson stroked his very young moustache and dreamed, waiting for his gin-and-bitters.
Sitting there, facing Bond Street, he had his face turned to the sea. His pallor showed how recently he had emerged from it into the port: so did his lack of interest in the schoolgirls opposite.
 -- From "The Heart of the Matter" (1948, Viking)
One never knows when the blow may fall. When I saw Rollo Martins first I made this note on him for my security police files: "In normal circumstances a cheerful fool. Drinks too much and may cause a little trouble. Whenever a woman passes raises his eyes and makes some comment, but I get the impression that really he'd rather not be bothered. Has never really grown up and perhaps that accounts for the way he worshiped Lime." I wrote there that phrase "in normal circumstances" because I met him first at Harry Lime's funeral. It was February, and the gravediggers had been forced to use electric drills to open the frozen ground in Vienna's Central Cemetery. It was as if even nature were doing its best to reject Lime, but we got him in at last and laid the earth back on him like bricks.
 -- From "The Third Man" (1950, Viking)
 After dinner I sat and waited for Pyle in my room over the rue Catinat: he had said, "I'll be with you at latest by 10," and when midnight had struck I couldn't stay quiet any longer and went down into the street. A lot of old women in black trousers squatted on the landing; it was February and I suppose too hot for them in bed. One trishaw driver pedaled slowly by towards the river front, and I could see lamps burning where they had disembarked the new American planes. There was no sign of Pyle anywhere in the long street.
Of course, I told myself, he might have been detained for some reason at the American Legation, but surely in that case he would have telephoned to the restaurant -- he was very meticulous about small courtesies. I turned to go indoors when I saw a girl waiting in the next doorway. I couldn't see her face, only the white silk trousers and the long flowered robe, but I knew her for all that.

HEADLINE: 'Tough' Year No Reason to Quit, Myers Says

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
New York City's Health Commissioner, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., yesterday expressed frustration over his first year with city government, but said his mother-in-law's illness would determine whether he stayed on the job.
In an interview, Dr. Myers denied news reports quoting department officials who said he had been offered another job and was considering quitting out of dissatisfaction. But he described his first year in the city as "tough" and acknowledged frustration with the city's bureaucracy and fiscal problems that have limited the Health Department's work in the three areas he considers priorities -- child health, drug abuse and AIDS.
 
 Appearing with Mayor David N. Dinkins at a news conference earlier yesterday, Dr. Myers said he had not decided whether the time and financial obligations imposed by his mother-in-law's condition, which he did not identify, would force him to resign. He said Mayor Dinkins had given him time to consider the question.
 
'Incredibly Interesting'
 "I am trying the best I can to come to grips with some tough issues," he said. "I have liked the opportunities that have been afforded to me in the City of New York. It is one incredibly interesting place to be."
Yesterday was another mixed day for Dr. Myers. The Mayor publicly praised him for helping to secure an additional $17.6 million in Federal money to be spent on 20 New York City areas that account for 75 percent of its reported AIDS cases. But the Commissioner was required to submit a plan showing which programs would bear the cuts ordered by the Mayor -- $28 million, or 17 percent, of his budget.
Dr. Myers declined to give details about what he proposed. "I'll resist cuts that I believe will damage the quality of care that we provide," he said in the interview.
The budget crunch comes as the city is experiencing troubling rates of infant mortality and communicable diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis, measles and syphilis. "We're seeing a resurgence of a number of diseases that have no business growing and are directly attributable to poverty, drugs and the economic circumstances of government," Dr. Myers said.
But he also said his department was doing well under the circumstances and spoke enthusiastically about its accomplishments under his tenure. He described his upper-level management team -- 98 percent of whom are his own recruits -- as a "top-flight group of people." He said the department had created programs aimed at approaching health problems more creatively. For instance, he said, drug use in pregnant women has quadruped since 1985; the department responded by offering both substance-abuse treatment and prenatal care at one site.
Dr. Myers, 37 years old, came to New York City last year after serving as health commissioner for his native Indiana. There, he had backed a law requiring the recording of names of people infected with AIDS and tracing their sex and drug partners -- an approach that produced scathing criticism from AIDS groups here.
 Although he has not advocated those policies here, he soon upset AIDS groups again by abolishing a program that taught intravenous drug users how to disinfect needles with bleach to avoid the virus. These organizations and others in the health care community also faulted him for not being forceful enough in speaking out on health issues.
 Dr. Myers said he had overcome the ill feelings from AIDS organizations, but added, "There are a lot of people who don't want to believe that this commissioner can be successful."
Dr. Myers' wife, Debra, is a physician specializing in pulmonary diseases and sleep disorders. They live with their two children, a 12-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old-son, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. The Commissioner also teaches at Cornell Medical School in Manhattan.
Department officials who declined to be named said on Tuesday that Dr. Myers had become dissatisfied over a number of issues, including his access to the Mayor, and had been seeking other employment.
Health Department officials confirmed Tuesday that he was considering resigning, but said the reason was his mother-in-law's illness.
Intensely private, Dr. Myers refused yesterday to discuss the details of his mother-in-law's illness or his own personal financial problems, which Mayor Dinkins alluded to during yesterday's news conference. The Mayor said Dr. Myers took a pay cut when he accepted his current post, which pays $110,000 a year.
Dr. Myers has no deadline for his decision. He said it would take "as short as I possibly can."
"At this point there are too many variables," he said. "I don't have enough information yet."
Of his tenure, he said: "It's been very tough, exceptionally challenging. I've had to think more on my feet and push myself to meet the challenge."
But he professed to have not been disappointed. "I came to this city over a year ago to have what I thought would be the most exciting challenge in my life, and it's been all of that."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
White Sox Decide to Gamble on Bo Jackson

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
With questions about his health and athletic future still unanswered, Bo Jackson made a rapid return to baseball employment yesterday, signing a contract with the Chicago White Sox in which both sides will share the economic risk of the unknown.
Jackson, whose dual stardom in baseball and football is unprecedented, could earn $8.15 million over three years (not counting potential bonuses for various awards), but the White Sox have guaranteed only $700,000 as his salary for this season.
 
 Jackson, whom the Kansas City Royals released 16 days ago because of a football injury to his hip, chose the White Sox, expressing his preference for the team, its new stadium, its medical staff and the city of Chicago. Among other teams said to have expressed interest were the Atlanta Braves and the Toronto Blue Jays.
 
Michael Expresses Surprise
 General Manager Gene Michael of the Yankees, the team that turned down the first chance to sign Jackson after he was placed on waivers, said he was somewhat surprised by the White Sox's decision to sign Jackson. He would still not second-guess the decision of the Yankees not to claim Jackson on waivers, which would have required the club to pay him the $2,375,000 salary from his Royals contract.
"No way," Michael said at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "How could I second-guess the doctors?"
Of the White Sox, he added, "It's their business."
The White Sox contract does not prohibit Jackson from playing football, but a Jackson associate, who insisted on anonymity, said that Jackson knows that even if he plays baseball again, he will not be able to continue his National Football League career with the Los Angeles Raiders.
"Bo is well aware of the fact that he won't play football again," the associate said. "He has been told that's a risk he can't take. They'll deny it, but he knows it. He knows baseball is his life now."
 Jackson, 28 years old, has become a worldwide celebrity through his two-sport feats and the resulting television commercials and endorsements that bring him more money than he earns in his sports salaries. Some estimates have put his off-field income at about $5 million a year.
 The White Sox contract calls for a guaranteed salary of $700,000 this year, whether or not Jackson plays, and two option years. The $700,000 is the minimum Jackson could earn from the agreement. By earning bonuses of $10,000 a game -- with a different maximum number of games each year -- Jackson could earn as much as $1.5 million this year, $2.9 million next year and $3.75 million in 1993. Those totals do not include bonuses he could earn (a maximum of $500,000 each year) for a variety of awards.
 The contract, with the option years, would take Jackson one year past the time he would be eligible to become a free agent. He will be on the disabled list until he is able to play.
Explaining his decision to sign Jackson, Jerry Reinsdorf, White Sox co-owner, said it was not "a marketing thing because we're going to have an enormous ticket sale this year with the new stadium."
 "In making the business decision," Reinsdorf continued, "I assume he will not play this year. If he does, it will be a big bonus. But considering the total dollars he could potentially earn, compared with what we have to pay if he never plays, 90 percent is based on his ability to play. Considering that the financial risk is one we can afford to take, when you look at the risk-reward ratio, it's tremendous. The potential upside is tremendous. We're risking what is a substantial amount of money; it's not chopped liver. But it's certainly a reasonable amount."
 Reinsdorf offered an analogy. "It's like life insurance," he said. "You pay the premium, the premium is gone. But if it turns out you die, your family is very happy you had the insurance. We can afford the premium. If he comes back, we'll be thrilled with the results."
 If Jackson comes back this year, he would earn $10,000 for each game he is available to play up to 80 games. If he is available for 40 games, including 30 after Aug. 31, the option for 1992 will be automatically exercised.
Then, next season his base salary would be the salary he earned in 1991 less $100,000, and he could earn $10,000 a game up to 150 games. If he is available for 125 games in 1992, the 1993 option will automatically vest. His 1993 base salary would be equal to the salary he earned in 1992, and he could again earn $10,000 a game. But his maximum salary would be $3.75 million.
 Speaking at a news conference at the club's spring training complex in Sarasota, Fla., Dr. James Boscardin, the White Sox orthopedist, said the club initially thought Jackson's hip injury was "worse than it actually is from the media reports and such."
"We believe there's a very good chance Bo can become a productive member of the White Sox," he said
 Ron Schueler, the White Sox general manager, said a reasonable expectation was that Jackson would return in 1992. If he doesn't play this year but the White Sox exercise the option for 1992, his base salary would be $600,000.
 
Injured in January
 The injury Jackson suffered to his left hip in an N.F.L. playoff game Jan. 13 jeopardized his dual sports career and his dynamic commercial career. The Royals concluded, based on a report by their orthopedist, Dr. Steve Joyce, that Jackson would most likely not be able to play this year and perhaps never again. Rather than pay him his entire 1991 salary of $2,375,000, they decided to release him and give him the required 30 days' termination pay, which amounts to $391,484.
 The other 25 teams could have claimed him on waivers for $1, but all passed, put off by the risk of paying his entire salary but not knowing if he could play. The Yankees, as the American League team with the worst record in 1990, had first crack at him but opted not to gamble, citing the recommendations of seven orthopedists they consulted.
The White Sox were among the clubs who decided to pursue the outfielder as a free agent, and Jackson quickly decided they were his first choice. Not long after Jackson cleared waivers, Schueler met with Jackson's agent, Richard Woods, in Tampa, Fla. Then the White Sox dispatched Boscardin to Birmingham, Ala., to study results of tests performed on Jackson's hip by Dr. James Andrews, the orthopedist who has been most optimistic about the chances for Jackson's return.
 Finally, on Tuesday afternoon, Reinsdorf said, he spent less than two hours on the telephone with Woods negotiating terms of the contract.
 "Right now, I feel like a caged animal," Jackson said at the news conference. "I can't wait for them to open the chutes and let me go and do what I've been doing my whole life, and that's running."

HEADLINE: Investment Abroad Easing

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
American companies plan to increase investments overseas by 6 percent this year, down from the 19 percent average increase posted during the previous three years, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department said a survey conducted in December showed that majority-owned foreign affiliates of United States companies planned $61.2 billion in capital spending this year, up from $56 billion in planned spending in 1990. 
 But the increase in planned foreign investments would be far less than the 21 percent that was planned in 1990 and actual spending increases of 13 percent in 1989 and 24 percent in 1988.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis, which prepared the report, said the 1991 projected slowdown in spending growth reflected reduced need following high levels of capital spending in preceding years and parent companies' constrained ability to finance overseas projects because of sluggish domestic economic conditions and weakening economies in some host countries.
The survey showed that manufacturers plan to increase spending by 4 percent, to $29.8 billion. The largest increases in investments were planned in Germany, up 18 percent, to $6.7 billion; Japan, up 17 percent, to $2.3 billion, and Britain, up 13 percent, to $13.4 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in U.S. Trading, With Rate Drop Expected

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined broadly in domestic trading yesterday, with traders expecting lower interest rates.
Gold prices were generally lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery slipped 80 cents an ounce to settle at $359.50. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $358.30 an ounce, off 90 cents. 
 The dollar was mixed overseas. In New York, the currency declined on negative news about the economy and the possibility that the unemployment report scheduled today would show a further decline.
 
Started a Selloff
 The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims jumped to the highest level in eight years last month. The report, which dampened hopes of a quick end to the recession, started a selloff in the dollar.
"The dollar was knocked down as people began reassessing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will ease credit," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the firm IDEA. Weak data might encourage the Fed to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, and such a move typically is negative for the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 137.45 Japanese yen, from 137.78 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it fell to 136.25 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 135.95 yen, down from 137.3 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.785, from $1.7805 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.7845 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.7735.
 
Other Dollar Rates
 Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.668 German marks, down from 1.675; 1.4033 Swiss francs, down from 1.4205; 5.6495 French francs, down from 5.6795; 1,241 Italian lire, down from 1,247, and 1.1555 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1557.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.667 German marks, up from 1.6645; 1.4025 Swiss francs, down from 1.4140; 5.645 French francs, down from 5.6472; 1.8780 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8765; 1,239.75 Italian lire, down from 1,240, and 1.1553 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1548.

HEADLINE: United and Pilots in Accord as Heathrow Service Begins

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 4

 BODY:
United Airlines and its pilots said today that they had reached a tentative agreement after more than three years of bargaining and several attempts by the pilots to buy the carrier.
United called the deal "a new, comprehensive labor contract." 
 The parties released no details of the proposed accord that was reached late Wednesday, but the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, which was seeking large increases in wages and benefits, said the agreement covered most important economic issues.
"A few significant issues" remain to be resolved, union officials said, but they added that the agreement would still be presented to United's approximately 7,700 pilots.
 
Contract Lapsed in April 1988
 The pilots have been working under a contract that lapsed on April 1, 1988. Technically, airline and railroad labor contracts do not expire but "become amendable." United's flight attendants and mechanics are also working under such contracts.
The stock price of United's parent, the UAL Corporation in Chicago, rose after the announcement. It finished up $2.125 a share today, to $149.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
United's protracted labor problems have been "a cloud hanging over the company," said Robert J. Joedicke, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. "It's one down and two to go, but it's the important one," he added. "You cannot operate an airline without pilots or machinists."
 
Economic Realities
 Weakness in the airline industry and a possibility of layoffs may have made the pilots more cooperative at the bargaining table, he noted. United may be seeking to settle its labor problems as it expands its trans-Atlantic business, Mr. Joedicke said.
The agreement came the same night that United took over routes into Heathrow Airport in London that it had acquired from Pan American World Airways Inc.
"We're always encouraged when the collective-bargaining process works," said David Stack, a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, whose United contract lapsed in November 1989. "We certainly feel we will be able to come to an agreement at some point."
But Ellon Jarvis, the chief negotiator for the Association of Flight Attendants, whose contract became amendable in November 1987, said, "I can't express any excitement or optimism."
The pilots suspended their talks with UAL through much of last year while trying to lead an employee buyout of United. Their last effort ended in October when they were unable to obtain financing for a $4.4 billion bid.

HEADLINE: Plan to Ease Bank Credit is Criticized

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The nation's senior auditor said today that the Bush Administration's proposals to ease credit conditions were misleading "accounting gimmicks."
In a letter to top banking regulators, Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, said the regulators should now be tightening accounting rules instead of trying to entice banks to provide more credit by relaxing the way troubled loans are valued, as the Administration has suggested. 
 "The solution to current issues facing depository institutions is not accounting gimmicks," said Mr. Bowsher, a constant critic of the Administration's banking policies and the Government's supervision of the industry. "The purpose of accounting is to provide even-handed, neutral and unbiased information for making business and economic decisions, and not to determine what those decisions should be."
 
Administration Disagrees
 The Administration took issue with Mr. Bowsher's assessment. "Nothing in this package is regulatory forbearance, as the G.A.O. has implied," said Desiree Tucker-Sorini, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department. "We don't feel this is a loosening of standards, but a common sense approach."
Last month, bank regulators from four agencies proposed the changes at the request of Administration officials, who have said the existing rules discourage banks and savings and loans from extending credit to financially sound customers.
But critics have said the measures will eventually haunt the industry and the Government because the changes dilute standards at a time when increasing numbers of large banks are failing or reporting lower earnings. They have compared the proposal to the decisions in the 1980's to relax standards for savings institutions and to refrain from closing weak institutions.
The most significant proposal is now in a comment period before the Securities and Exchange Commission and the agencies that regulate the banks and savings and loans. They are expected to decide late this month or next whether to permit the change, which would allow institutions to split their bad loans into performing and nonperforming parts rather than writing them off entirely.
The guidelines were issued jointly by the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
"At this time, the implied loosening up on valuation of real estate loans will only serve to temporarily gloss over existing problems," said Mr. Bowsher, who heads the General Accounting Office, which conducts audits and investigations for Congress. "We believe stronger, not weaker, guidelines need to be provided by the regulators."

After 2 Deaths, Now a School Grieves for Itself

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: MELVILLE, L.I.

 BODY:
News of a school closing affects different people in different ways. At Sunquam Elementary School, one second grader took all the Sunquam literature out of her mother's wastebasket and put it up in her bedroom. "If I hang it all up," she told her mother, "they won't close Sunquam."
Another second grader began acting up at home, throwing shoes and tantrums. When asked by a teacher to write an essay beginning "I am lucky because. . . .," he wrote, 50 times, "I am not lucky." 
 Sunquam is a meandering one-story school in a woodsy corner of Melville, a community bisected by central Long Island's busiest commercial corridor, where potato farms are slowly yielding to housing tracts. Melville has no downtown and no Main Street. But it has Sunquam, near the public library, the fire house and the Dunkin' Donuts. In a way this is Melville's village square.
"The community is so spread out," said Kathy Asta, a Sunquam parent, "that what we've tried to do in the school is bring the community together."
It has been a hard year, both for the school and for its extended family. In September, a third grader, Nicky DeNicola, died of leukemia. Last month, another tragedy struck, in the way these things so often seem to, with a well-worn routine gone horribly wrong.
As her class was leaving the gym on March 14, 9-year-old Deanna Moon was caught and crushed between a closing motorized partition and the gym wall as she tried to slip through. Parents ferrying in tomato sauce for the annual spaghetti dinner tried to calm the children; a police officer giving an anti-drug talk down the hall radioed for help, and the Fire Deparment arrived in moments.
 But it was too late. Deanna died from her injuries nine days later.
 People in the community offered support, praying with the Moon family and taking food to the gym teacher, who has been accused of mishandling the door controls and suspended. Then, three days after the accident, the school district, Half Hollow Hills, announced that because of proposed cuts in state aid, two schools would have to close. One is a junior high school. The other is Sunquam.
The district Superintendent, Kevin N. McGuire, said Sunquam was chosen because it is the oldest elementary school, because it needs the most repairs and because it is half empty. Closing it would save the district about $300,000 a year, he said.
"It would not be financially appropriate to keep this school open," Mr. McGuire said.
Parents and their children reacted as if they had been physically hurt. To them, Sunquam is more than just a building with a few classrooms; it is the glue that holds together the spread-out neighborhoods in the western half of the district. If Sunquam were closed, the children would have to go all the way to Dix Hills, several miles to the east. Dix Hills has six elementary schools clustered together.
Hundreds of people turned up at a school board meeting to shout at Mr. McGuire and the board. When Mr. McGuire showed charts and graphs to illustrate the district's dire financial state, the audience barely seemed to listen.
"People are already upset about Deanna, and now that they're going to close the school, they're much more upset," said Jordan Goldman, 10. "Why us?"
A group of parents is considering filing two lawsuits, one to block the closing of Sunquam and the other to have the western half secede from the district, bringing Melville's commercial strip and its huge tax base with it.
Though its circumstances are perhaps sadder, Half Hollow Hills is not the only district going through an upheaval over closings. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget would drastically cut school aid across the state, with about half the cuts coming from districts on Long Island.
The Island went through a round of school closings in the mid-1970's as much of the baby-boom generation graduated. In the last 20 years, five schools have closed in Half Hollow Hills, which once had 13,000 students and now has 7,400.
With an annual budget of $94 million and a reputation for getting students into Ivy League schools, Half Hollow Hills has found only $6 million of the $14 million it needs to cut.
People in other parts of the district say they are sorry it has to be this way. "I don't think anyone would have ever, ever thought we would be in this economic situation," said Judith Faber, president of the P.T.A. Association Council.
But to Phran Ginsberg, Sunquam's P.T.A. president, the issue goes far beyond money. "If they take the school away," she said, "they've completely destroyed our community."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Up on Economic Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An unexpected rise in initial unemployment claims, an increase analysts say virtually assures that March employment data expected to be released today will be weak, pushed up prices of Treasury securities yesterday.
The claims report, which is released each week by the Labor Department, showed that initial claims rose by 33,000 in the week that ended on March 23, to 543,000. It is the third straight week that initial claims have risen by more than 500,000. 
 Reports showing that sales of American-made cars remained sluggish during the last 10 days of March also helped to bolster prices.
"We are now five weeks past the end of the war, and to me there is no discernible bounce in economic activity," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
"I don't think the economy is turning up," said Edward J. Hyman Jr., the president of ISI Group Inc., a New York investment firm. "I think it will take another drop in rates to get there."
 
Focus Turns to Fed
 The weak economic reports revived speculation that the Federal Reserve Board might move to lower short-term interest rates again this month.
The reports, as well as the Fed speculation, helped to increase demand at an auction yesterday of new one-year Treasury bills.
The new securities were sold at an average discount rate of 5.88 percent, well down from the average 6.06 percent at the last one-year bill sale on March 7.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 19/32 late yesterday, up by five-eighths of a point, to yield 8.18 percent, down from 8.23 percent late on Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 3/8, up by 10/32, to yield 7.98 percent. And the 7 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at a price of 100 11/32 in late trading, up by 3/32, to yield 6.93 percent.
 
Short-Term Bills Down
 Rates on outstanding short-term Treasury bills fell slightly.
Late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.74 percent, down by 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a basis point, to a late-offered rate of 5.76 percent.
In other developments, a number of companies reacted to the decline in rates by pricing new debt securities.
Among the investment-grade issuers was the Dow Chemical Company, which offered $300 million in 9 percent bonds through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The securities, which mature on April 1, 2021, were priced at $99.46 to yield 9.052 percent, or 88.5 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds at pricing. They are noncallable for life.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues rose a quarter of a point to half a point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted securities were up by about a quarter-point.
 
Money Supply Higher
 Elsewhere, the Fed said yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week that ended on March 25. The third, the largest measure, M-3, fell by $4.7 billion.
M-2, the monetary aggregate most closely watched by the Fed, rose by $6.2 billion. The increase, the 12th weekly rise in a row for M-2, was in line with market expectations.
The report had no effect on prices in the credit markets.
Wayne Smith, an economist at Reid Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn., said M-2 growth this month should begin to slow.
"The current pace cannot be sustained," Mr. Smith said. "But the pickup we have seen, after virtually no growth in the fourth quarter of last year, has been a welcome development."
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: A Nonprofit Council Honors 7 Corporations as 'Models'

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The Council on Economic Priorities, a nonprofit group whose shopping and investment guidebooks have made it the best known of the many self-appointed watchdogs of corporate behavior, honored seven companies last night as "models for other corporations."
The awards were made at the organization's Fifth Annual Corporate Conscience Awards ceremony at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel with George B. Harvey, the chief executive of Pitney Bowes Inc. as host. 
 Herman Miller Inc., a furniture maker based in Zeeland, Mich., won in the environmental category for large companies for its early decision to stop using wood from rain forests, its installation of a co-generation energy plant that burns wastes and its founding of a subsidiary to recycle office furniture.
Smith & Hawken, a mail-order company in Mill Valley, Calif., that specializes in gardening equipment was the small-company winner. It was cited for wide-ranging recycling and energy-saving efforts, its use of nuts from rain forest trees in buttons and for signing the Valdez Principles, a 10-point environmental program.
The Kellogg Company, the Battle Creek, Mich., cereal producer, was honored for its treatment of employees, including a range of benefits supporting family life.

Giving the Banks Greater Powers

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
EXECUTIVES of the big money center banks are the strongest supporters of the Administration proposals for overhauling the banking system -- especially freeing the banks to expand all over the country and giving them broader powers, like the sale of securities and insurance.
"The fundamental problem in banking is colossal overcapacity," said Thomas C. Theobold, the chairman of the Continental Bank of Illinois. Writing in the current issue of the Journal of Applied Finance, he added: "We don't have 10,000 independent banks because the market needs or will support 10,000 banks. We have them because banks have been too tightly regulated and almost completely insulated from normal market forces." 
 And, at a conference on deposit insurance at Pace University in New York this week, Thomas G. Labreque, the chairman of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, spoke of the regulatory restriction on commercial banks in the face of growing competition from the "non-bank banks" -- commercial and industrial companies that provide some financial services.
"We've lost market share to captive finance firms like General Credit Corporation and General Motors Acceptance Corporation, and to non-bank financial holding companies like American Express, investment firms and global combinations like Sumitomo-Goldman and Credit Suisse-First Boston," Mr. Labreque said. "Take American Express, for example. It owns a bank which offers F.D.I.C.-insured deposits. It has a thriving credit card business. It also owns Shearson Lehman Hutton investment bank and IDS Insurance Company." But such companies, he added, were not "saddled with the regulations to which bank holding companies are subjected."
Critics of the Administration proposals worry about letting the commercial banks, especially those with weak capital positions, acquire new powers. In its report on deposit insurance, called "A Strategy for Reform," the General Accounting Office, which reports to Congress, stresses the need to strengthen supervision of the banks and raise their capital reserve ratios before they should be permitted to expand into other areas.
The G.A.O. wants "trip wires" that would force regulators to take action when the banks let their capital ratios fall too low, issue excess credit or take unacceptable interest-rate risks. G.A.O. also calls for on-site annual examinations and more bank examiners, and it demands stricter accounting rules and early notification by auditors to insure better compliance. It favors risk-based premiums, which would reward scrupulous banks and penalize the careless.
Steven M. Swaim, who headed the team that prepared the G.A.O. report, told the Pace conference that "in our judgment the powers of the banks should not be expanded until after the reforms are made." Even then, and only for well-capitalized bank holding companies on a case-by-case basis, should Congress phase out restrictions on interstate banking and consider phasing in powers for the banks to engage in securities and insurance businesses, the G.A.O. said.
Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, says such new powers should be carried out only by separate affiliates, with "firewalls" to prevent conflicts of interest. Lowell Bryan of McKinsey & Company favors the use of bank holding companies that would be divided into a core bank along traditional lines, with loans limited to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses, plus a finance company and a wholesale bank.
The bankers still fear that the regulators will regulate them unwisely and excessively compared with the non-bank banks. John S. Rippey, senior vice president and legislative director of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, said the necessary reform should have two main ingredients: "market-driven regulation" combined with "better and more sophisticated supervision." He praised the G.A.O. report for making a valuable start on both.
For the present, G.A.O., like the Administration, supports the "too big to fail" doctrine to prevent collapses of major banks that would jeopardize the whole financial system and take down any deposit insurance arrangements with it. But the G.A.O. differs with the Administration on its proposal that commercial and industrial companies be encouraged to own banks. Congress is afraid of undue concentration of power and is likely to junk the Administration's proposal.
Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady has not defended the proposal strongly and, in the view of some, is using it as "bargaining material" to get what he really wants -- nationwide banking.
The savings and loan disaster struck fear into the hearts of the Federal Reserve and the other regulators -- not to mention millions of depositors and taxpayers. Banking reform legislation and economic recovery are needed to restore health to the banking system. Yet it may take years to repair all the damage to the system created by a decade of excess debt creation and careless lending, of which the inflationary real estate boom was only the latest example. And a strengthened banking system is crucial to stronger national economic growth and performance in the global economy.

HEADLINE: An 18.2% Gain Is Seen For Money Managers

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
With the stock market finally snapping back after months of uncertainty because of events in the Persian Gulf, the nation's money managers saw the estimated value of their equity portfolios shoot up 18.2 percent in the first quarter, according to CDA Investment Technologies, a Rockville, Md., firm that tracks their performance.
The managers' performance beat both the 14.5 percent gain shown by the Standard & Poor 500 Stock Index and the 11.6 percent rise in the Dow Jones industrial average, when adjusted for dividends to be comparable to the CDA estimates. In contrast, the managers finished last year, a difficult time for stocks, worse off than the Dow, and only slightly better than the S.&P. They could have fared better by putting the money to work in Treasury bills.
 
Late Result Uncounted
 To estimate performance and come up with individual rankings, CDA reviewed periodic filings that 540 money managers made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CDA then computed the theoretical return that each money manager would have earned, assuming that each ended the quarter with the same basket of stocks that was held entering the quarter. 
 While CDA's estimates are a fair indicator of performance over time for many money managers, that method has some shortcomings for money managers who trade actively during the quarter.
For instance, Kenneth J. Gerbino & Company, a Beverly Hills, Calif., firm that topped the list of all money managers for the third quarter of last year, was put dead last this time with a drop of 1.6 percent. It was the only manager surveyed that reportedly lost money in the quarter.
Kenneth J. Gerbino, the firm's president, said, "On Dec. 31, we were out of the stock market, except for gold-mining stocks and cash, and in January we took $7 million to $8 million of cash and bought industrial stocks." The purchases were too late to be picked up by CDA, but Mr. Gerbino said he would have finished the quarter up about 6 percent had those purchases been counted.
Also, CDA does not adjust performance for gains or losses that result from short positions, that is the sale of borrowed stock in expectation of a price drop that would enable the short-seller to replace the borrowed stock at a lower cost. CDA also tends to exaggerate the performance, for better or worse, of money managers whose portfolios are concentrated in a handful of stocks.
This quarter, with many managers feeling the benefits of a rising market, money managers were not strenuously disputing their rankings.
Fred Astman, the portfolio manager for First Wilshire Securities Management in Los Angeles, which topped the list, said that CDA had exaggerated his true performance only slightly. "It was the best quarter we've ever had," he said.
CDA reported that First Wilshire had seen its $4 million portfolio, comprising 14 stocks, grow by 51.2 percent for the quarter. In fact, Mr. Astman, said, his portfolio has 30 stocks counting some small, obscure companies that CDA tends to overlook in its survey. "It would be closer to 40 percent when you figure all 30 issues," he said.
Besides having a heavy concentration in small, over-the-counter stocks, one of the big beneficiaries of the current market rally, Mr. Astman holds several health-care issues, one of the quarter's best industry performers. Hospital Staffing Inc., a supplier of labor to the nursing home industry, rose from about $4 to $6, and Hosposable, Inc., a supplier of hospital products, doubled from $4 to $8 during the quarter, he said.
 
Out-of-Favor Stock Cited
 He is also invested in some select savings and loans, including CalFed Inc., on the theory that their profit margins will widen as interest rates drop. That is because mortgage rates tend not to drop as much as the institutions' cost of funds.
Cypress Capital Management, which turned in the fifth-best performance, had an estimated gain of 39.9 percent. Robert Masterson, the firm's director of research, said an out-of-favor stock, Fruit of the Loom, contributed most to its strong performance. Fruit of the Loom closed yesterday at $13.875, down 12.5 cents, but well above its Dec. 31 price.
"It's recession-resistant; it's got minimal capital requirements going forward, and it's throwing off a ton of cash," said Mr. Masterson, who is unfazed by the well-publicized cash problems of the company's chairman, William F. Farley. He feels that certain covenants give investors ample protection from any of Mr. Farley's own debt problems.
Like some of the other names clustered at the top of the list -- Froley and the Revy Investment Company -- Cypress also has a well-known specialty in convertible securities, which paid off handsomely in the quarter. Like bonds, convertible securities pay some fixed rate to their holders, often 5 to 9 percent these days, but also mimic equities, in that holders have the right to turn them into stock if the stock surges.
"Two things have helped the convertible market," Mr. Masterson said. "One is the underlying boost in the equities, and the other is the yield on the converts," he said. "So you've had a double whammy."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 2.23 Points at Closing, to 2,924.50

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks lost ground yesterday, but smaller stocks picked up speed as Wall Street weighed the evidence pointing to a further drop in interest rates -- the kind of news that should give the market a shot in the arm.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which shot ahead 22 points at 2 P.M., slid 2.23 by the close, to 2,924.50. 
 Showing that the weakness was largely in the big, high-profile stocks, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks edged ahead 0.83, to a record 379.77.
The Nasdaq composite, the small-stock index, also reached a high, 497.57, up 2.52.
Traders are waiting for signs today whether employment figures will show that the economy is weak enough for the Fed to ease monetary policy.
Trading volume stood at a strong 198.1 million shares, down only slightly from Wednesday's strong 213.7 million shares.
Birinyi Associates said repeated waves of computer-driven program buying lifted the Dow by fewer than 3 points. Part of the reason for the small gain was a 13-minute-long selling flurry an hour before the close. It chopped 11 points off the blue-chip index.
Still, advances led declines 9 to 6. Only three stocks dropped to new lows but 180 rose to new highs, including American Stores, the food and drug chain, which rose 2 1/8, to 90 3/4.
Morgan Stanley, the investment firm, rose 3/4, to 87 3/4, for another new high.
"The market's hanging fire," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers, "until it sees what tomorrow brings."
Traders estimate that the rate of unemployment could now be as high as 6.7 percent, possibly enough for the Fed to trim rates.
One unknown, though, is a reported dispute at the Fed between Alan Greenspan, its chairman, and individual Federal Reserve presidents and its effect on what happens. The presidents are said to be unhappy that Mr. Greenspan has taken unto himself actions they regard as something they should have a voice in.
 
New Jobless Claims Rise
 Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist for Brown Brothers, Harriman, noted that bonds rallied -- carrying stocks ahead -- after weekly employment numbers released yesterday were weaker than expected. They showed that new jobless claims rose 33,000, to 543,000, or enough to give traders the feeling that the Fed might ease rates after today's numbers come out.
"It increased the likelihood that tomorrow's unemployment report will be weaker than originally expected, which could likely move the Fed to ease rates," he said.
The prospect of lower interest rates gave new pep to the financial stocks, particularly insurers and banks.
Among the banks, Citicorp climbed 1 1/4, to 15 7/8, with two million shares changing hands. First Wachovia of North Carolina rose 1 1/4, to 55. Bankers Trust tacked on 1 1/8, to 44 5/8. U.S. Bancorp of Oregon added 1, to 29 1/4.
In insurance, Chubb rose 1 5/8, to 75; Fund American 1 1/4, to 62 3/4; Ohio Casualty 1 3/4, to 43 3/4; St. Paul 1, to 74 1/4; A.I.G. 1 1/8, to 100 7/8; General Re 1 1/4, to 101 3/4, and Lincoln National 1 7/8, to 51 1/8.
High-technology stocks, a long-standing market leader, continued strong yesterday.
Borland International tacked on 2 1/4, to 60; Hewlett-Packard 1 1/2, to 52; Apple Computer 1 1/2, to 71 1/2, and Commodore International 1 3/8, to 20 3/4.
Compaq Computer, another technology leader, slumped 1 7/8, to 62 1/2, in heavy trading after it announced widely known plans to buy 13 percent of Silicon Graphics, a maker of workstations. Silicon Graphics fell 1 1/8, to 36 7/8, also in heavy trading.
Health care stocks were also strong. Value Health, a provider of managed-care programs marketed yesterday at $12, ended on Nasdaq at 15 7/8, with 3.2 million shares traded. Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 1 1/8, to 79; Humana 1 3/4, to 51 3/4; Medtronic 1 3/4, to 121 3/4; SmithKline 1 3/8, to 70 1/8; Warner-Lambert 1 3/8, to 77 3/4, and Allergan 1 1/4, to 25 1/2.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Stock Prices Up Slightly in Tokyo
 TOKYO, Friday, April 5 (Reuters) -- Japanese stock prices rose a bit today. The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 77.52 points, or almost three-tenths of 1 percent, to end the week at 26,767.33. For the week, the index was up 475.29 points, or 1.8 percent.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims at 8-Year High

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The number of Americans applying for unemployment insurance jumped in late March to 543,000, the highest level since January 1983, the Labor Department said yesterday. The report suggested that the economy was still mired in recession.
After the figures were released, interest rates on Treasury securities fell, as they often do on publication of statistics that indicate weakness in the economy. The data also suggested that the unemployment rate for March, to be announced by the Labor Department today, will show a rise from February's 6.5 percent level. 
 But the sharp increase in initial unemployment claims for the week ended March 23 -- that is, applications for unemployment pay filed by newly laid-off workers -- ran counter to other recent data indicating that the recession was past its lowest point and that a recovery was beginning. Rising home sales and a rebound in consumer confidence with the end of the Persian Gulf war were among the recent optimistic reports.
The conflicting data produced conflicting assessments. David Mullins, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, for example, said the latest unemployment insurance claims simply confirmed what the nation already knew -- "employment is weak and will continue to be weak, even after we start an upturn." He added, "The figures were not unexpected."
Mr. Mullins's remarks seemed to suggest that even if the Labor Department's employment report was very negative, the Federal Reserve would not respond by lowering short-term interest rates another notch to stimulate economic activity. The Fed lowered rates on March 8, the same day the Labor Department announced that the unemployment rate rose to 6.5 percent in February from 6.3 percent in January and 208,000 private-sector jobs disappeared.
The Labor Department itself was pessimistic about the initial claims level that it announced yesterday. "If you look back over the figures for initial claims in recent weeks, you don't discover a lot of upturn in the economy," said Thomas Plewes, an associate commissioner in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The 543,000 initial claims, seasonally adjusted, represented a rise of 33,000 from the 516,000 claims in the week ended March 16. Although the norm is for claims to fall in the spring when construction and other activities increase, Mr. Plewes said, initial claims have been moving gradually upward instead.
The last time initial claims were this high was in the week ended Jan. 8, 1983, when they reached 546,000. The nation was then beginning a recovery, and the number of initial claims was moving downward, not upward as it is today.
"What happens in the spring is that claims decline, but this spring initial claims are growing," Mr. Plewes said.
Initial claims for most of March averaged 200,000 a year more than they did in March 1990, the Labor Department said, and the total number of people receiving unemployment insurance rose by one million over a one-year period to 3,475,000 in mid-March.
Still, the relationship between unemployment insurance figures and total unemployment is not as close as it once was because state regulations governing unemployment insurance have tightened, making fewer unemployed people eligible for jobless pay.
During the 1974-75 recession, for example, 67 percent of the nation's total unemployed people were eligible for unemployment insurance, compared with 45 percent in the 1981-82 recession and roughly the same percentage today.

HEADLINE: Japanese Improve Share as U.S. Car Sales Decline

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 4

 BODY:
Against a backdrop of sluggish sales in March, Japanese auto makers improved their share of the American automotive market at the expense of the Big Three domestic auto makers.
In late March, car sales in the United States were off 7.8 percent, to 232,240, compared with 279,996 a year earlier. Light-truck sales were off 8 percent to 130,213, from 157,185 last year. There were 9 sales days in the latest period compared with 10 last year; percentage changes are based on the average daily rate. 
 Ten-day total vehicle sales totaled 362,453, a decline of 8 percent from 437,181 a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales from March 21 to March 31 was 6.3 million, compared with 7.2 million last year.
Although consumer confidence indicators have risen sharply since American troops in the Persian Gulf stopped fighting, "personal income levels are much more important to vehicle sales than consumer confidence," said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco. Personal income levels in January and February were weak.
Domestic auto makers and automotive analysts have been predicting that the Honda Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation will increase financial incentives to consumers to shrink growing inventories. Honda did increase incentives, as well as cut production, and Toyota was offering incentives on some models until Wednesday.
At the same time, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation slashed production, which means that a bigger proportion of sales went to foreign companies in March.
 
Japanese Import Protection
 Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, in a March 6 letter to President Bush asking for protection from Japanese imports, had predicted that discounting by Japanese auto makers would result in lost market share for United States companies.
In the American car market, sales of American-built and imported models dropped 10.6 percent in March to 735,994, from 855,260 a year ago; totals were based on 26 sales days this year, compared with 27 last year. The percentage decline is based on the daily average.
G.M. car sales were off 12.3 percent for the month, to 255,236; Ford car sales were off 14.8 percent for the month, to 149,126, and Chrysler car sales were off 18.3 percent, to 55,713. Hence, G.M.'s share of the total United States car market declined to 34.7 percent for the month from 35.4 percent last year; Ford dropped to 20.3 percent, from 21.2 percent last year, and Chrysler dropped to a 7.6 percent share, from 8.3 percent last year.
Analysts noted that fewer sales by the Big Three to rental and leasing fleets in March caused bigger declines compared with last year. Conversely, some large foreign auto makers, whose fleet sales are proportionately smaller, experienced less of a decline in sales and, consequently, were able to gain share of the car market.
Car sales for the Honda Motor Company were up 9 percent in March to 74,961. The Toyota Motor Corporation sales were off 5 percent, to 66,494. But the Nissan Motor Company car sales were off 24 percent, to 32,473.

HEADLINE: For F.D.I.C.'s Top Law Firm, Fees Reaching $600 an Hour

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The Government has agreed to pay lawyers at a prominent Manhattan firm as much as $600 an hour for their work in several cases involving some of the nation's largest failed savings and loan associations.
The fee arrangement with Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which has the unusual feature of promising a minimum fee plus a contingency, is potentially the most lucrative ever between the Government and a law firm. It is expected to be worth tens of millions of dollars over its life. 
 The fact that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation turned to one of America's most prestigious -- and most expensive -- Wall Street law firms to help it recoup some of the billions of dollars lost by failed financial institutions reflects the growing complexity of legal work surrounding the savings and loan bailout. It also signals the importance the Government places on the task. But some members of Congress criticized Cravath's fees today and accused regulators of wasting taxpayer money.
David Boies, a Cravath partner who is billing the Government as high as $600 an hour, said the fee agreement showed how Government litigation "is more and more resembling complex commercial litigation."
Mr. Boies compared the complexity of the assignment to two other highly celebrated Cravath victories, the I.B.M. antitrust case in which the Government ultimately dropped its charges and the Westmoreland libel suit, which his client, CBS, also won.
Terms of the agreement were negotiated last summer between Cravath's senior partners and Alfred J. T. Byrne, the F.D.I.C.'s general counsel, who came up with the idea of hiring a top-flight law firm to tackle the cases. He notified six firms and received bids from three, including Cravath.
Since the bailout began, the regulatory agency has become the nation's largest employer of lawyers. This represents a shift for many private law firms, which in this time of economic recession can no longer count on growing work from their stable of Wall Street and corporate clients. The agency has retained more than 1,000 law firms, including those that are doing work for the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is specifically charged with administering the savings bailout.
Last year bank regulators paid $615 million to law firms for services ranging from prosecuting savings and loan officials to collecting delinquent loans. Cravath's share of these fees was $1.6 million.
Cravath's work focuses on litigation against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., former senior executives at the firm including Michael R. Milken, the former financier whose "junk bonds" helped finance some of the largest takeovers in the 1980's, and other firms that peddled such bonds to savings institutions that later failed.
The Cravath fee arrangement came to light today when the Government released major parts of its contract between the firm and the F.D.I.C. The agreement was obtained through a legally enforceable request submitted by The New York Times in November under the Freedom of Information Act.
Already, Cravath lawyers have filed actions against Drexel, the Milkens and the Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif., seeking more than $20 billion. The suits contend that the defendants were culprits in the savings and loan debacle through their participation in a "fraudulent" junk bond market. Among the institutions that have been cited with Drexel are Centrust Savings of Miami, Gibraltar Savings also of Beverly Hills, and Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
Under a novel arrangement for the law firm and the Government that pegs Cravath's pay to performance, the firm's senior litigators -- Thomas D. Barr and Mr. Boies -- could bill the Government as much as $600 an hour, its other partners $425 and associates $270.
The firm's compensation is tied to its performance, but the arrangement is unlike the traditional all-or-nothing contingency fee, which typically is up to one-third of a judgment if the suit is successful and nothing if it fails. In this case, the lawyers are guaranteed a minimum discounted from their original rates. At a minimum, Cravath's senior litigators will bill $300 an hour, even if they fail to recoup a cent for taxpayers. If the firm manages to obtain more than $200 million for the Government in these cases, then its rate jumps to as high as $600 an hour.
But some authorities on compensation said that the deal was a fair one; a bargain for the Government and potentially lucrative arrangement for Cravath, whose senior lawyers typically are said to charge hourly rates of $375 to $400, excluding any premiums for satisfying clients.
"If things don't go well, the Government gets them at a discount," said Steven Brill, president and editor in chief of The American Lawyer, a monthly trade publication. "If they do well, then they get only a small percentage of the overall take."
The unusual agreement has drawn criticism from some lawmakers who say it will add to the already high cost of the bailout, as well as defendants in the cases filed by Cravath who see the lawyers as little more than bounty hunters.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, said the F.D.I.C.'s system of obtaining lawyers was "scandalous" because it was not subjected to the same kind of competitive bidding as other Government contractors.

"Different Mix at Law Schools"
At law schools approved by the American Bar Association.
 
For the third year in a row, students at dozens of law schools boycotted classes Thursday to protest what they say is the failure of their schools to hire enough minority and women faculty members.
 
At the University of California at Berkeley law school, where the protest was organized, about 80 percent of 900 law students boycotted classes and six professors canceled classes. Of the 55 faculty members, 5 are members of a minority group and 10 are women.
 
By contrast, students at the University of Texas at Austin held a rally after the school offered faculty appointments to four women, one of whom is Hispanic. If that professor accepts the offer, she will be the law school's first full-time Hispanic professor.

"My judgment is that the Cravath fee is excessive," said the Democrat in a telephone interview from his home in San Antonio. "It's the equivalent of war profiteering."
Mr. Byrne, the F.D.I.C.'s general counsel, conceded that Cravath had been retained only after "an informal competitive bidding process" and that the agency did not have an objective written policy.
He said it was "a reasonable bargain in favor of the Government" and would result in a "substantial net recovery to the benefit of taxpayers."American Continental+ (Lincoln)

HEADLINE: Gap Between Rich And Poor Widens

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To show that Republican policies of the 1980's did not favor the rich, Senator Pete Domenici draws an inaccurate conclusion from his statistics -- that the income of the poorest gained almost the same as the income of the richest, 11.8 percent versus 12.2 percent (news article, March 7). 
 The same percentage change for a wealthy person and for a poor person will lead to significant differences in absolute terms. Let us assume that someone earning $10,000 a year and someone earning $1 million a year (an absolute gap of $990,000) both gain a 10 percent increase; the poorer has gained $1,000, whereas the richer has gained $100,000; the absolute gap has widened from $990,000 to $1,089,000 -- a $99,000 increase.
The gap itself between rich and poor has increased by 10 percent. And a poorer person spends a much larger percentage of income on necessities than a richer person (Engel's Law) -- that is, the rich man's gain is for luxuries.

HEADLINE: Wake Up From Your 80's Slumber, America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"When 'Fairness' Isn't Fair" (Op-Ed, March 24) by Clayton Yeutter, President Bush's counselor for domestic policy, makes me realize how desperate Mr. Bush's staff is to have him re-elected, and why his domestic policy failures are commonplace.
The Reagan-Bush boom Mr. Yeutter speaks of was a false economy created and perpetuated by turning a blind eye to the savings and loan network that pumped unsecured billions into the economy to ignite construction spending, which the White House viewed as the cornerstone of our economy (similarly, the recent cuts in the prime interest rates by the Federal Reserve). The other main economic tool was astronomically escalated military spending, which provided thousands of temporary jobs at inefficiently run oligopolistic companies that could furnish ludicrous bids but receive a contract by default. 
 Unlike Mr. Yeutter and the rest of the Bush Administration, most Americans deal with reality, economically and socially, and know this is the Reagan-Bush legacy:
(1) In 1980 we had a $1.1 billion trade surplus; by 1990 we had a $95 billion trade deficit. (2) In 1990 alone President Bush ran a deficit greater than the deficits of Presidents Carter, Johnson, Kennedy and Truman combined. Before Ronald Reagan all 40 Presidents ran up a combined national debt of $994.3 billion. The Reagan-Bush Administrations alone added $2.63 trillion. In fiscal year 1991 the interest on the debt was $197 billion.
These frightening figures, along with a decline in the manufacturing base, an unwillingness to educate the American public for a global future, to address AIDS, crime, health care, homelessness, to provide desperately needed funds for research and development, and to draft an overall industrial policy (such as both Japan and Germany have), lead the politically aware to believe the White House has only one domestic policy.
A study by the Trilateral Commission several years ago concluded that television creates excess democracy. I must argue the opposite. Since the corporate takeover of television (for example, the General Electric Company's ownership of NBC), democracy is severely restricted by corporate and Government self-interest. My argument is this:
The Reagan-Bush Administrations have brilliantly used television to lull the American mind to sleep. They have pejoratively neglected the American public, while forging the "new world order," which is another bubble waiting to burst (like our economy). Meanwhile they have created distraction after distraction (remember how conveniently the flag-burning issue grabbed the headlines daily during the savings and loan investigations?) and sound bite after sound bite to mask their covert, illegal and clandestine activities.
Wake up from your decadelong slumber, America; democracy is dying. Don't you remember when homelessness wasn't even in your vocabulary?

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Old Litmus Tests Are Abandoned In the New York Democratic Primary

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
The more raucous it gets, the more cozily familiar a New York Democratic Presidential primary can feel. After a couple of weeks of in-your-face protests, spats over Israel, splashy appearances by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, press harpoons and candidate snits, this uncharacteristically important race approaches its Tuesday climax in what at first blush appears to be the standard indigenous style.
But in fact the primary that pits Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas against former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California differs starkly from off-the-shelf New York primaries of yore, in which candidates fell over each other to express their concern for cities, social welfare programs and any number of issues that the state's traditional liberal and labor-oriented primary voters once valued. Many of the traditional litmus tests for Democratic candidates in New York have been all but abandoned, suggesting much about the status, and the troubles, of the national Democratic Party and the growing compromises forced on its New York branch. 
 "The note of liberalism has been complemented by a grace note of desperation on the part of Democrats," said Norman Adler, one of the state's droller political operatives.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown have not forgotten to profess their admiration for New York or the need for attention to cities, the poor and racial equality. But these issues have assumed a far less central place in either candidate's platform than they did in those of past candidates. The classic appeals to New York Democrats, usually revolving around aid targeted to cities and their poor, have been bypassed by national themes involving the general economy, a show of revulsion over insider politics and new demographic realities.
A couple of months ago, when a host of Democratic contenders addressed the United States Conference of Mayors, many sobered city executives left the session believing that the Presidential contender with the best program for cities was the second-tier aspirant, Larry Agran, former Mayor of Irvine, Calif. (who was arrested last week in the Bronx when he tried to participate in a Brown-Clinton debate).
Yet endorsements from liberals, unions and Democratic leaders have flowed to Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton despite their contrary positions on what used to be core issues. They include Mr. Clinton's approval of the death penalty and his leadership of a right-to-work state and Mr. Brown's advocacy of a flat tax, a levy so offensive to New Yorkers that when one was proposed in the Reagan era, the conservative Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato staged a mock Boston Tea Party.
"This hand-wringing of the cities, and the 'Why don't you love us?' is not in tune with the political mood or the demography of the 1990's," said Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York in Albany. The beginning of the change came in June 1978, he said, when California voters passed Proposition 13, cutting local property taxes in half. The rebellion started prairie fires across the country, and soon President Jimmy Carter pulled back on his recently announced multi-billion dollar urban initiative.
President Reagan's victory in the air traffic controllers' strike in the early 1980's helped push right-to-work laws into the background as unions focused on the more direct threat of striker replacement, an issue many union leaders view as their litmus issue of this campaign.
Locally, former Reppresentative Edward I. Koch was fashioning a successful run for Mayor of New York by breaking with his liberal colleagues over such issues as the death penalty, low-income housing in middle-income neighborhoods and racial quotas. He opposed them all.
Many political analysts believe the major issues of urban America increasingly began to be identified as those of the poor and minority groups at a time when middle-class whites living outside the cities, and hurting in the current recession, were becoming a larger part of the electorate. In their recent book, "Chain Reaction" (W. W. Norton, 1991), Thomas Byrne Edsall and Mary D. Edsall note that between 1970 and 1986 the nation's heavily white suburbs grew to 44.9 percent of the population, up from 40.8 percent, while the cities' proportion slipped from 35.2 to 31.6 percent.
"In a critical development in Presidential elections," they wrote, "the 1992 contest will mark the first time that suburban (and exurban) voters cast an absolute majority of ballots. This reflects the continuation of a trend that will have profound implications for the strategies of both parties, for the role of race in national elections and for the formulation of policy."
Although both candidates have been paying increasing homage to New York and the cities, Mr. Clinton's 10-page position paper clearly charts a policy that does not emphasize a return to massive aid targeted to beleaguered urban areas. Rather, it argues that the best way to help Americans in cities is to help Americans in general.
 
Unusual Developments
 Mr. Brown has raced to endorse a $30 billion aid plan being pushed by the Conference of Mayors, but his main message is that the overhaul of a "governing elite" will send more money and help to cities and to average Americans generally.
Meanwhile, in New York, these unusual developments have emerged: Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger and other liberals have endorsed Mr. Clinton despite his capital punishment position, and an execution in his state this year.
Many union leaders, including Jay Mazur of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, endorsed Mr. Clinton despite his state's right-to-work law. The garment workers have suffered probably more than any other union over the loss of jobs to Southern right-to-work states.
Barry Feinstein, whose Teamsters local represents thousands of city workers, and other labor leaders endorsed Mr. Brown, despite his flat tax proposal. When President Reagan proposed such a tax, New York state leaders said it would mean huge tax increases and devastating layoffs.
Invariably, the endorsers say nice things about their candidates and then say they were forced to choose from a highly limited field.
Ironically, as the local liberal political agenda diminishes in importance, the New York primary itself has catapulted in political significance. The Clinton camp says a win would all but clinch the nomination. A win or something close to it for Mr. Brown would boost his standing dramatically and also add to the possibility that some in the party would beat the drums for an entirely new candidate.
But in a conservative era, New York Democrats have extracted few promises. Speaking of local party and labor leaders, William Kornblum, director of the Center for Social Research at the City University Graduate Center, remarked, "They're so dying for a Democratic President that a lot of the other stuff, traditional issues and so forth, forget it."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Arabs Find A World in Which They Count Less

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
As they try to define their new relationship with the United States and the rest of the triumphant West, the Arabs are reaching the conclusion that they do not matter as much as they thought they did.
Throughout the Arab world, a realization has dawned that after the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the defeat of Iraq they are no longer feared; in addition, many Arabs say they are shocked to find that they are not respected either. 
 Their fears do not appear to be a delusion. The Bush Administration has been persistent in getting Arabs and Israelis to sit down at peace talks, but it has not made public any comprehensive vision for a policy toward the Middle East or Arab world. In private, American diplomats say the Administration has returned to dealing with the Arab lands country by country, an approach that assumes no urgent reason to do otherwise.
The sense in the Arab world that it has been marginalized was only intensified by the treatment accorded Libya last week by the United States, Britain and France. Acting through the United Nations Security Council, the Western powers obtained economic sanctions designed to compel Libya to turn over to Western justice six Libyans accused in two airplane bombings that killed 441 people in 1988.
While there is hardly any admiration for the Libyans in the Arab world, the episode was seen as a demonstration of how little the West cared about the way the Arabs think, or how they see themselves. In the Arab view, the Western allies paid only lip service to pleas from friends like Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia for more time to find a more conciliatory way out of the impasse. The 21-member Arab League tried in vain to take charge of the issue but was ignored.
 
Benign Neglect?
 "From our perspective this new world order translates into a combination of benign neglect for Arabs, punctuated with selective punishment as we see with Iraq and Libya," Sherif al-Shobashi, chief European correspondent for the Egyptian daily newspaper Al Ahram, commented in a recent conversation. "It is a vengeful new order," he said, summing up a view that has predominated in the Arab press in the last few weeks.
Though they look at things from a different perspective, United States policy makers in fact reach some of the same conclusions as the Arabs.
When asked for a cold-blooded assessment of American policy in the Middle East, one United States diplomat spoke at length, on condition that he remain anonymous, in an interview. His comments echoed those of senior American envoys in the field.
"I don't think Washington sees an Arab landscape out there any more," the diplomat said. "We see Egyptians, we see Saudis, we see Libyans and Algerians. While there is still some appreciation of the concept of Arab solidarity, it no longer plays a role in our calculations."
There were, he said, hardly any "shared values" for the West and the Arabs, and the West's one big interest in the region, oil, is more secure than ever in the absence of Soviet competition and the relative feebleness of opposition to the West, even from Islamic fundamentalism.
The diplomat said things have changed irrevocably since the tense period less than two years ago when the United States showed great deference to Arab sensitivities during the gulf crisis. Since then the United States has concluded, among other things, that the so-called "Arab street" -- the power of public opinion -- is more myth than potent threat to American interests, the diplomat said. It has also concluded that the individual interests of Arab states like Saudi Arabia, which needs American protection, and Egypt, which needs American money, transcend by far any notion of Arab solidarity. And finally, he said, America has concluded that Islamic fundamentalism simply "does not carry the kind of punch the Soviet threat did."
This American official says there is no new doctrine governing Middle East policy, only what he described as "ad hoc and gradual" new rules that appear to be governed by lack of concern about old dangers rather than a quest for a new direction.
Ahmad Khalidi, a Palestinian scholar and political consultant based in London, says the rules these days "single out the Arabs for punishment and disciplinary actions while letting Israel free to defy all United Nations resolutions and the concept of a new world order." Nevertheless, he and other Arab intellectuals acknowledge that things are changing for Israel too. A senior Egyptian diplomat in Europe noted that American military inspectors were sent to Israel two weeks ago to investigate a charge (for which, last week, they found no evidence) that Israel gave advanced Patriot missile technology to China, "just as inspection teams have been plowing Iraq" to destroy that country's ability to make nuclear or biological weapons.
The comparative coolness of current American policy toward Israel is acknowledged by American officials, who say the new American language in Middle East diplomacy revolves essentially around the willingness of the region as a whole, including Israel, to yield to Washington's views. "The American-Israeli relationship is receding in the sense that there is a growing willingness to ask whether what Israel does falls within the area of our shared values," the American official who described the Administration's policy said. "But it would be foolish for Arab governments to conclude that there are more shared values between us and them as a result."
Among Arabs it is not evident that any credible resistance has yet emerged to what Mr. Khalidi calls the "American era." Libya, Iraq, Iran, leftist Palestinian factions and militant fundamentalists attract almost no support and, if anything, are under Arab pressure to keep quiet. Meanwhile, influential countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia maintain that the way to influence American policy is by remaining under the American umbrella.
 
Resentments
 It remains true, however, that large numbers of the estimated 300 million Arabs are deeply resentful of American policies in the Palestinian-Israeli dispute; even with relations between the United States and Israel having cooled, Arabs retain a belief that America applies a double standard when considering the rights of Israelis and the rights of Arabs. This is now also complicated by the growing perception that Arab views, policies and even cultural values are seen as worthless in Washington.
Gamil Matar, a widely respected leftist Egyptian writer, noted in an essay last week that the United States and the West are "not offering the Arabs a deal or even a prospect for a deal." The essence of the West's policies, Mr. Matar wrote, is a rejection, rooted in racial and cultural prejudice, of all fundamental Arab beliefs, including their legitimate grievances.
Last week there was, indeed, the first hint since the gulf crisis of a unified Arab protest, in the complaints over the treatment of Libya. This suggests that there may be some life left in what was thought to be the cadaver of pan-Arabism. But whether the outcry will evolve into a strong challenge to America's new vision remains to be seen.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Will More Guns for the Generals Aid or Threaten Democracy?

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
AT first everyone fell into a hush, and then they gawked as the black, sharp-angled F-117 Stealth fighter built in the United States streaked over a desert airstrip on the outskirts of Santiago like a strange Andean bird. It was the kickoff last month of Chile's 1992 International Air and Space Show, the pride of the Chilean military.
Though the name may connote something less bellicose, the air show is the largest display in Latin America of technology and hardware to kill and wage war. Grenades, cluster bombs, Uzi submachine guns, artillery, radar systems, helicopter gunships and a host of fighter jets were on view. Generals, colonels and officers of indistinguishable rank mingled with arms vendors in a 10-day event that they hope will lead to multimillion dollar deals. 
 But the display of highly advanced weapons -- technology these countries neither need nor can afford -- struck an odd chord. Less than a month before, an attempted military coup in Venezuela had reminded political leaders that democracy is not guaranteed. Many people in Latin America are asking how to structure armies in the future so that they remain loyal to civilian authority while continuing to provide for the national defense.
Should governments keep military spending at an absolute minimum and try to limit the army's ability to disturb the democratic process? Or should they provide enough spending to give their armed forces a continued sense of mission and pride, in hopes of keeping the soldiers in their barracks and away from the political arena?
Analysts here and in other countries note that discontent among military establishments is fueled by several sources. If the civilian government is corrupt or ineffective, the military is often considered an option for change. And if the level of military spending, particularly wages, is low, that often aggravates the problem.
In Venezuela, for example, real wages for the military have fallen 30 percent in five years; in Bolivia they are down almost 50 percent. Argentine officers earn less than half what they did in the early 1980's, and Brazil has cut military pay more than 25 percent. "Because of wage cuts, militaries have seen their social standing go from that of the middle class to the lower middle class," said Rosendo Fraga, one of Argentina's top military analysts.
Much of this is a direct reflection of economic conditions in Latin America. Many countries, like Argentina, are straining to get their economies back on a pay-as-you-go basis and have found military spending a convenient area to neglect. Indeed, spending on weapons systems, warships and other military hardware is now less than $1 billion a year in South America, experts here say, compared with an annual rate of $3 billion during the 1970's, the heyday of military governments.
"It's either put a lid on the military and let it erupt as it has done before, or expose them to the democratic process of defending what they are doing and provide them with the level of spending they can justify to the public," said Patrice Franko-Jones, an assistant professor of economics and international studies at Colby College in Waterville, Me.
Why, then, were the United States and other countries so eager to show up at the air show? Though military spending is small in Latin America compared with the Middle East and Southeast Asia, contractors are now pursuing all markets, in part because spending in the United States and NATO is being slashed. Some hope that as Latin America's economies recover, so will military spending.
 
Buyers and Sellers
 Chile is by far the most sought-after target, mainly because the civilian Government does not control arms spending. By law, 10 percent of Chile's copper revenues, or about $300 million a year, goes to the military. This has made Chile the biggest spender on the continent in percentage of gross domestic product. Argentina, for example, spends 1.8 percent of its national product on its military, down from 4 percent in the early 1980's. Brazil spends 5 percent. Chile spends 5 percent to 6 percent.
For military contractors, that means about $300 million to $350 million a year. Indeed, the big excitement here was over which company would get the contract for a new generation of fighter jets for the Chilean Air Force to replace its 30-year-old British-made Hunter aircraft; the contract could be worth more than $200 million.
Besides Chile, few countries are now building up their armed forces. Argentina does not have the money to buy enough spare parts for its existing equipment, leaving half of its fighter aircraft, 20 helicopters, 250 armored personnel carriers and its one aircraft carrier out of commission. Peru, though facing a fight against Shining Path insurgents, will spend little more than what it gets from the United States in military aid.
Colombia was said to be only in the market for light weapons, vehicles to fight guerrillas and drug traffickers. And Venezuela, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia are all considered modest buyers. On the other hand, Brazil is expected to spend about $200 million a year on new arms and Ecuador is said to be trying to buy $120 million worth of tanks, most likely from the French.
Who will emerge as the dominant supplier remains to be seen; certainly there is every prospect of a competition between the overstocked Western powers and the cash-strapped former allies of the Soviet Union. A lot of the weaponry from both sources, while conventional, is still more sophisticated than what Latin American countries now have.
"Everyone wants the most sophisticated weapon, whether they need it or not," Mr. Fraga said.

HEADLINE: BETTING ON BORIS;
With $24 Billion, Allies Hope to Buy Peaceful Transition

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In moments of national challenge, when the arguments President Bush must make to Congress and the public seem beyond his usual oratorical grasp, he often looks for help to the World War II era that formed his own world view.
Mr. Bush did that to gather the nation for war with Saddam Hussein. And last week, as he introduced a program of substantial aid for Russia, he seemed to borrow arguments that Harry Truman made for the Marshall Plan. 
 "The burden of our responsibility today is greater, even considering the size and resources of our expanded nation, than it was in the time of Jefferson and Monroe," President Truman said on April 5, 1947. Secretary of State George C. Marshall pleaded for "foresight and a willingness on the part of our people to face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our country."
On April 1, 1992, Mr. Bush said, "The stakes are as high for us now as any that we have faced in this century." He added, "Future generations of Americans will thank us for having had the foresight and the conviction to stand up for democracy and work for peace."
Like Truman's time, this is a moment when history unfolds with bewildering rapidity and forces choices that will reverberate for decades. Despite the political capital Mr. Bush obviously wanted from the announcement of the aid program in an election year, no one rolled their eyes when he spoke of a "defining moment in history."
Even the most reserved public figures talk of epochal changes nowadays, and the $24 billion aid program announced by the Group of Seven industrial nations seemed a fitting start. The program was a dramatic affirmation of President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic policies, the clearest break from the hesitation in American policy on Russia.
It is tempting to seek parallels between the proposals of aid to Europe in 1947 and assistance to Russia in 1992. But if the tattered Soviet Union is the modern equivalent of the battered post-war Continent, Mr. Bush's plan to aid Russia is clearly not the late 20th century version of the Marshall Plan.
Unlike the Marshall Plan, which provided material goods that the Europeans then sold for reconstruction funds, the current program is one of straight assistance: $6 billion to back the value of the ruble, $4.5 billion in loans, $2.5 billion in postponed loan payments.
To fill out the package, the United States toted up programs already under way among its allies and tossed them into the pot. The figures were extraordinarily jumbled -- the Japanese complained, in fact, that announcing anything about the program was premature -- but Mr. Bush insisted that they added up to $13 billion (or if they didn't, they would eventually). Most important, he said, no new taxpayer money would be required.
Mr. Bush hopes to use the money to prevent economic collapse in Russia from permitting the resurgence of dictatorship. The Marshall Plan, which began with $4 billion -- in today's terms, about $24 billion -- also aimed at preventing a rebirth of fascism. But its broader goal was to contain Soviet Communism.
Mr. Yeltsin may face a more daunting task to earn his aid and keep the peace than Europe's postwar leaders did. "The Marshall Plan very deliberately built on skills that were already there," said the historian Stephen E. Ambrose. "The Russians have some highly skilled people in weaponry of all types, but they don't know diddly about insurance or banking or risk capital."
So far, the aid plan that Mr. Bush has signed on to focuses only on Russia. Future aid is promised to the 11 other former Soviet republics, but some of these are already starting to question Mr. Bush's vision.
Truman and his aides were years ahead of public opinion and took extraordinary political heat. Mr. Bush, who took months to approve the aid program, does not have that problem. There is no talk of a Bush Doctrine, or even a Bush Plan. "Much less interested in emotion, much more interested in getting something positively done," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush was heavily criticized for clinging so long to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and some ask if the President, for whom personal relations are the key to foreign policy, is now relying too heavily on Mr. Yeltsin.
"In the past, we bet everything on Gorbachev and it was a mistake," said Jan Vanous, an expert on the former Communist economies. "Now we are betting everything on Russia."
With the International Monetary Fund conditioning loans in part on Russia's selling oil at market prices, Mr. Vanous said Moscow could get a windfall of billions and cripple Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltics, which have been buying Russian oil for decades at subsidized rates.
If the Marshall Plan pattern is the wrong precedent against which to measure the Bush program, Brent Scowcroft, the President's National Security Adviser, prefers another one: the Weimar Republic.
He has been arguing in the White House councils that the aftermath of World War I, when Britain and France stood astride a broken Germany, contains valuable lessons. While America gave Weimar Germany money, the brunt of postwar policy lay in the crippling war reparations that helped produce economic ruin and thus set the stage for Hitler's rise to power.
 
A Fear of Resentments
 Now, American officials fear the fringe nationalists in Russia who resent the victors in the cold war in a way that recalls the feelings of Germans toward their conquerors in 1918.
Mr. Bush does not push the Marshall Plan analogy too far, perhaps mindful that his domestic political problems may be even bigger than Truman's.
After World War II, the United States was in a relatively magnanimous victor's mood, and even then Marshall's State Department had to fight hard for the European aid program against right-wing Republicans led by Senator Robert Taft.
Truman succeeded in part because he gave Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, the Republican internationalist, plenty of notice and secured his support.
In 1992, Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican insurgent, is playing Taft to Mr. Bush's Truman, calling on Congress to stop the "Russian gravy train." Mr. Bush told the Democratic leadership about his aid plan 30 minutes before announcing it.
Still, on this subject also, Mr. Bush seemed to be hearing Truman's echoes, in his own fashion.
Asked what he would say to those who think $24 billion is too much, or not enough, Mr. Bush replied: "I will say that I think it is enough, and that it's what we ought to do right now and fight like heck for what we believe in here."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
If the G.N.P. Counted Housework, Would Women Count for More?

BYLINE: By MARIA ODUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Homemakers often feel their work is taken for granted, and advocates in the women's movement argue that the statistical invisibility of what used to be called women's work has policy implications that undermine a wide range of family issues. And so, there is an international movement to add housework to the gross national product as a way of elevating the work's status and, by extension, that of women.
The idea unsettles some economists and legislators, who say there is no sensible way to attach a price tag to unremunerated work, and that doing so would compromise the integrity of economic statistics by freighting them with political assumptions. 
 But proponents of the idea envision it as the magic wand that will force women's issues to the forefront of the American agenda.
"If you raise the status of women," said Representative Barbara-Rose Collins, Democrat of Michigan, "then there wouldn't be such a debate on subjects like the Family Leave Bill, which passed in Congress but the President vetoed. We would be more conscious of the family unit."
Carol A. M. Clark, an economist at Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C., agrees. "If we had been counting women's unwaged work 30 years ago when women began entering the work force," she said, "policy makers would have foreseen and prevented the current child-care and elder-care crises."
Opponents say the idea would only amount to empty symbolism and would create a convenient excuse for the tax collector to reach deeper into the family pocket.
"Once you establish it as a 'normal' part of income, then the Government can start to tax it," said Robert Rector, a policy analyst for family issues at the Heritage Foundation, "and I really think that's the bottom line here."
 
Pricing the Quality of Work

Furthermore, economists cannot easily grapple with the question of how to determine the value of particular jobs. The average cook, for example, earns $12,480 annually, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but what is the economic value of the homemaker who can prepare a coulibiac de saumon -- or the one who can't even boil eggs?
"There are questions of quality," said Larry Moran, a research economist with the Bureau of Economic Analysis. "I don't know about your quality of housework, but the quality of my housework would be in trouble."
In October, Ms. Collins introduced a bill to an Education and Labor subcommittee that would require the Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine a dollar value for unpaid services like housework, caring for children or the elderly, agricultural work, volunteer work and work in a family business so that the amount could be added to the G. N. P., the standard measure of all the goods and services produced in a country.
Because the monetary value would apply to the work itself, the legislation would count the efforts of men as well as women if they share or perform household or volunteer work. The legislation, endorsed by the Congressional Women's Caucus, has 31 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Representative Constance A. Morella of Maryland.
It's been seven years since the International Wages for Housework Campaign, founded 20 years ago, won its first major victory. At the United Nations Decade for Women World Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, a resolution was adopted calling on all nations to measure and include in their G. N. P.'s the unpaid contributions of women.
"It's important for policy concerns on women," said Dr. Joann Vanek, coordinator for programs on gender statistics in the United Nations statistical office. "The United Nations is particularly concerned about this in developing countries, because so much of what women do in those countries is not reflected in statistics."
 
The Economists' Ideas
 Several methods have been devised by economists to value housework.
One is market cost, which measures how much it would cost to take all the services performed inside the home into the market. For women in this country, this value would be about $16,000 per year in 1991 dollars, based on research by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in 1976. This value is comparable to the average salary of a kindergarten teacher, hotel clerk, receptionist or security guard, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Another is replacement cost, which measures how much it would cost to get someone to come in to perform all the household jobs. This conjures visions of a home crawling with babysitters, maids and cooks dashing in to perform a task and leaving soon afterward. This value turns out to be the same as the market cost.
And then there is the opportunity cost, which determines how much a person could earn in a job outside the home if he or she weren't doing housework full time. This figure, of course, could vary. If a woman had a law degree, for example, she could potentially earn in the six digits. However, based on a survey of women for a study by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in 1976, this figure was about $17,000 per year in 1991 dollars. This method has been used mostly by lawyers representing women in divorce proceedings.
Despite the United Nations' entreaty to have member nations include unpaid work in their G. N. P.'s -- which by some estimates is an additional $4 trillion worldwide -- countries have been sluggish, if not unresponsive, about embracing and carrying out the idea.
So far, no country has begun counting women's unpaid work in the G. N. P., but some countries, like France and Norway, have created "satellite" G. N. P. estimates that include it. Others, including Germany, Australia and Canada, have begun studies on the topic, said Dr. Vanek, the U.N. statistician.

HEADLINE: Wake Up From Your 80's Slumber, America;
Not Reagan's Heir

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Clayton Yeutter's "When 'Fairness' Isn't Fair," (Op-Ed, March 24) gets it half right. He exposes the bizarre methodology and statistical sleights-of-hand used by the Congressional Budget Office to denigrate the economy's tremendous performance during the Reagan expansion. Mr. Yeutter stretches credibility, however, by arguing that George Bush is continuing the conservative policies adopted by Ronald Reagan. 
 In constant 1987 dollars, domestic spending climbed by an average of $2.82 billion annually in the eight years Ronald Reagan was President. But under George Bush domestic spending has, on average, grown by an astounding $43.4 billion annually (even excluding deposit insurance and net interest). Even Jimmy Carter, with average annual domestic spending growth of $15.3 billion, seems conservative by comparison.
On taxes, Mr. Bush's reversal of Reaganomics hardly needs elaboration. Despite his campaign pledge, he capitulated to the largest single-year tax increase in our history. His regulatory record is equally dismal. Legal monstrosities like the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Clean Air Act have contributed to reregulation that chokes entrepreneurs with red tape and wipes out the limited deregulation gains of the 80's.
Big Government policies have not worked any better for Mr. Bush than they did for Jimmy Carter. Median family incomes are falling for the first time since the late 1970's-early 80's. Unemployment is climbing. Jobs are disappearing almost everywhere except the Federal Government payroll. National output is stagnant. Consumer confidence is low.
I sympathize with Mr. Yeutter for trying to make the best of a bad situation in the White House, having been given the near-impossible job of cleaning up the mess largely created by Richard Darman, the Budget Director. However, statistical manipulation is bad, no matter who controls the calculator.
Just as liberals should not try to make the 1980's look bad by holding President Reagan accountable for the economy's poor performance under President Carter, neither should Mr. Yeutter try to make President Bush's miserable record look good by giving him credit for the Reagan expansion.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
At Tax Deadline Without the Cash

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
For thousands of reputable middle-class Americans, April 15 represents a guilty secret. They fail to file income tax returns, and there are indications that with layoffs rising their numbers may grow this year.
Failing to file is a serious mistake but can be rectified. Even people who owe taxes but lack the money should file returns, experts say, and work out payment plans to avoid or minimize penalties. 
 Robert G. Nath, a tax lawyer and contributing editor to Bender's Federal Tax Service, said: "Some traumatic event triggers the nonfiling. It could be a divorce, a business disaster, a personal crisis such as drugs, alcohol or other illness, or a combination." Most nonfilers he has met are male, he added, and "have an astounding capacity for denial, taking refuge in self-deluding excuses": " 'The Government owes me money,' or 'I didn't have the money to pay,' or 'I'm getting my records together.' "
Often they miss one year, he said, promising themselves to make it up in the future, but "one year leads inexorably into another and then to a third." By then, fearful of the I.R.S. and a jail sentence, they are too overwhelmed to file.
Julian Block, a tax lawyer and author in Larchmont, N.Y., who answers tax questions on the Prodigy home computer service, said he had received many inquiries this season from people who have been laid off and received unemployment insurance with no withholding. They are now low on cash, but owe taxes. Should they just delay filing until they have the wherewithal, instead of calling attention to themselves by filing without paying?
"There's a perception that if it's not debtor's prison, it's the gulag," Mr. Block said. "They are not aware that they can work out payment arrangements."
Sol J. Upbin, partner in charge of the New York tax practice for Arthur Andersen & Company, notes that the I.R.S. is constantly improving its document-matching procedures, identifying income recipients by the W-2 forms that employers must file and the 1099 forms that financial institutions and other payers must file.
"If you have been a consistent filer in the past, it is very certain you'll be picked up for not filing," he said. "At a minimum," he advises, "file your return and eliminate one set of penalties."
Penalties for not filing can reach 25 percent of the tax owed, as can penalties for nonpayment of taxes, although when both are assessed one partly offsets the other. The penalties are in addition to taxes and interest due. Willful failure to file is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $25,000 and one year in prison, or both, plus the costs of prosecution, Mr. Nath noted, and willful failure to pay any tax is similarly punishable. In serious cases the Government can press felony charges of attempted evasion, which carries a maximum fine of $100,000, a five-year prison term, or both.
"Despite these penalties, when the I.R.S. catches a nonfiler, compliance is usually the most it seeks," said Mr. Nath, a shareholder in Odin, Feldman & Pittleman, a law firm in Fairfax, Va. But the agency's means of assuring compliance can be severe. He said the I.R.S. could prepare a return for the taxpayer "making all the assumptions against you," such as listing the taxpayer as single with no itemized deductions. The agency can then attach wages, bank accounts or other assets to get the tax, he said. It assessed taxes of $2.5 billion on 1.7 million nonfilers in 1988.
"When you array all your sources of credit, I would rank the I.R.S. last in terms of being responsive," Mr. Upbin said. If it is necessary to stretch out payments, he continued, "I would much rather work with a bank, regardless of the bank's rate." But it is necessary to negotiate frankly.
Taxpayers without alternative sources of credit should file Form 1127, applying for an extension of time to pay, by April 15, along with the return or a Form 4868 for a four-month extension.
"There are payment arrangements worked out all the time -- the best excuse in the world for not paying is being laid off," Mr. Nath said. "The I.R.S. as creditor wants as much as they can get. They will work with you to get it over time."
What's more, when there is reasonable cause, the service can waive the late filing and late payment penalties, he noted, and "in a surprising number of cases, there really does exist reasonable cause," like an illness, he said. People with a history of failing to file should consult a lawyer.
In one of Mr. Nath's cases the I.R.S. waived penalties for an alcoholic who had joined A.A. and quit drinking, in another for a young man who was supporting terminally ill parents and in another for a worker with a stressful, physically difficult job.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Industrial Metals Decline; Unemployment Rise Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Futures prices for silver and other industrial metals sank yesterday as a disheartening unemployment report shot down expectations for a rapid economic recovery.
Silver futures settled 10.7 cents to 12.7 cents lower on the New York Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in May at $3.95 a troy ounce and the spot price at $3.935 a troy ounce. 
 Among other industrial metals, April copper deliveries fell 1.1 cents,to $1.079 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange, April platinum deliveries fell $2.10, to $399.90 a troy ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and June palladium dropped $2.10, to $92.35 a troy ounce, on the New York Merc.
 
 Gold Moves Higher
 Gold, which is considered almost exclusively an investment metal, edged up on the Commodity Exchange, settling 30 cents to 40 cents higher, with April at $359.80 a troy ounce.
The drop in industrial metals marked a sharp turnaround for silver, which had risen more than 6 percent during the four trading sessions ending Wednesday on expectations that the recession was nearly over.
But hopes for a recovery were dimmed by the Government's monthly unemployment report, which showed the nation's jobless rate at 6.8 percent in March, up from 6.5 percent and the highest level in more than four years.
"That really kind of stalled any idea the economy is turning around," said James Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
Analysts said silver's rally had been largely speculative and did not include significant buying by industrial users.
 
Cotton Futures Rise

"In a case like that, something has to happen on the fundamental side to prop up the rally," said Randolph Donney, director of commodities research with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. But there was nothing, he added, "to recommend buying it."
Cotton futures rose sharply on the New York Cotton Exchange. Heavy rains have delayed cotton planting in California and may require growers to replant cotton in Arizona and coastal Texas.
"In California, they should have started planting by the end of March," said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York.
Cotton settled 0.60 cent to 1.85 cents higher, with May at 85.34 cents a pound.
Grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly higher after a choppy session on the Chicago Board of Trade, supporting theories among some traders that a seasonal upswing was under way.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Rose to 6.8% in March, Highest Since 1986

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Reflecting an increasingly grim labor market, the Government reported today that the nation's unemployment rate climbed three-tenths of a point in March, to 6.8 percent, the highest rate since late 1986.
With the ranks of the jobless swelling by another 414,000, there are 2.1 million more people looking for work now than there were last June. The total number of unemployed is nearly 8.6 million. 
 The figures released today, which provided the first broad view of the economy in March, were somewhat worse than expected and increased the pressure on the Federal Reserve for another round of interest-rate cuts to help pull the nation out of recession.
 
No Relief From the Negatives
 The report was almost unrelievedly negative. Besides fewer jobs and higher unemployment, it showed more discouraged and involuntarily part-time workers, longer spells without work and a shorter workweek.
Nonetheless, economists were divided as to whether expectations of a prompt economic recovery had been significantly set back. Stock prices sagged in reaction to the report, after the Federal Reserve did not act on the news to reduce interest rates, and the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,896.78, down 27.72 for the day. Prices of Treasury securities swung wildly and settled somewhat higher.
 
Data's Value as a Predictor
 Except for the length of the average workweek, which declined moderately last month, employment statistics are not considered predictors of business conditions. In fact, those that do not move in tandem with the economy tend to lag behind it, so that the unemployment rate, for example, may well continue to rise even after the economy has begun to expand again.
But while unemployment has often tended to keep rising after the economy starts to expand again -- people may resume looking for jobs before companies are confident enough in the recovery to hire them -- the jobless rate sometimes falls promptly. "We've had both kinds of experience," said Janet L. Norwood, Commissioner of Labor Statistics.
This time, in fact, prospects for a quick improvement in the jobless rate could be relatively good, because growth in the labor force has slowed substantially, largely for demographic reasons. Over the last year, for example, the labor force has expanded by 650,000, barely one-third of the average growth rate of 1.8 million during the last decade.
At the same time, however, this lack of labor force growth has helped keep the jobless rate from rising as high as it otherwise would have. The jobless rate now is four percentage points below the 10.8 percent peak reached during the 1981-82 recession, the worst since the 1930's.
 
 Confidence at White House
 At the White House, Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, stuck to his recovery forecast today even as it became increasingly likely that the economy's contraction in the first quarter of the year was greater than the 1.6 percent rate of contraction in the final quarter of 1990.
"We're going to see mixed signals for the next few months," Mr. Boskin said in an interview. But, he added, "The economy is likely to rebound by the middle of the year if the Fed makes sure to sustain growth in money and credit."
He cited currently favorable preconditions for recovery: relatively low oil prices, an expanding money supply, falling interest rates, lean inventories and resurgent consumer confidence.
But Geoffrey H. Moore, director of Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research, concluded that the recovery would probably be postponed.
 
 Outlook for the Recession
 "The recession is still with us -- and looks like it will be for several more months," he stated in publishing the index that the Columbia center designed to forecast the labor market. The index, which is derived from official figures, including the report issued on Thursday of another weekly jump in initial claims for state unemployment insurance, fell in March to a nine-year low.
Similarly, Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that he found "no sign of an economic rebound" in the figures released today but that the report was probably not weak enough to compel the divided Federal Reserve policy makers to take quick action to cut rates. Two important inflation reports are to be released next Thursday and Friday.
The number of payroll jobs -- probably the best single indication in the report of the economy's present condition -- slumped another 206,000 in March, with job losses concentrated in manufacturing, construction and retail and wholesale trade.
 
 Revised February Figures
 This was in the upper range of expectations, but the fall was magnified by the fact that the February decline was revised to 291,000, from the 184,000 that was initially reported. Payroll employment for January, however, was revised to show moderate improvement.
"The large back-to-back declines in February and March suggest that no abatement has yet occurred in the rate of job loss," Dr. Norwood said at a news conference.
Factories shed jobs at a somewhat slower rate than in February -- 92,000 compared with 149,000 -- but this was partly offset by a 12-minute decline in the length of the average factory workweek.
The survey by the department of payrolls also showed that its index of aggregate weekly hours of production workers fell to 121.3. The drop of eight-tenths of a point more than offset an advance of three-tenths of a point in Februrary.
The jobs data, published by the Labor Department, are based on surveys conducted during the calendar and payroll weeks that include the 12th of each month.
The department's survey of households, from which the official jobless rates are calculated, showed a 164,000 decline in civilian jobs, combined with a 250,000 increase in the labor force, raised the jobless level to a total of 8,572,000.
The three-tenths of a percentage point increase in the jobless rate was the second straight rise of this size. At 6.8 percent, the rise now stands 1.5 points above the rate at which employment peaked last May and June.
Jobless rates continued their upward march for all of the main population groups last month, with the rate for adult women rising three-tenths of a point, to 5.7 percent, and the rate for adult men rising two-tenths, to 6.5 percent.
The following developments were also noted in the report:
*The jobless rate for teen-agers jumped 1.6 points, to 18.7 percent, with the rate for black teen-agers rising a similar amount, to 38.6 percent.
*The average time out of work increased to 13 weeks last month, while the median duration rose to 6.6 weeks.
*The number of part-time workers who would have liked to have worked full time climbed by 100,000 in March after a 500,000-plus surge in February.
*The department's quarterly tabulation of discouraged workers -- those who say they want jobs but have given up looking for them because they think the search would be fruitless -- rose to 997,000, from 941,000, about half as large as the increase in the fourth quarter.
Geographically, all 11 biggest industrial states had increases in their unemployment rates last month. The biggest jumps were 1.1 percentage points in Texas, to 6.6 percent, and nine-tenths of a point in Michigan and Illinois, to 10.7 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively.
 
 In New York and New Jersey
 The rates for New York and New Jersey both climbed to 6.8 percent, up about half a point and of marginal statistical significance. But the unemployment rates in New York State, New York City and New Jersey all rose to what were apparently the highest levels since the mid-1980's; no separate rate was measured for New York City in 1988 and 1989.
In New York State, unemployment was up from 6.2 percent in February and 6.6 percent in January. The rate was 5 percent a year earlier.
In New Jersey, unemployment rose from 6.3 percent in February. A year ago the rate was 4.7 percent.
The rate in New York City rose to 8.1 percent in March from 7.3 percent in February. The city rate was 7.9 percent in September 1990 and 6.8 percent in March 1990.
The overall national jobless rate, including domestically based military personnel, was 6.8 percent last month, the same as the civilian rate but four-tenths higher than in February.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bond Prices Higher After Wild Swings

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury issues swung wildly yesterday before settling slightly higher.
At first, the fixed-income market responded enthusiastically to a Government report showing a sharp rise in unemployment last month. 
 Because negative economic news lessens inflationary pressures and tends to lower interest rates, the report that unemployment jumped three-tenths of a percentage point in March, to a four-year high of 6.8 percent, caused prices of existing Treasury bonds to rise as much as 18/32, or roughly $12.50 for each $1,000 of face value.
 
Gains Evaporate

But when the Federal Reserve did not respond to the job report by putting downward pressure on interest rates, as the market had expected, the gains began to evaporate.
Late in the session, for example, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing in February 2021, were being offered at 96 24/32, after ranging from an intraday high of 97 2/32 to a low of 96 14/32. At 96 24/32, the long bond's yield was 8.17 percent, down from 8.18 percent the day before. A week ago, its yield was 8.24 percent.
On Wednesday, the Treasury plans to auction $8.5 billion of new seven-year notes. The notes traded on a when-issued basis yesterday to yield 7.87 percent.
Among other representaive Treasury issues, the 7.75 percent notes of 2001 rose 2/32, to 98 15/32, to yield 7.97 percent; the 7.75's of 1996 rose 2/32, at 100 15/32, for a yield of 7.63 percent, and the 7 1/8's of 1993 rose 2/32, to 100 13/32, for a yield of 6.90 percent.
"There was a decided change of market sentiment after midday came and went and the Fed took no action," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Volume declined as many cashed in early profits and left for the weekend."
As for the relative strength of the Treasury bill market, Mr. Sullivan said it could be attributed to "the belief that sooner or later the Fed will have to ease." He added: "But the market acts more on fact than on hope. Furthermore, the supply of bills has shrunk because the Treasury has been reducing the size of its bill auctions for several weeks."
The discount rate on the 90-day bills fell six basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.70 percent; six-month bills dropped six basis points, to 5.72 percent, and the one-year bills declined three basis points, to 5.85 perent.
Eugene J. Sherman, senior vice president and chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, said the Fed's lack of action on interest rates meant the central bank was still preoccupied with inflation. "If so, the Fed would not favor increasing reserves in the banking system," he said.
 
Bid to Lower Expectations

"Actually, the Fed's main effort seems to be to lower inflation expectations," Mr. Sherman added. "It is the expectation or fear of inflation that causes investors to demand higher interest rates."
Despite the Fed's nonintervention, the Federal funds rate closed at 5.75 percent after trading at 6 percent most of the day. The funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, usually declines before a weekend.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 27.72 as Fed Fails to Act

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks sagged yesterday after the Federal Reserve failed to fulfill widespread Wall Street expectations that it would lower interest rates quickly to deal with the sluggish economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average -- the 30 blue chips that set the tone for the entire market -- dropped 27.72 points for the day, and 17.08 for the week, to 2,896.78. 
 Traders felt before the market opened yesterday that the combination of Thursday's report of a strong rise in new unemployment claims plus a sharp jump the March jobless rate would be enough evidence of economic weakness to prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. But when the Fed did not act after the jobless rate climbed to 6.8 percent for last month, its highest level in more than four years, stocks gave way.
 
 Drop in Turnover

Trading declined to 187.4 million shares, from 198.1 million on Thursday.
Declines led advances by 957 to 601, but in a sign that buying remained heavy in plenty of favorites, 127 stocks climbed to new highs.
One place to find them was among the stockbrokers: Salomon Inc. rose 7/8, to 30 1/8, after setting a new high of 30 3/8. Another was among the insurers: American International Group reached a high of 101 1/4 before dropping to 98 3/4, down 2 1/8.
The market's decline spread through the blue chips, the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the Nasdaq composite, the American Stock Exchange's market value index and the Russell 2,000.
Still, the smaller stocks, as represented in the Nasdaq, Amex and the Russell, held up better than the rest of the market. Several of the broader indexes, including the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq, reached all-time highs earlier this week.
"I think you'll need bullish news to pull the market out of a logjam," said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers. "You need a further ease in interest rates to overcome apprehension about forthcoming first-quarter earnings."
"Even though we've had token new highs in several market averages and the secondary stocks have done extremely well," he added, "you need the leadership of the blue chips to renew the upturn."
Bond dealers are understood to have told the Fed yesterday that any rate cut now would not really solve anything because investors would instantly sell long-term bonds and push interest rates back up again. They reminded the Fed that in early March, when the Fed lowered rates, investors did just that and rates rose again.
Dealers argued that the Fed probably would still lower rates soon. Some bond market participants speculated the Fed might act just before or after Thursday's producer price figures or Friday's consumer price report. The Fed gets the data maybe a day before they are released and, consequently, could move as early as Wednesday, if the numbers show that inflation is not rising.
After the release of the March unemployment data yesterday, some market analysts said that as bad as the jobless rate was, they felt that the fact that the workweek, or number of hours worked, also fell was more pertinent in underscoring the economy's weakness. The length of the average workweek is considered a predictor of business conditions.
 
CBS and McGraw-Hill Up
 CBS rose 3 3/4, to 169 1/2. Traders said that though it reported first-quarter earnings of $1.21 a share against $3.31 the year before, the results were better than expected.
McGraw-Hill, the publishing house, long thought to be a takeover target, rose 2 3/4, to 62 1/4, on speculation it might be pursued by Paramount Communications. Paramount, which fell 1 1/2, to 38 1/2, told analysts Thursday that it was looking for entertainment or publishing companies and might spend up to $5 billion for one.

HEADLINE: Brick Maker's Upturn Spurs Hope

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: READING, Pa., April 4

 BODY:
The mood has turned upbeat this week at the headquarters here of the Glen-Gery Corporation, the nation's third-largest brick maker, as the company posted its first two-million day for brick shipments since Nov. 21.
"It's boffo!" said Philip R. Mengel, the chief executive, as figures showed shipments in the first three days of April running at 96 percent of the comparable 1990 period. They were only at 74 percent during the final third of March and at 71 percent in early March. "We're quite encouraged," he said. 
 It is still too early to tell how much of the surge in the last week or so is normal seasonal pickup and how much represents recovery from the acute recession in the construction industry. A mid-December plunge sent Glen-Gery's business to levels 30 percent below those of a year earlier.
The slump, dating from mid-1990, had forced production curtailments or temporary closings at 11 of Glen-Gery's 13 brick plants since November, at various times idling 45 percent of the hourly paid factory work force of about 1,000, and prompting severe cost-cutting measures.
The new upturn in orders, if sustained, represents good news not only for Glen-Gery, which lost money last year, but also for the economy at large. Bricks and other basic construction materials have traditionally been a reliable indicator of general business trends, one of the first sectors to lapse into recession and one of the first to recover.
Glen-Gery's recent surge seems to confirm national reports late last month of a rebound in new-home sales and construction and in permits issued for future building. But the national economy apparently has not yet benefited from the rise. Applications for unemployment insurance jumped in late March.
No single company, of course, can fully reflect conditions in Reading and surrounding Berks County, which along with much of the rest of the country has succumbed to the nation's ninth post-World War II recession.
The unemployment rate in the county soared in January to 7.3 percent from 5.5 percent in December. The reasons for the large jump in January, the latest month for which figures are available, are unclear. But state and local jobless rates often have big swings because samples are smaller than national ones.
Although manufacturing now represents only 40 percent of national output, goods producers like Glen-Gery are still the big swing factor in business cycles, accounting for about 80 percent of changes in the gross national product, according to Lehrman, Bell, Mueller, Cannon Inc., an economic consulting firm in Virginia.
Brick is generally a high-bulk, low-value item, which limits shipping distances. But Glen-Gery executives have a rather large window through which to view the economic landscape. The company has thirteen plants -- seven in Pennsylvania, two in Ohio and one each in New Jersey, Virginia, Missouri and Iowa -- that send bricks throughout the Northeast, Midwest and near South.
Two of the plants are here in Berks County, one next to headquarters, the other the huge Shoemakersville plant 12 miles north of Reading. With an annual capacity of just over 90 million molded bricks a year, the Shoemakersville plant is one of the nation's largest. Six plants also make either concrete blocks or pipe.
About two-thirds of the company's bricks are used in residences, with the rest used in commercial, government and other buildings. Glen-Gery supplied the brick for the Worldwide Plaza skyscraper in Manhattan and the Trump Castle in Atlantic City. Last week it won the contract for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.
While brick makers have developed a staggering variety of colors and shapes to differentiate their wares, brick is relatively easy to make -- ground-up shale is mixed with water, put into molds, dried and finally baked in a kiln for about 24 hours. That means orders can be filled quickly, either from production or inventory that can be stored on-site as long as necessary. "Glen-Gery brick, a hundred to a million quick," was once the company slogan.
Whether or not the current business surge is sustained through the spring's "prime time," as Mr. Mengel calls it, the company's responses to many months of depressed conditions have had a considerable, lingering impact.
Poor results prompted a sweeping management reorganization that has chopped the corporate staff by 15 percent and contributed to the ouster of Mr. Mengel's predecessor. Mr. Mengel, who helped shape the company while a mergers and acquisitions consultant in New York, was installed by Glen-Gery's British parent, Ibstock Johnsen P.L.C., last July. Over all, Glen-Gery has shed 23 percent of its salaried staff in the last year, leaving just under 400.
 
A Temporary Shutdown
 In late November, with demand withering, the company temporarily closed its Reading plant, laying off 60 hourly employees for two months. The plant was reopened on Feb. 1.
The company also shut one of the two kilns at its cavernous Shoemakersville plant, halving production between mid-November and March and idling 42 workers.
Both kilns are now operating again. And even though they are operating at only 70 percent of capacity, the imposing on-site stockpile has crept above 31 million bricks, a four-month supply at sales rates that prevailed until recently.
Standing amid huge stacks of 505-brick cubes, Ronald L. Smeal, the plant's manager, talked of the hard times. "The whole plant operation has been tightened up," he said. "If you can get along without it, you just don't buy it."
Another economy has been to juggle personnel, making sure crews are big enough to handle the available work in regular shifts, and thereby avoiding overtime pay. This, in turn, has cramped the spending of a work force still trying to pay off debts that mounted during winter layoffs.
Plant closings and permanent layoffs have also helped Glen-Gery pare costs, at the expense of the economy. It closed a plant in Ottumwa, Iowa, and cut 115 management positions.
Other cost-cutting measures made since last summer include switching long-distance telephone carriers at an annual savings of about $70,000 and renegotiating contracts with rental-car companies and with companies that supply chemical additives, stretch wrap and steel strapping.
"I was amazed to find out how much you can save," Mr. Mengel said, adding that pay increases had virtually disappeared and that first-class air travel had been banned as the company's break-even rate dropped by about 10 percentage points, to 70 percent of capacity.
Yet Glen-Gery finds it can do little to spur demand for its products. And without that, it cannot return to profitability, since bricks accounted for about 75 percent of its 1990 revenue of about $150 million.
And even with the reductions it has made, its fixed costs remain high. "We have reduced the break-even level substantially,' Mr. Mengel said. "But there's a lot of operating leverage in this business, a lot of fixed costs in those kilns."
For the moment, executives are hoping further cuts will be unnecessary. But if the current pickup fades, Mr. Mengel said, another round of closings and production cuts may be inevitable, a prospect he calls painful to think about.
"We are gaining optimism and we are gaining market share," Mr. Mengel said. "Nevertheless, we are directly linked to construction. And we expect that for demographic and other reasons, recovery will be slow and gradual."

As the Republican Presidential candidate in 1988, George Bush used the pollution of Boston Harbor as one of his main campaign themes to defeat his Democratic rival, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.
But now a Federal district judge has placed the new Republican Governor, William F. Weld, on the political hot seat because of his tardiness in the harbor cleanup. The judge, A. David Mazzone, has barred virtually all new sewer hookups in the Boston metropolitan area until Mr. Weld decides on a site for a landfill as part of an effort to clean up the harbor. The ban, imposed earlier this week, covers new costruction and renovations in existing buildings. 
 And Judge Mazzone refused today to grant a request by the Governor that the ban be delayed for 120 days to allow him to seek an alternative to a landfill site previously selected by the Dukakis Administration and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.
Last fall, in his campaign for governor, Mr. Weld pledged not to put the landfill in Walpole, the area that state and Federal officials had selected after a three-year search. His promise was seen at the time as an effort to win votes in Walpole.
 
Governor Plans to Appeal
 "There is nothing within the Governor's plan or the Commonwealth's plan that is going to help the situation," said Judge Mazzone, who was appointed to the Federal bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1978.
A spokesman for Mr. Weld said the Governor would appeal the judge's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston. The spokesman said Mr. Weld had heard reports that some families were in a serious predicament after moving out of their apartments only to find they could not occupy new apartments because of the ban on sewer hookups.
The judge's order could have a serious effect on the economy of Massachusetts, which is already in a deep recession, and especially on Boston's metropolitan area, which has more than two million people.
Commenting on the decision not to delay the ban, John H. Spurr Jr., president of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Boston, said: "The real estate market is in tough enough shape as it is. Now what they are saying is that you cannot move."
 
43 Communities Are Affected
 Mr. Spurr estimated that 30 million square feet of space in industrial and commercial buildings in the 43 cities and towns affected by the ban cannot be occupied.
The 43 communities make up the area served by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, a state agency created by Mr. Dukakis after state and Federal courts ordered him to clean up Boston Harbor. The $6 billion cleanup project has been beset by disputes from the start.
Judge Mazzone's order forces Governor Weld to choose between keeping his campaign pledge to the 20,000 people who live in Walpole, 20 miles southwest of Boston, and the economic health of eastern Massachusetts.
"He's trapped himself," Richard P. Kotelly, deputy director of water management at the Boston office of the E.P.A., said of the new Governor. There is no reason for the state not to transfer the land to the water authority "other than a political one," Mr. Kotelly added. "It's just the same not-in-my-backyard syndrome."
He said the landfill site in Walpole, on an overgrown pasture wedged between two state prisons, would not be environmentally harmful. If the cleanup of Boston Harbor goes according to plan, only three or four truckloads of branches and other debris will be dumped in the landfill each day.
Walpole is concerned that large quantities of sludge will also be brought to the landfill. But the water authority is building a $70 million plant to process the sludge into fertilizer. The Walpole site is intended to be a backup if the new plant breaks down.

The Economy
 The unemployment rate climbed to 6.8 percent in March, the highest since late 1986. The rise of 0.3 percentage point swelled the ranks of the jobless by another 414,000, to 8.6 million, and there are 2.1 million more people looking for work now than there were in June. The figures were somewhat worse than expected and increased the pressure on the Federal Reserve to begin another round of interest-rate cuts to help pull the nation out of recession. [Page 1.] 
 Consumer credit declined at a 3.7 percent annual rate in February, the first time in four years that installment debt has decreased for three straight months. [28.]
The mood has turned upbeat at the headquarters of Glen-Gery, the nation's third-largest brick maker, and that could mean good news for the economy. Bricks and other construction materials have been a reliable indicator of general business trends. [27.]
A majority of F.C.C. members reached agreement on a proposal for relaxing the rules that bar television networks from the lucrative television rerun market. [27.]
A Federal judge awarded a $64 million default judgment against Iraq to an American company. [31.]
Five astronauts rocketed into orbit on the space shuttle Atlantis to deploy a $600 million astronomy satellite and practice techniques for assembling a large space station later in the decade. [9.]
 
 Companies
The Bank of Boston strengthened its hand in its bid for Bank of New England, announcing plans to issue $1 billion of securities if its bid is accepted. Half of the additional funds would be raised from institutional investors and half from current shareholders. [27.]
The Pentagon chose a team headed by Boeing and United Technologies' Sikorsky Aircraft division to build a new generation of combat helicopters. The contract could be worth $34 billion. [27.]
An association of state lotteries is teaming with Disney on a show that could, in effect, create a nationwide lottery. [27.]
CBS Inc. said its earnings declined 72.7 percent in the first quarter, to $23.3 million, or $1.21 a share. CBS also said it would cut about 400 staff positions by the end of the year, as expected. [27.]
Negotiations between NCR and A.T.& T. appear to be at an impasse, with neither side indicating a willingness to budge. [29.]
Campeau's U.S. retailing units may be combined into one company. The bankruptcy reorganization plan for Federated and Allied will feature a proposal to group the stores under the Federated Department Stores name and sell stock to the public. [29.]
Stephen Smith has been dismissed as executive editor of Newsweek. [25.] The Hudson Dispatch, a newspaper in Hudson County, N.J., for 117 years, was sold to a rival and ended publication. [24.]
 
 Markets
Stocks sagged after the Fed failed to fulfill Wall Street expectations that it would lower interest rates quickly to help the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average gave up 27.72 points for the day, and 17.08 for the week, to close at 2,896.78. [30.]
Prices of long-term Treasury issues swung wildly before settling slightly higher. Large gains began to evaporate when the Fed did not put downward pressure on interest rates. [30.]
Futures prices for silver and other industrial metals sank as hopes faded for a rapid economic recovery. [36.] The dollar rose sharply against European currencies in choppy trading. [36.]

HEADLINE: At Grand Central, a Stop and a Start

 BODY:
In the pursuit of efficiency, Amtrak, the nation's long-distance passenger rail system, will begin tomorrow to run all its long-distance trains headed north of Poughkeepsie through Pennsylvania Station instead of starting them at Grand Central Terminal. That may or may not make good economic sense; what it does mean is that after the Albany-bound Rip Van Winkle leaves Grand Central tonight, the magnificent Beaux Arts landmark that once called itself the gateway to a continent will become just another commuter station.
That's sad news, in the sense that it marks the end of a glorious era of long-distance passenger traffic originating and ending in Grand Central -- an era of big-name trains like the 20th Century Limited and the Lake Shore Limited, of red caps and movie stars. But that era has been disappearing for some time, and besides, there's offsetting good news: Grand Central itself is getting a facelift. Its waiting room is being refurbished, and now at night it is bathed in spectacular light furnished by 135 lamps mounted on four nearby buildings and positioned to enhance the terminal's celestial elegance. 
 That's small consolation, of course, for passengers arriving from the north and west who will now be decanted at Pennsylvania Station -- many years removed from the glory days of the Broadway Limited and the Spirit of St. Louis and badly needing a facelift of its own.
But it's wonderful news for the thousands of commuters who use Grand Central Terminal. The Grand Central Partnership, which raised $3 million in private contributions to light up the old building, is to be commended for making the end of an era in rail travel the beginning of what could be a bright new chapter for the station itself.

HEADLINE: The Council's Flawed Budget

 BODY:
To the surprise of its many critics, the New York City Council has proposed a plausible budget, a flawed but serious plan to close the enormous deficit. That may not sound like much, but for the city's legislature it represents a leap from a do-nothing past toward the responsible exercise of power under the new City Charter.
The Council would close most of the anticipated $3 billion deficit with service cuts and higher taxes, work force reductions, productivity savings and ways to streamline government. Some of the ideas for consolidating services and agencies make sense, like merging economic development offices. Other ideas are questionable, particularly reliance on $350 million in one-shot revenues from selling city-owned land and refinancing bonds. 
 Using one-time revenues is seldom a good idea because even after those revenues have been spent, the programs and services they paid for still require financing. The City Council says its proposed long-term service cuts would eliminate that need; it also proposes to contribute half of the one-time revenues to the general reserve fund.
Both proposals make the one-shot tactic more palatable, but it is still inadvisable. There is no guarantee that the long-term cuts will be made, and it is dubious whether the city could sell certain pieces of land for as much as the Council predicts.
The Council's plan, which Mayor David Dinkins derided yesterday, diverges most from his own on the matter of taxation. It wants to slash his proposed real estate tax increase from $755 million to $300 million. The Mayor's increase may be too high in a recession. To raise real estate taxes dramatically now could make the city less attractive to the middle class and to businesses. But the Council goes too far in protecting real estate, no doubt driven by parochial loyalties to constituents who are small-home owners.
Despite weaknesses, the Council plan is intelligent and substantive enough to serve as a useful alternative to the Mayor's proposal. That in itself is an accomplishment for a legislature just beginning to learn how to use its new responsibilities.

HEADLINE: Eastern Europe Is Out of Print

BYLINE: By Peter B. Kaufman; Peter B. Kaufman heads Pubwatch, a nonprofit organization that coordinates Western assistance to publishers in Eastern Europe.

 BODY:
More than a year after revolutions toppled Communism in Eastern and Central Europe, book publishing in the region remains in chains.
Forty years of totalitarian control combined with the rapidly changing economic landscape threaten the industry's future. The publishing houses that used to be supported by the state are collapsing, the heroic underground publishers are uncertain how to make money above ground, and state-owned booksellers, unable to become competitive, are closing in droves. 
 In the 1950's, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria tried to quash independent publishing. Book production equipment and paper mills were placed under state control. The state's monopoly on literary agencies, distribution networks, postal systems and import-export companies controlled the flow of printed information; nationalized finances made every publishing house dependent upon the state.
Today, old typesetting and printing equipment cannot meet new consumer demands. Worse, distribution networks and booksellers are paralyzed by millions of unsalable books. Laws regarding copyright, royalties and private profits have not yet been normalized.
Government subsidies for publishing houses in such fields as education, medicine and law have been slashed. In Czechoslovakia, the two state pedagogical publishing houses cannot afford to set type and print new textbooks in history and economics to replace the old ones that were filled with lies.
Moreover, economic and currency reforms meant to usher in market economies are bankrupting many publishers and booksellers. In Czechoslovakia, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and import duties have all risen. The price of paper and printing will soon go up by 100 to 200 percent, as will basic service costs.
Regional publishers admit that they do not know how to restructure their businesses. Last winter, at a conference in Prague on American publishing, more than 300 Czech and Slovak publishers, booksellers, literary agents and writers inundated the speakers with basic questions. "How are royalties paid?" "What should happen to books that are not sold?" "What is the importance of the Frankfurt Book Fair?"
The abolition of censorship, the goal of so many Western human rights activists, may mean little because of the barriers that face publishing in Eastern Europe.
But the West can change that. Western philanthropies, publishers, booksellers and government agencies should work together to help book trades in these countries weather the next two to three years. Western book publishers should supply free or discount copies to Eastern Europe's private distribution networks and retail stores. They should donate copyrights. They should share their business expertise. Publishing reference books, periodicals and catalogues are also needed.
Western companies should provide more publishing and computer equipment. In Romania, a publishing house that wants to release "The Federalist Papers" continues to produce its manuscripts on 40-year-old manual typewriters.
It is vital that Western support now be coordinated and focused on the entire publishing system -- from acquisition and production through distribution and bookselling -- in each country. In 1989, the pen won its main battle against the sword, but the war rages on.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Drops 3.7%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Consumer credit declined at a 3.7 percent annual rate in February, the first time in four years that installment debt has decreased for three straight months, the Government said today.
Analysts said the report was not surprising, considering the employment cuts and falling incomes accompanying the recession. 
 "It is consistent with retail sales being weak, with the decline in the employment numbers and personal incoes," said John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit dropped a seasonally adjusted $2.3 billion. It was the second consecutive month that installment debt decreased at a 3.7 percent rate. These decreases followed a six-tenths of 1 percent decline in December, the first drop since a two-tenths of 1 percent dip in February 1989.
The January plunge had been the steepest since a 5 percent decline in February 1987. And, the Fed said, the three-month drop was the first since installment debt fell from December 1986 through February 1987.
Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. It is tracked closely because it helps finance much consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
There have been signs since the end of the Persian Gulf war that consumer confidence and willingness to spend might be picking up. Retail sales rose for the first time since October and both new and existing home sales were up.
Still, Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, expects consumer credit to be weak for months to come.
"I don't see consumers going back to buying big-ticket items until the recovery is well established," he said.
All major categories of consumer credit declined in February except for credit card debt, or revolving credit, which increased $1.38 billion, the equivalent of 7.5 percent a year. Revolving credit grew at a 6.8 percent pace in January after a 8.3 percent drop the previous month.
Auto loans fell at a sharp 13.1 percent rate, or $3.10 billion, after a 7.3 percent decline in January. Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate fell a second straight month, down at a 1.9 percent rate, or $339 million. Still, the decline was not nearly as steep as the 14.7 percent plunge a month earlier.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on April 6 titled "Consumer Borrowing," about changes in outstanding consumer credit, misstated the annual rate of change for two months. It was down 3.5 percent in January and down 0.3 in February, according to the most recent revision. The error was disclosed last month when revised Government figures were issued, Because other discrepancies between Government figures and those in The Times's data bases were suspected, this correction was delayed so that the data could be reviewed. The latest version of the chart, with corrected data for the two affected months, appears today on page 36.

HEADLINE: John G. Tower, 65, Longtime Senator From Texas

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
In his 24 years in the United States Senate, John G. Tower, the first Republican Senator from Texas since Reconstruction, became one of the most influential and knowledgeable lawmakers on military and national security issues. But when he left Washington in 1989, he departed in virtual humiliation, as the Senate rejected a nominee of a new President for the first time.
Mr. Tower's repudiation by his former colleagues, who rejected him as President Bush's nominee for Secretary of Defense after public allegations of womanizing and heavy drinking, left a bitterness that could not be assuaged. In the normally clubby Senate, Mr. Tower was regarded by some colleagues as a gut fighter who did not suffer fools gladly, and some lawmakers indicated that they were only too pleased to rebuke him. 
 To have the institution that he had served turn on him was "deeply wounding," the 65-year-old Texan said in an interview last year. It was "something that stays with you and will stay with you for the rest of your life."
 
Four Terms in the Senate
 A dapper, diminutive figure who served four terms in the Senate, Mr. Tower was chairman of the Armed Services Committee when he retired in 1984. In the 1970's and early 80's he was a leading advocate of modernizing and expanding the military, and served as a central player in Congress in President Ronald Reagan's efforts to build up the nation's military arsenal.
But the job he craved for years, Secretary of Defense, was unattainable. And the rejection by his former colleagues shadowed the last two years of his life.
After his defeat he compared Capitol Hill unfavorably with Beirut. "They're pretty straightforward wha they do in Beirut," Mr. Tower said. "They hurl a grenade at someone or shoot a machine gun. Up here, it's a little more subtle, but just as ruthless, just as brutal. They kill you in a different way."
This year, in a book he wrote called "Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir" that was published by Little, Brown & Company, Mr. Tower raged against his former colleagues. Senator John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, is "not the brightest guy in Washington," Mr. Tower wrote, while Senator Jim Exon, a Democrat from Nebraska, "drinks, and drinks heavily." Senator Ernest F. Hollings is "the Senate bully, quick to attack with harsh and personal invective," Mr. Tower said of the South Carolina Democrat.
Mr. Tower reserved his most acid comments for Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who succeeded him as chairman of the Armed Services Committee and whose announcement against Mr. Tower's nomination was widely credited with sealing its defeat. Mr. Tower said the Senator suffered from blind ambition, timidity, inexperience and priggishness.
Only last month, shortly after the end of the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Tower sounded a melancholy note. He spoke of his long involvement with national security and foreign policy issues. "It's a little frustrating not to be involved," he told The Washington Post. "I think I could have made a very good job of it."
Mr. Tower's bitterness over his defeat was not assuaged by his access to Mr. Bush, with whom he occasionally lunched in private and who sought to ease the pain of defeat by naming him chairman of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, where he served until his death today in a commuter plane crash near Brunswick, Ga.
 
Son of a Minister
 John Goodwin Tower was born in Houston on Sept. 29, 1925, the son of a Methodist minister. He joined the Navy in World War II at the age of 17 and served for three years in the Pacific on a landing craft. After the war he graduated from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Tex., and earned a master's degree in political science from Southern Methodist University in Dallas before studying for a year at the London School of Economics.
Mr. Tower taught political science at Midwestern University in Wichita Falls, Tex., served as a Sunday school teacher and worked as an insurance salesman and a radio announcer.
He became a Republican in 1948 and ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1954. Texas Republicans chose him for a sacrificial run against Senator Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960, and he won 41 percent of the votes. The next year, when Mr. Johnson gave up his Senate seat to become Vice President under John F. Kennedy, Mr. Tower defeated William A. Blakeley, a conservative Democrat who had been appointed to replace Johnson.
 
An Unabashed Conservative
 Mr. Tower was an unabashed conservative from the moment he entered national politics. He was the first Senator to announce support for Barry Goldwater's 1964 Presidential campaign. In 1968, Mr. Tower helped to hold the Texas delegation for Richard M. Nixon, and he did not support Mr. Reagan until 1980. In 1988, Mr. Tower helped carry Texas for George Bush.
Mr. Tower sought the job of Secretary of Defense in 1981, but Mr. Reagan named Caspar W. Weinberger. After leaving the Senate in 1985, Mr. Tower served 14 months as the strategic arms negotiator in Geneva. Returning to Washington, he tried again for the Pentagon post in 1987 after Mr. Weinberger retired.
President Reagan turned to Mr. Tower at two critical junctures, as chairman of a panel that investigated the Iran-contra scandals and in lobbying Congress for ratification of a treaty with the Soviet Union banning medium-range nuclear weapons.
Mr. Tower also set up up his consulting company, John Tower & Associates, in Dallas. The company was consultant to some of the nation's largest weapons manufacturers, including LTV, Martin Marietta, Rockwell and Tetron. Mr. Tower did no lobbying, but had called a Congressional aide and former associate, James F. McGovern, who was Under Secretary of the Air Force, to check the progress of a contract for a client.
 
Bitter Divorce in 1987
 Twice divorced, Mr. Tower was the subject of rumors about womanizing, raised by his second wife, Lilla Burt Cummings, in a bitter divorce in 1987, and about excessive drinking. Mr. Tower denied his former wife's allegations. Associates said he was a moderate drinker but not a problem drinker. But Mr. Tower was close to his first wife, Lou Bullington, and dedicated his book to her.
It was these allegations that probably cost him the Pentagon post, but Mr. Tower also was criticized as being too close to the military industry.
In retrospect, he felt that he had been the victim of a virtual political mugging by his former colleagues. In an interview with The New York Times last year, Mr. Tower said: "Have I ever drunk to excess? Yes. Am I alcohol-dependent? No. Have I always been a good boy? Of course not. But I've never done anything disqualifying. That's the point."
He is survived by two daughters, Penny Tower Cook and Jeane Tower Cox, both of Dallas. A third daughter, Marian, was killed with him in the plane crash today.

BLOOD OF BROTHERS
Life and War in Nicaragua.
By Stephen Kinzer.
Illustrated. 450 pp. New York:
G. P. Putnam's Sons. $24.95. 
 If the decisive United States military action in the Middle East marks the end of America's "Vietnam syndrome," no conflict better illustrates that syndrome than the decade-long controversy over Nicaragua's Sandinista revolution. The American public readily believed that Saddam Hussein threatened United States interests, but during the 1980's it was deeply divided over the Reagan Administration's effort to force Nicaragua's Marxist Government from power through the limited means of funding the contras.
Even now that the Sandinistas are out of power, ousted in elections last year, no consensus exists on what danger they actually posed or what the United States should have done about them. No American reporter is better qualified than Stephen Kinzer, the author of "Blood Brothers," to conduct a post-mortem on United States policy and Sandinista rule. He opened The New York Times's bureau in Managua in 1983 after covering the 1979 Sandinista revolution for The Boston Globe, and stayed until 1989.
Mr. Kinzer, who now heads The Times's bureau in Bonn, believes that American policy makers wildly exaggerated the danger posed by the Sandinistas and failed to understand that they represented a genuine desire for change in Nicaragua. "Here," he writes, "was the living result of a foreign policy process in which factual assessments by professionals in the field had been systematically ignored, while lurid rumors were accepted as gospel."
The author's firsthand experience of the contra war convinced him that its main effect was to inflict suffering on civilians and harden Sandinista rule. For instance, in July 1987 he went to investigate what the contras claimed was a major military victory in the northern town of San Jose de Bocay. He found no evidence that the army command post or airstrip had even been damaged, and saw only the corpses of nine militiamen, three children and a pregnant woman. "Another trip in search of the 'new' contras had been in vain," he concludes.
Mr. Kinzer makes vividly clear that this was not a low-intensity war, as Pentagon strategists dubbed it. Six years of covering a conflict in which 30,000 Nicaraguans died took its toll on him: "Even my sleeping hours were filled with images of dead bodies and sobbing peasants." In the best tradition of reporters' books, "Blood of Brothers" takes us inside the lives of Nicaraguans humble and powerful, without the rhetoric that so often confounded efforts to understand what was really going on in that tiny country.
Mr. Kinzer was the first journalist to stumble on a contra camp in Honduras, and he defied the Sandinista authorities to travel to Nicaragua's remote Rio Coco region, where he witnessed the emotional homecoming of Miskito Indians displaced by the war. Most intriguing is his account of the power struggles among the top Sandinista comandantes, notably President Daniel Ortega Saavedra's outmaneuvering of his chief rival, the Interior Minister, Tomas Borge. Although the Sandinistas did send arms to their revolutionary brethren in neighboring El Salvador, Mr. Kinzer reports, they were far more occupied by internal conflict, which was fueled but not created by the United States.
"Blood of Brothers" is a graphic account of a country torn in half over the Sandinistas' efforts to build a new political and economic order. Early on, Mr. Kinzer saw that Sandinista policies were alienating ordinary Nicaraguans. "In 1983 most Nicaraguans had still not fallen to the depths of deprivation and despair which they would reach in later years, but many were already unhappy and restive. . . . When the Sandinistas decreed that foreign trade was to be a state monopoly, they effectively declared war on these small-scale entrepreneurs. . . . [And] by trying to transform [the existing system of food production] so completely and so suddenly, they were underestimating the deeply ingrained conservatism of Nicaraguan peasants."
While Mr. Kinzer in no way sees the Sandinistas' actions as justifying the United States intervention by proxy, he does recognize that they fed the contra resistance: "As years passed, the nature of the contra force changed. Most of its members were young Nicaraguan peasants and workers, driven by Sandinista policies to the point of rebellion."
Moreover, it was these policies that led to the Sandinistas' crushing electoral defeat in February 1990. Until the day after the elections, most Americans believed that Nicaraguans blamed the United States, not their own Government, for their misfortunes. "Blood of Brothers" raises the unanswerable question of whether the Sandinistas might have moderated their rule had the United States not sponsored a war against them. "No one will ever be able to say what the comandantes would have done with their historic opportunity in Nicaragua if they had not been confronted with civil war," the author writes.
Yet Mr. Kinzer's own critique of what he calls the regime's "colossal misjudgments" suggests that the Sandinistas' policies were not just tactical responses to outside aggression but reflections of their deep political convictions. His catalogue of their "errors" is long: their rejection of free-market economics, their militarism and arrogance, their antagonism toward the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy, the "suffocating social and political controls" they imposed, their embrace of an obsolete Communist political model and of "Fidel Castro's outlandish dream" of spreading revolution throughout the hemisphere.
Reflecting his penchant for steering clear of polemics, Mr. Kinzer balances that criticism by pointing out that the Sandinistas were willing to put their revolution to the test of the ballot box, and kept that bargain when to their great surprise they lost. Just as important, he notes, without the revolution the Somoza dictatorship would not have been dismantled.
"Blood of Brothers" might have ended with a more definitive judgment, but it is without doubt the best contemporary history of the Sandinista decade to appear. We finally have a welcome antidote to reams of literature about Nicaragua treating the Sandinistas and their country as nothing more than a cold war battleground.

HEADLINE: Alma Maters Court Their Daughters

BYLINE: BY ANNE MATTHEWS; Anne Matthews (Wisconsin '78) teaches nonfiction writing at Princeton University and writes frequently on higher education.

 BODY:
WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY, CAMPUS-GIVING PLEAS tumble into the mailboxes of America's college and university alumni, stirring memories and disturbing consciences. Each glossy full-color brochure, reunion invitation, nostalgia-inducing video and perky telefund call carries a single urgent subtext: send cash. But for many female college graduates, reactions to such appeals can be complex -- and getting more so.
Donna Guthrie (Rider College '68), a children's author in Colorado Springs, Colo., doesn't give to her alma mater. "As an older baby boomer, peace and justice issues concern me far more," she explains. With her husband, a physician turned businessman, and two children, Guthrie will spend much of April hauling lumber and mixing stucco at a Habitat for Humanity site in Key Largo, Fla. "I'm 44 now, and college seems lifetimes away. I'd rather underwrite my own community needs, from Laotian refugees to the soup kitchen." 
 Rachel Golden (Bryn Mawr '57; Ph.D. Columbia '70) has donated to both her schools, but, she says, "I can't get excited about the case for higher-education support because I'm so often made to feel like a number, or a faceless target, during fund drives." Golden is an Evanston, Ill., economist and consultant to nonprofit groups. "Ask me for my ideas, my advice, my participation, as well as for my money. Make me part of an ongoing community. If the schools had smarter marketing, my pocketbook would be wide open."
Regina Montoya (Wellesley '75; Harvard Law School '79), an attorney specializing in government relations at the Dallas firm of Godwin, Carlton & Maxwell, wants to build a history of women's giving to match the centuries of male philanthropy that have shaped institutions like the Harvard Law School. "I give to both my schools," she says. "Harvard taught me my profession. Wellesley helped me grow up. So I'm aiding another generation -- but on my terms. My Harvard contributions are earmarked for minority organizations or women's causes."
What, if anything, do women owe an alma mater? Gratitude and its cousins -- sentiment, duty, the yen to see one's name on a very large field house -- have paid many bills in American higher education. Since private giving now accounts for nearly a third of some college budgets, a school's survival, especially in economic hard times, can be decided by the unpredictable dance of donor and fund-raiser.
Many campus administrations have long assumed that "donor" primarily means "male donor." No more. As alumnae move into prominence and power in business and the professions (often becoming, in the process, major giving prospects), their views on college philanthropy are creating bewilderment, even alarm, on many campuses. The reasons why women give, or refuse to give, or give sporadically, or donate to one institution attended but not another are proving far more complex than previously believed -- and far different from the giving decisions of their male counterparts.
To meet operating budgets, four-year colleges and universities normally rely on six main sources: endowment earnings; Federal and state monies; corporate grants; foundation awards; private donations, and tuitions and fees (which often cover less than 40 percent of the educational price tag). With the baby boom over, campuses face soaring costs and severe cuts in Government money, even at rich institutions like Harvard or the University of Texas.
One response to the money crunch has been to undertake fund drives for staggering amounts. The size of such campaigns is often a function of prestige as well as an essential part of the annual budget. Stanford has nearly completed its drive for $1.1 billion. Columbia is campaigning for $1.15 billion; Cornell, $1.25 billion. Harvard and Yale have goals of $2.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
Commensurate with the huge amounts to be raised is a far more sophisticated approach to fund raising. Gone are the days of souvenir mugs and T-shirts; nowadays the focus is on detail, pressure and glitz. Stanford's centennial roadshow, for example, paired faculty panels on biomedical ethics with a singing-and-dancing extravaganza requiring a technical crew of 40 to set off lasers, fireworks and an on-stage bonfire. But the campus money push is colliding with other financial facts: an inconvenient recession, the rush to make college fund raising more professional and rising numbers of money-savvy alumnae.
Although American colleges and universities have extended higher education to nearly three generations of women since World War II, they have often failed to win women's fiscal allegiance. And until the last 10 years, fund-raising assumptions at many of the schools would have been familiar to Jane Austen: male graduates make money; female graduates marry into it. Development offices still schedule major solicitations of male graduates between the 25th and 50th class reunions, when earned income presumably crests. Fiscally speaking, college fund-raisers have traditionally found women most interesting after widowhood or inheritance gave them donatable goods -- stocks and bonds, office buildings, oil wells, Van Goghs.
Only recently have college fund-raisers realized that alumnae control record wealth, particularly asset wealth. Women are living longer, inheriting more and, despite persistent salary differentials and advancement cutoffs, the so-called glass ceiling, earning more, too.
Of the 3.3 million Americans whose gross assets of $500,000 or more qualified them as "top wealth holders" in 1986 (the most recent year for which the Internal Revenue Service has such figures), 41.2 percent (up substantially from only four years before) were women. On average, the women in the group were 6 percent wealthier than the men, held slightly more corporate stock and were considerably less in debt. The women had less insurance and personal property than the men but owned more cash, real estate and bonds.
And a recent Entrepreneur magazine survey found women starting small companies at three times the rate of men; by running their own franchises, women avoid the dual hurdles of the "glass ceiling" and the "mommy track" of much of corporate America.
In philanthropy, women are, at first glance, the generous gender: 78 percent of them contribute to causes like health research, youth care, religion, international or environmental issues, as opposed to 72 percent of men. But men give more in dollar terms: 3.1 percent of their income goes to charity; of women's income, only 1.8 percent. Male giving is up; women's, flat.
Women's donations to higher education are especially lackluster. For the past decade, more women than men have earned bachelor's degrees at the nation's 3,406 colleges and universities, but female donations bunch at the bottom and top ends of the giving scale. Women give more of the $10 to $250 donations ("nominal gifts," in the language of philanthropy), while more men occupy the crucial mid-range, supplying "major gifts" of five and six figures.
At the "ultimate gift" level, women reappear, but not in force. Of the roughly 140 private donations to higher education in 1990 exceeding $1 million, about 20 gifts came from individual women and about 60 came from individual men, the rest coming from couples or families. (Couples' gifts sometimes support women's institutions, as does Camille and Bill Cosby's $20 million donation to Spelman College, a black women's school in Atlanta.)
Fears about the scope and reliability of donations from women often lay behind objections to coeducation in the late 1960's and early 70's, especially at many formerly all-male Eastern schools, among them Colgate, Dartmouth, Bowdoin, Princeton and Amherst. " 'They won't give as well as men will,' was a frequent comment," recalls Sheila Tobias, who teaches gender and politics at the University of California at San Diego and who was an administrator at Wesleyan when coeducation was introduced. "To retain a constant number of male alumni, Dartmouth enlarged enrollments by up to 25 percent." However, a Dartmouth spokesman says increased enrollment had mostly to do with maintaining full quotas for male athletic teams.
But given the relentless scramble for alumni dollars, fund-raisers are being forced to come to grips with the question of why women will or will not give to their alma mater.
"It's true, women don't give like men," observes Willard F. Enteman, former president of Bowdoin and now a philosophy professor at Rhode Island College. "Asking the right questions, in the right way, has a lot to do with it. There are two ways to raise funds -- irrational and rational. With male alums, you often go out drinking till all hours to extract some whopping donation. I found that morally dubious -- and hard on my liver. Women don't respond to rah-rah. They want facts. They want accountability. I found this attitude refreshing, but many administrators resent it."
Men who want their children to attend their old schools often donate generously to their alma maters, hoping for preference. "Women don't use money that way," Sheila Tobias says, "maybe they don't see the power-money equation clearly yet. Or don't give enough. Five-hundred-dollar donations won't help a child get in, but a $700,000 endowed chair might. Once women earn that kind of money, we will see female philanthropy redefined -- and notions of female immortality, too."
At many coed schools, women are now approaching women for donations, contravening the venerable fund-raising principle of assigning male officers to potential male and female donors. Alumnae approached by fund-raisers of their own gender often voice approval, even relief, and use words like "condescending," "perfunctory," "over formal" and "too knee-jerk rah-rah" to describe previous solicitations by male campus representatives.
The next quarter-century will see the first wave of women to benefit from 60's and 70's coeducation move through the prime giving years. After that may come an even larger group of female graduates. Last fall, for the third straight year, over a million more women than men were enrolled in American colleges, consolidating a trend begun in 1979. Development offices may not learn the implications of this shift until well into the next century, but such new demographic realities are making the campus financial planner's life increasingly uncomfortable.
 BARBARA PAUL Robinson (Bryn Mawr '62; Yale Law School '65) is the first woman partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, a prominent Manhattan law firm. She is also the firm's specialist on charitable organizations and private philanthropy.
"This is a bad time to ask anyone, male or female, for donations," she says. "Everyone's retrenching, from the $10,000 givers who are philanthropy's mainstay to the heavy hitters, constantly pursued by this country's million or so nonprofit organizations. You know who sustains college fund raising today? Alumni volunteers. Many are exhausted, overscheduled professional women, who know that without alumni-funded scholarships, colleges could easily revert to preserves for the rich. But to sit in someone's living room these days and say 'Give!' takes much determination, and extremely thorough briefing."
At large colleges and universities, research staffs now create detailed financial and biographical files on select graduates, often with elaborate codings and rankings of giving potential. The data range from rumors about their financial assets to income estimates compiled from car registrations and zip-code analyses. Public-record information, such as divorce proceedings or property assessments, may appear in such files, though some deem the use of it morally objectionable.
Alumni have begun to return the favor, scrutinizing their old institutions with increasing care. From racial tensions to dormitory crimeto quarrels over course content, campus controversy makes donations from graduates far from automatic. Old-fashioned priorities can anger many alumnae, especially when schools tout a winning football team as reason enough to send a check. "I'm not putting my money in some sports sinkhole," says one Yale Ph.D.
Millions of American women, of course, do support their schools. The most loyal are alumnae of established Catholic women's colleges, like the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minn. Next come graduates of nonreligious single-sex colleges, and last are women who attended coed schools.
Donors usually cite strong social or intellectual satisfaction with their school years, a sense of obligation to history or the desire to honor a family member with a named gift, from a sculpture to an endowed teaching chair. Where male patrons often want to support showier, big-ticket causes -- athletics, especially -- women are more willing to make anonymous gifts, often for practical uses, like new wiring or the refitting of buildings to ease access for the handicapped.
 FOR EVERY ALUMNA who gives, many don't. It is the naysayer that interests Martha Taylor (Wisconsin '71; West Virginia '75). Taylor is the sole female vice president at the University of Wisconsin Foundation and a specialist in upper-end alumni giving. In the mid-1980's, in the course of doing a four-year study on alumni giving, Taylor began to suspect that the University of Wisconsin -- which ranked (and still does) first in private support among American public universities -- could raise even more money by learning why female graduates rejected standard pleas.
In her office, Taylor paces before a plate-glass wall framing a 20-mile view of university buildings, the waters of Lake Mendota and the rolling countryside near Madison, and ticks off categories of refusal.
There is the Last to Die Mentality, whereby women donate only to a husband'scollege, in his name, for projects he would have approved, firmly declining to support her own college. Taylor sighs: "These are frustrating; they truly believe being humble is ladylike. 'No male ego here,' they tell me. Yesterday I went to see a widow, saying: 'Why not scholarships for the music school? You were a music major.' But she was horrified. 'Oh, no, I couldn't. Peter would have wanted everything to go to the business school. I didn't earn the money, so I can't have a say.' This despite the fact that now it was all her property."
Many alumnae, Taylor has discovered, have not made financial decisions beyond household budgets (which she dubs the Supermarket Mentality) or local volunteerism (the Bake Sale Mentality). These women see the future as alien or threatening, and so declare themselves unable to give. Characteristic evasions are "I've got to ask my husband and my son" or "I don't think my accountant will let me."
Among older women graduates who have worked, "Look out for yourself first" is a fiercely repeated motto, especially after years of earning 67 cents to the dollar. "Money insecurity, real or perceived, prevents them from giving," Taylor says. "Women still worry about money like first-generation immigrants or Depression-era Americans, obsessed with keeping bread on the table and the kids in shoes. There's little energy left for the noblesse oblige impulse or the nostalgic sentiment behind so many big male gifts."
Taylor notes that the Bastion of Males argument is motivating a growing number of women (many with self-made fortunes) who at midlife think twice about underwriting schools that patronized or discouraged them when they were young. Many regard donations as leverage for change and influence, whether gaining a trustee seat or a female name for a new physics lab.
"Money gives such women immunity to say things universities don't want to hear," Taylor explains. " 'Why are women not being groomed for power?' is a very tough question now, right up there with 'Why are there no women on your board?' " Statistics confirm those resentments: males now account for 89 percent of presidents and chancellors, 88 percent of full professors, 80 percent of trustees, between 75 and 90 percent of chief academic officers and 80 percent of upper-level fund-raisers.
These days, when schools bid for important gifts, a frequent reaction from alumni wives is what Taylor calls "But you'd better ask me, too" -- an attitude strongest among women who share a two-career marriage. Few in this group find it amusing to be ignored as prospects for major donations while their husbands are separately wooed.
For the Nurturing Mentality, other causes -- from the performing arts to children's services -- seem more compelling than supporting an alma mater. Nurturers are decisive, even stubborn, about their priorities. Frequent responses are: "The university is rich"; "It's taxpayer-supported"; "It doesn't need me."
The New Career Mentality, which Taylor finds prevalent among ambitious women under 40, has this argument: "It's my money and I deserve to keep it." Women in this category share the suspicion that college philanthropy remains at heart a boys-only game. And donations often rub hard on 70's and 80's graduates, who are grimly paying off $100,000 student loans. ("Give my school more money? Don't make me laugh" is a frequent retort.)
Taylor sees women's giving as both a complex marketing problem and a neglected research issue. "Coed schools have never made a concerted effort to encourage female donors; the system just doesn't work that way," she says. "I was surprised to find how very differently women and men think about college giving. Men often give to preserve. Women use their money for change, hoping to make things easier on those coming up, and often give to their children's colleges rather than their own for just that reason. Mostly, women crave the balanced life -- and are exhausting themselves in the process."
 CAUGHT BETWEEN Rising anger and rising costs, higher education's fund-raisers have begun to consider new ways to appeal to alienated alumnae. But fund-raisers hoping to study patterns in female (or minority) giving, then tailor appeals to female (or black or Asian) graduates, often fear accusations of discrimination. If a female or minority trustee requests such information or action, the way is clear. Otherwise, many development officers hesitate even to propose fund-raising ideas based on gender, especially on campuses already torn by harsh debates over what, how and why they teach, and for whom. Some schools are investigating new avenues for support -- through women's honor societies, as at Dartmouth, or female professional groups, as at Cornell. But methods of encouraging women's donations often remain tentative and experimental.
At the University of Wisconsin, major female donors and trustees, intrigued by Martha Taylor's findings, have established a women's council to seek gifts of $10,000 and up from women. Some projects featured by the council are of special interest to women, from a cooperative children's book center to the recruitment of female engineering students. And council members and other alumnae have begun serious networking, often giving old social formulas a vigorous philanthropic spin.
Trying to interest women donors means invoking powerful sexual politics, since anger, duty, nostalgia and realism work in unpredictable ways. Some female fund-raisers dub the impulse by women to give for women "the Carol Gilligan factor," in wry homage to the Harvard psychologist's notion that women and men often judge the world in separate styles. Others see women's giving as a way to channel growing fiscal power toward traditionally "female fields," the liberal arts, education and social studies. A few hope to change male-dominated disciplines, pointing to donors like Clare Boothe Luce, who had not shown a particular interest in science but who left $70 million in her will to establish professorships and grants for women in science and engineering.
There are those who call such single-sex approaches self-ghettoization. "I approach donors as donors, not as male or female," says Donna E. Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison and former president of Hunter College. "A woman owes an alma mater no more and no less than a man: to make sure that others have the chance to attend in their turn."
 WOMEN GIVING EVEN modest gifts often attend financial seminars or planning courses, such as the Ms. Foundation's annual conference on women managing wealth. Impatient with requests for donations that imply "Just trust us," many female donors argue for fuller disclosure of campus needs. Joan Hopf (Smith '43), who used to be an active alumna, observes: "Our schools should tell us precisely what's needed and how they're spending the cash -- this much to buy books for needy foreign students, that sum to endow a dorm. Then we can decide what to do. We're all reasonably bright."
This shopping-list approach is beginning to dominate college philanthropy. Although administrators much prefer checks for general funds, donors, male and female, increasingly prefer targeted-giving appeals or restricted-use bequests.
How a woman supports her school frequently reflects her vision of American higher education. Some see it as, at heart, a business. ("I attended a financial corporation with educational subsidiaries" is a joke often heard when female graduates talk about the large universities they attended.) Others view the campus as a microcosm of reality, inequities and all; still others, as a fragile model of what the world could be.
"Are women satisfied with their educations?" asks Janet Holmgren McKay, Princeton's vice provost. "Academically, yes; socially, not very." At 42, she is one of the highest female administrators at Princeton, tending a $400 million university budget. A linguistics Ph.D. from Princeton and former assistant to the chancellor of the University of Maryland at College Park, McKay will, in July, become president of Mills College in Oakland, Calif.
Standing by a deep-silled window in her 18th-century Nassau Hall office on a recent weekday, McKay looks down at the elm-edged campus green. Students pause to chat between classes, book bags in hand. Men stand mostly with men; women, with women. The peak donation years for all lie just ahead, commencing in 2016.
"Women's giving combines those two great mysteries, sex and power," McKay says quietly. "We're about to find out if women will use their fiscal and political clout to hold schools accountable, on many levels. Money not only talks in higher education, it also confers the right to question, to stipulate and to withhold, as well as to support."

Is There Life After Marley and Juice Ads?

BYLINE: By MILO MILES; Milo Miles reviews world-beat music for "Fresh Air" on National Public Radio.

 BODY:
Once the quintessential outsiders' sound, reggae now appears to be safe in America's pop firmament. Its off-center beat has high name recognition among casual music fans and pervades commercials for fruit juice and tropical vacations. But reggae has a vitality problem: its revered past and sluggish present threaten to stifle its future.
Despite the outstanding, previously unreleased live performances on Bob Marley and the Wailers' recent "Talking Blues," the album points up the threat from the past. Marley's ghost seems to be the only reggae figure the mainstream considers worthy of attention. For the most part, current trends from Jamaica do not offer fierce competition. The popular dance-hall style, with its nimble electronic shimmy and groove-seeking arrangements, is potentially the reggae equivalent of hip-hop but in practice much more reactionary. Even with the resourceful producer Winston (Niney) Holness stretching beats, an anthology of contemporary reggae like "Turbo Charge" (Heartbeat CD HB 85; all three formats) settles for the same honorable, if shopworn, party pleasures as an old "Shindig" collection. 
 Likewise, solo performers are having trouble generating more than intermittent flickers. In 1989, the singer Foxy Brown burst in with a sinewy remake of Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car." But Ms. Brown's new "My Kind of Girl" (RAS RASCD 3070; all three formats) slides into servile love plaints, sparked briefly by a vigorous rhythm-and-blues oldie, "Piece of My Heart." Hers is exactly the sort of derivative, loose-ended album that plagued reggae before the music began to hammer out a vehement identity in the late 60's and early 70's.
Spurred by racial activists in the United States and the rising respectability of Rastafarians in Jamaica, reggae became the soundtrack for the most articulate and persistent center of black pride and pan-Africanism outside America. And this truculence has fired much of the enduring reggae for the past 20 years.
In the middle of reggae's confusion, the most acute vocal trio in the music soldiers on: Culture, led by Joseph Hill, with harmonies by Albert Walker and Roy Dayes that envelop his sandy tenor like a cozy cloak. Along with Winston (Burning Spear) Rodney, Mr. Hill, who launched Culture with the thunderous Two Sevens Clash in 1977, is the supreme exponent of "conscious" reggae -- music out to comfort and redeem the downtrodden.
Culture's only competition in reggae vocal drama is Toots Hibbert, now without his backup Maytals and recording infrequently. Both Mr. Hibbert and Mr. Hill are transformed gospel testifiers. But while Mr. Hibbert in his 70's heyday was a brash loverman-preacher in the mold of Otis Redding and Solomon Burke, Mr. Hill goes farther back for his church services. His passionate wails against despair and injustice have the power of a backwoods sermon. Oddly, the one overtly religious number on the new "Culture in Culture" (Heartbeat CD HB 67; all three formats) is the most perfunctory. Only the bemused rejection of gambling in "Five to One Strip Me" breaks new subject matter.
 The sly defiance of "Capture Rasta" rides on an undulant chorus with the inevitability of rolling hills. Long, languid horn lines in "Old Tattoo" convey the majestic rhythm progression long bumped aside by the clatter of dance hall. But the focus is always Mr. Hill, with his abrupt but well-timed shouts, gurgles and chuckles, and his insistent warnings and exhortations from the shadows of the mix. When he seems to peer through the barrier between rich and wretched souls and declares "too much different temperature here," you want to hear more. When he announces lightly that his faith in "Peace and Love" has nothing to fear from M-16's, you believe him.
The most provocative and quick-witted new reggae performer in several years has also evolved away from the spotlight, in England. Macka-B (Christopher McFarland) is a rapper -- or toaster, as they are known in Jamaica -- whose back catalogue of four records (available on all three formats) has been released in the United States by the Washington-based RAS Records.
 At least as verbally inventive as the celebrated Shabba Ranks and more touched by melody, Macka-B could soon equal acknowledged toastmasters like Big Youth, if his future material matches the high points of "Looks Are Deceiving" (RAS ARICD 038), "We've Had Enough!" (RAS ARICD 032), "Buppie Culture" (RAS ARICD 048) and "Natural Suntan" (RAS ARICD 058). His 1987 debut, "We've Had Enough!," is undernourished in both songwriting and sound. The rugged bass player Preacher and silky multi-instrumentalist Steel were not yet on hand, and the producer Mad Professor grows adventurous after their contributions are added. The accompaniment is spare, with slowly convoluting rhythms and just enough electronic chirps and synthesizd horns for a contemporary feel.
 Macka-B has unexceptional obsessions for a Rastaman: black pride, apartheid and Nelson Mandela and the ugly persistence of racism and classism. The difference is that his irrepressible personality consumes his causes and dilemmas, and makes them frightening, hilarious and vibrant. For a tribute to "Blackman," Macka-B appropriates the theme from "Batman."
This kind of disarming irreverence makes Macka-B the most tender-hearted militant imaginable, and he's by no means limited to standard activist themes. Occasionally he takes on peculiar calamities that even he can't do much with (salmonella-contaminated eggs, for example). More often, the unpredictable feints of wit and anger give his rhetoric a corrosive bite. On "Don't Beat Her," he asks how an abusive husband can claim to care more about his wife than the TV set, which he would never slap around.
Macka-B most sounds like an upstanding citizen of a newly ordered world when he turns to spirited morality in "Get Conscious" and "Badder Than Jah," both appeals of a religious man free of sanctimony. But his mortal spirit finally carries the day in the autobiographical tracks "Unemployment Blues" and "Drink Too Much." In a way, the songs are simple cautionary tales from a sensitive eccentric figuring out what work suits him and how to handle himself at Christmas parties. But at bottom, they are introductions to reggae's ruling boon companion.

Small Labels, Eternal Hope

BYLINE: By GERALD GOLD

 BODY:
And still they come: new classical labels crowding into an already overcrowded field, each convinced it has something special to offer. The explosion of new labels in the compact-disk era has added welcome spice to a field increasingly dominated by huge companies.
The Cala label, which bows in May, comes to the fray after making its mark with a six-CD series commissioned for the mail-order catalogues of American Express and Neiman-Marcus. The series, as Cala put it, was designed to appeal to a "well educated but for the most part musically untrained public," and the recording of Holst's "Planets" with the London Symphony was a best-seller in Britain. Cala's artistic director is Geoffrey Simon, a 43-year-old Australian-born conductor who lives in England. Mr. Simon regularly conducts several London-based orchestras. 
 Cala's first release as an independently financed label, sold in stores as well as by mail order, will be two disks of music by Debussy with Mr. Simon conducting the Philharmonia. It will be available in May.
Cala's brave new manifesto talks of using top-flight artists, reinterpreting the standard repertory and exploring little-known works. In addition, the label says it hopes to fill an educational role, in the sense that the original mail-order disks appealed to general audiences. But Cala also hopes to win over specialists as well.
 The Debussy disks, which mix familar and unfamiliar works and arrangements, will be followed by releases featuring Ravel, Brahms compositions and Respighi.
A more traditional entry in the small new label sweepstakes is Cedille. It is basically a one-person operation, the person being James Ginsburg, a 25-year-old law student in Chicago.
Like many small labels, Cedille sticks to soloists for economic reasons. Two disks are by the pianist Dmitry Paperno, a Soviet emigre who is a professor at De Paul University in Chicago. Mr. Paperno has lived in the United States since 1977 and performs in the Chicago area and abroad. He is featured on two disks -- one of Russian piano music (CDR 90000 001), the other, works of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms (CDR 90000 002).
Another pianist recorded by Cedille, Easley Blackwood, who is also noted as a composer, plays works by Alfredo Casella and Karol Szymanowski (CDR 90000 003).
The only other disk in the Cedille catalogue is a harpsichord recital by David Schrader playing the music of Padre Antonio Soler (CDR 90000 004).
 
Advance Notice
 In this age of electronics, careers are often made first by records. An example of one such career is that of the Soviet pianist Alexei Lubimov, who will make his North American debut at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday, performing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21, K. 467, with the Classical Band conducted by Andrew Parrott.
Mr. Lubimov comes to the United States preceded by a reputation built largely on the first two disks of a continuing cycle of Mozart's piano works, for the Erato label. Reviewing the disk containing Mozart's last four sonatas (Erato 2292-45510-2), Will Crutchfield, in The Times, praised Mr. Lubimov's ability to see "the Chopinesque side of Mozart . . . an example of the benefits of the 'early music' movement as it spreads and becomes more diverse."
 
Getting There First
 In May, Erato will release the first recordings of Daniel Barenboim conducting the Chicago Symphony in his new post as music director. (Mr. Barenboim and the Chicago have a five-year contract with the label.) The first releases will feature John Corigliano's new First Symphony and Richard Strauss's "Till Eulenspiegel" and "Ein Heldenleben."

A Bedazzled Critic Finds Oz, in Paris

BYLINE: By John Rockwell

 BODY:
A recent trip to Europe brought visions of cultural grandeur and impoverishment. Unfortunately, the impoverishment was not so much in the eastern parts of Germany, where cultural pride remains high despite severe economic woes, but looking back cross the ocean, in the United States.
We may be the mightiest nation on earth. We may have the most enviable popular culture, and through the hard work of a few artists and their champions we may still produce new work in the traditional arts that commands international attention -- John Adams's "Death of Kling hoffer," for instance, which just had its premiere in Brussels. But we can't seem to afford basic cultural amenities, and that's galling when one is faced with the riches of Europe. 
 Riches first: The largesse the Germans lavish on their theaters and museums and concert halls is legendary, and even with the strains brought about by a perhaps too sudden effort to swallow the former East Germany whole, the largesse continues. The eastern Germans worry, with reason, that theaters may be closed, artistic personnel laid off and new productions postponed, at least until the nation's cultural budgets sort themselves out.
Still, the basic vigor of German culture is beyond question. Even the British, slashing lustily at arts budgets after years of Thatcherism, seem about to restore music education as a basic part of the curriculum for young children.
But what struck me on this trip was the splendors of Paris. Under the presidencies of Georges Pompidou and Francois Mitterrand, stretching back now more than 20 years, Paris has been enjoying what will surely be reckoned by future historians as a cultural golden age. With the Musee d'Orsay and I. M. Pei's perky pyramids in the Cour Napoleon of the Louvre, Beaubourg and Pierre Boulez's Ircam and the Bastille Opera, new film centers and the spiffy refurbishment of the Theatre des Champs-Elysees, Radio France's championing of every century of French music and the exquisite early-music movement led by William Christie, glowing monuments downtown and shining theatrical marvels in workers' suburbs led by brilliant directorial innovators like Patrice Chereau -- France is, for a bedazzled American straw man on holiday, an Oz-like cultural wonderland.
The country's artistic riches are not just vulgar excess, as in certain American cultural centers thrown up with much local boosterism but a lamentable lack of actual art. French cultural subvention represents a truly regal extension of the royal patronage of the Old Regime, a feeling that politicians win glory in the eyes of history for the artistic legacies they leave behind. Some politicians, like Mr. Mitterrand or Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, are artist-intellectuals themselves.
Europe's politicians, for all their pomposity and vainglory, care enough about culture to support it as a necessity of life. Ours defame the arts by paying earnest attention to laughable philistines concerned only about the publicity they may reap by attacking "obscenity."
On this same trip, I kept running into Harvey Lichtenstein and his problems. Mr. Lichtenstein, who is the president and chief producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, has done noble work in bringing the best of European vanguard performing arts to New York. Yet now he is feeling the pinch -- of the recession and its impact on corporate and individual donations, and of cuts in the city, state and Federal arts budgets, which were minuscule to start with.
The latest problem was "The Black Rider," an amusingly kooky collaboration among the director Robert Wilson, the rock composer Tom Waits and the writer William S. Burroughs, produced at the Thalia Theater of Hamburg. It had been announced as a centerpiece of the New York International Festival of the Arts in June. But Mr. Lichtenstein, encountered first in Brussels and then in Hamburg and back in Brooklyn, reported that he was having trouble with the Thalia people, who, he said, kept raising the ante. The Thalia's administrative director, Ludwig von Otting, complained for his part that Mr. Lichtenstein had no money, that the Thalia had cut its fees to the bone and that the academy's Opera House was "unbelievably primitive, like some theater in Moscow."
What it all came down to was money, and the fact that Mr. Lichtenstein didn't have enough of it. He probably won't have enough to bring in Mr. Wilson's visionary production of Wagner's "Parsifal," either -- which after its current Hamburg State Opera performances will journey next winter to the Houston Grand Opera. Unless, of course, he can finagle a German grant.
Perhaps Mr. Lichtenstein is just being prudent, shedding commitments to preserve his overall operation. He still plans, he insists, on bringing in much valuable work, from "The Death of Klinghoffer" in September to, he hopes, projects by Peter Brook and Ariane Mnouchkine. He even talks about an academy-produced English-language tour of "The Black Rider." But at this point, that's pretty nebulous, and he knows it. Americans, when feeling flush, import large-scale art; by and large, we can't actually afford to create it.
Right now, Mr. Lichtenstein's academy is hurting financially, like so many other American institutions. And that means we're hurting artistically. After a renewed exposure to a European culture that gives the arts a higher priority than we seem to manage, that's a depressing realization.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURAL PLANS;
Visions Vs. Realities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Paul Goldberger's article "Two Reasons for Dancing in the Streets of New York" [March 17] should have arranged for legions of relief dancers, generations of them, if the celebration of the March 1991 plan for the Penn Yards along the Hudson River is to commemorate anything more than what it truly is -- just another plan. Numerous designs and projects have preceded it and Trump City, its immediate predecessor; some even before the then far-advanced "Litho City" of about 50 years ago. A published history referred to the abandoned Penn Central rail yard as a "nursery for dreams."
Such long-vacillating architectural visions in New York are certainly not unusual -- they number in the hundreds and probably encompass a major portion of the city's architectural efforts. But cheering the current railroad yard proposal is unusual. Not just from the lack of any meaningful direction for its advancement, but because current movement is in the opposite direction. Instead of "relocating" the roadway, a major rebuilding of the existing structure is about to proceed, and the potential for a huge park land development is another pleasant dream when we consider that the dilemma for the future will be how to maintain existing parks.
Does anyone actually believe that the $70 million newly renovated structure will be removed and the roadway relocated this century? The coalition of community groups should be congratulated for their imaginative design, but will the design be appropriate at a time well into the future?
Other goals and needs may then be of a much higher priority for this very large railroad yard area. For instance, environmentalists, concerned about the greenhouse effect and global warming, warn about potential rising water levels at the shoreline. This might require that the development be placed on stilts. Not to worry. The planning department's Special Manhattan Landing District, covering almost as large an area and planned well over a decade ago, though likewise unrealized, was also to be partially placed on stilts.
As housing, economic and social conditions in the city continue to decline and their ills compound each other, perhaps rationality and reason will return. What if this very large, repetitiously planned area, which has nevertheless so long remained a wasteland, could meanwhile provide a good deal of badly needed housing through mobile home placement? When the long-abandoned railroad yards really reach a point in time for actual renewal, the mobile installation could be moved to some other long-established wasteland.

HEADLINE: Selective Passions

BYLINE: By Laurel Graeber; Laurel Graeber is a New York writer specializing in the arts and design.

 BODY:
A LONG ISLAND couple, serious collectors of English ceramics, still have the first pieces they ever bought: two Wedgwood blue-and-white cups and saucers, purchased 30 years ago for $15. "I don't think they're worth more than $120 now," says one. "We've kept them for their sentimental value. But I think if we had to do it over again, we'd have started by being more selective."
Selectivity, always important in collecting, can have special meaning for the beginner: It may be a question of buying the most beautiful American quilt instead of the extraordinary -- and extraordinarily expensive -- piece of folk art, or the finest Victoriana as opposed to the rarest Chippendale. However the choice is made, building new collections in these leaner days calls for more time and study: visiting the most respected dealers, auction houses and museums for advice, and reading as much as possible. Also, in choosing an area of interest, perhaps the most important priority is not to become too obsessed with priorities. When means are limited, a little eclecticism and flexibility, combined with good judgment, can help the novice find something tasteful that is still within his budget. 
 "Don't be monomaniacally concentrated on something," advises Laurence N. Strenger, a longtime collector who is a partner at Ampton BCS Investments in Manhattan. "Rather than buying for the sake of buying, shift into another area. If you can't afford furniture, buy watercolors."
Most experts advise staying away from categories that are enormously popular -- and therefore expensive -- or those that have attracted an international audience. When the dollar is weak, pursuing objects coveted by foreign collectors is bound to be a losing proposition. "The best thing is to buy here, in this country, and buy things that aren't Japanese," says Herve Aaron, president of Didier Aaron, a New York business dealing in 18th- and 19th-century French, English and Continental antiques.
Setting realistic goals, however, does not mean giving up completely on a competitive area. If a new collector has found a sought-after style, period or artist that excites his passion, his first objective should be to determine whether there is an example he can afford. Although an original painting by Edward Hopper or Picasso is probably out of the question, a print or drawing by the same artist may be available at a reasonable price. And if fine 18th-century English or American furniture is beyond your means -- and if it isn't, you needn't read further -- there may be an area of the same period's decorative arts that will allow you to capture the look at lower cost.
"Everyday 18th-century tole objects can go for less than $1,000," points out Chris Jussel, owner of Vernay & Jussel, New York dealers in 18th- and 19th-century English furniture and clocks. "The same is true of textiles and costumes. And even some Old Master drawings are still available and within reach."
Another approach is to acquire pieces of a particular style that were made at a later date. This may involve investigating objects that were inspired by an earlier period, as 19th-century neo-classic was by 18th-century neo-classic, or investing in reproductions, now antiques themselves, that were made 100 years later. But keep in mind that this strategy won't assure a bargain -- Gothic Revival furniture, for example, is generally more expensive than Gothic -- and it may earn downright derision, depending on the level of purism in the field.
"Something like late Gothic Revival has a different approach and a style of its own," says Herve Aaron. "But to buy 19th-century copies of 18th-century French furniture is worth nothing -- there's no originality."
MUCH DEPENDS, however, on the priorities of the individual collector. Edward Munves Jr., president of James Robinson, Manhattan dealers in antique silver and jewelry, points out that there are many ways to admire an antique. While a reproduction cannot be valued for its originality, it can often hold its own on craftsmanship, beauty and condition. He offers as an example an egg-shaped silver jug, an 1865 reproduction made in the style of 1715. "Do we say the fellow who made the first created an original," he asks, "and all he made later, and all his colleagues made, were copies? You can carry the emphasis on originality to the nth degree. After all, you can say the 1715 egg-shaped jug isn't original, because the craftsman saw a chicken drop the thing, and all he did was put legs and a spout on it." Granted, the Victorian reproduction is worth $5,500 as opposed to about $35,000 for the original -- but that's not bad for a piece that probably brought only $100 a generation ago.
An even thornier question is whether the novice should settle for second-best. Again, he has to determine why he's really collecting. Whereas devoted scholars of the decorative arts take their collections as seriously as a museum's, others acquire merely to furnish their homes.
"If you decide that $1,200 is too much for an antique dining table in good condition, and you just want the look, you can pay half that for one whose legs have been replaced," says Karen Keane, managing director of Skinner, an auction house with offices in Boston and Bolton, Mass. "But," she cautions, "the ones in pristine condition are the only ones that will appreciate. It really depends on your motive."
If it's truly serious, some experts will advise purchasing at the absolute top level you can afford -- certainly a safe route in the midst of recession. "Buy the best even if it means eating creamed eggs for two months," asserts Letitia Roberts, senior vice president and director of Chinese export porcelain and European ceramics at Sotheby's. "The best things will always hold their own. And good things may bring even more money in hard times."
Others point out, however, that second-best doesn't have to mean second-rate. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the merely good, especially since it's usually more affordable than the great. And this may be the most enjoyable way for the beginner to gain experience.
"I think it's best to start small and build up," says William Iselin, vice president in charge of European furniture at Christie's. "You can get very discouraged if everything you look at is five times more than you can spend. And even if you have the means, you're not giving yourself a chance to learn."
Basically, any collector trying to buy affordable pieces can follow one of two routes: Look into the less important examples of an important art form or the exquisite examples of an area not yet in demand. Among the former, says Edward Munves, might be serving pieces in English silver, gold bar brooches, jewelry mounted with semiprecious stones and unmatched elements of a porcelain set. In the second category -- and often ignored -- are fine works by less recognizable artists and craftsmen. "A first-rate work by a lesser painter is better than a third-rate work by a top artist," says John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's and author, with Christopher Andersen, of "The Best of Everything: The Insider's Guide to Collecting -- for Every Taste and Every Budget" (Simon and Schuster, 1989). "As the first-ranked paintings get more expensive and go off the market, the law of supply and demand makes the others more important. If you've bought them, you win on two counts: quality and value."
Other areas that may appreciate in the future include well-made pieces that are not in the current taste or objects that have caught on in only one region of the country. For example, R. S. Prussia porcelain is not widely collected outside the Middle West, points out Letitia Roberts.
"The best prospects can be areas in which nobody has done much research," she adds. "In American ceramics, for instance, good pieces were made in small establishments that didn't keep a lot of records. And one way to increase the value of any collection is to do the detective work yourself in an uncharted area."
Whatever the approach, the critical criterion is quality. If an object is not top-tier, it should still be a worthy example. And if it's very good but not popular now, it's likely to become popular again. According to Roberts, "Fashion will accommodate whatever's worth accommodating." Areas some of these experts consider undervalued are 19th-century watercolors and drawings, American Empire furniture, early English oak furniture and pieces from the English Arts and Crafts movement. African and pre-Columbian art, as well as some antiquities, can be both affordable and fascinating, notes John Marion. "Antique coins are like miniature sculptures and may only cost in the hundreds of dollars," he says. And don't neglect the well-made objects of the 20th century. Already becoming collectible are items as recent as postwar architect-designed furniture and original posters from the 1960's.
"Salt and pepper shakers designed by Raymond Loewy or a Questar telescope made in the 1950's have all the qualities we prize in antiques," points out Donald Nathanson, a Philadelphia psychiatrist and lifelong collector. "Great workmanship will be passed on forever."
But even the finest piece of its kind can be a bad bet if you don't really like it. Collecting is inherently a passionate pursuit, and those who are serious invest their emotions as much as their incomes. Love for an object can be an added enhancement if its value increases, and a crucial consolation if it doesn't. As Nathanson puts it, "Anything that remains beautiful is a wonderful purchase."

HEADLINE: Within Limits

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
ARCHITECTURE IS NOT free verse. It's more like a sonnet: It demands creativity within a highly structured framework. Designing buildings is a struggle to make art within limits, to soar without wings, to make magic without pretending that the world is supernatural. It is the ultimate exercise in accommodating to reality.
In this sense, architecture is ideally suited to respond to the facts of life in the 1990's. Now, more than ever, we seem to have not enough time, not enough room and, most of all, not enough money. Choices in architecture and design are increasingly becoming as much a matter of what to omit as what to include; the house that has everything is not going to be the house of the 90's. In this decade, less has got to be more, and not in the way Mies van der Rohe had in mind, either. 
 Of course, architecture has always been the result of a decision about priorities -- or, to put it another way, a response to constraints. They sometimes involve a building's site, sometimes the project's functional demands and, almost always, money. And they are just as likely to be a combination of the three.
What we almost never see is architecture unconstrained by any of these limits -- an instance where an architect is presented with unlimited money, time and design freedom. But isn't this the dream, the magic moment of creativity that all architects yearn for? Try again. If you look back at the architecture and design of the last couple of generations, architects who have been invited to work without limits, or given only moderate ones, have almost never yielded first-rate buildings. Indeed, the opposite is closer to the truth: Almost every time an architect has designed a house on a virtually unlimited budget, the result has been one of his or her weakest designs.
Does any student of residential architecture really think that Richard Meier did better when he created a sprawling, 11-bedroom villa in Old Westbury, L. I., in 1971, than he did several years earlier, in 1965, with his Smith House in Darien, Conn.? The Smith House, whatever its impracticalities, is a tight, crisp homage to Le Corbusier, bursting with a young architect's enthusiasm. It is elegant and fresh, a stunning composition of wood and glass. But a few years later, when success brought Meier a client with a much bigger budget, the object stretched -- but the architectural ideas did not. Indeed, the Old Westbury house is vast and more than a little bit banal, with the scale of a small institution more than a house. Everything got bigger except the architecture, which seems almost to have shrunk.
The same thing happened to Meier's longtime peer, Charles Gwathmey. In the same year that Meier designed the Smith House, Gwathmey designed a house and studio for his parents in Amagansett, L. I., that became an icon of beach-house architecture. The pair of small, spare wooden buildings is energized by tight geometries; as in the early Meier house, they convey a young architect's creative passion, brilliantly contained and controlled. There was very little money available for the Gwathmey project, but the tight budget, like the structure of a sonnet, only intensified the brilliance of what was made.
Yet, in content, the Gwathmey house and studio are really like a haiku: The architect made poetry with a minimum of material. Gwathmey and Robert Siegel, with whom he has worked for most of the years since, have gone on to design a great deal of distinguished work, but never again has there been that same sense of astonishing achievement within tight limits. Indeed, many of Gwathmey Siegel's houses, like the 1971 Cogan residence in East Hampton, L. I., or the original plans for the Gimelstob Residence, designed in 1982 for a site in New Vernon, N.J., suffer from the same problem as Meier's house in Old Westbury: They are vast, sprawling and institutional. The architects described the Gimelstob project by saying that "the design attempts to interpret 'house' through cubist transformations rather than traditional vernacular" -- which, once you get through the professional rhetoric, seems to be a way of admitting that the building would have looked like a 1960's school.
Now, it's not that Meier and Gwathmey were once young and lean, and then got fat and happy, though these houses could well lead one to such a conclusion. The point is not the progress of architectural careers so much as it is the particulars of individual jobs, and the fact that creative energies often flow best under certain kinds of pressure. Take away the limits, and you have not really let the bird fly free: Sometimes, you've only let it fly in bigger and bigger circles.
The same relationship between small budgets and brilliant houses and big budgets and much weaker work exists in many other architects' careers. Stanley Tigerman, for example, came to prominence in the mid-1970's for a series of modernist houses around Chicago that were quirky, slightly perverse, but undeniably potent as images: The Animal Crackers House, looking like the wagon on the box of cookies, and the Daisy House, with its suggestively erotic floor plan, are perhaps the best known. When the big-money clients came calling on Tigerman, however, his architecture got weaker. The design of a house in Northfield, Ill., completed in 1987, deteriorated into a glitzy parody of Palladio. The red-brick suburban villa, a sprawling house with an indoor pool decorated in trompe l'oeil, is to a traditional suburban tract house what a "pimpmobile" is to a station wagon. Perhaps there are some ideas in this melange of fantasies, but they're well hidden.
It's no more accurate, however, to dismiss Tigerman's career as a progression from lean and smart beginnings to fat and dull middle age than it would be to describe Meier's or Gwathmey's that way. Tigerman has done plenty of impressive work in recent years, not the least of which has been his own weekend residence, a witty, almost bouncy compound of barnlike buildings designed with his wife and partner, Margaret McCurry. But the success of this project only proves the point. Tigerman and McCurry had relatively little money to spend, and their economic constraints forced them to a series of creative solutions not unlike the early projects designed by all of these architects. It's the limits that gave the work its focus and definition, not the point in the architect's career in which it occurred.
This phenomenon extends beyond the architecture of houses. A few years ago, Kevin Roche, as gifted a commercial architect as any practicing today and perhaps the most celebrated designer of suburban corporate headquarters in the world, produced an overblown, high-tech version of Versailles outside Paris for Bouygues, the French construction company. It was another case of too much: too much land, too much money, too much desire to dazzle the world. And Philip Johnson's career has sometimes suffered from the same affliction. While the lavish architecture of Johnson's historicist period has often been convincing -- who could not admire skyscrapers like Transco Tower in Houston or the I.B.M. tower in Atlanta? -- it's hard not to think that a lot of the buildings Johnson and his partner, John Burgee, have designed in recent years would have been twice as good had they cost half as much.
Haiku, sonnets -- it's not a coincidence that one comes up with words like these as ideals for the decade, for they suggest limits and constraints at their most positive. The real challenge for the architecture of the 90's will be to use the limits of this time to make the right choices -- to design lean buildings that will be not overblown epics, but eloquent, simple poetry.

HEADLINE: Talking: Shortfalls;
If a Sale Fails to Pay The Loan

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
THE decline in home values in the last few years is forcing some sellers to accept buyers' offers that do not cover still-outstanding mortgage balances.
In the early years of a home loan, most of the borrower's monthly payments go for interest rather than principal. So when an owner has to sell at a low price, he not only may lose his down payment and the small amount of equity he has built up, but he also may wind up owing thousands of dollars to the lender. The same problem would arise in a foreclosure. 
 For example, a couple who bought a home in 1988 for $150,000 with a $120,000 mortgage might find that the house can now fetch only $110,000 and that the shortfall could leave them with almost $10,000 still due on the loan. Such problems crop up in only a small fraction of sales, but it happens often enough for bankers to have given the phenomenon a name -- "the short sale."
"There's no question we are seeing it happen more often," said Thomas Hylinski, first vice president at People's Bank of Bridgeport, Conn., an area where prices have fallen substantially.
Lenders report no hard and fast rules for handling such situations. "Deals are being worked out strictly on a case-by-case basis," said John Battaglia, vice president of residential lending at the Boston Five Cent Savings Bank in Boston.
Much will depend, lenders say, on the market in which the property is situated, the attitude of the company servicing the mortgage payments and the policy of the investors who bought the loan from the local lender and who have the final say over any deals.
Lawyers warn sellers that they are legally obligated for the full deficiency. Richard Liebman, a bankruptcy lawyer in Rockville Centre, L.I., said lenders are in a strong position to enforce this obligation because they can hold up sales of mortgaged properties until they have been paid in full. "Theoretically the debt has to be satisfied before a closing can take place," Mr. Liebman said.
In reality, however, all sorts of maneuvering takes place. In today's weaker market the lender is often eager for the home to be sold even at a lower price, especially if the owner is having trouble meeting mortgage payments.
The fear is that otherwise the owners might simply abandon the home. It then becomes extremely expensive and time-consuming for the lender to pursue all the legal steps to take back ownership through foreclosure. In the meantime, the home may deteriorate and be worth even less.
Short sales may also be more attractive to sellers than foreclosure because they can keep their credit ratings intact.
Tim Good, president of Mortgage Access Corporation of Morris Plains, N.J., said troubled sellers under pressure to move should try to work out deals whereby they agree to sell as quickly as possible for the best price they can get in exchange for some compromise on the anticipated shortfall -- either paying a lesser amount or paying the money back in installments.
Whether the lender accepts a compromise amount will depend on the strength of the local market, on how much more the lender is likely to lose if he does not compromise and the seller then refuses to sell voluntarily, and on the likelihood that the seller has the income or alternative resources to make good on the full sum eventually.
"We have done a few of these compromise deals," said Ken Herz, a spokesman for Chemical Bank in New York City. "But like everyone else we try to collect the whole thing whenever we feel we can."
What can help tip the balance toward a compromise, said Robert Engelstad, senior vice president of mortgage and lending standards for the Federal National Mortgage Association, is if a mortgage insurance company -- a company that guarantees repayment of the loan to the lender in the event of foreclosure -- is willing to help diminish the shortfall.
Any owner who took out a mortgage for more than 80 percent of a home's value may still have such a policy in place. And although the mortgage insurance company is legally obligated to pay the lender only if there is a foreclosure, a growing number are stepping in earlier voluntarily.
"WE are doing so as a way to control the extent of our own losses," said Jeanette Bernay, manager of corporate communications for General Electric Capital Mortgage Corporation of Raleigh, N.C., a mortgage insurance company.
Normally, however, the intervention occurs only when the seller has clearly exhausted all financial resources or in instances of genuine hardship "such as death, unemployment or illness," said John Hoff, vice president for claims at Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation of Milwaukee, another mortgage insurer.
The most likely option for anyone else is to arrange to pay off the deficiency over several years. "That's what's been happening with most of our short sales," said John Haggerty, director of operations for Citicorp Mortgage, one of the nation's largest residential lenders.
Typically, say bankers, the amount is spread over 5 to 10 years and interest is charged on the sum still outstanding. The Veterans Administration has started working this way, charging borrowers 4 percent and giving them up to 15 years to repay.
Consider, too, how People's, the Connecticut bank, decided to handle two recent short sales. One involved the sale of a home in Trumbull that had left the lenders with a $10,000 shortfall. The bank refused to compromise on the amount due because the husband still had a good income. Instead, it agreed that the $10,000 could be paid back over five years. An interest rate of 10 percent was charged. Payments came to $212 a month, which were tolerable, since the couple's monthly housing costs had dropped from $2,000 before they sold the house to $800 for a small rental apartment.
In the second case, the owner of a condominium in Bridgeport still owed the bank $15,000. He did not want to walk away from his debt or declare bankruptcy, but it was unlikely he could easily pay back so large an amount. So a deal was struck whereby the man's family co-signed a note for $15,000 payable over five years at $310 a month. It may appear at first like a troubling indenture. But it has enabled him to maintain good credit.
Usually a payment schedule is workable only when the amount is under $40,000 and the seller still has a good income. Otherwise bankers say the tendency is for the beleaguered owner to file for personal bankruptcy. Although this may generate future credit problems, it normally wipes out the debt entirely.

HEADLINE: 'Other Boroughs'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your article on March 10 entitled "Other Boroughs Strategy Bucks Difficult Times" you refer to several Brooklyn projects either completed or proposed that not only affect the economic well-being of the borough, but the long-term esthetic impact, too. 
 First, there is the Livingston Plaza complex, which is to become the new home of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Though not yet inhabited, the building, because of the use of gray and gray-black tile for its facade, already looks as dirty and dingy as if it had been ravaged by pollution for the last 30 to 40 years. And the copious use of those tiles, along with its high rounded corners, makes the building just another rotten piece of official architecture, very much in keeping with the dismal Landlord-Tenant Court building directly across the street.
You also refer to the proposed construction of Atlantic Center over the Long Island Rail Road station at Atlantic Avenue. According to the public plans presented at community meetings, it calls for two large office towers immediately adjacent to the Williamsburgh Savings Bank building. The singular beauty and striking esthetic of the bank would be significantly marred by two office towers alongside it. The wiser course would be to distribute the office complex to, literally, a wider base much smaller in height, rather than have these towers rise in esthetic competition to one of the finest pieces of architecture in all of New York City.
It seems that in these cases form becomes the slave of function (much to our regret), and we in the "outer" boroughs will have to suffer the outrage of Livingston Plaza for decades. But it may not be too late to save Atlantic Avenue.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:

Paying for Repairs
 
Question: We are senior citizens living in a rent-controlled apartment in a building converted to a cooperative under a noneviction plan. The owner of our apartment, the former building owner, refuses to pay for repairs, claiming that the co-op management should pay. Meanwhile, the superintendent says it's our responsibility. Who should pay and how does one get them to pay? . . . Herbert Stessin, Manhattan
 
Answer: Your dispute is probably with your shareholding landlord, and you have recourse to the courts and state regulators. Michael R. Finder, a Manhattan housing lawyer, said a co-op's lease usually provides that repairs within a unit, such as a leaky faucet, are the owner's responsibility and that structural repairs, such as a leaky roof, are management's.
If a written request fails to get action from your landlord, you can file a complaint with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal at its borough office, 240-6010. Mr. Finder said your other options are to sue the landlord in the housing division of City Civil Court or to withhold your rent and raise the repair issue when the landlord sues you for nonpayment. A lawyer is not required for housing court; call its borough office at 374-2212 for information.
 
Electrical Outlets
 
Question: Is the landlord required to provide grounded three-pronged electrical outlets in an older apartment building in New York City? Would the cost of converting the outlets be the tenant's responsibility? Is it lawful to use adapters on refrigerator and air-conditioner plugs to fit the older style electrical outlets? . . . J.Sussman, Manhattan
 
Answer: Landlords are not required to provide three-pronged outlets in pre-1967 buildings. That year the city's code was amended to require grounded outlets in new construction, according to Vahe Tiryakian, spokesman for New York City's Buildings Department. All post-1967 buildings should have the grounded outlets.
If a Buildings Department inspection found a code violation, Mr. Tiryakian said, the owner would be ordered to comply. Housing lawyers say the cost of compliance is the owner's, not the tenant's, responsibility.
Adapters are widely used for plugs on modern appliances in pre-1967 buildings lacking three-pronged outlets. But Mr. Tiryakian said such adapters are not approved by the city's code.
 
Late-Payment Penalties
 
Question: The landlord notified all tenants of our rent-stabilized apartment building as follows: Rent is due the first of each month. Rent received after the fifth day will be subject to a $20 late charge. If the rent is not paid within 10 days, the tenant will be served with eviction papers. Proceedings will not be discontinued unless legal fees are paid. Is this legal? . . . Herman Marak, Elmhurst, Queens
 
Answer: Maybe. The first issue is whether your lease provides for a late penalty, according to Michael B. Rosenblatt, chairman of the Enforcement Bureau's Co-operative and Condominium Committee in the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. If the lease allows a penalty, the next question is whether the amount is reasonable. The $20 appears to meet that test.
As for the threatened eviction, Mr. Rosenblatt said that landlords are entitled to invoke such proceedings in cases of unpaid rent, but that imposing legal fees on the tenant is for a court, not the landlord, to decide.

The Hartford Builds on Spec in Hometown

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
FIFTY-FIVE Farmington, the first large office building to be completed in Hartford since 1989, and the last expected for another two to three years, opened two weeks ago after a troubled history.
 The general contractor went out of business midway through construction and apprehension over the economy and the city's stagnant real estate market gave the builder, the Hartford Insurance Group, some anxious moments. But the company completed the 272,000-square-foot structure at a cost of $40 million. 
 "It was discussed that we not do this building," said Kevin North, the insurance group's deputy director of real estate. "Undoubtedly it's going to be slower to lease than we projected, but we think it is poised for when the market comes back."
 The 12-story building, at the corner of Farmington Avenue and Flower Street, is the Hartford's first speculative venture in its home city, after developing more than 5.5 million square feet of office space in 20 other communities. The company will occupy 12,000 square feet and U.S. Travel Systems, a Hartford corporate-travel agency, has taken 20,000 square feet through the Farley Company, leasing agents. Rents will range from $14 to $17 a square foot for unfinished space.
 Michael Ezell, project manager for the designers, Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback & Associates of Atlanta, said the building "has a solid feeling of permanence and stability that lawyers and accounting firms like."
 Sitting on an oddly shaped lot of 1.2 acres across the street from the Hartford's headquarters, the triangular building is constructed of precast concrete, etched to simulate limestone, and green granite. The exterior focus is a rounded corner with bay windows.
 With 1.4 million of the 8.3 million square feet of office space downtown empty, Fifty-Five Farmington enters a fearsome market. Hartford's vacancy rate has risen from 6 percent in 1987, when it was the lowest in the nation, to about 17 percent downtown and 25 percent in the suburbs, according to Cushman & Wakefield Realtors.
 The central business district is pocked with craters left by demolition through the 80's, making way for ambitious new projects that never materialized for lack of funds.
 A $100 million World Trade Center lost its franchise and the new franchise was issued to Bridgeport. The planned 51-story $250 million Cutter Financial Center is believed to have been taken over by John W. Galbreath Company of Columbus, Ohio. Neither developer responded to phone calls.
 Plans for the Society for Savings' 1.2 million square feet of offices between Pratt and Asylum Streets are not expected to be resuscitated for three to five years. In the meantime, Robert A. Firger, senior vice-president of the bank, said the bank was talking to the city about creating a park or "other attractive street activity" that would not be permanent or affect its future building plans.
 The Oakleaf Development Corporation's site for a 1.2 million-square-foot building at 180 Allyn Street is under consideration as a state convention center site. "We may sell," said Daniel R. Friedman, chairman of Oakleaf, which has let 10 of its 18 employees go.
The city's Planning Department has not heard in over a year from I. D. C. Sari, a French developer, on its as yet unapproved proposal for a huge mixed-use project near the northern city limits. Calls to the developer's office in Hartford were not returned.
 "Hartford is in a horizontal mode," said Carl Traub, vice president at Cushman & Wakefield Realtors, who said a meager 26,188 square feet was leased downtown in 1990. This year, 53,000 square feet has been vacated, while 97,000 square feet has been leased downtown and 136,000 square feet in the suburbs.
 Fifty-Five Farmington was temporarily stalled last August when the E & F Construction Company of Bridgeport went out of business after real estate investments soured.
"FORTUNATELY, we had a contract stating that in the event the general contractor became insolvent we could terminate with a simple letter and take over the subcontractors ourselves," said David Holl, the Hartford Group's director of construction. "We'd never done it before. We did it without missing a beat, but I don't think we would do it again. It takes its toll."
 The two-story entrance rotunda, lined with green marble and mahogany, leads to a wide corridor flanked by banks of elevators. Straight ahead is a huge picture window through which can be seen the Capitol and Bushnell Park. "Nothing can ever be built to destroy that view," said Mr. Ezell, the project manager for the designers.
 Shops, banks, travel agencies and restaurants are sought as ground-floor tenants, with each unit having direct access to the street and the lobby. Ceiling heights are 9 feet, but the top floor has 14-foot ceilings and decorative balconies around the windows.
 The building and a park across the street have a total of 852 underground parking spaces. As a hedge against future needs, the garage under the park was built to become the basement of a future Hartford Group office building. Until that happens, the park's benches, walks and a court with sculpture commissioned by the insurance company will be open to the public.
 If the city is to emerge from the doldrums, Deputy Mayor I. Charles Matthews said, the revival of the Economic Development Commission, which disbanded in the booming early 80's, will be the catalyst. Last month the City Council reconstituted a commission of 15 members, 5 of whom must live in the city, while the rest may be suburbanites. Mr. Matthews said he hoped to have the commission seats filled by April 30.
 "We need a one-stop service which will help retain existing businesses and recruit new ones," he said, adding that the city is prepared to offer tax deferrals and abatements. Traditionally, Hartford's growth was generated from within, by expansion of the giant insurance and banking concerns that are now contracting.
 Lately, in the absence of a commission, Mr. Matthews has been meeting with the Chamber of Commerce, the Downtown Council, the Convention and Visitors Bureau and other business groups, "relaying information back and forth," he said. "They all have something to say, but not to each other."

HEADLINE: Pressing to Save Jobs From Pentagon Cuts

BYLINE: By States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MOUNTING concern over the survival of some of the region's largest military installations has sparked a vigorous lobbying effort in New Jersey and on Capitol Hill.
As many as 15,000 New Jerseyans' jobs could be at stake if -- as some members of Congress fear -- Fort Monmouth, the Picatinny Arsenal and the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard appear on the cost-cutting "hit list" that the Pentagon will release by April 15. 
 Fueling those fears is an internal Army report, as well as meetings that New Jersey lawmakers have held with military officials.
"There is active concern that Fort Monmouth, Picatinny and the Philadelphia Naval Yard may go down," said Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of Bellmawr, who has actively lobbied in defense of the bases. "New Jersey seems to have been disproportionately targeted."
The Pentagon's proposals would have to pass muster with President Bush and Congress before taking effect this fall.
At stake are 7,700 civilian jobs at Fort Monmouth in Red Bank and 5,200 at the Picatinny Arsenal in Dover, as well as 7,500 at the Philadelphia shipyard. About 3,000 of the shipyard workers live in New Jersey.
Mr. Andrews and his New Jersey colleagues, particularly Representatives Dean A. Gallo and Frank Pallone Jr., have begun an aggressive campaign to convince defense officials that the military installations should be spared. The measures have included letters to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, a meeting with Army Secretary Michael Stone, testimony before the House Armed Services Committee and tours of the bases.
Community groups have also sprung into action. The Save Our Fort Committee in Monmouth County and the Concerned Responsible Individuals to Save Picatinny have mounted letter-writing and petition drives.
At the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, a Joint Committee for Yard Development brought 500 workers to Washington last month for a rally in support of the shipyard.
By April 15 the Pentagon is to recommend which military installations should be closed or consolidated to meet cost-reduction targets set by the defense appropriation bill that Congress passed last autumn. In January Mr. Cheney outlined a 25 percent reduction in active-duty personnel by 1995.
That move will reduce funds for the military by about 20 percent over the next five years, said Robert M. Rauner, director of the Pentagon's Office of Economic Adjustment.
"The cold war is over," Mr. Rauner said. "We therefore have need for fewer things, because we will have fewer people -- meaning we don't need as many places to train them, house them, feed them, entertain them, medicate them."
An internal report by the Army Materiel Command, the Army's main procurement branch, cites Fort Monmouth and the Picatinny Arsenal as candidates for closing. The report, "A.M.C. Vision 2000," proposes to streamline Army command functions by consolidating several units, including Monmouth and Picatinny, into one operation in Huntsville, Ala., now the site of a smaller installation called the Redstone Arsenal.
The last time the Government initiated a round of military closings, in 1989, a New Jersey base, Fort Dix, lost its status as an Army basic-training operation. The phase-out, to be completed late next year, will result in the net loss of 800 civilian jobs and as many as 3,200 military jobs.
"Between Fort Dix and the other two bases we've discussed, that would be the end of the Army presence in the state," said Mr. Pallone, Democrat of Long Branch. "And I think that would be totally unfair."
New Jersey members of Congress and their constituents argue that the base closings proposed so far will not even save money. The Army Materiel Command report estimates that consolidating command units into one operation in Alabama will cost $2 billion initially and will not start saving money until 2008.
And supporters of Fort Monmouth, Picatinny and the naval shipyard argue that the military will lose valuable expertise and resources if they are moved.
"I feel that the Army can find much smarter ways to save money," said Martin Kane, chairman of the Save Picatinny Committee, a grass-roots organization representing the installation's 5,200 civilian workers.
"We all recognize that there are going to be necessary cutbacks that have to be implemented in order to cut costs," said Mr. Kane, a civilian lawyer at the Picatinny Arsenal. "But the 'Vision 2000' just doesn't make sense from a readiness standpoint, or from an economic standpoint."
Mr. Kane's committee has urged government officials of 132 municipalities in the area to write Secretary Cheney with their concerns and has invited members of Congress to visit the base. Nearly 100 lawmakers have toured Picatinny since January, spurred in part by interest in the technology that assisted in the Persian Gulf war. Picatinny researchers helped develop components of the Patriot missile and the Copperhead artillery projectile, a "smart" weapon.
The gulf war amply illustrated the strategic value of Delaware Valley installations, say supporters of the two bases and the shipyard. Fort Monmouth provided electronics equipment and served as a communications center. The shipyard sent two aircraft carriers refurbished at the yard -- the Independence and the Saratoga -- to the Persian Gulf.
 
'Importance of High Technology'
 "With Operation Desert Storm having shown the importance of high technology and battlefield communications, this is hardly the time to begin to make changes in Cecom," Mr. Pallone said, referring to the Communications-Electronics Command.
Mr. Pallone recently joined Mr. Gallo, Republican of Parsipanny, for a meeting at Fort Monmouth that drew more than 300 civilian workers.
At Picatinny, Mr. Gallo said, the staff's research and development expertise would be difficult to replace. Past attempts to relocate military bases have shown that few employees are willing to move, he said. He and other New Jersey lawmakers also stressed the state's strategic location as a mecca for universities and the advanced-technology industries.
"At a time when we are dealing with a shrinking military, I think a place like Picatinny becomes much more important," Mr. Gallo said. "Because you are looking to give those in the service the best capability in terms of new, hard-hitting weapons. And that is Picatinny's expertise."
 
County's Largest Employer
 Fort Monmouth, near Eatontown, is Monmouth County's largest employer. Picatinny is the second-largest employer in Morris County, after the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
Mr. Gallo said that closing Picatinny "would have a devastating effect on the economy of northern New Jersey and the region, frankly," because the impact would extend into parts of Pennsylvania and New York.
Transplanting Fort Monmouth to Alabama also would affect the entire community, said Frank Wyckoff, a spokesman for the Save Our Fort Committee and president of the Greater Eatontown Chamber of Commerce. With New Jersey in an economic slump, the region can little afford to lose close to 8,000 jobs, he said.
The ripple effect on businesses in Monmouth County and other regions, from retail stores to restaurants, could be severe, New Jersey lawmakers said. And the loss of military contracts could have dramatic consequences, they said. Picatinny awarded some $72 million in defense contracts to New Jersey companies last year. At Fort Monmouth, 1990 contracts totaled $63 million for New Jersey companies.
A 1990 study by the Pennsylvania Economy League estimated that closing the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard would cost the Delaware Valley region an estimated total of 35,000 jobs and $900 million in income.
 
Fight Led by Senators
 New Jersey members of Congress, led by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg and his fellow Democratic Senator, Bill Bradley, fought to maintain Federal financing for the naval yard's Service Life Extension Program. The program allows the yard to rebuild 30-year-old aircraft carriers and extend their life for 15 to 20 years.
But the yard may well end up on the Pentagon's base closing list, said Mr. Andrews, who warned that "the signals were not good" during a recent meeting that he and other members of Congress from the region had with Susan Livingstone, Assistant Secretary of the Army.
New Jersey lawmakers are hoping for an ally in former Representative Jim Courter, a Republican from Montclair, who is chairman of President Bush's eight-member Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which will review the Pentagon list and offer its own recommendations to the President. Mr. Courter, at least, is familiar with the state's defense structure, his former colleagues said. During the last round of base closings, initiated in 1989, Mr. Courter strongly opposed cutbacks at Fort Dix.
But Mr. Courter told the Senate during his confirmation hearing in March that he and the commission would be "totally objective and nonpartisan." And Mr. Rauner, at the Pentagon's Office of Economic Adjustment, warned that with a 25 percent reduction in force, some bases would simply have to go.
 
Need for Cuts Acknowledged
 New Jersey lawmakers acknowledge that the defense budget needs paring. A freshman Representative, Dick Zimmer, Republican of Flemington, who ran on a "no new taxes" platform, said he would support the process as long as it is fair and objective and allows input from Congress.
Unlike some lawmakers, Mr. Zimmer said, he believes that forming a nonpartisan base closing commission was a good idea.
"Congress would not have had the will to close bases through the traditional process, and in fact hadn't been able to close a single one for 12 years," he said.
But many lawmakers are frustrated by the sense that New Jersey has been unfairly singled out. New Jersey already absorbed the loss of basic training at Fort Dix, they argue, and now faces more cutbacks while the South appears to gain.
Fort Dix also has been the target of lobbying efforts by New Jersey lawmakers who would like to see the fort's basic training mission restored. Mr. Lautenberg introduced legislation in February calling on the Defense Secretary and the Base Closing Commission to consider regional balance in deciding which bases should close.
 
Favoritism Is Seen
 "There clearly is favoritism to the South and the West, and some of that is Congressional politics," Mr. Andrews said, adding that the Defense Department had undoubtedly felt pressure from those regions' influential members of Congress. Economics may also play a role, speculated some New Jersey residents who cited high costs of living costs in the Northeast.
Mr. Rauner admitted that the nation's newer bases tended to be in the South and that older bases like those the Northeast tended to be more expensive to operate. But Army officials insisted that base closings and cutbacks would take place throughout the nation.
"Every post in the United States is being looked at," said the Army Secretary, Mr. Stone, in his recent meeting with New Jersey lawmakers. "New Jersey, I can assure you, has not been singled out."
Pentagon officials were also optimistic about the region's ability to recover. At the Office of Economic Adjustment, which advises communities on how to recover from base closings, Mr. Rauner said the vast majority of military towns came back even stronger than before, with more diversified economies.
But New Jersey members of Congress say they are as concerned about national defense as they are about the state's economy. And even if the region's bases appear on the April 15 closing list, New Jersey lawmakers said, they have vowed to continue lobbying.
"We really see the 15th of April as the beginning of the fight, not the end," Mr. Andrews said.

HEADLINE: Florio Plan to Sell Roads Is Criticized

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
GOV. JIM FLORIO's plan to to cut the projected $800 million state budget deficit in half by selling state highways to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority is drawing criticism from financial analysts, urban policy experts and a growing number of legislators, including some influential Democrats.
The proposal, critics say, is at best bad planning and at worst illegal because it would require the Turnpike Authority to spend bond money raised specifically for maintenance and widening of the superhighway and its feeder roads. 
 Critics also call the plan a thinly veiled tax increase that will ultimately result in even higher tolls for turnpike users and will perhaps necessitate tolls on previously free roadways. At the same time, they say, the state's credit rating will suffer as investors lose confidence in the Florio administration's ability to balance the budget without resorting to such drastic measures as mortgaging highways.
Administration officials acknowledge that the proposal is a one-time effort to help balance the state's budget deficit, rather than a long-term solution. But while the proposal may be unusual, they say, it is not illegal and is not expected to result in any new tolls. And they argue that the state's credit rating continues to be among the best in the nation and should remain strong as the result of decisions made by Mr. Florio in his first 15 months in office.
The Turnpike Authority, an organization that receives no state funds, operates and maintains the 118-mile toll road that stretches from Ridgefield Park in northern New Jersey to Pennsville in the south.
Critics predict that the authority will embrace the Governor's plan because the chairman, David Goldberg, and four of the five board members are Florio appointees. Officials of the authority have declined to comment on the proposal.
The controversy comes in the wake of increases of 70 to 100 percent in turnpike tolls that have forced commuters to dig deeper into their pockets and have sent truckers searching for alternative routes through or around New Jersey. At the same time, the proposal has provided yet another rallying point for Republican officeholders hoping to sustain voter unrest through 1992, when the entire Legislature is up for re-election.
"I think this is the dumbest scheme to hoodwink the taxpayers of the state of New Jersey that I ever heard of," said the Assembly minority leader, Garabed Haytaian, Republican of Hackettstown. "You don't close a budget gap for one year by using smoke and mirrors."
Mr. Haytaian, along with the Senate minority leader, John H. Dorsey, Republican of Boonton Township, and other Republican legislators recently held what they called a town meeting in the East Brunswick Public Library to air their views on the issue.
 In addition, some key Democratic legislators have expressed reservations with the plan.
The Senate president, John A. Lynch, Democrat of New Brunswick, said last week that he feared it was inevitable that tolls would be charged on roads taken over by the Turnpike Authority. He said the state budget should not be balanced by passing new tolls onto the public.
And in the State Assembly, George A. Spadoro, Democrat of Edison, along with several other Democratic Assembly members, recently questioned the legality of the sale. Mr. Spadoro, who is chairman of the Assembly Transportation Authorities, Telecommunications and Technology Committee, said his committee would hold hearings on the proposal this month.
 The proposal, which was first made public by Mr. Florio in his budget address in January, calls for the sale of a number of state-owned roads to the Turnpike Authority for $400 million. Officials have not yet specified which roads would be sold but expect to submit a formal proposal to the authority in the next few weeks.
A special report, written by Mr. Haytaian and Mr. Dorsey for the East Brunswick meeting, said that the highways under consideration included the full length of Interstate 295 and a stretch of Interstate 95 between the turnpike's northern terminus in Ridgefield Park and the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee.
Also being considered, the report said, are roads that are still on the drawing board, including Route 92 between Routes 1 and 130 in central New Jersey, and proposed access ramps from the turnpike to Liberty State Park in Jersey City.
The roads would be paid for with a portion of the $2 billion the Turnpike Authority raised in 1985 through the sale of bonds. All the money was originally earmarked for widening and improvement programs on the turnpike.
Since 1985, however, only $700 million has been spent, with $900 million held in reserve for continuation of that work. The remaining $400 million would be used for the purchase of the state roads.
Some financial experts, however, say the money should either be retained by the Turnpike Authority or used to retire part of the outstanding debt on the bonds.
"I don't see any fundamental economic justification for this proposal," said David O. Zenker Jr., senior vice president in the bond department of Oppenheimer & Company, a New York investment house. "From a political point of view, though, it's kind of clever."
 Mr. Zenker said money raised to improve services on the turnpike should be used specifically for that purpose. "They borrowed this money to allow for future growth of the turnpike," Mr. Zenker said. Recent toll increases, he said, reflect both increases in operating expenses and the continuing obligation to pay interest on the bonds.
If the $400 million is used as Governor Florio has proposed, Mr. Zenker said, the money would not improve turnpike services, but instead would increase the Turnpike Authority's liabilities by expanding maintenance responsibilities to the new roads.
"Transferring the cost of those roads to the Turnpike Authority is essentially a regressive tax on turnpike drivers," he said. "What you're doing is placing the burden on those who use the turnpike as opposed to spreading it across the state."
Moreover, Mr. Zenker said, changing the use of the bond proceeds could have a negative effect on the state's otherwise excellent credit rating.
 
Bond Outlook Changed
 "Using turnpike funds for transparent budget fixes jeopardizes the borrowing integrity of both the turnpike authority and the State of New Jersey," he said.
Indeed, the Standard & Poor's Corporation, a credit-rating concern, while continuing the state's AAA rating, recently changed its outlook from "stable" to "negative."
"The outlook is an indication of where we think ratings are going over the next 18 to 36 months," said Arthur J. Grisi, senior vice president of Standard & Poor's municipal finance department.
The negative outlook, Mr. Grisi said, is the result of a number of factors, including the general downturn in the economy, the state's looming budget deficit and the Florio administration's proposal to sell state property to raise cash.
"Going forward with proposals like selling $400 million worth of roads is uncommon for the State of New Jersey," Mr. Grisi said. "This is clearly a shift from the conservative fiscal approach the state has had in the past."
 
Effect on Credit Rating
 Mr. Grisi said that Standard & Poor's was basing its rating and outlook on the presumption that the proposed sale is a one-time revenue item, meaning that any budgetary benefits would be short-lived.
"Indeed, the state will need to replenish the $400 million somewhere into the 1993 budget," he said.
Moreover, Mr. Grisi said, the proposal could have an impact on the Turnpike Authority's credit rating.
"We certainly need to review the current status of turnpike ratings if this $400 million proposal works the way the Governor is proposing," he said. "It certainly isn't going to impair their ability to finance, but they could come under some pressure."
State Treasurer Douglas C. Berman acknowledged that the proposal amounts to no more than a one-time infusion of revenue into the state treasury, but said that such measures must sometimes be used in difficult economic times.
"Real-world problems demand real solutions," he said.
 
Alternatives Are Welcomed
 The administration, he said, has done everything in its power to balance the budget by cutting spending to a point where there is nothing left to cut. Critics of the turnpike proposal, he said, are welcome to suggest other ways to make up the expected $800 million shortfall.
"What is the alternative?" he said. "Do they want more in layoffs? Do they want to not fund the Property Tax Relief Program this year?"
The fact that the state's credit rating has remained at AAA despite its fiscal difficulties, Mr. Berman said, is proof that the credit agencies believe that the administration is acting responsibly.
But beyond economics, critics are also questioning the legality of the administration's proposal.
"There are a number of troubling questions surrounding this issue," State Senator Dorsey said. The Turnpike Authority, he said, may be legally prohibited from taking money raised for capital improvements and using it for other purposes.
 
No Conclusion on Legality
 In a legal opinion prepared by the State Office of Legislative Services, Albert Porroni, the legislative counsel, said the legality of the proposed purchase could not be conclusively determined without knowing specifically which roads would be acquired.
Mr. Berman, however, said the administration was confident that the proposal would not violate any of the covenants contained in the bond prospectus.
"I think that people ought to wait to see how it's finally proposed to determine if it meets all of the legal and financial policy tests," Mr. Berman said. "We are confident that in the structure we are going to propose it, it will be perfectly legal."
And speculation regarding the imposition of tolls on whatever roads are ultimately sold is premature, he said. "Our expectation is that there will be no tolls."
 
A Responsibility to Help
 When asked what might motivate the Turnpike Authority to purchase non-toll roads that would cost money to maintain, Mr. Berman said the authority had a responsibility to help solve the state's fiscal difficulties.
"The turnpike is part of the state government," he said. "And helping the state out in this situation is part of an overall solution in which they will also gain a more rational road structure that makes sense."
 The Turnpike Authority recently hired a tax law firm to study the matter.
Critics, however, believe that the authority, will ultimately go along with the proposal.
"The Turnpike Authority has been captured by the Governor," said Dr. George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of city planning at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "The fact that the proposal makes no sense for the authority from a business perspective doesn't make any difference. It makes $400 million worth of sense to the Governor."

HEADLINE: Shifting Currents Affect Day Care in County

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
MORE parents are driving their young children to the office each morning as corporate-sponsored day-care programs proliferate in the county. At the same time, many day-care programs for the children of low-income workers are struggling as government subsidies are threatened. 
 "There are two currents in day care: one going out and one coming in," said Sally Ziegler, executive director of the Child Care Council of Westchester, an information and referral agency that also supervises home-based child-care programs in the county. "Going out is support for low-income families and coming in is corporate support. There is a whirlpool in the middle where a lot of parents are in trouble."
 
Corporate Efforts Grow
 Corporate-sponsored day care has been growing in Westchester since General Foods USA provided funds three years ago to help start the Phelps Child Care Center in North Tarrytown, an on-site day-care center for employees of the Phelps Memorial Hospital Center that was the first of its kind in the county.
General Foods has also joined the Nestle Foods Corporation, Gannett Westchester Rockland Newspapers and MONY Financial Services to renovate a wing of the Y.W.C.A. in White Plains as a child-care center for the companies' employees and the general public. The Avon Corporation has for the last year offered on-site day care for its employees in Rye.
The International Business Machines Corporation and Pepsico are jointly financing the $600,000 renovation of a newly purchased home for the Country Children's Center in Katonah, a few miles from their new corporate office buildings in Somers.
And at its South Westchester Executive Park in Yonkers, the Robert Martin Company is about to open another child-care center, the third in 18 months for the real estate-development company, which also operates centers in Hawthorne and Elmsford. In a program that is the first of its type in Westchester, the company operates the centers for use by the tenants of its corporate parks.
But the majority of working parents in Westchester have no access to corporate-sponsored day-care centers like these -- even if they could afford to use them. Weekly fees for infant care at the Robert Martin center in Elmsford, for example, are $182.
The high cost of living in Westchester, which often requires both parents to work, is responsible for the increased demand for day care, Mrs. Ziegler said. Despite the sluggish economy and the declining birthrate, the Child Care Council received 3,904 calls last year, 882 more than in 1989. Most were from parents with limited resources, and most were seeking infant day care.
 
Where Two Currents Meet
 "People have to work to live here," Mrs. Ziegler said. "If you are single and making $25,000 with three kids, in Westchester you are poor."
At the Country Children's Center, the two currents in day care come together. Forty-four preschool children attend the center, which until its new home is ready in September will continue using space in the Katonah United Methodist Church and nearby St. Luke's Episcopal Church. Most parents pay the full $130 weekly fee. But 16 families have been receiving government subsidies.
"There are not that many families in Katonah who need subsidies," said Polly C. Peace, director of the center. "But there are at least 20 percent more than we can even help."
 
Five Subsidies Eliminated
 Until the beginning of March, each of those 16 families received aid from Title XX, a Federal block-grant program that provides an array of social services to each state. Five weeks ago, the Country Children's Center was told that the income-eligibility requirements had been raised for the families. In 11 cases, the parents saw their subsidies reduced; in five cases, the state aid was eliminated altogether.
Unwilling to evict the families, the nonprofit Country Children's Center dipped into its reserve fund -- set aside to help pay the mortgage for the new property -- to provide scholarships for the five families who had lost their subsidies.
Last week, Annette Myers, the county's Assistant Commissioner of Social Services, said the county had made an error and the subsidies would be restored immediately.
Tuition was raised in January, Mrs. Peace said, and it may have to be raised again. The center is determined to provide room for families with limited resources, Mrs. Peace said, but "it makes it very expensive for other people."
 
'A Wonderful Blessing'
 "It was a wonderful blessing when we got this very large grant," Mrs. Peace said, discussing the financial contribution provided by I.B.M. and Pepsico for the center 's new site. "But ongoing, it doesn't do a thing for us. We have to pay the mortgage, and with these cuts at the government level, it's going to be difficult."
I.B.M. has provided $430,000 and Pepsico $170,000 to allow the Country Children's Center to convert a three-bedroom house into a center that will provide daytime care for 52 preschoolers, including infants. The house sits on a four-and-a-half-acre parcel that also has a pond and a barn, where the children and staff will be able to raise rabbits, incubate duck eggs and plant a garden, Mrs. Peace said.
Employees from I.B.M. and Pepsico will be given some priority for spaces, Mrs. Peace said, although details haven't been settled. The I.B.M. contribution to the center is part of a $22 million fund that the company established two years ago to to increase the availability of child-care services for its employees nationwide. The fund is the largest financial commitment made by any American corporation toward child care.
 
100 Years in Mt. Vernon
 Thirty miles south of Katonah, the Mount Vernon Daycare Center, a nonprofit operation, plans to celebrate its 100th anniversary this month. But its director is worried that this birthday may be the last.
Enrolled at the center are 100 children, 21 months to 5 years old, nearly all of whose parents receive state subsidies. Weekly care for children up to age 3 is $115, and $100 for the older children.
Government assistance to such centers is being jeopardized by state efforts to close an estimated $6.5 billion budget gap. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed that $50 million of the state's Title XX funds -- about a fourth of the total -- be shifted from discretionary uses to help pay for other, mandatory social services. Although the state is insisting that day-care services be maintained, county officials are not sure how they can comply without cutting other needed services.
"We are preparing for the worst scenario," said Linda Iglehart, director of the Mount Vernon center. Many of the parents are employed as bank tellers or home health aides, she said. "They are coming in and showing me their rents and leases and saying 'how do you expect me to pay?' "
 
A Push Toward Welfare?
 The paradox of the government cutbacks, she said, will be if the inability to pay for day care forces a parent to quit working and go on welfare.
"I'm going to help them, even if I have to go to corporate America and beg," Ms. Iglehart said. The center is now financed by parental fees, government subsidies and the United Way.
How county agencies will be able to maintain day-care programs with significantly less money is a question that perplexes the county's Social Services Commissioner, Mary E. Glass. The state, she said, "continues to mandate levels of service, and the money is simply not there."
The county is trying to get the state to clarify which day-care programs must be maintained despite expected fund reductions, the Commissioner said. But cuts must occur, she added, and so "it will be that much more difficult to assist the working poor."
 
Deeply Felt Consequences
 The consequences, she said, will be deeply felt. "These are the teachers and firemen who affect the fabric of Westchester," she said. "These are the people who make things tick."
One of them is Lisa M., a secretary at a Westchester hospital and the single parent of two preschool children. The young mother, who spoke only on the condition that her name not be published, takes home about $320 a week, of which she spends nearly half for child care.
Lisa said she has been grateful for the $30 weekly subsidy she received from Title XX, which helped her afford to send her son to the Mount Vernon Daycare Center.Last month, Lisa learned that she and 12 other parents at the center had lost their subsidies.
Last week the $30 was restored, when the county admitted it had made an error in ending the subsidy before a final agreement had been worked out with the state on what reductions would be permitted as the county responded to state budget cuts.

HEADLINE: St. Agnes Is Put on a Path To Self-Sufficiency

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
ST. AGNES HOSPITAL, an 85-year-old institution widely perceived to be at death's doorstep a few months ago, emerged last week from a series of consultations with a smaller staff, new medical roles and improved chances for a complete recovery.
John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, arrived here by helicopter on Monday to confirm his decision, taken against the advice, he said, of five independent financial assessments, that the 184-bed hospital remain open. 
 "This is one of the happiest days of my life, as last December was one of the saddest," Cardinal O'Connor said. On his earlier visit he had told the same gathering of doctors, nurses and staff members that the hospital would have to find a way to earn the $6 million it expected to get from the archdiocese this year or he would have to sell the institution.
 
250 Hours of Meetings
 "I didn't know which way to turn, except upward," the prelate said, recalling the 250 hours of meetings he said he had held in the four intervening months. Speaking slowly, with occasional flashes of wit and touches of emotion that had some staff members in tears, he described the difficulties he had faced before the "new affiliations" were completed.
Under the reorganization, St. Agnes will establish new links with the Westchester County Medical Center, referring tertiary, or specialized care, patients to the larger institution, which has a 95 percent occupancy rate, and getting the Medical Center's primary care cases in return.
St. Agnes will also become a teaching hospital, specializing in primary care, for New York Medical College, which is only four miles away on the county-owned Grasslands Reservation in Valhalla. The college will continue to use the Medical Center as its principal teaching hospital, providing medical students with experience in tertiary care.
 
A Bittersweet Taste
 The college, a "nonsectarian school in the Catholic tradition," as its dean, Dr. Karl Adler, describes it, will effectively take control of St. Agnes. The hospital's 17-member board is being replaced by a five-member board, three of whom are also college trustees. Both institutions are controlled by the Archdiocese of New York.
The Cardinal's visit, savored by doctors and staff members, had a bittersweet taste. His welcome message that the hospital would be given a chance to survive was coupled with a firm declaration that it would have to accomplish that goal on its own. "There will be no more archdiocesan money going into St. Agnes," he warned.
He had told the staff in his December visit that the hospital must find ways not only to earn the $6 million he estimated that it would need to break even this year, but also to show how it could repay at least part of the $9 million it owed the archdiocese and the $3 million it still owed suppliers.
"I hope that one thing has been learned," Cardinal O'Connor said to the assembled hospital employees: "That we do not have a bottomless well. The Archdiocese of New York is not a welfare state. We do not have any more money for St. Agnes, and consequently we have to do everything conceivable" to make the reorganization work.
Speaking to reporters after addressing the staff, he was even more direct, saying, "We no longer have any financial responsibility for St. Agnes under the new arrangement."
Asked how long he thought it would take for St. Agnes to become self- sustaining, Cardinal O'Connor said that Dean P. Gestal, the chairman of the new hospital board, "said he can do it in six months."
The Cardinal noted that "most of the financial estimates say if we could do it in 1992, it would be pretty fast work." Mr. Gestal, a private investor of Greenwich and a former general partner at Glickenhaus & Company, which he left in 1989, moved quickly and decisively in reducing expenditures, handing out some of the 60 to 80 termination notices planned before the day had ended.
He said he intended to reduce the staff of 600 by 10 to 12 percent. These included nurses, technicians, maintenance personnel and administrative employees -- every category except doctors, who are not considered employees.
The reorganization of St. Agnes, meanwhile, found welcome partners in the Medical Center and the college, each of which is involved in changes that complement the new affiliation.
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, introducing Cardinal O'Connor on Monday, said, "The county of Westchester, some time ago, offered to all hospitals in the region the ability to affiliate with our Medical Center, to assure that tertiary care would be available to everybody."
 
'Willing to Work With You'
 That effort has drawn some interest, but so far little enthusiasm. Edward A. Stolzenberg, the Acting County Commissioner of Hospitals, said the county had contacted the 42 hospitals of the Hudson Valley region -- Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties -- but that only 12, including St. Agnes, had responded.
"We said 'we're willing to work with you in planning services for your area,' services they might not have, such as handling trauma cases," he said. "We're overloaded and a lot of hospitals are nearly empty. We have to find ways to work with community hospitals to build up their services, so they can retain their patients and send us only those who need specialized care."
Mr. Stolzenberg noted that "hospitals are always nervous about other hospitals' involvement, wondering if a big teaching hospital will gobble them up."
The Medical Center's goal, he said, is to "use our space and St. Agnes's space more effectively."
"We'll be referring a lot of the primary patients who fill up our beds, and who come to us from a variety of sources -- emergency rooms, clinics, doctors -- to St. Agnes, and that will give us the room to take in the patients we really should be taking care of."
 
AIDS Center Designation
 Mr. Stolzenberg said that the County Medical Center is "an AIDS center and the only one licensed by the state as such in the Hudson Valley region that we serve." Now St. Agnes will also apply to the state to be designated an AIDS center, he said, "and will probably have a 20- to 25-bed clinic for that purpose." He said the Medical Center would take "tertiary-care AIDS patients, those requiring brain or heart surgery."
Mr. Stolzenberg said he expected that St. Agnes, working with the Medical Center "in areas of unmet community needs, would also be providing obstetrical care for Medicaid mothers, which is a crisis in Westchester because hospitals are turning poor women away."
Other areas that he said would be considered for St Agnes are pediatrics, geriatrics and drug-abuse treatment.
 
'Triage Based on Disease'
 Mr. Stolzenberg said the Medical Center was not seeking to increase its revenues by shedding primary-care patients for the more highly reimbursed medical procedures. "This is triage based on disease," he said. "We are a county facility, with 40 percent of our caseload Medicaid cases. For a hospital like ours, staffed and equipped to take care of very, very sick patients, it is not economical to treat patients who are not very sick."
The Medical Center budget for this year is $250 million, he said, "of which we raise $232 million."
The $18 million difference is made up through county taxes. "But it's been fairly steady in recent years," Mr. Stolzenberg said. "And it reflects services we provide the county, such as burn care, that a private hospital might not take on."
Dr. Adler, the dean of the medical college, said the new affiliation with St. Agnes was "timely" because "a major part of medical education throughout the country right now emphasizes primary care."
He said students would continue to get training in primary care at other hospitals, mostly in New York City, but the emphasis would now be on St. Agnes.
 
Convenient Training
 "It is much more convenient with a large class to have the hospital training nearby," Dr. Adler noted, as has been the case in tertiary care at the adjacent Medical Center, "as well as using community physicians."
Dr. Vincent Nicolais, president of the St. Agnes medical staff, said that the changes would provide an academic setting for the hospital's physicians.
"Previously, if you were a physician and wanted access to higher training or newer techniques," he said, "you would have to go to conferences. Now, affiliated with the medical college, you have the means for improvement at your fingertips."
 The reorganization follows a difficult four-month period as the hospital saw its occupancy rate dip below an already low 73 percent, in part a result of the decision by Kaiser Permanente, a health-maintenance organization with 32,000 members in Westchester, to cancel its contract with St. Agnes.
Paige Stetson, a spokeswoman for St. Agnes, said, "Kaiser represented 20 percent of our business. They said the prime reason for ending the contract was the uncertainty of St. Agnes's future."
 
Delays Hurt Reputation
 The uncertainty had been growing through the 1980's, with the hospital delaying the purchase of new equipment because of financial problems created by the cost of building a new medical services building.
The modern equipment has since been bought but the delay did not help the hospital's reputation. St. Agnes also suffered the loss through death or retirement of a dozen of the hospital's most active primary-care physicians in the 1980's. They had referred patients to the hospital's specialists, and without those referrals, the occupancy rate declined.
Only 60 to 80 of the 480 doctors on the staff admitted a majority of their patients to St. Agnes, a situation that Dr. Nicholai predicted would change dramatically now.
"We had physicians referring their patients to wherever they wanted to refer them; there was no structure," he said. "Doctors would rent office space at St. Agnes, seeing their outpatients on the grounds but referring them to White Plains Hospital or United in Port Chester or any of the other primary-care hospitals where they also had affiliations.
"With the medical college controlling St. Agnes through a new board of trustees, those doctors will now have a greater incentive to use St. Agnes for primary care or the medical center for tertiary care."
The incentive would be continuing to rent space at St. Agnes. Some doctors, anticipating the new referral patterns, have already left.

Senior Thesis Debated: Enrichment or Torture?

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Huddled over their computers and encirled by stacks of books in the Firestone Library, bleary-eyed Princeton University seniors are scrambling to complete within the next week or so the hallmark of their "Princeton experience": the thesis, a research paper on the order of a Ph.D. dissertation.
But if some professors and administrators have their way, this 66-year-old mandatory rite of passage will become optional, enabling both faculty members and students to put their time to better use, they say.
The subject has been debated by faculty members, especially in the larger departments, since the fall, when Sheldon M. Garon, last year's director of the senior seminar program, recommended expanding the seminar program at the expense of the thesis requirement.
 
A Trade-Off Is Suggested
 
 Lawrence Stone, an emeritus professor of English history, wrote in The Princeton Alumni Weekly on March 20 that the "only practicable way of offering more undergraduate-level seminars is to make a trade-off in which some existing forms of instruction are cut back."
"In my view," he asserted, "the prime target for such a trade-off is the compulsory senior thesis."
Richard G. Williams, associate dean of the college, said he would favor an optional senior thesis, since 10 to 30 students each year do not graduate on time because they have problems with their theses. But he expressed doubt that the thesis could be eliminated without a bitter controversy, especially considering that the university's president, Harold T. Shapiro, is among its staunchest supporters.
"The thesis can be an important experience, but on the other hand I know that for some people it defines that experience in a very painful way," Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Garon, a professor of Japanese history, said he believed the importance of the senior thesis had been greatly overemphasized. It should be a requirement only for students who wish to graduate with honors, the practice at most colleges, he said in an interview.
 
Results Called Dubious
 "The thesis demands enormous amounts of faculty and student time, and the results in many cases are not worth the effort," Mr. Garon said. He added that all too often theses did not involve primary research and failed to make an original contribution to their field.
Mr. Garon said that in his experience as departmental representative, the mandatory thesis had injured all attempts to make innovations in the curriculum, particularly at the senior level, because students were so consumed with their theses that they ignored their classes.
"I discovered, to my frustration, that very few seniors wanted to take the seminars, even though we have a highly motivated faculty," Mr. Garon said. "Probably they thought it would interfere with their theses, or worse, they wanted a degree without ever challenging themselves intellectually." The eight interdisciplinary seminars are now in their second year.
Mr. Garon, who has been informally sampling colleagues' opinions on the subject, said he believed the faculty "overwhelmingly supports" his position. But he is quick to add that it may take months, if not years, to make a change.
 
The Ultimate Challenge
 In the past, faculty members have viewed the thesis as the ultimate challenge to students to bring together the knowledge and skills they have gathered in the previous three years and make an original contribution to their field of study.
"I have always believed that the most important part of an education is to think deeply about a single issue," said President Shapiro, a professor of economics. "In that respect, the experience of the senior thesis is really an invaluable one."
Walter F. Murphy, a professor of politics for 32 years, put it more bluntly, "To give up the senior thesis would be somewhat like playing the Super Bowl and then, sometime in the fourth quarter, blowing the whistle and saying, 'Game over.' "
Gray Tuttle, a senior from Birmingham, Ala., who wrote a collection of poems as his thesis, said his senior independent work gave him an unusual opportunity to pursue his particular interests under the guidance of a thoughtful adviser.
But with classes and a job search to cope with, many other seniors find the pressure of the thesis aggravating, if not unbearable.
"It is a very valid exercise, but it would take much of the stress and strain off professors and students if it were optional," said Laura Fortner, a senior from Setauket, L.I., majoring in East Asian studies.

Chinatown: More Than Restaurants

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
Manhattan's Chinatown is for the adventurous shopper who delights in a treasure hunt and considers a babel of foreign dialects -- Shanghai-ese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Fukienese, Toisan and more -- music to the ear.
Chinatown is hustle: vendors hawking umbrellas, children's pajamas, pancakes filled with fried scallions. It is also bustle: people jostle one another in the streets and don't bother to excuse themselves in any dialect. 
 Some sights are predictable: the roasted ducks hanging in the windows, for example, or the cars double-and triple-parked for lack of spaces.
But Chinatown is mainly about flux. As new immigrants from China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Thailand move in, each day brings change. For the shopper who prizes serendipity, the change is revealed in unfamiliar products: a porcelain fishbowl with painted carp inside, or oolong tea at more than $100 a pound.
The heart of Chinatown is Canal Street. The N, R, No. 6, J and M subway lines stop at Canal Street near Broadway. From there, walk east from Broadway toward the Bowery.
 
Delicious Finger Foods
 The sidewalks are lined with one of the area's prized resources: the vendors who sell delicious finger foods at recession prices. Fifty cents buys a plump steamed bun, three inches in diameter, filled with cabbage and ground pork; or a rolled wide rice noodle made with dried shrimp and scallions, or a scallion-filled pancake six inches across, fried to golden crispness.
"Many of the food vendors are from Wenzhu, an old seaport on the coast south of Shanghai where the people have a history of going overseas," said Peter Kwong, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at Old Westbury, L.I., and the author of "The New Chinatown" (Hill & Wang, 1987).
Armed with pushcart licenses, the vendors prepare their ingredients at home and cook them on the street. To find the best food, look for the carts with the largest crowds of eager, noisy customers.
For more substantial fare, there is Kam Man, one of the neighborhood's most popular supermarkets. In addition to addictively juicy strips of barbecued pork, soy-sauce squab and roasted duck, the two-floor market sells homemade joong, which are to the Chinese what tamales are to Mexicans. Inside the lotus-leaf wrapper is a mixture of glutinous rice, black beans, a Chinese sausage, black mushrooms and pork. There are also joss sticks, teas and dried plums. Kam Man is at 200 Canal Street, near Mulberry.
 
Tea and Ginseng
 Where there is Chinese food, there is also tea. Ocher-colored tins hold a dozen varieties of tea at Ten Ren Tea and Ginseng Company at 176 Canal Street, near Mott Street. A pound of oolong can cost $7.20 to $118.80. "The difference is bitterness and sweetness," said Alfred Liu, a salesman at the store.
Wood cabinets also hold ginseng from Korea, the United States, China and the Soviet Union. A teak table designed for serving tea has a hole through its top with a container underneath for discarding tea leaves.
To brew the tea and cook the food, there are Chinese utensils like bamboo brushes for scrubbing woks and a cleaver that, held sideways, flattens a clove of garlic in a split second. A wide assortment of utensils is at Hong Chong Imports, 14 Bowery near Doyers Street.
 
24-Karat Treasures
 A literal treasure, found more readily in Chinatown than in uptown jewelry stores, is 24-karat gold, the soft, deep-yellow gold like that buried with pharaohs, fought over by pirates, and sewn into the hems of robes when the Chinese had to flee from one place to another. A tiny horse charm sells for $90, and a rectangle with a raised Chinese character that translates to "long life" sells for $240 at May Cheong Jewelry, 175 Canal Street near Mott Street.
Two old stores in Chinatown specialize in porcelains. Quong Yuen Shing at 32 Mott Street, near Bayard Street, was founded in 1891 by Lee Lok, who came to the United States from Canton. Today, the store, which has its original wood cabinetry, still sells porcelains -- and also tickets to Yankee baseball games and other events from a Ticketmaster machine.
 Nearby, at 26 Mott Street, is Wing On Wo & Company, which first sold porcelains in 1901. Large porcelain urns painted on the outside with peonies and inside with gold-colored carp, were originally used by the Chinese as fishbowls. Nancy Seid, the store's owner, suggests a different use for the reproductions, which sell for $350 to $650. "Put glass on the top and use it as an end table," she said.
At Pearl River China Resources Products Inc., a child might find joy in a plastic pencil box ($4) with four buttons that, when pushed, open four different compartments. For an adult who wants a note of Chinese sybaritism in the bedroom, there are shocking-pink silk comforters filled with silk wadding ($230 for one 70 by 80 inches). The store is on the second and third floors at 277 Canal Street, near Broadway.
For a different glimpse of Chinatown life, look skyward. Walking along Elizabeth Street north of Canal recently, Peter Kwong noticed dozens of pairs of navy blue slacks flying like pennants on a line stretched from a rooftop to a truck parked on the street.
When clothes are finished in the Chinatown garment factories, which are often in tenements that don't have elevators, the workers string a nylon cord from the factory roof to a truck across the street. The clothes, wrapped in plastic and placed on wire hangers, are then hung on the nylon cord. A gentle push from the workers on the roof sends the clothes sailing down the cord.
Occasionally a few fall on the ground, where another worker casually picks up the garments and shakes them out. A little dirt never hurt a pair of navy blue slacks.

Top U.K. Index Hits Peaks, Thrice

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The leading British stock-market index reached record closing highs last week on three successive days, as the London market rode a crest of optimism about lower interest rates, falling inflation and a relatively early end to the recession.
With the new highs, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index has managed to outperform the Dow Jones industrial average, which has stumbled twice in trying to break through its all-time closing high of 2,999.75. Since the beginning of the year, the Financial Times index 100 is up 18.7 percent, and the Dow is up 10 percent. Since Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, the British index is up 8.8 percent, and the Dow is down about a tenth of a percent. 
 But while the blue chip stocks are lagging on Wall Street, smaller United States stocks have matched the London rally. Both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index reached all-time highs last week.
With its performance, the London stock exchange has neared or exceeded the predictions of many European analysts for the full year. Michael Howell, the chief strategist for Salomon Brothers in London, has moved his year-end prediction of 2,750 for the Financial Times index to 3,000. UBS Phillips & Drew is leaving its year-end target at 2,500, but Mark Brown, the firm's chief British strategist, acknowledged that it might have to be raised soon. The index closed on Friday at 2,545.3.
The extra driving force that the British market seems to have over Wall Street comes from the prospect of greater cuts in interest rates. In addition, inflation in Britain is expected to decline more dramatically, with the "headline rate" -- the main inflation indicator -- projected to fall to 4 percent from its current 8.9 percent. And at least until recently, British stocks have had relatively low price-earnings ratios, and so the London market has been perceived to be a better value than many foreign stock exchanges.
In Britain, analysts seem to be regularly lowering their interest-rate estimates for the end of the year. At the end of 1990, S. G. Warburg was predicting the base rate, the key interest rate set by the Bank of England, would drop only as low as 12 percent by the end of 1991. A month ago the firm moved the prediction to 11 percent, and the estimates are now at 10 percent. The base rate itself was recently cut to 12.5 percent.
In the United States the key short-term interest rate, the Federal funds rate, is at 6 percent and is not expected to slip much further.
Most of the downward revisions in Britain have been prompted by the strong performance of the British pound in the European Monetary System. With the recent fall of the German mark, sterling has risen above the midpoint of its fixed trading range against the mark. This gives more leeway for lowering interest rates without pushing the pound through the bottom of the trading range.
But how much higher the stock market can go is an open question. George Hodgson, the chief equity strategist for Britain at S. G. Warburg in London, expects a consolidation soon but another surge in the second half of the year, when he believes data will show inflation falling and a recovery beginning. "We need decisive evidence not just that the economy is bottoming out but that it is turning up," he said, "and that is some time off."
And what can go wrong?
The decline in interest rates could be slower than is now expected. Merrill Lynch raised this warning in a recent analysis, suggesting that central banks may be willing to suffer a little more recession to squeeze out a bit more inflation. In addition, the relative attractiveness of the British market erodes as the rally persists. Mr. Brown of UBS said the overall earnings-per-share ratio is now around 13, "and the market no longer looks cheap."
In its survey of data through March 14, the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, a compilation of earnings expectations, concluded the British market was already overvalued. Since then the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index has jumped another 45 points, or 1.8 percent. The analysis also revealed considerable uncertaintyabout the outlook for earnings in the next 12 months. On balance, analysts are revising their earnings estimates downward for the next two years.
And then there is the political uncertainty. Prime Minister John Major must hold a general election by June 1992, but the timing is still in doubt. It could be as early as June of this year.
Mr. Howell of Salomon Brothers has done an analysis based on historical data that shows that the Financial Times index would be likely to fall 150 to 200 points when an election is called, or about 6 to 8 percent at current levels, if the leading parties are equal in the public opinion polls.
But he also argues that a lead by the Conservatives over Labor tends to temper the decline in the Financial Times index. If Mr. Major were to have an election this June, he figures, the market would drop 50 to 100 points because the Tories have been ahead in recent polls.

Compaq, MIPs and a Strategic Graphics Alliance 

When the Compaq Computer Corporation said last week it would form a strategic alliance with Silicon Graphics Inc., a manufacturer of computer work stations with powerful graphics capabilities, the numbers were small: only $185 million to be invested by Compaq. But at stake might be nothing less than the future of the $50 billion personal computer and work station market. A struggle is now emerging among six competing groups to set technical standards for the industry. Compaq and 20 other companies, including Digital Equipment, have formed a consortium based on a new family of microprocessors designed by MIPs Computer Systems in Sunnyvale, Calif. By choosing this standard, they are pitting themselves against International Business Machines, Intel, Motorola and other very big names. But Compaq's new alliance may give the MIPs group a technological edge. Further announcements are expected Tuesday.
 
Texans' Bid Kicks Up a Feud
 
It was pure Texas. Last year the Energy Services Company, a Dallas-based driller headed by Richard E. Rainwater, bought 58.6 percent of the Penrod Corporation. R.D Smith & Company, an investor group, owned the rest. Penrod is a drilling company once controlled by the Hunt family. Last week, Energy Services offered $8 a share to buy out its partner. But what started as negotiations turned into a feud. Energy Services, in a move most likely designed to sow dissension among the individual investors in the Smith group, offered to buy only 75 percent of their holdings. The offer "could be worth as much as double what they're offering for it," said James Rubin, an investor in the Smith group.

More Viewers, Fewer Ads
 
Even though viewership was up during the gulf war, the networks lost money. NBC said it lost $55 million on its war coverage, and last week CBS reported a $17 million loss in the first quarter of 1991. As a result, CBS will layoff 400 employees, about 4 percent of its work force. War and advertising, it appears, make strange bedfellows. "Advertisers didn't want to display their products between battle scenes," said Jib Fowles, a professor of media studies at the University of Houston, Clear Lake. But the losses to the networks are far from over. "People scan the television the way aborigines scan the horizon. They flip channels and never really watch anything. The advertisers know this and are backing away. They want more targeted media."
 
A Federal bankruptcy judge approved a $115 million offer last week from NBC's cable affiliate, Consumer News and Business Channel, for its rival, Financial News Network.
 
Dixon Draws Just Five
 
Don Dixon, the Texas real estate developer, led Vernon Savings Association, near Dallas, from obscurity into oblivion. When the regulators took control of the savings and loan in 1987, they found 96 percent of its loans past due. Losses to the association totaled $1.3 billion, which the taxpayers still must pay. Last December, Mr. Dixon was convicted of 23 counts of fraud, including defrauding regulators and illegally spending depositors' money to support his lavish life style, beach houses and companions. Mr. Dixon, who faced a sentence of 120 years and fines of $5.6 million, was sentenced last week by the United States District Court Judge A. Joe Fish to five years in prison. He could be out by 1992. He was also fined $600,000 and ordered to do 500 hours of community service. Judge Fish said that Mr. Dixon's misdeeds "were a far cry in my mind from the loss of a billion-dollar institution." He got off easy compared with Woody F. Lemons, Vernon's chairman, who received a 30-year term from a different judge a year ago.
 
Citibank: Shop, Shop, Shop
 
Citibank, the nation's largest bank, already has the world's biggest credit card operation. More than 30 million subscribers charge about $47 billion a year on their cards, adding about $1 billion a year to the bank's earnings. But once you have the customers, how do you get them to use their cards more frequently? Citibank has an answer. Buy something with a Citibank card and if you find it selling for less within 60 days, the bank will pay you the difference. With the Citibank card you do not have to shop around. There is a cap of $250 on each refund and a $1,000 cap for the year. The program boosted card use by 5 percent in tests. How much will the program cost? Experts think not much at all. With other refund programs, like extended warranties,less than 1 percent of all users ever file a claim.
 
Postwar Buyers Loyal to Honda
 
It was a terrible month for the automobile industry. For everyone except Honda, that is. Sales for the industry were down 10.6 percent for March, compared with last year. The big American makers did the worst: General Motors was down 12.3 percent, Ford was down 14.8 percent and Chrysler was off 18.3 percent. Sales of imports also declined but not by as much, and Japan's market share actually improved. The only bright spot for Detroit was Chrysler's better sales of minivans. And Honda? Its sales were up 10.2 percent for the month. "Obviously the idea that people would be buying American after the gulf war was a little off the mark," said Harvey Heinback, an automotive analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Hey Buddy, Spare a Little Loan?
 
The credit crunch is finally ending, according to the Federal Reserve last week. Only a fifth of the senior loan officers it surveyed at 58 American and 18 foreign-owned banks imposed tighter terms for business borrowers in the last six weeks. In January, a third had made it more difficult to borrow and last November, half the banks had hearts of stone. But some economists still question if there ever was a credit crunch. It all depends on how you read the data. "The decline in lending is not the disease, it's the symptom," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. And what is the disease? "A recession that varies from region to region and industry to industry." If you can't borrow in New York, try Chicago.
 
Jobs Get Scarcer Still
 
Another sign that the recovery is still more wish than reality: Unemployment jumped to 6.8 percent last month, from 6.5 percent in February. The gloomy news surprised many economists. "The numbers were about 50 percent worse than the consensus forecast," said Kermit Baker, chief economist at Chaners Economics. "It shows the path to recovery is not as smooth as some people hoped for." The service sector did better than manufacturing.
 
Gloom Lingers at the Factory . . .
 
Is the manufacturing economy starting to develop a little bounce? Not yet, if factory orders are any guide. They fell by 0.5 percent in February, according to the Commerce Department, following four straight months of even deeper declines. "The best you can say is that the sharp declines have faded out, but there's no sign of an upturn yet," said Lawrence Chimerine, a senior adviser to DRI Inc. "Indications are that the March numbers will be no better."
 
. . . And in Construction
 
Construction too remains mired in a slump. Last week, the Commerce Department announced that spending on new projects fell in February for the 11th straight month. New construction, one of the first sectors to go into recession, was down 0.1 percent following a decline of 2.8 percent in January.
 
 Where Doctors Fail to Tread
 
Not so long ago, doctors made house calls. Now many of them won't even treat the sick, at least if the sick are also poor. That is what the Physician Payment Review Commission told Congress last week. The advisory group said 44 states have trouble getting doctors to accept Medicaid patients. The reason: low fees. Medicaid, the joint Federal-state program for 27 million low-income Americans, pays physicians, on average, just 69 percent of what Medicare does. And Medicare pays less than most private insurers. Just raising Medicaid payments may not be enough to improve treatment. "Many patients come from areas where there are few if any physicians," said William B. Schwartz, a professor of medicine at Tufts University. Luring physicians to practice in these areas, mainly inner city and rural, will not be easy.

Russia Calls It Price Reform
 
For more than half a century, the Soviet government set prices -- all 25 million of them. Rents were last changed in 1928, bread prices in 1954. But last week, the government moved to close the widening gap between prices and production. It increased prices by 250 percent to 1,000 percent. "They call it price reform, but it is still a set of fixed prices. They're just fixed at higher levels," said Judy Shelton of the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, Calif. Market systems require prices to fluctuate with changes in supply and demand. "But these prices are not established by supply and demand. They have nothing to do with free markets and they won't produce more goods." The popular response to the price rises were riots and strikes.
 
Japan: Friendly, but Changing?
 
 Japan fears being shunned by the United States . So, when the gulf war ended, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu met with President Bush, and all was friendly. Japan, the Administration said, made progress on trade, and its surplus with the United States is down to a mere $41 billion last year. But is that progess? Yes and no. American exports to Japan have increased. "You have to look at what we're exporting and importing," said Clyde V. Prestowitz, head of the Economic Strategy Institute. "They're selling us high-value added, high-technology equipment and we're selling them commodities and agricultural products." Not much has changed.

Japan's Sleight of Hand in Trade . . . And Its Duty to U.S. Auto Workers

BYLINE: By EDWARD RENSHAW; Edward Renshaw is a professor of economics at the State University of New York at Albany.

 BODY:
The number of people working in automobile manufacturing in this country has shrunk more than 20 percent since 1978, and that includes employees at Japan's newly established operations here. Obviously, an even steeper decline has taken place at Detroit's Big Three.
That means Detroit will have fewer employees to fund its retiree benefits obligations. That is especially troubling because American companies are now paying for health-care benefits of retired men and women who contributed to Detroit's prosperity years ago. This is a burden that Japanese transplant companies don't have to shoulder because almost none of their employees are old enough to be eligible for retirement. 
 Skyrocketing health-care costs have made Detroit's burden a heavy one. In 1988 and 1989, the General Motors Corporation paid more than $1 billion in health-care costs for its retired employees. And the health-care retirement burden is almost certain to get worse as Detroit cuts middle management and strives to catch up with the Japanese in terms of automation.
So where is the money for these retiree benefits obligations to come from? Taxpayers could end up bearing some of the burden. Remember the Chrysler Corporation bailout in 1979. If Chrysler had gone out of business, taxpayers would have had to absorb more than $1 billion in Federally insured pension benefits to the company's retired workers.
In terms of health care, there is a way out: Congress could take a page from the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935. By that year, the increased use of cars and the effects of the Great Depression had slashed the number of railroad employees by more than 40 percent from the 1920's levels. Congress responded with an act implementing a system of retirement benefits for all railroad employees. The railroads and their employees were to be "taxed" uniformly to pay for those benefits. This act solved an important social problem -- rising unemployment coupled with the number of retired people with little income -- and helped to create a more level playing field for surviving railroads.
In these treacherous times, the best way to finance a similar system for auto industry health-care benefits would be to levy a uniform sales tax on all motor vehicles and parts sold in this country, including imports.
Taxing imported vehicles would prevent them from having an unfair cost advantage over Detroit's products and taxing parts would help to compensate for the fact that Japanese transplant companies -- by putting artificially high values on imported parts -- are able to largely avoid paying any corporate profit taxes to Washington.
Detroit's Big Three, which are now badgering Washington for special protection, might add this to their agenda. And labor might think about supporting them.

Japan's Sleight of Hand in Trade . . .

BYLINE: By KEVIN L. KEARNS; Kevin L. Kearns is a fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington.

 BODY:
America's trade deficit with Japan often serves as a rallying point against adversarial Japanese trade practices, but because of the gulf war, the Commerce Department's release of the 1990 trade figures passed almost unnoticed.
America's trade deficit with Japan fell substantially -- to $41 billion from $49 billion the year before -- and the gap stands far below 1987's record of $56 billion. 
 At first glance, it may seem that Japan is opening its protected market and that American industry is meeting the Japanese challenge. That certainly is the spin that American and Japanese officials are putting on the numbers. But first glances are deceiving.
As Tokyo knows -- and Washington must learn -- the "how much" of the deficit no longer tells the whole story. Just as important is trade composition -- what is being traded and where in the global Japanese production base it comes from.
American laissez-faire economists believe it doesn't matter whether a country sells $100 worth of computer chips or $100 worth of potato chips -- since the $100 earned is the same. But not all economic activity creates the same benefits. Making and exporting low-tech and agricultural products doesn't provide the same opportunities to generate wealth and spin off new industries as high-tech production and trade do. The $8 billion drop in the trade deficit masks disturbing trends.
Japan has cut the deficit in several ways. First, it has bought more from America. But the dollar volume of its exports of manufactured goods in most sectors has outpaced the growth in dollar volume of its manufactured imports from America. To offset the persistent deficits in manufacturing, Japan has expanded its purchases of commodities, which is not as good for the United States as manufactured or high-tech items.
Second, Japanese companies have located some assembly plants in the United States. These plants don't provide the same range of jobs or domestic content as their American counterparts, but they do improve the trade numbers by the amount of value added to essentially Japanese goods by American workers.
Finally, Japanese companies have moved assembly plants to countries other than the United States, allowing exports from the Japanese-owned production base to show up in those countries' trade figures and cutting the deficit attributable to Japan.
In Thailand, for example, 46 Japanese electronics companies have been established since 1985. Japan's consumer electronics exports to America fell sharply in the last two years, but exports of microwaves, videocassette recorders and color televisions from Japanese companies in Thailand have soared. Electronics exports from Japanese subsidiaries in other Asian countries and Mexico are also up dramatically.
In the last three years of declining deficits with Japan, the plight of critical American industries, relative to their Japanese competitors, has worsened. What do the statistics indicate about American exports? They say our economic future lies not in such goods as office machines, computers and electrical and power-generating machinery -- where, in spite of the fact that we sold more to Japan, the sectoral trade imbalances of the peak deficit year 1987 have actually expanded by more than $2.3 billion.
Although there have been some success stories in trade deficit reduction since 1987, the majority of the $15 billion improvement came in areas that raise as many questions as they answer. Apparently, the nation's future lies in its economic past: In lumber, for example, breakfast cereals, meat, fish and metal scrap -- where the trade surplus has expanded by $3.6 billion. Are we really a nation of scrap metal collectors and lumberjacks?
Laissez-faire theorists insist that what we make doesn't matter. But Japan and other trading partners do care about the composition of their economies, support particular industries and target American counterparts because they consider those industries to be engines of future growth.
In the past two weeks, the chief executives of the Detroit's Big Three automakers have met with President Bush about Japan's automobile cartels. And the head of the National Association of Manufacturers has written the President requesting a complete review of American-Japanese economic relations.
Our manufacturers know that the decline in the trade deficit with Japan is not an accurate measure of our nation's competitiveness vis-a-vis Japan. It is time for policy makers to stop trumpeting their putative trade successes, put economic ideology aside and look hard at the composition of trade.

HEADLINE: Technology;
A Faster Path to Finished Steel

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

DATELINE: NEW CARLISLE, Ind.

 BODY:
In a wide stretch of quiet farmland in northwestern Indiana, the Inland Steel Company is engaged in a joint venture with the Nippon Steel Corporation to produce finished steel using a new process that cuts manufacturing time to less than an hour, from about 12 days.
The process, in which unfinished steel coils are converted into high quality finished steel, is unique in North America. It is being hailed by some steel industry experts as the most advanced technique for producing high quality steel for the appliance, office furniture and automotive industries. 
 Inland, the nation's fourth-largest steel producer, has a great deal riding on the project, which it views as a means to create high quality steel cheaper and more quickly than any competitor. It is looking at the project as a way to help the company emerge from its worst tailspin in years.
Inland's 60 percent stake in the year-old plant here, known as I/N Tek, has so far cost $112 million alone, and there are still start-up expenses. Nippon has put up the rest of the money for the project.
Next to the I/N Tek plant is another joint venture in which both companies have a 50 percent stake in a state-of-the-art plant; this one will produce galvanized steel. Inland's stake in the plant, which will coat steel coils with zinc and nickel for the automobile industry, represents an additional $225 million investment.
Inland has been plagued with a number of operational problems in the last year, making the success of I/N Tek even more important.
A power failure late last year at a factory that produces bar products for the automobile industry caused production in that division to drop 40 percent. And Inland is still losing money from start-up problems with a new processing center at the company's steel distribution unit on the south side of Chicago that began operating last year.
All of that, coupled with the current depressed conditions in the steel industry, has caused Inland's results to plunge to their lowest level since the industry's depressed days of the mid-1980's. The company reported a net loss of $20.6 million for all of last year on sales of $3.87 billion, compared with net income of $120 million on sales of $4.1 billion in 1989. The company's stock has fared badly, slipping to $19.375, from around $48 two years ago and $35 last summer.
Inland has bet heavily on large investments in high technology mills, the star of which is the I/N Tek joint venture.
The expenditures and investments have been "a lot for us to assimilate," said Frank W. Luerssen, the company's chairman and chief executive. "And sometimes we look back and ask ourselves if it was appropriate to do it with such rapidity since it's a risky thing to do and we've suffered through the process. But I suspect that people sitting here two, three or four years from now will look back and say that it was the right thing."
The I/N Tek plant is being watched closely by the industry because it takes the cold-mill steelmaking process and moves it from the traditional batch approach, in which batches of steel are moved through the process one by one, and replaces it with a continuous process.
The I/N Tek mill, which is based on technology designed and manufactured by Nippon, weaves coils of steel through a mill the length of seven football fields. It takes what the industry calls "hot bands of steel," the unfinished coils produced in the company's steelmaking plant 55 miles north of here, and cleans, thins, softens and finishes the metal to enable it to be cut and shaped to customers' specifications for such things as washers, dryers, file cabinets and automobile doors and fenders.
In the first step of the process, coils of steel go through what is called a pickling mill, a cleaning in a bath of weak hydrochloric acid that strips the steel of any rust and dirt. From there, the steel goes through a tandem mill, a series of giant rollers that reduce a half-mile strip of steel an eighth of an inch thick to a 64th-of-an-inch-thick sheet two miles long.
Next, the sheets of steel move into an anealing process, a furnace that reheats the metal to develop the metallurgical properties that make steel malleable instead of brittle.
In the traditional annealing process, coils of steel are heated by large cones that are placed on top of the coils. This causes the edges of the coils to be hotter than the interior, which can lead to lack of uniformity in the finished steel.
But in the I/N Tek process, the sheets of steel are threaded continuously through a 10-story furnace heated to 1,470 degrees Fahrenheit, resulting in uniform heating and a more consistent finished product. The sheets then go into a temper mill, where they are flattened and smoothed before being inspected for quality by a computer.
Throughout, the process is controlled by computers and other high tech equipment, which further assures uniformity and quality, the plant's operators said.
The result is what many industry experts contend is the highest quality finished steel produced anywhere.
Traditionally, this cold-mill process involved physically moving the steel coils in batches from one site to another, which could take as long as two weeks and required as many as 500 employees, compared with the 200 working in nonadministrative jobs at the I/N Tek plant here.
"The I/N Tek facility is clearly a leader in technology," said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. "It will save production costs because you don't have to start and stop the process, like you do in a conventional processing plant. There is no waste of energy and labor."
Also, Inland has the advantage of having just one steel-producing mill -- compared with the three of the USX Corporation and the four of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation -- to provide the unfinished coils of steel. That plant, perched on the Indiana shores of Lake Michigan, is just 55 miles by rail to the north and uses up-to-date continuous casting technology.
Using the two plants in tandem is expected to give Inland a real advantage.
But none of the investment will help the company much unless the market for steel improves. Analysts, and even Inland officials, expect 1991 to be the toughest year the steel business has seen since 1986. Orders were down 35 percent in February from the similar period last year. And steel prices are now 10 percent lower on average than they were a year ago.
Under these conditions, a price increase at Inland is probably unlikely. And some analysts have criticized Mr. Luerssen's strategy, saying that Inland will need to charge customers higher prices to recoup its investment in the joint venture plant here. "Although the joint venture will lower operating costs, the total cost of production, including interest and depreciation will be higher," said Charles A. Bradford, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc. "They seem to be banking on users of steel paying more for higher quality products," Mr. Bradford said. "And in this economic environment, I don't know how realistic that is."
Still, Mr. Luerssen is optimistic. "Even though we turned in a bad year, we're taking steps to get back into profitability. There is no doubt that this project is the right thing for this company," he said of the new plant. "We will recover from this."

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Why the Privacy Issue Will Never Go Away

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

DATELINE: BURLINGAME, Calif.

 BODY:
"It's astonishing the things you can do on a desktop computer in five minutes, which five years ago would have taken overnight computer runs on a mainframe," said Charles W. Stryker, president of Trinet America Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., which provided the data for Marketplace: Business, a listing of American business that the Lotus Development Corporation offered, then withdrew, last year.
Trinet America and its parent, American Business Information Inc. of Omaha, subsequently brought out their own versions of Marketplace: Business, called Lists-on-Disk, for I.B.M. personal computers and compatibles. 
 Business Lists-on-Disk, which costs $750 for a year's license, contains general factual information on 9.2 million private and public businesses, including name and address, a description of the primary line of business, the number of employees, the key purchasing executives, information on ownership and estimated or actual revenues. Using Lists-on-Disk, a marketing company would be able to get accurate names, addresses, contacts and phone numbers for, say, all the advertising agencies in St. Louis, or all the accounting firms in the Southwest.
Lotus withdrew Marketplace: Business at the same time it canceled its plans to introduce Marketplace: Households, a CD-ROM product that contained names, ages, addresses, marital status, estimated income range, buying habits and other data on 120 million citizens, based on United States Census and consumer credit data gathered by Equifax Inc., one of the nation's big credit bureaus.
But such programs will not go away, because personal computers and CD-ROM disks allow small businesses to contact their customers with laser beams instead of shotguns, saving on production costs and greatly increasing chances of success.
Marketplace: Households promised to give small companies and individuals the same access to consumer marketing information that bigger and wealthier companies have long enjoyed. A small business hoping to send an advertising flyer directly to the potential customers most likely to buy their products could create a model of its ideal customer using Marketplace guidelines, and, as quickly as one could say Big Brother, list thousands of names of real people who most closely fit the model.
 Even though Marketplace: Households is dead, the debate over the relationship between personal computers and privacy continued at the First Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy, a meeting here sponsored by a group called Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. The conference, which ended on March 28, attracted about 400 participants from organizations as diverse as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, TRW Information Systems and Services, and the Legion of Doom, a loosely knit group of young computer enthusiasts who have been accused by various law-enforcement agencies of such activities as breaking into computer systems and stealing documents and codes.
"We are going to confront many more debates like Lotus Marketplace in the years ahead," said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Washington office of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.
Businesses' desire for such highly targeted marketing lists is also undeniable. "We're moving into a world of much more specialized niches and personalized products," said Tom Mandel, director of the values and lifestyles program at SRI International of Menlo Park, Calif., a market research and consulting concern. "We're in a more slowly growing consumer economy, so there is more pressure on businesses to find good consumers."
A key difference between Marketplace: Households and Lists-on-Disk is that American Business Information contacted all the businesses to verify data before listing them. A.B.I. culled business listings from 5,000 Yellow Page phone books, and called each one, Mr. Stryker said. He said 85 percent of the companies agreed to provide information beyond verification of basic data. For those that declined to provide revenue figures, Trinet provided estimates based on industry averages for the number of employees.
While businesses were contacted about being listed, people listed in Marketplace: Households were not notified. Your name, dear reader, was probably in the Marketplace data base, which was drawn from Equifax's data base of 80 million American households. And chances are that you probably did not consent to the inclusion of your name. Rather, you provided the information for other purposes, like applying for a credit card or a mortgage, or filling out a warranty card for an appliance.
Executives of Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass., and Equifax, based in Atlanta, canceled the program after months of increasingly vigorous protests from consumers. More than 30,000 people, in what may have been the first grass-roots, personal computer-based consumer protest, contacted Lotus to voice their concerns that Marketplace: Households represented an abuse of private information.
"We don't have any plans to get back in that business," said John A. Ford, assistant vice president for corporate affairs of Equifax, a billion-dollar multinational credit and information bureau. "We believe the decision to stop development was a socially responsible one. We are concerned about the balance between the needs of businesses and individuals' concerns over privacy."
According to a Louis Harris & Associates poll commissioned by Equifax, the majority of consumers do not object to the use of their names in secondary mailing lists so long as they are given the option of removing their names from the list. The process of removing one's name is called "opting out." But critics of Lotus's Marketplace: Households noted that because the program was encoded on a CD-ROM disk, which is not eraseable, consumers could not opt out or correct erroneous information once it was encoded. Such changes would have to await the creation of a new disk.
 Lotus and Equifax officials said the program was misunderstood. It did not allow users to seek information on specific individuals. One could not ask for information on George Bush, for example. But ask for a list of executive males who earn at least $200,000 a year, live on the East Coast and carry an American Express card (even if it is just for identification) and presto!: The list would include George Herbert Walker Bush, age 65, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington.
 "Your privacy is a commodity and it has a value," said Esther Dyson, editor of the newsletter Release 1.0. "I'm a big fan of people owning data about themselves." She said was sorry Lotus had abandoned Marketplace "before the issue of 'ownership' of private information was debated."

Long and Short, the Bond Fund Gap

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
As a general rule, short-term bond funds react more quickly to changing interest rates than long-term funds. After a lag, the yields on long-term funds follow.
That hasn't happened recently. When short-term interest rates began to fall last year, long-term rates held their ground or even moved up. That may have reflected concerns about the weakness of the United States economy, said Stephen A. Schoepke, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services Inc., in Summit, N.J. 
 Whatever the reason, the current yield difference is unusually wide. Eventually, long-term rates should tumble. And for investors, this means "a good possibility of long-term bond fund price advances," Mr. Schoepke said.

 BODY:
WHEN IT COMES to technology in education, "it's hard to use a crystal ball because the technology is changing every 18 months," said Sam Petruso, coordinator of computer services in the Mill Creek Township School District in Pennsylvania. Still, Mr. Petruso has engaged in a fair amount of crystal-gazing of late, equipping his district's elementary schools with computers, laser disks, compact-disk players, 8-millimeter video camcorders, videocassette recorders and Sony Watchman televisions.
Only a small number of schools nationwide have gone so wholeheartedly into high-technology education. But more and more schools are eyeing the field and sallying forth. The problem for educators, as Mr. Petruso notes, is understanding the new and emerging technologies and the promise they hold, so as to tap the best ones for classrooms of the present and future. 
 As usual, the technology is expected to progress much faster than the ability of schools to pay for it. New technologies are always expensive, and schools and legislators will continue to struggle to find innovative and equitable ways to pay for advanced educational tools, such as the following.
COMPUTERS: The heart of education's technological transformation is the computer, an information-processing and -transferring engine comprising several components, including working and storage memories, video displays and input devices.
One measure of computer processing power is a MIP, for millions of instructions per second. Some of the personal computers used in businesses have about 20 MIP's as against educational computers' measly 1. But 100-MIP personal computers are expected in a few years. More MIP's create opportunities for technologies such as video, speech and handwriting recognition, and realistic simulations of, say, chemical reactions.
The physical form of computers is also evolving, with notebook and hand-held computers becoming more common. Eventually, computers may be integrated into every student's and teacher's desktop. More likely, the computer's decreasing size and weight will enable students or teachers to travel from class to class with their own personal information devices.
Notebook computers, battery-powered computers the size of a stack of typing paper or smaller, can store as much as 60 megabytes, or 60 million characters of data in a magnetic hard disk the size of a cigarette pack. That's the equivalent of about 30,000 book pages of text information. Researchers say that in a few years, notebook computers may store hundreds of megabytes of data on rewriteable optical disks, which resemble audio CD's. And they may be able to tap into huge pools of information by plugging into a school's network, as one would plug a telephone into an outlet, or by using cellular and radio-frequency modems.
NETWORKS: Critical to future educational technology is the network, the system of glass and plastic fiber-optic cables, copper wiring, radio, microwave and satellite technologies that serve as vast data highways.
Within a year, all 180 schools in Florida's Broward County school district will be linked in a vast computer network. With 161,000 elementary and secondary students, and 180,000 adult-education students, the district is the eighth-largest in the nation. "We can see how we could expand curriculum offerings without having to find stand-alone teachers," one for each classroom, said Virgil Morgan, superintendent of schools.
At the Shoreline School District in Seattle, fiber-optic cables -- which transmit data as pulses of light at rates as high as 100 million bits a second -- will soon enable students and teachers to retrieve articles, video clips, slides, photographs and sound recordings from a central resource library. Using two-way video, classes and individual teachers will see and interact with another in the same building or across the district.
The National Science Foundation is planning to establish a high-speed national fiber network by the year 2000 to connect all American universities and, perhaps, most secondary schools. Schools using such a network could draw information from virtually any university library in the nation.
 
 
Wireless Networks vs. Built-in 'Plumbing'
 Some schools are experimenting with wireless networks that send data over low-power radio waves, while other schools are being designed with networking "plumbing" built in. Wireless networks are more flexible than wired ones, and more expensive. But Apple Computer has applied to the Federal Communications Commission for permission to use part of the radio band for computer communications, suggesting that the field may become popular and more economical.
Other networking technologies, including packet radio and cellular modems, may give students at home access to school or museum resources.
TELEVISION: Schools may some day have video wallpaper, where images surround students. In the near term the conventional video monitor -- or television -- will enter most classrooms, but in updated form.
The key is interactive technology, which enables students and teachers to participate in the display of information. Using, for example, the interactive form of the recent public television series on the Civil War, now being developed, students could jump from one topic to related topics, including texts of documents, bibliographies, biographies of key individuals and more.
The video monitor will likely be connected to computers, video camcorders, videocassette recorders, laser disks, compact disk players, cable TV, satellite dishes and other classrooms for live, two-way television broadcasts. Eventually, high-definition television using digital signals will bring photographic-quality images to viewers, along with computer data and graphics. Japanese companies have indicated that they plan to integrate computers and optical disks into new monitors, creating video computers. American companies, by contrast, are trying to integrate video into computers, creating multimedia PC's.
MULTIMEDIA: The combination of computer data, graphics, sound and video is called multimedia and is already used to convey information. The next step is to give more students than the few now using them the tools to produce their own multimedia presentations.
OPTICAL DISKS: This category includes intriguing technologies with names like CD-ROM, CD-V, laser videodisks and CD-I. Most resemble audio CD disks, except that they play data, graphics, sound and video on computer screens or television sets hooked to a computer. Optical disks are already replacing textbooks in some classes because they can be updated rapidly.
The next generation of optical-disk technology will in-<cc11.6volve computers that can record, erase and record again on a single optical disk.
SATELLITES: The recent development of satellite receiving dishes the size of garbage-can lids will eventually allow homes and individual classrooms to pull in signals from satellites. Using portable satellite transmitting stations, professors will beam lectures from remote archeological sites, for example, to schools, while students on field trips will send in reports.
ELECTRONIC MAIL: Electronic mail enables teachers, administrators and students to keep in contact more efficiently than if they used postal mail, interoffice mail or even the telephone. Messages can be sent at any time and stored in a central computer, to be retrieved at the recipient's convenience.
Scholars can use E-mail, as it is called, to keep abreast of developments in their field; to contact colleagues and leading authorities at other universities; to collaborate on research papers, and to publish findings. Students can obtain assignments and have administrative notices or professors' messages sent to their dorm rooms.
VIRTUAL REALITY: Once the stuff of science fiction, virtual reality is now a serious topic of educational research. Students can "travel" to distant locations and sense that they are physically present at, say, the ruins of Pompeii. They move through the artificial environment experience by wearing a specially wired helmet or goggles, by gesturing with a special glove and moving their eyes. Medical students could hone their skills on virtual patients, for example, while architectural students could build virtual buildings.
"One of the positive effects of technology on education will be to teach people to learn to learn, rather than to learn specific facts," said David Nagle, head of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple Computer. The role of teachers, Mr. Nagle added, is not diminished but rather enhanced by these technologies, making it "worthwhile to spend as much time teaching teachers to use the technologies as it is to teach students to learn."

HEADLINE: Black Businesses Work in Schools

BYLINE: By Jonathan P. Hicks

 BODY:
NEAR the Robert Taylor public-housing project on Chicago's South Side, the Soft Sheen Products Company has developed a special relationship with Beethoven Elementary School. Executives of Soft Sheen, which manufactures hair-care products and is the nation's sixth-largest black-owned company, make themselves available for a host of programs, from developing parents' associations to helping establish tutorial programs. 
 Soft Sheen has also provided materials and equipment for a second public elementary school and two public high schools that it "adopted." But company executives say their most important offering is in their time and personnel.
 
 
Black Role Growing
 Soft Sheen is not alone in its activities. Indeed, there are signs that black companies are playing an increasingly important role in schools. "Black-owned companies are doing more in education," said Frank L. Matthews, publisher of the journal Black Issues in Higher Education and senior scholar at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
And they are doing so increasingly on the local level, according to Mr. Matthews and others who study black-owned concerns. "But it's hard to quantify what they do," he said.
The participation of black-owned companies in school systems dates to when many public schools were legally segregated. Companies then commonly established scholarships and made personnel available to teachers. But the recent increase in activities, Mr. Matthews and others contend, is fueled by heightened concern about the nation's public schools, particularly in inner cities, where many large black-owned companies are based.
"School systems have deteriorated so badly that I think black companies feel a greater need than ever to get involved," said Robert L. Johnson, president of Black Entertainment Television, a Washington, D.C., cable network.
"Our work force comes mainly from Chicago public schools," said Frances Williams Gutter, Soft Sheen's manager of special projects. "So it's important that we do whatever our resources allow."
And there are more wealthy black entrepreneurs now to make such resources available. Last year, for example, Reginald F. Lewis, the Wall Street investor and chairman of TLC Beatrice Inc., donated $1 million to Howard University and smaller sums to other historically black colleges. Mr. Lewis also finances scholarships to college-bound New York City public high school students.
 
 
Starting Foundations
 Many black-owned corporations have seen their revenues grow to a point that they can incorporate programs for school systems within their annual budgets. Soft Sheen, for example, which is 27 years old, has established the Soft Sheen Foundation to finance programs associated with its school adoptions. The foundation also finances learning centers and arts and crafts centers in Chicago housing projects.
The Mays Chemical Company in Indianapolis, which last year had $50 million in sales of specialty chemical products, works with a local group, Community Leaders Allied for Superior Schools, and in partnership with the Chamber of Commerce to conduct several programs. These range from contests for students with the greatest improvement in grade point average to assistance from company executives in teaching economics.
"The schools are hungry and open to whatever suggestions we might be willing to make," said the company's president, William G. Mays. "As a black-owned company, we have a special commitment to deal with the inner city and to get through to black males interested in achieving."
More often, however, the educational reach of black-owned companies has been limited. Annual sales last year of the 100 largest black-owned industrial companies and automobile dealerships equaled $6.8 billion, roughly the same as the Ralston Purina Company, which was 69th on the Fortune 500 listing of the nation's largest companies in 1989. Since nearly all black-owned companies are privately held, profitability figures are not available. But their executives say profits often are not robust enough to allow outside expenditures.
"Our limitations are more financial than anything else," said Jeffery B. Cullers, vice president of Vince Cullers Advertising Inc., the nation's oldest black-owned advertising firm. Cullers Advertising has a relationship with the Chicago Board of Education in which the company develops marketing programs "to help make the public aware of the school system's needs," Mr. Cullers said.
Mr. Matthews is optimistic, however. "Black companies are becoming more savvy and are growing in size," he said. "The commitment is already there; now they're getting the resources to do even more."

HEADLINE: THE ROMANIANS SEE MORE WOES AHEAD

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania

 BODY:
The leaders of this country, the unhappiest of the formerly Communist nations of eastern Europe, concede that it is going through hardship as it jettisons the Communist legacy and struggles toward a market economy.
"This year will be dominated by economic difficulties, as last year was by political confrontations," President Ion Iliescu said in an interview in Cotraceni Palace. "There will be problems with the labor force. The number of jobless is mounting. Optimists say there will be 400,000, 500,000 unemployed. Pessimists say up to a million, and perhaps that is more realistic." 
 Coping with mounting material distress is made more difficult by a loss of confidence in the leadership among the intellectual elite, which played a vital role in the overthrow of President Nicolae Ceausescu in December 1989. Writers and academics, as well as foreign diplomats, said the loss of support deprived the Government of the help of people who could rally mass support for it.
Mircea Dinescu, a dissident poet who was put under house arrest by President Ceausescu's Government, became by circumstance the man who announced the fall of the old regime to the nation over television. Today he says the hopes he cherished have faded.
 
'Servants Took Over'
 "I think if I was Japanese now, a year after the revolution, I would disembowel myself," he said in an interview in his office at the Writers Union, which he heads. "We say in Romania that miracles endure for three days. Like our revolution: after three days the professionals of power took over. The master was killed, his servants took over."
Diplomats agree with the criticism by intellectuals; they are reflected in the State Department's human rights assessment for 1990. The Government is accused of undemocratic practices toward opponents, particularly in connection with the presidential election last May and mob attacks on opponents in June.
Speaking of foreign criticism, Mr. Iliescu singled out the United States. He said a refusal by international banking organizations to grant credits stemmed from American disapproval. He suggested that America lacked respect for his people in doubting the voting that gave him 86 percent in May.
"A popular choice was clearly exercised," he said. "So if you respect a people, you should respect its choice."
 
Security Forces Weakened
 Asked whether he feared economic hardship might lead to a melding of political and social discontent that might bring people into the streets, Mr. Iliescu replied, "That is always possible." He suggested serious consequences because of what he called the former regime's legacy of suspicion, which, he said, deprived "the forces of public order of the necessary force to resolve problems of confrontation."
Prime Minister Petre Roman is responsible for the program to speed change to a market economy. It requires passing on to the 23 million Romanians the true costs of the necessities of life, which under Communism were disguised by ample subsidies to the producers.
"We have made an error," said Alexandru Birladeanu, the Senate President, an 80-year-old economist who resigned from the Ceausescu leadership in 1968. "We are going too fast. In creating the Romania of the year 2000, we are making the Romanians of 1991 pay too high a price."
Inflation has devalued money in people's pockets by 50 percent since October, Government statistics show. The average wage of about 2,000 lei a month is worth less than $10 on the realistic black market.
 
Morale Problem Cited
 The President and the Prime Minister conceded that low morale was hampering transition to democracy. "There is a general illness," Mr. Iliescu said. "We bear a very heavy legacy, an atmosphere of general suspiciousness created by the old regime."
Many Romanians and diplomats hold Mr. Iliescu and Mr. Roman themselves responsible. The root of the "illness," they said, is the survival of former Communists like them as leaders and a belief that thousands of agents of the Securitate, the Ceausescu secret police, continue to serve the Government.
Mr. Birladeanu expressed confidence in the President but added: "I don't exclude that he has some reflexes conditioned by his youth. Perhaps he doesn't quite understand the working of democracy."
Mr. Iliescu, describing Romanian society, said, "There are no pure people who are not linked to the old regime."
 
'Equal Guilt for All'
 This view causes resentment. "They say we were all dirty," said Ana Blandiana, a poet persecuted by the Securitate. "Equal guilt for all, those who were close to power and us others."
Culture Minister Andrei Plesu said: "Ceausescu died, but his spirit lives on," What lingers is "a human type produced by Communism -- people who like privileges, opportunists, people incapable of normal, transparent behavior."
"A post-totalitarian neurosis with a very bad effect on everything" pervades Romania, Mr. Plesu, a writer, continued. "We are all of us infected by a perverse illness. This has created huge social tension and a toxic intolerance."

HEADLINE: New York's Economy: Rebound Seems Distant

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
The New York metropolitan region, which began an economic slide before the rest of the nation, will lag behind a national turnaround, according to several recent forecasts.
The end of the Persian Gulf war, a surging stock market, an awakening housing market and signs that consumer confidence is rising have prompted talk that a national economic revival may not be far off. But economists charting the vicissitudes of New York and New Jersey say both states will suffer more job losses in 1991 and, some believe, 1992. 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, in one of the more optimistic of the forecasts, believes that a local turnaround could occur near the end of 1991. But by year's end, the authority projects, New York City will have lost 40,000 more jobs.
A forecast by Matthew P. Drennan, an economist at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, put a turnaround in 1992, with a loss of 71,000 jobs in the city in 1991 and 26,000 more next year.
 
The Signs of a Rebound
 According to a Federal Home Loan Bank of New York forecast, the New Jersey economy should begin to recover in 1992, but the outlook next year for New York State will still be poor, reflecting the "stagnating" New York City and Long Island economies. The two-year forecast estimates that New York State will lose 165,000 jobs and New Jersey 57,000 jobs in 1991.
Rae D. Rosen, the organization's vice president and senior economist, noted the signs of a rebound in the national housing market. "Locally, we're going to get a little bit of a spillover," she said, "but that's not sufficient to pull us out of a recession."
Ms. Rosen said she expected weak gains in personal income of about 2 percent to 3 percent in New York State, not only well below the inflation rate but also the lowest rate of growth in more than 20 years. That suggests that state and local tax revenues will continue to fall below expectations, raising the prospect of higher real-estate and personal-income taxes.
The result, Ms. Rosen said, would be "very sharp" declines in purchasing power. "I can't be optimistic about retail sales," she added.
 
Relocated to Other Cities
 New York City, which in the 1980's enjoyed its most prosperous decade since World War II, is the focus of the region's current economic weakness. In a briefing last month, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, noted that the city had lost 100,000 jobs between September 1989, its recent employment peak, and January 1991.
Last week, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company said it would transfer or eliminate 4,000 jobs from its New York headquarters. About 3,000 employees will be relocated to other cities while one of the company's Manhattan buildings is renovated. MetLife said the project is to be completed by 1996, when it will decide whether to bring the workers back to New York.
And the Grumman Corporation said it would eliminate 1,900 jobs, three-fourths of them on Long Island, because of cuts in military spending and a need to trim expenses. The aerospace and transportation company is Long Island's largest private employer.
 
Undergoing Reorganizations
 The March unemployment rates provided more gloomy evidence of the region's faltering economy. The jobless rates for New York and New Jersey both rose to 6.8 percent, while New York City rose to 8.1 percent.
Since the early 1950's, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, New York City has tended to begin recessions about two months before the nation begins a slump and to emerge from them about two months after the nation has revived.
But the city's current downturn, he said, is "not your run-of-the-mill recession," because key parts of its economy, including Wall Street, the legal and accounting professions and department stores and other retailers, were not simply sagging but undergoing reorganizations that have yet to run their course. "There's a lot more uncertainty in New York," he said.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said this downturn has differed from past slumps because it has been led by white-collar sectors that had once been sources of the city's strength. Financial services, which added 115,000 jobs between 1980 and 1987 -- 40 percent of the city's private-industry job growth during that time -- have lost 50,000 jobs since then.
Large declines in the city have also come in trade, which lost 46,000 jobs between September 1989 and January 1991, the labor statistics bureau reported. About 32,000 of the jobs have been in restaurants, department stores and other types of retailing.
Manufacturing has continued its long decline in the city, losing 30,000 jobs in the 16 months after September 1989. Construction, which had gained 50,000 jobs from 1980 to 1987, lost 16,500 jobs in 1990 alone, the bureau said.
The only part of the city's economy that has continued to expand is the services sector, but the growth has mostly been in health, education and social services rather than in more highly paid business and professional services like law and engineering.
Economists say the city's prospects for recovery and growth largely depend on its supply of educated workers and whether its costs become competitive with those in other regions.
One sign of hope, Mr. Ehrenhalt indicated, is that the city's rate of inflation, which had been higher than that of the nation for much of the 1980's, is now essentially even with it.

HEADLINE: Vast Majority of Americans Feel Sting of Recession, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
A large portion of Americans, far more than the 6.8 percent who are unemployed, have been deeply stung by the recession and may be in no position, financially or psychologically, to help bail out the economy by going on a shopping spree, a New York Times/ CBS News Poll shows.
The recession touches the vast majority of Americans in some way, the poll found. Fifty-eight percent said they knew someone well who was currently out of work. Almost half said they were finding it harder to make ends meet. 
 Three out of 10 respondents, and half the blacks, said a family member had been out of work in the past year. One in five whites, and almost half the blacks, said they thought the chances were high that a family member would be laid off in the next year.
The Times/CBS News survey of 1,283 people Monday to Wednesday stands in sharp contrast to record-breaking surges in consumer confidence measured by polls in March that examined long-range views.
In interviews conducted after the poll, nearly all of 20 survey participants said that their spirits had been lifted by the victory in the Persian Gulf and that they were optimistic about the future prospects of the nation's economy. But many said they were deeply concerned about their own families' financial difficulties, brought on by inflation, debts and layoffs.
 
Economy the Paramount Concern
 The survey substantiates the view that the euphoria after the gulf war was just that: a collective sigh of joy.
"I don't think things are getting any better yet," said Craig H. Munson, a 57-year-old iron worker in Saginaw, Mich., who has fallen behind in his utility payments since being laid off in January. "I don't know what I'll do if I don't get a job this month."
The participants in the Times/CBS News survey were selected at random by a computer to represent the nation's diversity. Statistically, their views are not expected to differ by more than three percentage points in either direction from those of all Americans.
The poll found that the state of the economy was still the paramount concern for a third of the nation, ranking far above drug abuse or all other social ills combined. In particular, the level of concern about unemployment now matches levels recorded during the 1981-1982 recession.
No wonder. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits reached an eight-year high of 543,000 people in late March, the Government reported Friday.
The jobless rate for March climbed to 6.8 percent from 6.5 percent, the fifth straight monthly increase, indicating that 410,000 people had lost jobs last month alone, the Labor Department said. In all, two million Americans have lost jobs since last summer.
 
Little Jobs 'So Hard to Get'
 Judy Parker, who is 45 years old and lives near Lexington, N.C., made telephone equipment for A.T.&T. for almost 25 years before the plant closed in late 1989. Her severance pay is spent, her unemployment benefits will run out this month, and she cannot find a job, even one paying the minimum wage. Her 47-year-old husband, Rodney, makes $6.83 an hour building bedroom furniture, but sales are poor and his employer has put him on a part-time schedule.
"I've been out of a job since October 1989, and I can't find anybody to give me a chance," said Mrs. Parker, who made $11 an hour at A.T.&T. "I figured, 'What the heck, I don't have to make a whole bunch of money.' But I didn't realize that these little $4-an-hour jobs are so hard to get. I guess I could be looking harder, but it gets kind of depressing when you're told you're being put on a preferred applicant list for running a cash register for $3.80 an hour."
Her husband, who was not among the survey's respondents, characterized the local job market as "plain dirty as hell."
Young adults in the survey, ages 18 to 29, reported having a particularly hard time. Almost half said a family member had been out of work in the past year and 29 percent said they believed there was a high likelihood of someone in their household losing a job in the next year.
"My husband, Clay, says it's a depression," said Victoria Reimers, 24, of Everett, Wash. She said that she earned $5.25 an hour as a clerk at Sears, Roebuck & Company and that because of slow sales, her schedule was cut to 11 hours a week from 30. Mr. Reimers, a 25-year-old brick mason, cannot find steady work, she said.
The Reimers have borrowed money from parents to pay the rent on their one-bedroom apartment; the rent just increased by $20, to $420 a month. "We go sit in the Jacuzzi to relieve stress," Mrs. Reimers said, adding that animals also have a calming effect on her. She and her husband have two cats, two dogs and a boa constrictor and 14 rats to feed to the snake, she said.
 
Positive View of Future
 How do these American voices mesh with earlier reports apparently brimming with consumer optimism?
The Conference Board, a research organization, reported recently that its March index of consumer confidence jumped 21 points from February, breaking a 24-year record for a single month's gain.
Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center in New York, said most of the gain in the board's survey came from a sharp increase in positive views about the economy's future, not from people's views of their own situation. For example, in reporting on their current financial condition, 36 percent of the respondents in the board's survey said they believed jobs were hard to find, as against only 10 percent who said jobs were plentiful. "Normally, optimists outnumber the pessimists," he said.
In additional results from its survey, completed in mid-March, the board said Friday that 25 percent of the respondents said their families had been significantly affected by the recession and nearly 35 percent said they had postponed making a major purchase in recent months.
But, Mr. Linden said, a pent-up demand for products is growing and would probably be unleashed as soon as people feel more confident in their financial situation. The board's national surveys are based on 5,000 interviews, and the margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
 
Psyche vs. Bank Balance
 The return of consumer confidence will have as much to do with people's psyches as their bank accounts or job prospects, said William A. Roiter, a Boston psychologist who counsels laid-off workers. He als an existing $8,000 president of Hurst Associates, which provides employee assistance programs to New England companies.
"People are feeling very insecure and out of control," he said. "People need something they can believe in again before they can recover."
Martha Adkins of Lancaster, Ohio, says her 47-year-old husband, Don, cannot sleep at night because his carpentry business is falling off. "He stays up at night and worries," said Mrs. Adkins, a respondent in The Times/CBS News Poll.
In the last year, she said, his income has fallen to $40,000 from $65,000. To make ends meet, Mrs. Adkins, who is 34 years old, temporarily got a full-time job for four months this winter; almost half her earnings, at $2.50 an hour, went to pay the babysitter for their 4-year-old son, Daniel. The Adkinses are very wary of debt and say they do not use credit cards or plan to carry more than an existing $8,000 mortgage on their $110,000 home.
 
Concern Among Blacks
 Black respondents had the most worries about the economy, with more than half saying the economy was getting worse as against 30 percent of the whites. But Sharon K. Smith, who is black, said it was getting better. "I don't believe things are as bad as some people would have you believe," she said.
But Ms. Smith, a 34-year-old insurance clerk in Atlanta, said companies were much more worried about losses these days than they are about the ethnic make-up of their work force. "It doesn't matter whether you are white, Hispanic, black, blue or green anymore," she said. "We have been told in no uncertain terms, 'If you're not productive, you are out.' "
The survey's respondents were split, 40 percent to 41 percent, on whether the economy was "fairly good" or "fairly bad." But while an additional 2 percent said the economy was "very good," 16 percent more called it "very bad." Wishful feelings were revealed behind the positive responses, since 72 percent also said the economy was in recession.
But the vast majority polled felt the touch of recession in some way. A total of 77 percent said that either they had had a family member out of work recently or were having difficulty making ends meet or knew someone well who was out of work.
Older people in the survey held a slightly rosier view of the economy than the young held, perhaps because those over 64 have attained some financial independence, are secure in their retirement benefits, or they simply know how to can a jar of peaches.
"The recession may be having a deep effect on everybody else, but not for me," said Lillian Ascetta-Ackerman, a 75-year-old widow who supplements her Social Security income by growing and canning her own fruit and vegetables at her home in Matamorus, a rural part of northern Pennsylvania. "I learned to live sparsely in the Depression," she said. "Young folks today, they get a steak, and they have to have mushrooms with it. They haven't learned to make do."
Florence Stray says that she struggles to get by on her $650-a-month Social Security check, but that she remains a flag-waving optimist. "You've got to have faith in your country, that it's going to get better," said Mrs. Stray, a retired social worker, who lives by herself in San Diego.
"I'd be living under a bridge with the rest of them if I didn't have a subsidized apartment," said Mrs. Stray. She said she drives a 20-year old car, never eats in restaurants and shops for clothing in a local thrift shop.
Many people have not yet been hurt by the recession, and some survey participants seemed to exhibit survivors' anxiety. "I'm embarrassed to say the recession really hasn't affected us at all," said Mickey Pleasants, who is 48 years old and lives in Raleigh, N.C. "My husband, Riley, is a dentist."

 
 
HOW THE POLL WAS TAKEN

The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Monday to Wednesday with 1,283 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits so unlisted numbers could be called along with listed ones. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for blacks it is plus or minus about 10 percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Cast as Villains in Drought, Rice Farmers Defend Water Rights

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROBBINS, Calif., April 5

 BODY:
Any day now, the rice farmers in the Sacramento Valley will burn, disk, furrow, fertilize and flood their fields and plant the crop that has made them the arch-villains of California's drought.
These men say the work will be a welcome distraction from the badgering of state officials who tried to the buy their water and the criticism of people from one end of California to the other who wonder why anyone is paid by the government to grow a monsoon crop in this desert landscape. 
 When Governor Pete Wilson inaugurated a voluntary "water bank" program to transfer water from the state's haves to its have-nots without the cost or ecological risk of building news dams and aqueducts, the rice farmers seemed the most promising donors.
But while the water bank was more successful than expected, the rice growers, who use more water each year than all the households in Los Angeles and San Francisco put together, hunkered down and refused to sell.
 
State Offers to Pay Farmers
 "None of us here want to be knot-headed about it," said Al Driver, who grows 1,046 acres of rice on a 2,400-acre ranch here. "But we don't care for it and we're not going to do it."
Under decades-old agreements, the farmers pay the government as little as $7 for the water they consume on each acre of land. This year, the state offered about $450 for that amount of water. But accepting the offer would force the farmers to idle land, thus losing income from rice. Some farmers would also lose a $260 Federal subsidy for each idled acre.
The farmers secured the rights to cheap, abundant water over generations, and their biggest fear is that selling water now would endanger those rights in the future.
They are not the only farmers to guard their water jealously, but no other group, not even the alfalfa farmers, whose crops consume more water, has been singled out for so much criticism. In large part, the rice farmers' special status reflects their historical privilege.
 
History of Water Rights
 The ancestors of these rice farmers were the first settlers on the banks of the Sacramento River, and they dipped their buckets into the water at their doorsteps and irrigated their crops. Under a system of property rights that harks back to English courts, Mexican pueblos and Western mines, these families owned the land and the water that flowed past it; it was their livelihood and their patrimony.
Then, in the 1930's, the Federal Government came calling, set on building the Shasta Dam to tame the wild snow-fed rivers that tumbled from the Sierra Nevada and pumping some of the water to the arid south where the population was growing. Would the farmers be willing to give the Government their water and then buy it back?
The farmers struck a tough bargain. Their water would forever be the cheapest and most plentiful in the state, with assured deliveries even in times of scarcity and prices as low as 1 percent of what others pay.
This winter, the rice farmers were asked again for their water, this time by state officials with open checkbooks and hard-luck stories about drought-striken cities and farms, about fellow Californians who could no longer flush their toilets or irrigate their orchards.
 
This Time, No Deal
 But this time virtually all rice farmers said, "No thank you." Their worry about jeopardizing their future water rights had special urgency because they face renegotiation of their water contracts with the Federal Government over the next several years.
"We don't trust the system," said Tim Leathers, the manager of Reclamation District 108, a water district near the town of Grimes.
Pat Tennis, whose grandfather began rice farming here in the 1920's and helped build the levees, worried that there would be nowhere to turn if promises about water rights proved hollow. "Are you protected by law or subject to the political arena?" asked Mr. Tennis, who farms with his son, Jim, and son-in-law, Darrin Schmidt. "Do you seek relief from the Legislature or the courts?"
 
More Fear in Rice Fields
 Such fears were fed when Governor Wilson said he might invoke emergency powers if the drought worsened and when Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is the vice chairman of the House Interior Committee, pleaded with state and Federal officials to seize the rice farmers' water rather than let them "shake down" taxpayers by buying it for so little and then selling it for so much.
The rice farmers say they had other fears as well.
They are afraid that idling their land will cost them their subsidies, which are worth about one-third of their income. The subsidies bring the market price of rice, currently $7.26 for 100 pounds, to $10.71. The Federal program allows the farmers to idle half their land and still get 92 percent of their total subsidy payments. Under a complicated formula, if they idle more than that to sell water, some of them will retain their subsidies and others will not. It is unclear which farmers fall into each category.
A professor at the University of California at Davis has computed how the rice farmers would fare economically if they sold their water.
The state offered $125 for each acre- foot, enough water to cover one acre one foot deep. According to the professor, Richard Howitt, a farmer who loses his subsidy of $260 an acre would need to get $200 for each acre-foot to break even. A farmer who continued to get the payments would break even at only $60 an acre-foot.
The rice farmers are also wary of ruining their markets. Rice farming is a fragile industry, with growers scrambling for markets and battling foreign trade barriers. California, which produces 25 percent of the nation's crop, is the No. 2 producer in the nation, behind Arkansas, and the crop dominates the economies of half a dozen counties. The 1988-89 crop in the state was worth $442 million, with most of the sales to cereal and beer manufacturers.
Another fear of rice farmers is the economic collapse of their tightly knit communities if they idle land. Here in Robbins, equipment dealers and crop dusters would likely suffer, along with truck drivers and fertilizer dealers.
Driving through the hamlet of 100 people recently, Phil Illerich, a retired rice farmer, pointed to the hulking mill that belongs to the Farmers Rice Cooperative, of which he is a member. "What do you do with the help?" he asked. "Put them on welfare for a year? And there's a half million dollars in property taxes. What about that?"
The water bank, which stopped solicitations this week because its goal had been met, made most of its purchases from farmers in the delta area, down river from here, where growers took corn and sugar beets out of production. The water will be sold to cities and to fruit and nut growers in Kern and Fresno Counties, who have inferior water rights and have been forced to halt irrigation this year.
Proponents of the water bank, who see it as the best way to adjust for the historical irrationalities in pricing and distribution, say the rice farmers may be more willing to sell next time around, especially if local communities do not unduly suffer and if cooperative growers are rewarded with public appreciation and the sympathy of lawmakers.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
BAGHDAD FORMALLY AGREES TO 'UNJUST' U.N. CONDITIONS FOR PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
Iraq's acceptance today of a punishing United Nations cease-fire resolution has forced Saddam Hussein to accept the full consequences of his arrogance and of the defeat that the United States and its allies imposed on him and his people in the Persian Gulf war.
But as stringent as the demands are in forcing Iraq to complete the destruction of its chemical, biological and nuclear industries and pay reparations to Kuwait, they have not produced the outcome that the Bush Administration continues to pursue publicly and privately: the removal of President Hussein from power. 
 While Mr. Hussein may take his personal survival as a victory, it is by no means a victory for the Iraqi people, who have had little to say about the course of his two decades of rule, especially on the crucial and catastrophic decisions to invade Iran in 1980, invade Kuwait in 1990, and go to war against the American-led coalition in 1991.
The Iraqi people have mortgaged a piece of their sovereignty to the United Nations and to the coalition, whose bureaucrats and inspectors will in coming months oversee the destruction of the country's high-technology military laboratories. In the name of enforcement, they also control Iraq's trade for the indefinite future as a means to garnish a suitable part of oil revenues to pay damages to Kuwait.
Even Iraq's ballistic missile program, which a few years ago instilled pride across the Arab world as a step toward pan-Arab satellites and space industries, will be dismantled and destroyed, stripping the country of weapons that all of its enemies from Teheran to Damascus to Tel Aviv still possess.
Mr. Hussein, who told a Soviet envoy on Oct. 30 that if his choice were to surrender in Kuwait or fight, he was inclined to fight, has long inspired official fear in Saudi Arabia that he would someday lead an assault by the so-called have-not Arab countries of Yemen and Jordan against the rich oil-producing emirates and monarchies of the Arabian peninsula.
The Iraqi leader's decision to hold on to Kuwait -- along with his refusal to pull out of Kuwait without a fight at the last minute, an act that would have left him still the most powerful hand in the region -- may go down as one of the most colossal miscalculations in modern history.
But Mr. Hussein may well think that his mistakes, while regrettable, may be overcome. After all, he has the rebellion by Shiites in southern Iraq and by the Kurds in northern Iraq under control.
 
Military Stretched Thin
 But the Iraqi military is stretched thin in holding onto major cities and oil-producing areas. The prospect of low-intensity guerrilla warfare that will sap the strength of the Government is a real threat to the stability Mr. Hussein must re-establish if he is to rebuild his country.
The humanitarian airlift that this week will send American C-130's into the mountains of northern Iraq will be dropping food, blankets and tents not only to civilian Kurdish refugees, but also to the Kurdish rebel fighters who are traveling among them. In that sense, the airlift is lending direct aid to the insurrection.
With the vote of Iraq's National Assembly today ratifying the decision to accept the cease-fire terms, Mr. Hussein has shown that he is not ready to resign and is handling decisions in the manner he has in the past. This was the same Assembly that ratified, after the fact, Mr. Hussein's decision to go into Kuwait, to release hostages taken in Kuwait and Iraq and to go to war against the coalition.
If his error in Kuwait forces Mr. Hussein to loosen the reins of control, it is unlikely that Iraqis outside the inner circle will have any role except in the civic affairs agenda: repairing electrical, water and sewage services, reopening schools and providing public health services. Any attempt at debate on foreign policy in Iraq appears destined to be reserved for the Revolutionary Command Council, where Mr. Hussein is likely to remain rampant.
Though a United States intelligence report two weeks ago predicted Mr. Hussein's downfall within a year, some longtime analysts inside the Government suggest that Mr. Hussein's grip on Iraq's security services, and the leadership of both the military establishment and Baath Socialist Party, will protect him from any internal rivals.
These analysts and Iraq specialists expected Mr. Hussein to accept terms he considered onerous because that was the only way to get his nation moving again by ending United Nations trade sanctions and removing the blockade on the shipment of Iraqi crude oil to world markets.
 
Clearing the Obstacles
 Middle East specialists in the Administration and the intelligence agencies say that once the Iraqi economy is moving forward again, Mr. Hussein and his cosmetically rearranged Cabinet can be expected to try to whittle, chisel and needle their way around every obstacle that the cease-fire resolution has placed before them.
As American military forces withdraw from the region, they say, Mr. Hussein is likely to waste little time in channeling his regained oil revenues both into domestic rebuilding programs, and also in repairing his military machine so he can once again enforce central control throughout the country.
And politically, they say, he will seek to press United States policy in the region to use the same standards of pressure it has applied to Iraq to bringing Israel into compliance with United Nations resolutions calling for the return of occupied territories.
If Mr. Hussein is able to exact any measure of revenge for the humiliation he has been made to suffer in the eyes of many in the world, it will be in the political arena. There still are millions of Palestinians, Jordanians, Yemenis and North Africans who supported him in the war and may still clamor for the same measure of justice that Washington fought for in the name of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
BAGHDAD FORMALLY AGREES TO 'UNJUST' U.N. CONDITIONS FOR PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, April 6

 BODY:
Five weeks after the United States and its allies drove Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait, Iraq today accepted United Nations terms for a formal cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war.
In accepting the conditions, the National Assembly in Baghdad, which follows Mr. Hussein's dictates, called the arrangement "unjust," but it acknowledged that Iraq had little choice if it was to avert further degradation. 
 The message of Iraqi acceptance was delivered in New York to the offices of the United Nations Secretary General and to the chairman of the Security Council by the Iraqi representative at the United Nations, Abdul Amir al-Anbari. He told reporters that Iraq accepted the terms "without conditions," but added that he considered the resolution "one-sided and unfair."
 
Cease-Fire Now Official
 Under the terms of Security Council Resolution 687, adopted on Wednesday, Iraq's acceptance automatically activates a permanent cease-fire between the opponents in the gulf war. But the Pentagon did not immediately issue orders to American forces in the Persian Gulf region proclaiming a formal end to hostilities.
 [In Houston, where he is spending the weekend, President Bush said the Iraqi letter "appears to be positive." But h said he did not "want to get too far out front until we get the analysis." Mr. Bush took note of "some griping" in the Iraqi letter about the conditions. "That's just too bad," he said. "Saddam Hussein is in no position to barter."]
The Iraqi acceptance clears the way for a series of steps to insure the peace. Those include the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force, the destruction of Iraq's biological and chemical weapons and its long-range missiles, and the payment of Iraqi reparations to Kuwait for damage suffered after the invasion last Aug. 2.
 
Embargo's End in Sight
 Iraq's move will also clear the way for the eventual end to the economic embargo against Baghdad, and it will ease the withdrawal of American troops occupying 15 percent of Iraqi territory in the south of the country,
The Iraqi acceptance is a major diplomatic milestone in the campaign begun by the United Staes and its allies last August to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait and strip Mr. Hussein of the military power that made his army the most feared in the Arab world.
But the allied campaign against President Hussein has not ended the Iraqi leader's hold on power. He still appears firmly in control and his army has apparently crushed rebellions by Kurds in the north of Iraq and Shiite Muslim dissidents in the south.
Hundreds of thousands of Kurds continued to flee from the Iraqi Army today, fearing reprisals after their revolt in the north. In Baghdad, the Iraqi leader dismissed his Defense Minister and replaced him with a son-in-law, sharpening the nepotistic profile of a Government that has come to depend increasingly on clan and blood ties as the gulf crisis has unfolded.
The United States, which has declined to give the rebels direct military aid, has announced that starting on Sunday, American helicopters with Air Force cover will drop non-military supplies to Kurds stranded in northern Iraq. Other Kurdish refugees continued to enter Iran, which called again today for increased international aid.
 
A Rubber Stamp
 The vote in the 250-seat Iraqi Parliament accepting the Security Council resolution was said by Iraqi officials to be 160 to 31, although the numbers, like the assembly itself, represent little more than window-dressing for decisions of the the Supreme Revolutionary Command Council, which met under Mr. Hussein's chairmanship last night.
"While declaring that this resolution is unjust, they have found there was no other choice than to accept it in order to defeat the American-Zionist plot," the Parliament speaker, Saadi Mehdi Saleh, said. Drawing on Koranic texts, he said, "We must sometimes, for our own good, accept that which displeases us."
The allied air war destroyed much of Iraq's roads, bridges, oil refineries, water-purification plants, electricity-generating stations, sewage plants and communications networks. To rebuild them, Iraq needs to free itself of the economic and other sanctions imposed by the United Nations after Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait.
But Resolution 687, approved by the Security Council on Wednesday and accepted by the Iraqi parliament today, makes the lifting of trade sanctions conditional on the destruction of Baghdad's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons potential under United Nations supervision.
 
Terms of Trade Ban
 Until those capabilities are destroyed, a trade ban remains in force, and until Iraq can resume oil exports, it has no way of earning money to finance its own reconstruction. At the same time, the resolution mortgages part of Iraq's oil revenues to pay reparations to Kuwait.
Baghdad's effort to quickly restore its economy may also be impeded by a separate Security Council resolution, adopted on Friday, calling on Iraq to halt its repression of the Kurds and the Shiites. Because it asserts that the international movement of Kurdish and other refugees is a threat to global security for which the Iraqi Government may be held responsible, the resolution could be used as a basis for continued sanctions against Baghdad.
While the terms of Wednesday's resolution have been widely condemned in Baghdad as an American ploy to destroy Arab military potential in the fight against Israel, the Iraqi Parliament's acceptance today seemed part of an effort by Baghdad to secure its own survival after months of crisis, war and insurrection that have brought not only destruction by allied bombing but the worst uprisings in Iraq's modern history.
Those twin civil wars have left a legacy of bitterness and fear. Iranian officials reported today, for instance, that 300,000 Iraqi Kurds had fled into Iran, braving minefields and harsh conditions to escape anticipated retribution from loyalist Iraqi units known for vengeance.
On Friday, Baghdad offered a conditional amnesty to rebellious Kurds, but Kurdish rebel officials in Damascus dismissed the offer today as what one rebel spokesman called a "sick joke."
 
Panoply of Revolt
 Confronted by this panoply of revolt, destruction and challenge, President Hussein has rewarded family loyalty and reinforced the power of his own clansmen. Thus, Brig. Gen. Hussein Kamel, a cousin and son-in-law from the Iraqi leader's native Tikrit region, was given the Defense portfolio today, replacing a military commander, Gen. Sadeh Tuma Abbas.
General Kamel had previously been charged with building Iraq's military, now likely to be truncated all the more under the terms of the resolution.

Baker to Middle East
 HOUSTON, April 6 (Special to The New York Times) -- Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived here today to see President Bush before flying to Turkey and the Middle East.
Mr. Baker said the main purpose of his trip would be to "take advantage of the window of opportunity in the aftermath of the gulf war" to see if progress could be made on a settlement of disputes between Israelis and Arabs.
At a news conference, Mr. Bush said he did not rule out using American troops as part of a peacekeeping force in the gulf. But he said "a lot of United States troops" would not be involved, adding, "I have no intention of leaving our forces there."

Majors' Umpires Stop Work

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Major league umpires stopped working yesterday and do not plan to work regular-season games beginning with tomorrow's opening-day schedule. The umpires' lawyer said the umpires were being locked out; the owners' chief negotiator said the umpires were engaged in a work stoppage.
 Whatever the terminology in the game of labor-strife semantics, amateur ("alternate," according to the leagues) umpires are scheduled to man the season-opening games in eight cities while major league umpires meet in Chicago to determine when and where to establish picket lines. 
 "They have not been told they would be locked out," Robert Kheel, the owners' lawyer, said yesterday, "but they have given us no assurances that they intend to work Monday or any other time so the leagues have made appropriate arrangements for replacement umpires."
 
Talks Collapse
 Intensive negotiations between the two sides broke down just before 3 A.M. yesterday. The umpires were prepared to agree to allow the league presidents to select umpires for post-season games, a major demand by management, but the league presidents refused to accept the umpires' proposal on salaries. Under the existing system all umpires get to work post-season games on a rotating basis. The league presidents want to designate umpires for the games so that the best umpires will be working.
At Shea Stadium, four former minor league umpires worked yesterday's game between Toronto and the Mets. At Wrigley Field, a crew of four Big Ten umpires worked the game between Milwaukee and the Chicago Cubs.
Richie Phillips, the major league umpires' lawyer, said the two sides were only $750,000 a year apart on the total amount the leagues would spend on salaries over four years.
 "It's incredible that we're $750,000 apart and it's not getting resolved," Phillips said by telephone from his office in Philadelphia.
 Phillips, who had been uncharacteristically quiet throughout the negotiations, said the owners' representatives, referring to post-season selection of umpires, had given "every indication if I made a certain move, they would meet the salary requisites. I said O.K. I'm prepared to make this final concession, provided that you make the salary concession, and that would do it."
 Kheel, Phillips said, "came back into the room and shocked me. After we had moved closer and closer to a deal for 15 hours, he said no, they don't want to do it."
 Kheel acknowledged having said that the clubs would make "significant economic concessions" in return for regaining control of post-season assignments. "I view us as having met whatever commitment he perceived us as having made," Kheel added.
 Phillips immediately informed the umpires of the breakdown in talks, and they decided not to work the final two days of the exhibition schedule, yesterday and today.
 Phillips said the umpires had received neither crew nor game assignments for the regular season.
 "If they would permit the umpires to work Monday, then we'd have to deal with that," he replied. He later said: "I'm not saying we would work under the circumstances. I've let them know there is that possibility we would work for some time while we negotiate if it's meaningful."
 The last time the umpires did not work was during the 1984 post-season playoffs.
 Kheel said that the owners' offer would incease the umpires' total compensation by 50 percent. Phillips disputed that representation, saying that in the major economic areas the owners had offered a 50 percent raise in post-season pay but had not come near 50 percent on salaries, per diem expenses and pension contribution.
 On salaries, he said and Kheel confirmed, the owners offered these raises: minimum -- $41,000 to $57,500; 5-year umpire -- $49,000 to $72,500; 10-year -- $67,000 to $91,300; 15-year -- $87,000 to $110,000; 20-year -- $105,000 to $128,800. Kheel said that the owners also added a higher maximum, for 25-year umpires, at $155,000.

1941: An Unmatchable Summer

BYLINE: By RAY ROBINSON; Ray Robinson is the author of "Iron Horse: Lou Gehrig in His Time," (W.W. Norton, 1990) and "The Home Run Heard 'Round the World," which is to be released this month by HarperCollins.

 BODY:
On a gleaming spring day in Florida 50 years ago, Joe DiMaggio, eager as usual to get to work, received a traffic ticket for speeding. As things turned out, so the exaggeration goes, it was the only time that the New York Yankees' center fielder was stopped during that enchanted year.
DiMaggio's elegant presence and 56-game hitting streak were hardly the only reasons that 1941 merits inclusion in any baseball time capsule. That summer, as the United States edged toward entry into World War II, the game produced a blend of grand-scale heroics from Ted Williams and his .406 batting average, Bob Feller, Lefty Grove, Bucky Walters, Pete Reiser, Tommy Henrich, Whitlow Wyatt, Cecil Travis, Country Slaughter, Johnny Vander Meer, Leo Durocher and Dixie Walker. 
 That summer, in the waning days of the Great Depression when more than nine million remained unemployed, baseball seemed to provide a cocoon for many Americans amid lingering economic woes of the past and Hitler's ominous conquests in Europe. The basic nourishment at ball parks was the nickel hot dog, and, after the game, a full-course dinner at a good restaurant could be eaten for half a dollar. Tickets to the ball park ranged from 50 cents for a perch in the bleachers to $1.10 for general admission to $3 for the best seat in the house.
On the field, New York boasted 3 of the 16 major league ball clubs. The Yankees, under Joe McCarthy, were set to scale the heights again, after losing to Detroit in 1940. The Brooklyn Dodgers, pennant-less since 1920, played under the strident lash of the former pool hall hustler from Massachusetts, Leo Durocher. At the rusty old Polo Grounds, the Giants were being managed by Bill Terry, who had hit .400 in 1930, something no one had done since then.
It was DiMaggio, however, who set the tone for the season. After winning batting titles in 1939 and 1940, the 26-year-old outfielder had become the acclaimed successor to Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. In 1941, he was playing for $37,500 (the average big league salary that year was $7,300), but only after being forced to stage a holdout against a hardened Yankee front office.
 As the 1941 season began, DiMaggio had already hit in 19 straight games in spring training. He added eight games at the beginning of the regular season before drifting into a brief slump. On May 15, a day sticky as flypaper at Yankee Stadium, DiMaggio singled against Chicago's Edgar Smith. Baseball's most sustained skein of batting brilliance had begun.
The tapestry of consistency continued through May, days that were cluttered with speculation about Rudolf Hess's unscheduled aerial adventure in a stolen plane from Augsberg to Scotland, apparently attempting to arrange peace with the British. There were also fallacious reports that the German boxer Max Schmeling had been killed by the British in Crete while trying to escape capture.
And the news of war intersected with the news of sports. Hank Greenberg, a bachelor with no dependents and runner-up for the most valuable player award in the American League in 1940, played the first three weeks of the 1941 season, then became the first star player to be drafted into the Army. His salary went from $55,000 a year down to $21 a month. By the end of the year, four other big leaguers had gone into the service.
By June 2, DiMaggio was one-third of the way through a record that was captivating America (soon Alan Courtney's lyrics -- "Joe, Joe DiMaggio, we want you on our side" -- were composed in tribute). That night, baseball lost Lou Gehrig, the mighty oak, whose consecutive game streak of 2,130 games had endured through Prohibition, the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression and F.D.R.'s New Deal. The first basemen died in the Riverdale section of the Bronx three weeks short of his 38th birthday after a two-year battle against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an affliction since named after him.
DiMaggio's streak went to 30 games on June 17, an all-time Yankee mark. That night, Joe Louis retained his heavyweight boxing crown when he knocked out the converted light heavyweight, Billy Conn, in the 13th round. A spectator at the Polo Grounds fight, DiMaggio drew thunderous applause as he entered the park.
DiMaggio raised his number to 54 with a lucky infield hit on July 13. The same day, the movie producer Samuel Goldwyn said he intended to film Gehrig's life story. Mentioned as a candidate to play the ill-fated player was a former baseball broadcaster and actor named Ronald Reagan. Gary Cooper eventually won the part.
DiMaggio's streak went to 55 on July 15, against Ed Smith, who had fed him the pitch on May 15 that started the historic barrage. On the same afternoon, the Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, blasted Charles Lindbergh, the heroic lone eagle of the 20's, for his isolationist policies. War was creeping closer.
The next day the streak reached 56 as DiMaggio collected three hits in four trips in Cleveland.
A crowd of 68,000 showed up in Cleveland on July 17, but ill fortune finally caught up with DiMaggio, as third baseman Kenny Keltner snared two vicious ground balls and threw him out. In his last time at bat, Dimaggio hit Jim Bagby's pitch into a double play. The streak was ended.
Would he have liked the streak to have gone on forever? DiMaggio was asked afterward. "When they take them away from you, like Keltner did," he said quietly, "there's nothing a fellow can do."
The next day DiMaggio began another binge that lasted for 16 games.
Meanwhile, in Boston, Williams, whose eyesight was reputed to be keen enough to spot a poor dry cleaning job from 30,000 feet up, was on a seasonlong tear. On Sept. 27, the 23-year-old Red Sox slugger went to bed in Philadelphia with a batting average of .3996, enough to grant him entry into the pantheon of .400 hitters. The last player in the American League to hit .400 had been Harry Heilmann of Detroit, at .403 in 1923.
Joe Cronin, the Red Sox manager, assured Williams on Sunday morning that nobody would hold it against him if he chose to sit it out in that afternoon's doubleheader with a Philadelphia club that was 37 games behind the flag-winning Yankees. The Red Sox, in second place, were 17 games out. Nothing was at stake in the games.
"It's entirely up to you," said Cronin. "You've got .400 in the bank now. What do you say: play or sit it out?"
Williams needed only seconds to respond.
"A man is a .400 hitter or he isn't," Williams said. "I'm going to play. I don't want anyone to say I walked in through the back door. I'm going to prove it."
On a damp day, 10,628 fans came out. Facing three pitchers in the first game, Williams went four for five, including his 37th homer. In the second game, he continued his bravura display, with two hits in three times at bat. When the curtain came down, Williams was at .406.
Marveling at what his protege had accomplished, Eddie Collins, the general manager of the Red Sox, said, "All Ted has ever lived for is his next turn at bat."
But there was still more to come in this wonderful season. The Dodgers won the National League pennant, clawing and scratching to defeat the Cardinals, even though a young player who hit out of an unorthodox corkscrew stance was brought up from Rochester in September to help the Cards. His name was Stan (the Man) Musial, and his measly .426 average in 12 games was not enough to sidetrack Durocher's team. But it was the first of many years in which Musial would never fail to hit at least .300.
In the World Series, the Yankees won two of the first three games. But it was the fourth at Ebbets Field that long-suffering Dodger fans remember.
Pete Reiser's two-run homer had given the Dodgers a 4-3 lead into the ninth. With Hugh Casey, Brooklyn's most rugged relief pitcher, snarling down at the Yankees, it seemed a good bet that the Series was on the verge of a two-all deadlock. When Johnny Sturm and Red Rolfe were retired, the Yanks were down to their last out.
With a count of three balls and two strikes on the Yankees' Old Reliable, Tommy Henrich, Casey unleashed a pitch -- could it have been a spitter? -- that Henrich swung at and missed. But the Dodgers' catcher, Mickey Owen, who hadn't committed an error in a year, also missed. The ball tore through his grasp and rolled to the grandstand as Henrich sped to first base.
Already on their way to take their post-game showers, the Yankees returned to the playing field. A game beyond recall had taken on a new life. In quick succession, a despondent Casey gave up a single to DiMaggio, a double to Charlie Keller, a walk to Bill Dickey, a double to Joe Gordon and a walk to Phil Rizzuto. When the slaughter ended, the Yankees had won, 7-4, and they won the next day, too.
"I'm only sorry about one thing," Owen said later. "I should have called time and stopped the game, giving Casey and myself a chance to get over the shock. I've always kicked myself for not doing that."
Less than two months later, on Dec. 7, the Japanese navy rained bombs down on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The attack on Pearl Harbor, a place unknown to most Americans, cost 2,280 American lives and wounded more than 1,000.
In recalling that time, the author William Manchester would write: "It had been a fine, golden autumn, a lovely farewell to those who would lose their youth, and some of them their lives, before leaves turned again in a peace-time fall."

How Accurately Does The Government Measure The Pinch of Inflation?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO many consumers, suffering such real-life financial jolts as $140 traffic tickets, $50 drugstore prescriptions and $1,000-plus annual increases in college tuitions, the nation's official retail inflation gauge seems somewhat disconnected from reality.
Their perception, particularly at a time of slowly growing incomes, is that prices bound ahead even when the Government reports, as it did at its latest reading last month, that inflation during the latest three months ran at the relatively modest annual pace of 3.9 percent. 
 Anecdotal evidence, economists have learned, can be dangerous, but it does underline some of the limitations inherent in the closely watched Consumer Price Index, which monitors the rate of inflation. Most economists view the index as one of the more reliable of the Government's statistics.
And at the moment, most economists say, the index seems to be giving an accurate reflection of inflation . Still, an understanding of some of its limitations can provide a better understanding of both individual circumstances and the shape of the economy overall.
Of the various criticisms leveled against the index, one of the most often cited is that it fails to adjust sufficiently for improvements in the quality of a product, such as faster computers, or more sophisticated medical care, or changes in the configuration of a product, such as automobile producers making more options standard. Some critics have suggested that taxes ought to be considered as a factor.
"We don't know how to measure all of these things," said Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. He cites banking services and computer software as areas where output -- and thus unit cost -- is particularly difficult to gauge.
Another source of confusion is that the price index is designed to measure inflation, not the cost of living. Its so-called basket of goods and services rarely changes even though in hard times consumers tend to substitute cheaper products for more expensive ones -- they eat hamburger instead of steak.
And even if the index were perfect, psychology suggests that perceptions of inflation would be skewed by everyday experience. The typical consumer observes the price of a gallon of gasoline daily but may well go for years without knowing, say, the going rate for a new roof.
 
Perception and Reality
 "People's perception of inflation tends to be higher than the actual inflation rate," said Jason Bram, associate economist at the Conference Board, a business research group.
In addition, producers and distributors find it relatively easy to impose big percentage increases on frequently purchased, low-priced goods such as candy or postage stamps. Consumers will notice but probably not object.
 One of the biggest criticisms of the consumer index comes from Albert Sindlinger, the veteran researcher whose data come from polling. Taxes should be not be left out, he said. By his calculations, an appropriately constructed index would show that, primarily because of taxes, consumer prices over the last year climbed more than twice as fast as the 5.3 percent posted by the Government's rate.
"Inflation is far from under control," Mr. Sindlinger insisted. His own inflation index was "in tandem" with the Government's throughout 1988 and 1989, he said, but it has jumped 13.5 percent over the last year.
To one degree or another, many economists agree with Mr. Sindlinger: Consumers have less money available now for discretionary purchases than is generally assumed, and they will be financially unable to fuel an economic rebound even though confidence has revived.
"Conceptually, he's right," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for the Manufacturers Hanover Company, who once created his own index of so-called nuisance items such as toothpaste and candy. "I wouldn't want to be pinned down to his specific number."
For all its deficiencies, the consumer index is defended by an array of private economists as well as its sponsors within the Labor Department.
Martin Fleming, chairman of the statistics committee of the National Association of Business Economists, and an economist for the Cahners Publishing Company, a Massachusetts-based company with a string of trade magazines, called it "one of the better" Government statistical series and said the omission of income taxes -- the consumer index does include excise and other taxes -- is quite proper.
"It really stretches the notion of what a consumer price index is" to calculate inflation as Mr. Sindlinger does, Mr. Fleming said, suggesting that in any event the burden of recent tax increases has fallen mainly on the well-to-do, who, among other things, lost a long-time favorable treatment on the sale of capital assets in the 1986 tax overhaul. .
During the early part of last year the consumer index almost certainly overstated inflation because of the foot-dragging way it measures housing, Mr. Fleming asserted. The Government includes six-month-old housing prices, which have the effect of overstating inflation when prices are in a downtrend. The cost of medical care, he added, is almost always too high because there is no prompt adjustment for quality improvements.

 
Britain Includes V.A.T.
 Over the last 20 years or so, considerable work has been done on how income and Social Security taxes might be incorporated into the consumer index so it would be more accurate for wage escalation and certain other purposes. Britain adopted such a gauge in the 1970's when it imposed a value added tax.
However, Government and academic researchers in this country have calculated that a tax and price index would have shown only moderately higher inflation than the consumer index, at least through the mid-1980's. According to Robert Gillingham, a former Labor Department official who is now a deputy assistant Treasury secretary, tax and price index inflation averaged 6.9 percent between 1967 and 1985, just seven-tenths of a point more than the 6.2 actually posted by the consumer index.
He said he was "skeptical" of Mr. Sindlinger's current results, asserting that there has been no appreciable increase in income taxes during the last year or so to cause the Sindlinger index to accelerate sharply. "There's some quirk going on if it's 13 instead of 6," Mr. Gillingham said, referring to the inflation rate.
Mr. Sindlinger said his information consisted of responses to a survey question he has asked consistently since 1972: Are all forms of taxes costing more, less or the same compared with a year earlier?
"It's a psychological question," Mr. Sindlinger said, acknowledging that many taxes, including property taxes, are directly or indirectly included in the consumer index. "It all comes from interviewing."
In the end, debate over whether the consumer index is significantly underestimating inflation can seem rather abstract to the householders on whose views Mr. Sindlinger has built a handsome business and who regard themselves, correctly or not, as financially pinched.
"Higher tax rates are cutting into disposable personal income," Mr. Sindlinger said. "Consumers are complaining to us -- and can't take much more."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
1992 Election Is Far Off, But Not Far Enough for Some

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is a measure of President Bush's strength and the opposition's woes that Democratic leaders have been selling a poignantly simple message in recent weeks: As one party strategist puts it, "Yes, Virginia, there will be a Presidential election in 1992."
Party leaders from Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to George J. Mitchell, the Senate Majority Leader, have found themselves defending, explaining and justifying the notable lack of activity in Democratic Presidential politics. They say the American public will be better served by a shorter campaign. They reject the notion that the Democratic nomination has become a hollow prize, devalued by the extraordinary post-war popularity of President Bush. 
 "The word is out that Democrats are in trouble, that we can't win the White House in '92, that our Senate majority could be in jeopardy, that there could be a massive realignment in the House and in the state legislatures in November 1992," Senator Lloyd Bentsen said in remarks prepared for delivery to a Democratic Party dinner in Detroit last night. "I don't believe a word of it, and you shouldn't either."
But it is easier to persuade people that Democrats will be competitive in the 1992 Presidential election when some of them actually begin to compete. As a result, many in the party breathed a sigh of relief in recent weeks as a few signs of incipient Presidential campaigns finally appeared.
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, the first black person ever elected governor, announced that he was forming a Presidential exploratory committee and embarked on a round of speeches and interviews about his "new mainstream" philosophy -- tempering traditional Democratic compassion with conservative fiscal policies.
Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee says he is giving active consideration to a second run for the Democratic nomination, and behaved like a candidate last week when he called on the Bush Administration to change its policy and provide more help to the Kurds of Iraq. Mr. Gore's stock has risen among many in his party because he was one of 10 Senate Democrats to vote for the resolution authorizing war in the Persian Gulf; that means he can approach foreign policy issues these days with something other than defensiveness.
There is stirring as well among some less well-positioned Democrats: Paul Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator, is considering a race, as is George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic nominee who lost 49 states. And the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has run twice before for the Democratic nomination, is flirting with a third try and says he will make a decision sometime this fall.
 
Biding Time
 But most of the political heavyweights -- including Senator Bentsen, Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt -- remain circumspect. Each has his personal reasons; Mr. Cuomo, for example, is still struggling with the New York State budget. But each also has the financial base, the political network and the name recognition that make it possible to enter the Presidential race much later than most candidates could.
Some broader forces are also slowing this race down.
Foremost is the lingering afterglow of the war. Some strategists say that the country is still on a wartime footing, in political terms, still rallying 'round the President and the flag. This makes it difficult and even dangerous to engage in partisan debate with the President.
 
Prime-Time Patriotism
 Last week, for example, CBS broadcast a special "All-Star Salute to Our Troops" in which Mr. Bush was presented as every inch the resolute Commander in Chief, part of a patriotic pageant. The fact that the show's co-executive producer was Roger Ailes, the President's media consultant in the 1988 campaign, only heightened the chagrin of some Democrats who watched.
The nation's post-war psychology also makes it hard for potential candidates and their advisers to assess the political landscape of 1992.
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted Monday through Wednesday, found Mr. Bush's job approval rating had dipped slightly from the historic levels recorded just after Operation Desert Storm, but was still at 80 percent. The telephone survey of 1,283 adults nationwide has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
No one knows how long these still-remarkable ratings can last. Many a Democrat can outline some turn of events whereby Mr. Bush becomes vulnerable: a worsening economy, further deterioration in the Persian Gulf, rising concern over domestic issues. What seems a hollow prize today, some argue, could turn into something worth having. Indeed, the latest unemployment figures -- the jobless rate rose to 6.8 percent in March, highest since late 1986 -- surely have given the White House pause. Moreover, Mr. Bush came under increasing criticism last week for the plight of the Kurds. At the very least, one Democratic strategist said, "You can see that soon we'll get back to a situation where you can have more normal political discourse in this country."
But it is a measure of the conventional wisdom about the Democrats' chances in 1992 that much of the talk here centers on the question of whether a candidate who runs next year will be helped or hindered for a 1996 race. Recent history would suggest that having run for the nomination before is a help; both Ronald Reagan and George Bush had previous campaigns under their belts before they ultimately prevailed. But the Democratic Party has not been kind, in recent years, to those who won the nomination but lost the election.
In the meantime, Democrats wait for the race to begin. Four years ago this week Gary Hart officially announced his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic nomination; he had a full-time staff of 36 and was the third Democrat to formally enter the race, after Mr. Gephardt and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt. Eight years ago this month, Democratic candidates were fighting it out in straw polls.
Today, Democrats are making do with a few signs of life.

HEADLINE: The Region: Q & A -- Klepper of the T.A.;
Keeping Riders In the Hard Stretch That Lies Ahead

 BODY:
ALAN F. KIEPPER, president of New York City's Transit Authority, took charge 13 months ago after an eight-year career in the Houston transportation system and 10 years in Atlanta's. His agency now has a $215 million budget gap, and service cuts and fare increases are almost certain. In an interview last week with Stephanie Strom, a reporter for The Times, Mr. Kiepper discussed the system, which transports millions of riders daily in 3,565 buses and over more than 700 miles of tracks, and what those riders might expect in a time of financial crisis. Here are excerpts from the interview. 
 Question. How will the Transit Authority solve its $215 million deficit?
Answer. I think it's going to take a fare increase. I think it's going to take budget cuts on the part of the Authority. It will take some additional assistance from the state, hopefully, and possibly from the city. I think probably what's going to happen is that sort of a patchwork will be knit together of assistance from all of those sources in order to keep us afloat. But it's got to come soon because we're trying to cut our expenses. There's certainly a level below which we can't cut unless we want to begin to dismantle the system. We haven't reached that yet, but if we don't get some help, we run the risk of doing that.
Q. Do you still plan to cut service by $15 million?
A. The service changes are under revision, but I'm certainly going to recommend that there be some changes. We really need the whole $15 million, but we have made some rather extensive modifications based on public comment that will probably yield about $9 million, if approved by the board. The bus substitutions for rail service have been taken out, and a number of the bus changes have been modified. We've taken the A train and made extensive changes in that. We still will run the A train to Washington Heights and Inwood, and it will run to 11 o'clock at night, which some people were very concerned about.
Q. Why should riders pay more for less?
A. There's no other way to balance the budget and keep the system running. I'm sure it's difficult for people to understand: service is being cut back, yet the fare is going up. Even at $1.50 -- and I'm not predicting that's where it will go -- it's the best bargain in town.
Q. How have you addressed the fear of crime in the subways?
A. When I came here a year ago, crime was increasing between 20 and 25 percent per month. We had what I would characterize as a moribund police department: morale was low. There was a very low police presence on the system. There was not a vigorous enforcement of regulations. There wasn't follow-up to assure that warrants issued were being effectively enforced.
Since October, we have had a decrease in crime every month. There is a much greater police presence now, and I believe the system is getting safer. The statistics bear that out. Only 3 percent of major crimes in New York occur in the subways. We had 27 homicides last year, which represented less than 1 percent of the total in the city.
Q. If the system is getting better, why are you losing customers?
A. I'm convinced that the main reason we're losing passengers now is that less people are going to work. There's been 100,000-plus jobs lost in New York over the last three years, and a lot of that has been in areas like finance, insurance and real-estate industries, which use stations in the Wall Street area. We're holding our own pretty well in some other areas. Most of our losses are concentrated in areas where we normally get heavy work trips on the subway. We're not attracting more customers, but we are making efforts to hold on to the ones we have in this recession.
Q. What efforts are you making?
A. We are working on the public address system, and making a special effort to get the fidelity and the operation up to snuff. We are proceeding with replacing or repairing all of the booth communication systems. The really big effort, which I think has been the most successful, has been the increase in personal security represented by the reinvigoration of the police. We're working on getting more customer amenities in stations, escalators, elevators, public address, customer service attitude on the part of employees.
Q. What are you doing to reduce fare evasion, which increased after the last fare hike?
A. Fare evasion reached its peak last August. We're proceeding to harden fare control areas by putting in new ironwork, eliminating slam gates. We have unarmed guards in some 70 stations, and the transit police are covering another 40 or so. In those where we have completed the ironwork and also have police protection and or property protection agents, we've reduced fare evasion by over 70 percent.
Q. Won't another fare hike increase the incidence of fare evasion?
A. I think there isn't any question about it. It's also going to discourage some riders. But we're in a dilemma. We get our funds from two sources: 55 percent come from the fare box and the remaining 45 percent is from subsidies. The only source of revenue that the Transit Authority and the M.T.A., its parent, control is the fare.
Q. Couldn't the authority cut its own expenses more instead of increasing fares?
A. We are cutting our expenses. We've got 3,000 less people working for the Transit Authority now than were on the payroll about 18 months ago, and it's gone down virtually every month. But eventually we also reach a point of diminishing returns because to maintain a decent level of service requires a certain number of people. Whether we carry 2,000 people on a train or 1,500 you still need the same number of people.
Q. Will the financial crisis force the authority to abandon the war on graffiti?
A. While we have had an increase in graffiti hits on our trains -- that is a fact -- you haven't seen any of them riding around the system. We are committed that whenever graffiti is identified, the train doesn't go out of the yard or goes out of service as soon as it completes its run.
Q. You have said there will be cuts in the car cleaning force. How can you continue to improve cleanliness in the subways?
A. We haven't distributed the people as efficiently as we should, and we can and have reduced the size of the cleaning force without really affecting the standard. We're also going to more automated types of cleaning. We can take a team of about six people with an automated mobile wash unit and we can clean a station in a matter of hours to a level that the mop-and-bucket crew couldn't do in six months.
Q. Are you doing anything to reduce the lines at token booths that resulted from the last fare hike?
A. Yes. We are trying to get people to use token vending machines and we're purchasing 75 more machines. We're getting good response to them. We're also entering into a number of cooperative marketing arrangements where we'll be doing cooperative promotion with fast-food and retail outlets. We're really trying to prepare for the fare card days under the automated fare collection system, so that people who ride the bus don't have to go to a subway station to buy a fare card.

Jittery Asia Has Visions Of a Nuclear North Korea

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
THE destruction of Saddam Hussein's nuclear capability in the opening hours of the Persian Gulf war was met with more than a little cheering here. It was the right idea, a senior South Korean official said recently, adding with a wry smile, "too bad it was the wrong reactor."
The candidate for destruction that he and many other Asians have in mind sits in a heavily guarded complex near Yongbyon, a town 60 miles north of Pyongyang, North Korea's capital. By various estimates, the increasingly isolated government of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's aging "Great Leader," may be only four or five years away from producing a crude but effective atomic bomb. If true, Mr. Kim is already far closer to becoming a nuclear power than Mr. Hussein ever was. And that prospect figures in virtually every disaster scene that the Americans, Japanese and now even the Soviets dream up about the balance of power in Asia in the 1990's. 
Though North Korea signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty more than five years ago, Mr. Kim has refused to allow international inspectors to see the Yongbyon reactor. While contending that the reactor is for peaceful purposes, Mr. Kim insists that inspection will be permitted only when the United States withdraws its nuclear arsenal from the South.
Mr. Kim's refusal is taking its toll on his country. After initial confusion and hesitation, Japan has finally made it clear to Pyongyang that the price of diplomatic relations with the North, and its accompanying billions of dollars in Japanese aid to its moribund economy, is regular inspection of the plant. Even the Soviets, who gave Mr. Kim the technology that got him started, have joined in, and restraining North Korea's nuclear ambitions may be the only substantive issue Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu agree on when the Soviet leader lands in Tokyo in 10 days.
But no one expects Mr. Kim to back down soon, especially if he hopes to block South Korea's growing relationship with his former patrons. Over the past year the Soviets have established diplomatic relations with the South, and now South Korean companies are rushing to offer Mr. Gorbachev what he cannot get from Pyongyang: investment, consumer goods and some basic industrial technology. Soviet officials have already agreed to support South Korea's application for entry into the United Nations, a move the North opposes. Pyongyang may hope to use a promise to abandon the program as leverage -- either to get American forces out of the Korean Peninsula, or to win better terms in the sputtering negotiations between North and South.
 
Reactor With a Guest House
 Officials in the South -- to say nothing of the Japanese -- are increasingly unnerved by what they are learning about the North Korean nuclear program. They are acutely aware that one of North Korea's few successful exports these days is an improved version of the Soviet-made Scud missile. Seoul is so close to North Korea that the South Korean Government decided recently not to buy a Patriot missile defense system, because it would not have time to react to a launching from the North. Nervousness was only increased last fall, when American defense intelligence and nuclear experts came through Tokyo and Seoul with the latest spy satellite photographs of the plant itself.
According to descriptions from officials who have seen the photographs, there is an unusually big "research" reactor and a much larger one under construction. They are all powered by natural uranium mined in North Korea and Japanese experts say the new reactor should have an output of 100,000 to 200,000 kilowatts. That, in turn, should produce spent fuel that should yield between 20 and 50 kilograms of plutonium every year, plenty for upwards of a half-dozen simple nuclear devices. A plant to refine the fuel into weapons-grade material appears to be under construction. Experts laugh when they hear North Korea's protests that the reactor is for research into power generation.
"Everything is there except transformers and power lines," says Toshibumi Sakata, the director of Tokai University's Research and Information Center. Higher resolution spy satellites, the Japanese say, show anti-aircraft guns around the plant -- and a guest house, perhaps for Mr. Kim.
 A nuclear-armed North Korea would undoubtedly spur the South to revive a nuclear program that it reluctantly shelved -- or said it shelved -- in the 1970's at American insistence. Another unknown is the Japanese, who themselves are within Scud range.
The other night in Tokyo, a senior Japanese diplomat began speculating that if North Korea gets the bomb, right-wing groups will push for Japan to abandon its commitment to stay nuclear-free. "I can't think of any scenario in which a majority of Japanese would say 'Yes, Japan should go nuclear,' " cautioned the diplomat. But if North Korea remains so evasive on inspection, he said, "it will increase anxieties, and there would be people who would ask, 'Can we rely on the Americans?' "
 Indeed, politics, not technology, is the only obstacle to Japan's building a nuclear deterrent. It already has some of the world's most sophisticated nuclear-power generating equipment, and to many engineers building a compact nuclear weapon seems less daunting than building a 64-megabit memory chip.
"How long would it take Japan?" mused Richard Rhodes, the author of "The Making of the Atomic Bomb." "About three months."
A Japanese government expert, asked about the estimate recently, thought about it for a few seconds and then said, "Yes, it might take that long."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
A Double Dose of Pain for the Poor

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN their State of the State messages this year, many of the nation's governors emphasized the importance of investing in the health and welfare of children, even as they proposed cutbacks in social welfare programs serving low- income families with children.
This seeming contradiction symbolizes the plight of the poor in 1991. The states, ever more burdened in the decade since Ronald Reagan's "new federalism" began shifting a host of new responsibilities to them, are less able to meet those responsibilities because the recession has dried up tax revenue. The resulting cuts in state budgets often have a disproportionate effect on the poor, who depend on public welfare and public services more than other citizens. 
 One example: Michigan officials last month cut 17 percent from payments in the main Federal-state welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Gerald H. Miller, director of the Department of Social Services under Michigan's new Republican Governor, John Engler, said in an interview that the cuts were "very devastating" and might well result in increased evictions and an increase in people who "will not be able to purchase basic needs like soap."
 
Shrinking Benefits
 The across-the-board welfare cuts shaved $85 off the average payment of $501 a month for a family in Michigan, reducing public assistance grants below the levels in effect in May 1988.
Many state legislatures are still in session, so it is too early to say for sure how the latest state budget problems are affecting the nation's most vulnerable residents. But legislators in almost every state have considered cuts in health, welfare or housing programs, even as the demand for assistance rises. The states' current problems represent the culmination of a trend that has been developing for several years.
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute with liberal leanings, said, "If we look at governors' proposals and state legislative actions to date, the results suggest that 1991 will be a year when poor people suffer the largest budget cuts since Ronald Reagan's first year as President in 1981." Mr. Reagan's cuts, in programs like welfare and food stamps, affected mainly the working poor and those just over the official poverty line. But Mr. Greenstein said that cuts being made or contemplated by states this year would also hit some of the "poorest of the poor," those with incomes of less than 75 percent or even 50 percent of the official poverty level.
Robert Rector, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, contends that reports of cutbacks in selected welfare programs are misleading. "Overall spending for welfare programs continues to grow considerably faster than the rate of inflation," he said.
State officials report that the number of households receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children rose in January for the 18th consecutive month, to 4.3 million, and the number of individual welfare recipients reached 12.3 million, up 8.8 percent from January 1990. In the first month of this year, 105,000 children were added to the rolls, bringing the total number of child welfare recipients to 8.3 million.
As the welfare population has increased, the purchasing power of their benefits has decreased. From 1970 to 1990, the maximum benefit for a three-person family in a typical state grew to $364 a month, from $184. But that increase lagged behind the rise in consumer prices. After adjusting for inflation, the purchasing power of that welfare income declined by 39 percent.
California is one of the few states where welfare benefits kept up with inflation, partly because of a state law that automatically increased benefits for inflation. But California withheld the cost-of-living increase this year, and Stephen K. Larsen, chief of welfare policy at the state Department of Social Services, said that for the 1991-92 fiscal year, officials wanted to reduce the grants for the first time in memory.
Facing a revenue shortfall of more than $12 billion in the coming year, the new Governor of California, Pete Wilson, has proposed that welfare benefits be cut by 8.8 percent. That would reduce the maximum payment for a family of three, now $694 a month, to $633, the level prevailing in early 1988. Mr. Wilson, a Republican, has also proposed eliminating a program that provides cash to homeless families to pay for temporary shelter while they search for permanent housing. The proposals are pending before the California Legislature, where the outcome depends on negotiations to resolve the state's budget crisis.
Governor Wilson has resisted calls by some Democrats for an increase in the state's personal income tax, contending that such increases could worsen the state's economic problems. Noting the Governor's position, Casey S. McKeever, a lawyer at the Western Center on Law and Poverty, a legal aid group in Sacramento, asserted: "Poorer families are singled out for special attack in this budget. No other group has been asked to suffer as much as needy families with children."
In Illinois, Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, proposed to reduce a state welfare program known as general assistance by forcing local governments to pick up a larger share of the tab for payments to able-bodied adults.
 
Where's the Money?
 The state now pays about 90 percent of program costs; under Mr. Edgar's proposal, the state and localities would share costs equally. Where Chicago and local townships are supposed to get the money is not clear. The Governor's proposal would also set a six-month limit on general assistance payments to adults; there is no time limit now.
In addition, Mr. Edgar is proposing a 5 percent cut in Medicaid payments to hospitals and doctors who treat the indigent, and he wants to curtail some of the Medicaid services that are optional under Federal law: dental, optometric, podiatric and chiropractic services, and hospice care for the terminally ill.
Alicia S. Pelrine, director of human resources at the National Governors Association, said that about half the states, burdened by new Federal mandates for maternity and child care, were cutting back optional Medicaid services and optional coverage of people who are not necessarily poverty-stricken, but whose resources have been depleted by high medical bills.
No program causes governors more distress than Medicaid. They feel powerless to control it because the cost of health care is soaring and the Federal Government is continually mandating expanded eligibility and additional services. Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican, describes Medicaid as "the Pac-Man of the state budget," because it gobbles up an ever-growing share of state revenues. Washington and the states split the cost of Medicaid, with Washington's share ranging from 50 percent to about 80 percent, depending on a state's per capita income.
 
Ax-Wielding in Ohio

In Ohio, Gov. George V. Voinovich, facing what he calls "a budget problem unparalleled in Ohio history," has proposed ending the state's general assistance program, which now provides $300 million a year in aid to poor people. He would replace it with two smaller programs costing the state $195 million. "Most Ohioans have had enough welfare, enough poverty, enough drugs, enough crime," he said in his State of the State speech last month.
In Maine, Democratic state legislators beat back efforts to cut the Medicaid program this year. "The low-income population has less ability to bear the brunt of the state's fiscal problems," said State Representative Charlene B. Rydell, a Democrat who heads the health committee of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"In hard times," she said, "government becomes much more important as a safety net to people who are suffering the most."

Atlanta and the Olympics: The Games Have Already Begun

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
WHEN Atlanta pulled off the remarkable coup of being chosen to host the 1996 summer Olympics, it marked the culmination of a zealous marketing effort aimed at portraying an image of unity, prosperity and racial harmony.
So much for the easy part. Now, as the $1.2 billion effort to stage the games gears up, it is occurring in a place that seldom bears much resemblance to the idealized blend of Martin Luther King and Scarlett O'Hara sold to the International Olympic Committee. 
 Instead, the process has begun with a power struggle between the overwhelmingly white group that won the games and the black Mayor of a city that is 70 percent black; an upscale neighborhood's successful effort to block a proposed Olympic tennis stadium and protests by residents of two inner city neighborhoods who fear the games will displace the poor.
For the most part, Atlanta is still basking in the glow of the Olympic victory. Almost everyone agrees that the games, if handled right, could provide an infusion of resources for the poor as well as a luminous platform and a business bonanza for the city.
"The power and the passion of the people is clearly on the side of staging a successful games consistent with the leadership that we've developed," said Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. "This is a situation where everybody can win."
But there is also widespread recognition that the effort to stage the games will be played out over a Byzantine power grid, along numerous fault lines of race and class. Potential conflicts include not just interracial ones, but also intraracial ones -- some low income blacks are suspicious of the alliance between black politicians and the city's business interests.
"This is not a settled time in urban life anywhere and certainly not in Atlanta," said Steve Suitts, executive director of the Southern Regional Council, a non-profit civil rights and educational group here. "If the economics of the games look good, that creates some elbow room for some real accommodation of interests. But if you have projections showing that large deficits are a possibility, then I think it's going to be messy and unpleasant and enduringly so."
Almost no one took much notice in 1987 when Mr. Payne, a real estate lawyer and former University of Georgia football star, came up with what seemed like the wildly eccentric idea of trying to bring the Olympics to Atlanta. Along the way, the committee enlisted the support of broad segments of the community without relinquishing any control.
When Atlanta's bid won its surprise victory, governmental bodies woke up to find the private Olympic committee dominated by affluent whites in control of what is likely to be the largest economic enterprise in the history of a city that, despite the economic boom that has enriched its suburbs, remains one of the nation's poorest. Putting on the games will involve an estimated $418 million in construction, including a new Olympic stadium, Olympic village and two high-rise housing towers.
After some edgy negotiations, the city and the Olympic committee worked out an agreement that left the committee firmly in control, but already several politically and racially sensitive issues have arisen.
Some residents of the Summerhill area, a poor black neighborhood parts of which were bulldozed 25 years ago for the construction of the Atlanta-Fulton County stadium, have vowed to stop construction of the Olympic stadium planned for their neighborhood.
"They came in here 25 years ago and took over people's homes," said Ethel M. Mathews, an organizer of the effort to stop the stadium. "They disappeared like ants. We want the Olympics to come to Atlanta, but we don't want them to take our homes to build parking lots."
Atlanta City Council President Marvin Arrington last week proposed that another low-income housing project, the Techwood homes be demolished to make way for housing for the Olympics. After the games are over, the facilities would be used as dramatically upgraded housing for the poor, he said.
Residents there are leery.
"I would like to see some community-based people sitting on the boards," said Maggie Smith, president of the tenants association at Techwood homes. "Right now the only thing everybody's interested in is the Olympics coming here and making money out of it."
But Atlanta's politics have come along way since the stadium was built in Summerhill. For instance, Mr. Payne said the Olympics will have the most aggressive minority business program in the city's history.
"There's no question those people's voices are heard in a way they were not 25 years ago," said Mr. Suitts.
One reason for optimism is what could be an economic windfall expected to come from European television rights, which are now expected to bring in at least twice the $125 million organizers had anticipated. Such a cushion could facilitate some of the economic and political trade-offs needed to satisfy the disparate interests.
But some observers question whether the group is prepared for the turmoil that could develop.
"The real question is how this is handled over the next several years, not by public relations people, but by people who are politically sensitive," said Alvin Boskoff, an Emory University sociologist. "And I don't think the members of that committee are politically sensitive."
Mr. Payne thinks his committee is up to the job.
"I don't expect anything that is going to be a challenge to the successful staging of the games," he said. "I see some things that are going to require the full measure of our business and political acumen, but we're not exactly rookies at this. We know what we're doing."

Bo Jackson, who knows baseball, football, endorsements and commercials, last week ended his brief acquaintance with unemployment. Jackson, who sustained a career-threatening hip injury while running the football for the Los Angeles Raiders three months ago, was released last month by his baseball team, the Kansas City Royals, after the team doctor concluded that the outfielder's career might be over. During the two-week waiver period that followed, no team showed an interest in taking on his $2.4 million Royals contract with no guarantee that he could play. But then Jackson was up for bids, and the Chicago White Sox spoke up. The team will pay him as little as $700,000 for one year or, if his hip and his hitting hold up, as much as $8.15 million over three years. But the deal could mean more to Jackson than any White Sox pay check. Since his football days are over, the end of his baseball career might also have meant an end to his endorsements, which reportedly bring him about $5 million a year.

HEADLINE: Why the Rich Should Pay an Extra Tax Share

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Why is the rate of income tax higher for income above a certain level? That question is asked by J. Thomas Pearson (letter, March 18), who objects to richer people paying an extra share of tax, and it indicates the failure of our schools to educate their students on the history of income sharing in the United States. 
 Our country, like every capitalist country, has the problem noted by Will and Ariel Durant (authors of the monumental books on the history of civilization) of the tendency of wealth to become increasingly concentrated. People with surplus capital are the ones who can seize new opportunities to gain more wealth, and their economic power generally provides political power, which can influence government decisions favoring their ventures.
Land subsidies for railroads, and mail subsidies for steamships and airlines are classic examples.
The battle waged against industrial trusts by President Theodore Roosevelt was one attempt to limit the power of concentrated wealth. President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to limit the concentration of wealth and its transmission from one generation to another through sharply progressive income taxes and high inheritance taxes.
In the long run, the wealthy have managed to circumvent or undo antitrust and progressive taxation legislation, and the result has been a continuing concentration of wealth and political power, which undermines the economic and social health of our country.
The disposable income of poor people is steadily eroded by ever higher sales taxes. At the same time, the old stock transfer tax, which was like a sales tax for the rich, was ended, and our government officials fear reinstating it because stock brokerage houses might move elsewhere, rather than pay it, notwithstanding the dire need of revenue to sustain essential services and the quality of life in New York City, which could be the beneficiary.

HEADLINE: Why the Rich Should Pay an Extra Tax Share;
Less Local Freedom

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Seymour J. Harris argues (letter, March 26) that state and local taxes should become deductible from (a credit against) Federal income taxes. This is a dangerous proposal and would prove counterproductive. 
 Under this scheme, state and local governments would be able to increase their expenditures manyfold, indeed right up to the level of the Federal taxes that are paid by their districts, without any increase in the total tax liability of their constituents, and therefore without any political resistance.
This would remove all restraint on such spending. Finance for needed schools, highways and police would become easier, but so would indulgence in less useful or even outright wasteful projects.
I suspect that almost all state and local authorities would exploit their new freedom to spend unwisely. But even if only a minority did so, it would be necessary to control them by imposing nationwide guidelines on local spending.
The result would be less local freedom to set priorities, Mr. Harris's goal, not more.

RAINMAKER
The Saga of Jeff Beck, Wall Street's Mad Dog.
By Anthony Bianco.
Illustrated. 486 pp. New York: Random House. $25.  
 Wall Street's deal makers of the 1980's created for themselves the aura of supermen, individuals who were worthy of millions of dollars a year in compensation. They saw themselves reshaping the course of American economic history through their financial wizardry. It was a glorious story, one that served the interests both of the subjects and of the many writers and journalists who latched on to it to symbolize the money era. But since the beginning of 1990, as once-mighty companies hobbled with alarming frequency into bankruptcy court, the story has come to an abrupt end.
Anthony Bianco, a senior writer for Business Week, has chosen to tell this story one more time. Readers may wonder why he bothered.
"Rainmaker" chronicles the travels through Wall Street of Jeff Beck, an investment banker with a reputation for irreverence. He was a man who lived the money myth of the 1980's, as well as a number of myths he created himself.
Mr. Bianco appears to find Mr. Beck worthy of a biography because, in his words, "this compulsive liar's peculiarly excruciating fate was to be a man more honest than the times in which he lived." But Mr. Bianco seems to have lost his own ability to distinguish between illusion and reality in this deeply flawed book.
Mr. Beck was not content in his false belief that he was a controlling force in the tumult of economic change. He permitted nothing in his life to be unexceptional, pouring out a stream of lies to his associates, to his wife, even to his psychiatrist, about his present and his past. Mr. Beck regaled listeners with tales of his adventures in the Vietnam War, although his military experience was limited to the Army Reserve. He told colleagues and Mr. Bianco that he held "vast hidden interests" worth billions of dollars at the same time that he was struggling to maintain his princely standard of living on his multimillion-dollar compensation. When pressed about discrepancies in his fabrications, he would lie about secret undercover work with the Government, somehow involving the Central Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Beck told his lies as he, like many others, was rising rapidly on Wall Street. He attained the position of head of mergers and acquisitions at Oppenheimer & Company, and eventually landed a job as an investment banker at Drexel Burham Lambert Inc., the firm whose junk bonds fueled the takeover craze. Eventually, his manic excitement spread to Hollywood, where he befriended the actor Michael Douglas. He worked as a consultant for the movie "Wall Street," and even won himself a bit part in the film. He left Wall Street in 1990 and is now "building a superior body" with the goal of competing in Hawaii's Iron Man Triathlon.
Much of this may sound familiar. Last year, in one of the longest articles in its history, The Wall Street Journal chronicled Mr. Beck's life and lies on Wall Street.
Mr. Bianco writes that readers should plow through his 486 pages because the Journal piece "didn't go nearly far enough in unmasking Beck." But unmasking does not seem to be Mr. Bianco's real goal. "Rainmaker" reads less like an effort to uncover a fraud than one to defend a friend and justify the author's own toil.
Mr. Bianco admits early on that he and the deal maker are good friends who originally planned to collaborate on a book about Mr. Beck's life. As described here, that effort collapsed, and Mr. Bianco took up the project on his own. But the relationship between Mr. Bianco and Mr. Beck became so close that it is difficult to understand how the author expected to remain objective.
In one of several disturbing scenes, Mr. Bianco travels with Mr. Beck to the Hotel du Cap d'Antibes in the south of France, one of the most expensive hotels in the world. While it is not clear who paid for this trip, Mr. Bianco indicates that the exclusive resort would not have allowed him to come were it not for Mr. Beck. The many episodes of the two men playing tennis, sunbathing and relaxing certainly raise questions about Mr. Bianco's objectivity.
In one of these scenes, Mr. Bianco and Mr. Beck notice a beautiful woman swimming in the pool. Through his connections at the hotel, Mr. Beck finds out the woman's identity, sends her a bottle of champagne and invites her and a friend to dinner. Soon, Mr. Bianco is "wooing" the woman Mr. Beck helped him meet.
Mr. Bianco takes his closeness with his subject one step further when he attacks those who have criticized Mr. Beck, at times without answering their arguments. And he accepts many anecdotes and accusations at face value from a man he calls a liar.
Details piled on details give "Rainmaker" its heft. But Mr. Bianco recently condensed the essential elements of his book into 12 pages for New York magazine. The sad part is, nothing of significance was lost.

HEADLINE: Mayor Dinkins: Every Day a Test

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts; Sam Roberts is urban affairs columnist for The New York Times.

 BODY:
On a blustery afternoon last month, two of New York's top labor leaders mounted the steps of City Hall to blast the Mayor they had helped elect. "The head stinks," said Stanley Hill, leader of the city's largest municipal union. Barry Feinstein, president of the teamsters' local that represents city workers, exploded: "This administration is going into the toilet."
New York politics is often indistinguishable from theater, but on this day the anger was genuine. The city's union leaders, a keystone in the coalition that brought David N. Dinkins to office, had just been humiliated before their own members. Philip R. Michael, the city budget director, had privately assured the financial community that the city was negotiating to have the unions defer part of their newly won wage increases. The word got out, and now the unions were howling for Michael's scalp. 
 They didn't get it. Instead, three days later, Dinkins summoned his labor commissioner, Eric J. Schmertz, to Gracie Mansion, the restored 18th-century country home on the Upper East Side that serves as the Mayor's official residence. Schmertz, it turned out, had suggested to Michael that wage deferrals might indeed be in the offing. And Dinkins had decided that Schmertz, who had been organized labor's favorite for the job, would take the fall -- not Michael, recruited from Wall Street. "I think," Schmertz recalls Dinkins saying solemnly, "your usefulness is at an end."
Those eight words marked a defining moment for this Mayor and his administration. Dinkins couldn't recall ever having dismissed anyone before. In choosing Michael over Schmertz to vindicate his administration, he signaled that his immediate priority would be to establish fiscal credibility rather than to please his natural constituency and the fragile coalition that had elected him.
The ouster of Schmertz, and the agonized balancing of interests that led to that decision, also underscored what may be the most important single fact about David Dinkins: he is a minority mayor. The word resonates on several levels. First, Dinkins is acutely conscious of his precarious position as a black man being judged by a white society. Second, he won the slimmest of victories in the mayoral election by carefully holding together a coalition of minority interests. Finally, he governs a city of minorities, seeking to apportion its diminishing resources equitably among the myriad racial and ethnic groups that form the New York he likes to call a "gorgeous mosaic."
No decision is made at City Hall without passing through this complicated layering, as if through a triple filter. In surveying the five boroughs of New York, Dinkins sees an infinitely complex, restive concatenation of competing groups and special pleaders, whose interests he must weigh, balance and respond to. "You are my base," he once told a group of black supporters at Sylvia's, a soul-food landmark in Harlem, "but I have to be Mayor of all the people of the city of New York."
 DAVID DINKINS WAS ELECTED IN 1989 AS NEW York's first new mayor in 12 years and its first black mayor ever. Although it was the narrowest victory since 1905, his election was a milestone, a powerful symbol of change in a city where non-Hispanic whites, although they still control the levers of economic power, no longer constitute a majority. Belatedly -- New York was the last of America's 10 largest cities to elect a mayor who was black, female or Hispanic -- the city's politics had caught up to its demographics.
Unusually for a large American city, no single racial or ethnic group in New York constitutes a majority. Blacks, who make up about a quarter of the population, are nearly outnumbered by Hispanic residents. Newer groups are jockeying for supremacy or, in some cases, simple recognition. When Dinkins greeted the Indian consul general in February, it was suggested that the traditional political itinerary for New York office-seekers -- Ireland, Italy and Israel -- be expanded to include a fourth "I," India. The Mayor, who has already visited Italy and Israel, politely explained that he had accepted an invitation to tour Africa first.
Dinkins was chosen as the instrument to defeat Edward I. Koch, the three-term incumbent, not in spite of his race, but largely because of it. As the most prominent black city official -- he served as Manhattan Borough President -- he was uniquely positioned to unite a coalition embracing organized labor, liberal whites, and black and Hispanic New Yorkers, an alliance that had signaled its potential just the year before by delivering the city to the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the Democratic Presidential primary. The voter-registration campaign that had been mounted for Jackson set the stage for Dinkins's victory; a final boost came when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a week before the 1989 mayoral primary, coyly hinted that whichever candidate could best bring a racially divided city together would win.
Dinkins was a touch-and-feel politician, a product of the Democratic clubhouse whose secret weapon was his Rolodex. As a party regular he had shaken so many hands over the years -- especially in the quasi-ministerial post of borough president -- that, despite his race, he emerged almost as a candidate of the status quo. "No Jewish politician has gone to more Jewish events," says Ken Sunshine, who last year held the thankless job of arranging the Mayor's schedule. "Eighty percent of success is showing up," Woody Allen once said. "David," says Basil A. Paterson, a close friend and former law partner of the Mayor, "was always showing up."
But when Dinkins began showing up as Mayor, he seemed to be a stranger in two worlds. The white establishment, which he had cultivated for years, was wary of a black mayor with a progressive agenda. And, as recession forced him into the no-win position of allocating losses, his own constituency became estranged, particularly poor blacks, embittered that hard times were deferring their dreams. Moreover, a revised City Charter required him to tolerate a newly assertive City Council, which gained enhanced powers over the city budget, land use and other mayoral prerogatives.
Still, during 15 months as Mayor, Dinkins has bridged a mammoth budget gap, laid the groundwork for a vastly expanded police force and revolutionary strategies for deploying it, cajoled commodities exchanges to remain in New York, snared next year's Democratic National Convention for his city and organized a hero's welcome for Nelson R. Mandela.
Yet those brief celebratory moments have been muffled by a painfully deliberate, measured style. An asset in the race against the loud, combative Koch, that style has often made Dinkins look indecisive and reluctant to lead, aloof and out of touch with the passions that move his city. Dinkins contrasts his style with Koch's. "It's easy to get angry," he says. "It's a lot more difficult to maintain composure in the face of difficult circumstances, and I, frankly, don't think people want to see a mayor out of control." Yet in trying to project self-restraint and a dignified aura, and to adhere to his own timetable, the Mayor has often appeared so detached from events that it seemed he was not in control.
In one particularly chaotic week last October, he adopted stances that might have been defensible individually but, taken together, seemed bewildering, naive and reactive. Only days after negotiating a surprisingly generous raise for the city's schoolteachers, his administration hinted that as many as 15,000 city workers would have to be laid off. At the same time Dinkins announced his plan for an expanded police force. During a crime wave last summer, the public had become fixated on the goal of hiring 5,000 more police officers, but Dinkins, in what seemed a remarkable display of obstinacy, refused to commit himself to any specific figure until a review of the department's needs had been completed. Dinkins lamely suggested that his apparent reticence on the issue was intentional: by stalling, he helped create a constituency for positions he had wanted to advance anyway.
It's a bitter commentary that a Mayor who has begun what could be the biggest police-force expansion in New York's history, in a city for which crime is the top priority, has been reduced to pleading for credit -- financial credit from Wall Street, and approval from the New Yorkers he governs.
With potential challengers thinking they smelled the blood of a lame duck, Dinkins's political hold seemed so tenuous only a year into his first term that he felt compelled last month to declare that he would be a candidate for re-election in 1993. He also issued an unusually pointed appeal, as guest host on a black radio station to galvanize his base: 'There are a lot of folks who are not pleased that I am Mayor," he said. "There are a lot of folks who don't want me to be right nohow under any circumstances." Beleaguered and reeling, the Mayor of all the people was pleading for understanding from his bedrock constituency in his hour of need.
 THE GENTLEMANLY demeanor and reticence that helped elect Dinkins but now threatens to undo him as Mayor was shaped, in part, by a calculated strategy: how to survive on white terms in a largely white world. "David learned a long time ago, that as a black person you couldn't afford to get angry if you're going to exercise power," says Percy E. Sutton, a mentor and a predecessor as Manhattan Borough President.
For the same reason, Dinkins has scrupulously avoided casting himself as a victim because of his race. When asked if he thinks he is held to a different standard because he is black, he says, "You could stick needles under my fingernail; you would not get me to respond in the affirmative to that, because that will be seen by many as hiding behind color."
Yet race remains the prism through which many New Yorkers view their Mayor, and through which the Mayor sees himself and his city. According to Koch, it has shielded Dinkins from tough assessments from whites: "We tiptoe around criticism because we're afraid of hurting his feelings or the feelings of his black constituents."
Blacks tend to see the matter differently. Representative Charles B. Rangel, whose district includes Harlem, says Dinkins has been regarded with suspicion and subjected to tougher standards because of his race. He compares him to a white basketball player coming to Harlem, where spectators would say, "Sure he should be given a chance, but let's watch him very carefully."
Although some of the Mayor's wounds have been self-inflicted, Rangel's remark rings true. While the new Mayor was no more irresolute about his budget than President Bush was about his budget last fall, nobody asked whether Bush was up to the job, as they did about Dinkins.
But it's not only whites who are scrutinizing the Mayor. Blacks, who expected Dinkins to be "a superman," according to Basil Paterson, are watching closely too, fearful lest the Mayor decide to appease the financial community by cutting services rather than raising taxes. Dinkins, "has to do some demonstrable things to show he's not just cutting everything to satisfy the Wall Street people," says Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr., president of Bronx Community College, who is black.
So intense is the scrutiny, so heated the competition for scarce money, that at times, evenhandedness can be seen as inherently unfair. "It's not the same to please the Wall Street community coming out of a decade of excess as to please the lady from the Bronx who has no health care," says Dennis Rivera, head of the hospital workers' union.
Indeed, the effort to treat all New Yorkers equally, to please everyone and offend no one, has on occasion produced a kind of moral gridlock. When blacks boycotted a Brooklyn grocery store owned by Korean immigrants, the Mayor seemed so reluctant to slight either group that he alienated both. His failure suggested naivete in assuming that black militants had an investment in his success and contradicted one of his most appealing campaign claims: that he was a conciliator who could keep the peace. (His administration speedily settled a subsequent boycott in Queens, though.)
Race is also the lens through which Dinkins has privately filtered criticism, whether aimed at his handling of the budget, the hand-carved headboard his wife chose for Gracie Mansion, or his passion for tennis. He tends to interpret negative press coverage as having a racial component but stoically subdues his indignation, wrapping his feelings in a protective layer of bland verbiage and baroque syntax. (Despite his formality and his avuncular profile, he can be testy and curt in private, peppering his remarks with the occasional expletive.)
Reporters need the persistence of a picador to pierce Dinkins's thick protective hide. But on rare occasions he hints at his irritation. Perhaps, Dinkins says of the press's early obsession with his tennis game, people "would react differently if I shot basketball hoops."
Race has undeniably been a variable in any number of mayoral equations -- even in controversies that were not overtly racial. One factor in Dinkins's eagerness to show financial discipline, Paterson says, was that "blacks have not been associated with fiscal concerns, but with taking care of people." Last fall, when Governor Cuomo broached the possibility that the state's Financial Control Board might usurp authority from the city's first black mayor, Dinkins cautioned a businessman: "If the F.C.B. tries to take over, the Korean boycott would be nothing compared to that."
Earlier, Dinkins had been criticized for apparently capitulating to disgruntled correction officers who blockaded the city's jail complex on Rikers Island. He later explained privately that he had feared violence if mostly white police officers were deployed against predominantly black and Hispanic guards.
Race even figured in Dinkins's decision to attend the United States Open tennis tournament in Queens rather than fly to Utah for the funeral of a white tourist slain in a Manhattan subway station. "Expectations are raised about what I should do," he said. "What is the message I send to the families of other people who got killed?" -- meaning the black and Hispanic families whose sons constitute the majority of murder victims in the city. "When he errs," says Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen, whom Dinkins dispatched to the funeral instead, "he errs on the side of decency."
So complex have New York's racial and ethnic politics become, that even a visit to Israel, a matter of course for Koch, became a political mine field for his successor. In January, responding to a request from the Jewish Community Relations Council, Dinkins flew to Israel as a gesture of solidarity with the Jewish state, then under siege from Iraqi missiles. It was emblematic of the dilemma of a minority mayor that not everyone was delighted with his decision. A number of blacks, including some who opposed the Persian Gulf war altogether, complained that he was catering to the Jewish community again; some Jews suggested the Mayor was guilty of pandering. Arab-Americans demanded that he visit Jordan, too. Dinkins responded that he was demonstrating solidarity not only with Jews in Israel, but also with American soldiers in the Middle East -- nearly a third of them black. One week later, the scribbled message he inserted in Jerusalem's Western Wall covered all bases: "I pray for peace here and everywhere in the world," he wrote, "and for freedom in South Africa."
If war was hell for Dinkins, peace wasn't much better. When a radio reporter handed him the opportunity to announce a homecoming parade for American troops, the Mayor balked. The city couldn't afford it, he said. Moreover, he cautioned that encouraging private benefactors to subsidize a celebration would only invite complaints that the money could better be spent on enduring projects like libraries. This was the response of a junior accountant, not a mayor in tune with the mood of his city. "Millions for Mandela, but not one cent for American heroes," a white civic leader said tartly. Once again, Dinkins lagged behind a public desperate for leadership or, at least, for diversion. Four days after the radio interview, the Mayor reversed himself. He announced that, solely through private philanthropy, returning troops would receive a hero's -- and, as he made sure to mention, a "she-ro's" -- welcome in the city's greatest official greeting ever.
 IN TENNIS, A DINK IS A deceptively weak shot. In Gaelic, it's an elegant dresser. Growing up in Trenton and, briefly, in Harlem, serving in the Marine Corps, and attending Howard University, David Norman Dinkins was called Dink, and the nickname was prophetic. The Dinkins style of governing is a direct extension of his tennis game. He prefers singles "because it's all you -- you don't have to worry what your partner's doing." The Mayor, says Sid Davidoff, a lobbyist and sometime court rival, "has a weak serve and not a very good backhand. You don't get the killer shot. But he stands there and goes from side to side. And, if you play his baseline game, he'll lull you and finally wear you out."
That is the Mayor's game plan. Having defied the skeptics by winning office, Dinkins, stubborn and at times sanctimonious, follows his personal convictions now more than ever. He loathes critical advice. Even Rangel, Paterson and Sutton, the members of Harlem's old guard who were his mentors and under whom he served perhaps too long an apprenticeship, have been reluctant to second-guess him. Paterson, a skilled mediator, was stunned that he was never asked to help resolve the Brooklyn grocery boycott. The decision seemed to reflect Dinkins's burning desire for personal vindication -- to stand on the shoulders of those who had come before, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. put it, but without holding anyone else's hand.
After a quarter-century in public life, however, Dinkins has remarkably unsophisticated political instincts. He has also been slow to transcend his previous job, in which reaching a decision loomed as an end in itself, and to shed a management style in which moderation sometimes seemed to be a goal rather than a consequence of good government. There are signs of late, though, that he has turned a corner, that feeling more self-assured, he has begun to project some of the decisiveness and leadership that he has displayed behind closed doors -- qualities I saw when, for this article, the Mayor overcame his antipathy to letting the press see him in an unscripted setting and allowed me to accompany him for two full days in private and in public. At times, his performance fully lived up to the expectations of his critics: detached, uncommunicative and perpetually late. But another Dinkinsemerged, a decisive and demanding Mayor who demonstrated flashes of potential -- tantalizing pulses that, if sustained, could propel him from being the right candidate at the right time to being the right Mayor as well.
 DINKINS'S FIRST PUBLIC appearance is at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx for a breakfast meeting of the 48th Precinct community conference. The Mayor's mantra is children; this speech provides another opportunity to promote his "cops and kids" anti-crime agenda before this racially mixed audience. But the Dinkins style can be so stultifying that, after earnestly expressing the sentiment that "kids are our future," and promising 30 more officers for the precinct, he pauses to say plaintively, "You all are supposed to applaud to indicate that you agree."
After looking to the future, Dinkins turns to his own past: he shares some rare personal reminiscences with his audience, reflecting on his strict upbringing and sense of discipline. This is the message that many of the whites who voted for Dinkins hoped he would bring to to his black and Hispanic constituents. But while he acknowledges that many poor children lack the discipline that was imposed on him by his mother and grandmother, both dollar-a-day domestics for white families, he shuns the term "underclass" and avoids lecturing. This disappoints critics who believe a black mayor, in particular, has a special responsibility to confront the problems of welfare dependency. Today he recounts the now-familiar story of how his mother and grandmother beat him after he was caught stealing a reflector off a license plate, but he adds a new wrinkle: the only time he had been slapped by his mother before was when he addressed an adult by her first name on the street.
After the speech, Dinkins heads to City Hall for a full day of meetings. His formal first-floor office is dominated not by the traditional portrait of an eminent predecessor, but by photographs of Nelson Mandela and Paul Robeson. A narrow staircase, lined with photographs of the Mayor posing with sports and entertainment figures, leads to a more fuctional basement hideaway. Wooden blinds, nearly always drawn, and a leather couch the color of ruby Port lend it a vaguely English atmosphere, somehow appropriate to Dinkins's Victorian elocution and personal manner.
He is meeting today with his "mini-cabinet": his five Deputy Mayors; George B. Daniels, his counsel; Albert Scardino, his press secretary (soon to resign), and Victor A. Kovner, a onetime Koch confidant, active in Jewish and liberal causes, who was chosen as Corporation Counsel even before Election Day to reassure jittery New Yorkers that a Dinkins administration would not turn City Hall upside down. (As it turned out, three of the five Deputy Mayors, like Kovner, are Jewish.)
Dinkins's full cabinet is considered largely unexceptional but competent, despite early complaints that talent and experience had been sacrificed to diversity and a determined housecleaning of Koch holdovers. Nobody reports directly to the Mayor, but some Commissioners enjoy special stature and access, notably Lee P. Brown in Police, Betsy Gotbaum in Parks and Mark Green in Consumer Affairs. Three of the five Deputy Mayors -- Bill Lynch, Barbara J. Fife and Sally Hernandez-Pinero -- are alumni of Dinkins's borough presidency. Their intimacy with the Mayor has prevented the usually assertive First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, a former Sanitation Commissioner and investment banker, from presiding as effectively as he might over key players who are putatively on the same team but don't always wear a common uniform.
At the top of the agenda today is the Board of Education's proposal to help prevent the spread of AIDS by distributing condoms to high-school students on request -- a controversial program for which Dinkins has announced his support. Analyzing the condom vote, Dinkins seems confident -- just as he was when he jauntily emerged from a secret meeting in a midtown hotel room last fall with Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, who had been resisting budget cuts demanded by City Hall. How had Dinkins persuaded Fernandez to back down? The Mayor, referring to the fact that he and his allies had coralled the votes on the Board of Education, ventured an unusually blunt reply: "He can count."
Dinkins displayed a similar toughness earlier that day in a meeting with his mini-cabinet to discuss strategy for dealing with the City Council. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, wants to begin the bargaining over the Mayor's anti-crime plan with the Council's more modest version, which included fewer preventive services for children and would require smaller tax increases. "I'm not going to do that," Dinkins declares. "I say we should work for the product we have, which is eminently superior to what they put together. The battle you've got to win for me is, work from our document, not theirs. If it develops that we can't get it, it sure as hell is going to be pretty clear who doesn't want it." Subsequent negotiations produce a compromise that is closer to Dinkins's version than to the Council's.
So pronounced is the difference between the Dinkins who can dominate in private and ramble obliquely in public that, after viewing both versions during the "urban summit" that Dinkins convened in New York last fall, San Francisco's Mayor, Art Agnos, asked Bill Lynch in disbelief: "Does your Mayor have two personalities? Does he think that's the way a mayor is supposed to behave?"
Seated at an oval conference table, Dinkins often seems distracted. He peruses his mail, fingers a silver letter opener and vets speech texts. (He interrupts another meeting to call his speech writer to insert several paragraphs about bias-related violence, moments before he is to deliver an address at a gay and lesbian celebration of African-American History Month.)
At one point, the Mayor interrupts the condom debate to ask Fife, "Has 'Miss Saigon' cleaned up its act?" The British musical almost didn't make it to Broadway because of a dispute over the casting of an English actor as a Eurasian, but Fife attests to the show's racial rectitude. Dinkins telephones his wife, Joyce, and tells her to accept an invitation.
Dinkins can be attentive and exacting, demonstrating a methodicalness and math major's obsession with detail that make occasional personal lapses all the more unfathomable. "Is it logical?" he implies as he counterpunches each parry from his appointees. He wields his watch -- an $1,800 black stainless-steel-and-gold Concord Mariner SG, which he won in a charity tennis tournament -- as a management tool and an escape hatch. "I'm due at the Mariners' Temple at noon, so why don't we cut to the chase?" he announces at 11:40 to officials who have gathered to explore solutions to another looming crisis, prison overcrowding. "Give me my piece of it in 10 minutes."
Dinkins's meetings are heavy on good intentions. But a subtext seems to be: Tomorrow we've got to get organized. To that end, the Mayor just recruited a chief of staff, John Flateau, a campaign alumnus whose duties and authority over other appointees remain ill defined. He has his work cut out for him. Disorganization among the Deputy Mayors pushed Bill Lynch to the verge of leaving earlier this year; he changed his mind when Dinkins warned that his defection would only fuel disaffection among the civic, religious, political and labor leaders from outside Dinkins's Harlem base who were closer to Lynch than to the Mayor.
After lunch, Dinkins is briefed on the impact of pending Congressional bills and on a meeting with West Side legislators pressing for a highway detour. He greets visiting Soviet dignitaries, the sort of ceremonial occasion that often occupied him as borough president. He still attends so many black-tie affairs that some disillusioned handlers refer to him as "Waldorf Dave." Yet, with this Mayor, some ceremonies assume a symbolic value that many whites overlook, just as they did the importance of Jesse Jackson's candidacy for American blacks. "The value of being an African-American mayor is not limited to things a mayor can do," Dinkins says. "These things translate." They translate more slowly among New York's white establishment where, Dinkins says, "if you look at the corporate boards, the law firms, you find very few people like me." When he paid a courtesy call last fall at the headquarters of a major bank, top officials complained about the paper work involved in monitoring minority recruitment. Defending the fundamental fairness behind such requirements, Dinkins said stiffly: "Some people don't understand the city is here for all of us."
No translation is necessary during the Mayor's midday speech at the Mariners' Temple Baptist Church on the Lower East Side. Introducing Dinkins, the pastor, Dr. Suzan D. Johnson, recalls the biblical David as "a shepherd boy whom everybody kept overlooking." "The David we know," she says, had also challenged a giant. Dinkins, grandson of a minister and son of a barber, reminds visiting schoolchildren that they can grow up to be anything if they stay in school. "You know that you can be mayor," he says. After the service, as a beaming 9-year-old, Dana Thorpe, poses for a picture with Dinkins, the young man's mother whispers: "You have been an enormous motivation to my son."
This is the kind of event that Dinkins believes the "general press," as he refers to non-black newspapers, largely overlooks, depriving him of balanced coverage. (This distrust of the press was reinforced by Albert Scardino.)
"I'll tell you what makes me angry, or at least annoyed," Dinkins says, and cites recent news coverage suggesting that blacks are dissatisfied with some of his positions, but neglecting to report that he had been enthusiastically received at a black church's fund-raising dinner (the appearance had not been listed on his public schedule). "I think I'm misjudged by some, but I don't like to dwell on it because it comes out like I'm whining and complaining," he says. "But in many instances, what people perceive is what the press tells them. It's the first-nighters: the critics can kill a show."
 "PROBLEMS DON'T GO away when you elect a black," Harold Washington warned before he was elected Mayor of Chicago. Dinkins agreed, but suggested during his own campaign that even raised expectations were better than none. "Our cause is about change," he promised. But Act 1 of his mayoralty was largely a struggle to maintain continuity in the face of unprecedented budget gaps coupled with growing demands for government services. "We worked hard and finally got a victory," says the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, the black minister from Brooklyn, "so we thought the Messiah had come."
Dinkins has been in no position to perform miracles, though. Last year, he claimed credit for adding no more than $60 million to the city budget -- mostly for drug treatment and social services for children. That's about two-tenths of 1 percent of the city's $29 billion budget, and he may have even less impact in the budget he submits this month. "It may be that you affect things at the margins," he says, "but when things get tight, the margins matter a hell of a lot."
And many of Dinkins's critics may be missing the main event. "The fundamental message is that we are becoming the pluralistic society we always thought we were," said Albert Scardino shortly before leaving as press secretary. "The people who are in charge are not exactly enthusiastic about that change. The miracle of David Dinkins, if he's able to perform it, will be to make that happen peacefully."
The difficulty of that challenge was sharply illustrated last month, when Dinkins agreed to march with the St. Patrick's Day parade's first gay and lesbian contingent. The newcomers were the targets of taunts from spectators, as well as several beer cans. "It was like marching in Birmingham," Dinkins later said, pointedly comparing the mean-spirited response of spectators to civil rights demonstrations in the Alabama city. Dinkins, as it happened, has never been in Birmingham, but by marching in the parade, shillelagh in hand and resplendent in a green blazer, the Mayor looked like a leader, even though he gave up the traditional position at the front of the parade. This was a matter of profound personal conviction, not political calculation (though the decision probably cost him fewer votes than it restored to his coalition). Similarly, the Mayor recalled that he hadn't weighed how his visit to Israel would be perceived because he believed that he was doing the right thing. "You ought not," he says, pausing to lick his index finger, "test the wind."
 FOR YEARS, DINKINS doggedly kept his eye on the prize -- not the mayoralty, but the borough presidency, which he finally won in 1985 after failing twice. When he reluctantly relinquished that job to run for mayor, he did so to pursue a progressive agenda -- not just to balance the budget or expand the police force. Symbolism aside, he acknowledges, "my election is of no moment to the guy who was not eating two years ago and is still not eating."
Many of Dinkins's white voters had hoped that he might stifle black militants (he was "strong enough to hold the line," one campaign slogan said ambiguously). Or that he might cement the jagged edges of the city's ethnic and racial mosaic. Some thought he would be uniquely situated to preach self-help, to sensitively apportion the pain demanded by an austerity budget and to inspire blacks who had never tasted prosperity or empowerment. Perhaps expectations were too high. But Dinkins did get 3 in 10 white votes, an electoral milestone. "If you're right," the Mayor said, about my premise that he was elected largely because he is black, "you could argue that people were coming together."
That was a major hurdle. So was balancing his first budget. But Dinkins wonders how many more tests he must pass. "I'm not saying we ought to be entered into the Fiscal Hall of Fame, but look at what we achieved," he says. "Since we did all the things they said we couldn't do, they ought to be saying, 'Wow.' Just maybe, the time will come when people will be a trifle more patient and say, perhaps he does know what the hell he's doing."
In last month's Inner Circle lampoon, a reporter playing Scardino sang, "You're Just an Ordinary Mayor." Ordinary isn't going to be good enough during fiscal and social crises -- just as it wasn't in the mid-1970's when Abraham D. Beame, New York's first Jewish mayor, was widely viewed as being in over his head. If the dismissal of Eric Schmertz defined the end of an agonizingly long first act of the Dinkins administration, then Act 2 will feature new players and new props. Its success still depends, though, primarily on whether its leading man manages to project greater presence.
After Dinkins got rid of his Labor Commissioner, he promised a more hands-on administration. But he offered only an ambiguous explanation about "reassessment" and a promise to place himself "in the loop sooner" -- the same sort of grudging concession he made last summer when he promised to sound angrier about surging crime if that's what it would take to get reporters off his back.
"David Dinkins should resolve to rush the net," says the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer. It would go against his grain to do so, but there is recent evidence that Dinkins is at least inching forward. Ten days after Schmertz was dismissed, Dinkins himself proposed give-backs from organized labor and forcefully acknowledged that the city faced a "structural deficit" because it had been spending more on services than it had been receiving from taxes. That same night, Barry Feinstein and Stanley Hill, among other labor leaders, attended a party that raised $800,000 for the Mayor's re-election campaign -- suggesting that Dinkins may have been right when he told Wall Street contributors during the campaign that he could persuade organized labor to accept sacrifices. "They'll take it from me," he said.
"What's important here in general is not to, quote, 'be politically right,' " Dinkins says. "What's important is to do the right thing. And that does take some courage and conviction. I understand the whole business of form and substance and whatnot. You can get out the smoke and mirrors and do things and, hell, Ronald Reagan was damn good at it. But that did not make him right. And I'm not going to be a part of that kind of crap."
The mandate he gave his deputies, Bill Lynch recalls, was direct if somewhat detached: "I want to be right -- you've got to make sure I'm effective." Lynch says: "The last administration was often perceived as effective. History will determine whether or not we were right." David Dinkins's challenge is to be both.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Van Slyke Makes a Big Catch

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
For two months, Bobby Bonilla and his agent, Dennis Gilbert, have publicly squabbled with the Pittsburgh Pirates over a contract. The Pirates offered $16 million for four years, but Bonilla rejected it, even when the Pirates reiterated the offer after he lost in arbitration and had to settle for a $2.4 million salary. The Pirates, in effect, wanted to give him $13.6 million for three extra years, but player and agent said no.
 Now come Andy Van Slyke and his lawyer, Richard Moss, and they quietly and professionally negotiate the fourth-richest contract, based on annual average value, ever given a player. Taking only slightly more than a week, the Pirates and Van Slyke reached agreement yesterday on a three-year extension, beginning next year, for $12.65 million. 
The average of $4,216,667 per year falls behind only $5.38 million for Roger Clemens, $5.15 million for Dwight Gooden and $4.7 million for Jose Canseco. It exceeds the average attained in recent contracts by Tony Gwynn, Darryl Strawberry and Fred McGriff, among others.
 Furthermore, the contract will pay a $750,000 signing bonus and salaries the first two years of $4 million and $4.6 million, leaving "only" $3.3 million at risk in 1994, a potential lockout/strike year.
 The Pirates, one of those small-market teams considered by baseball officials to be at a disadvantage, are obviously trying hard to keep pace with the ever-escalating market. It is not very likely, however, that they will offer Bonilla $16 million a third time. How many times can a suitor take rejection?
 
Was Sax Kidding?
 When there was talk a week ago about the Yankees' possible interest in trading for Bonilla, could Steve Sax, their astute second baseman, really have said, "The guy has put up a lot of numbers, but our team is kind of set." Which of four positions that Bonilla could play, with the exception of first base, is so set that the Yankees wouldn't be better off with him there? Right field? Left field? Third base?
 
The Masked Survivor
 Veteran -- in many cases, aging -- catchers roamed training camps this spring seeking jobs. Most found them. Gary Carter gets one more season with Los Angeles, Rick Dempsey with Milwaukee, Ernie Whitt with Baltimore, Ron Hassey with Montreal, Andy Allanson with Detroit, Matt Sinatro with Seattle. Bob Boone, most senior of them all, did not make it with Seattle.
 Perhaps the most intriguing case of all, though, is Rich Gedman and his success in gaining a job with St. Louis. First, he had to beat out Alex Trevino, who worked for Joe Torre twice before, in New York and in Atlanta. Then he had to overcome his own recent failures.
 In 1985, Gedman batted .295 with 18 home runs and 80 r.b.i. for the Red Sox. He slipped slightly the next season, to .258, 16 and 65. Since then, however, he has batted .211 with Boston and Houston and seemed to have hit himself out of baseball.
 "He lost his confidence," Torre said. "I watched it in 1987. That was the year no one was signing anybody. He had to sign back with Boston in May. Those people ate him alive. The boobirds killed him. He lost his confidence."
 Gedman acknowledged his difficulties after his experience with free agency during the collusion era, but he said: "I don't like to reflect back on it. Whatever happened happened. It doesn't matter. Those things are done. Now I just have to regroup and start over. I have to have a new approach to things. I have to approach the game as if I've done nothing. Be like I was when I was 22 years old."
 He is 31 years old now, and he is a backup catcher, not the starter he was in one World Series and two playoffs.
 "I don't know what's ahead for me," he said. "Whatever happens I accept it. I dug a hole for myself. I have to climb out of it." Piniella Means Business
 Lou Piniella, whose mind for business resulted in a baseball raise this winter from $350,000 to nearly $700,000, carries that type of thinking over to the game itself.
 "I liken a baseball season to a fiscal year for a corporation," the manager of the World Series champion Cincinnati Reds said. "You don't come to spring training and say, 'We're going to win the World Series.' You take it by quarters."
 The first quarter, Piniella said, is spring training. The second is the start of the season. The third quarter, he explained, is maintenance. Then comes the fourth quarter when "you apply the whip and make the post-season."
 "All these things will fall into place," he said, "if you can do things when you're supposed to do them."
 
Unemployed and Underpaid
 Chet Lemon, released by the Detroit Tigers on Friday, was one of the most underpaid players in the major leagues. In March 1985, he signed a four-year contract with an option for a fifth year, effective in 1988, for $3.7 million. That's a total of $3.7 million. Thirteen players now have contracts worth more than $3.7 million per season. The Tigers owe Lemon his $800,000 salary for this season and a $300,000 buyout for the option year.
 
They Don't Like the Trend
 The Players Association and player agents couldn't help notice the number of players released in the last week or 10 days and may try to do something about it. The union may file a grievance against some of the releases, arguing they were improper and contending that the clubs have to pay the players their entire 1990 salaries and not just 30 days or 45 days termination pay.
 Some of the releases in question involve Fernando Valenzuela ($2.55 million salary) by Los Angeles, Pete Incaviglia ($1,675,000) by Texas, Oddibe McDowell ($925,000) by Atlanta and Mike Aldrete ($510,000) by Montreal.
 Players' contracts do not permit such releases so the club can avoid paying the salary, but the union thinks that is precisely what happened with Valenzuela, whom the Dodgers indicated they were going to release even if he had pitched well in his last exhibition outing.
 Incaviglia and McDowell, the union suggests, were released for disciplinary reasons, also not permitted under the contracts. The suspicion is that the Rangers released Incaviglia because he was constantly fighting with Manager Bobby Valentine and that the Braves let McDowell go after he refused to enter a game as a pinch-runner.
 Aldrete might be the most flagrant release of all. The outfielder won his salary arbitration case, then got little chance to play in exhibition games. "They ignored him," one agent said.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
A Week of Concepts, a Day at the Park

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
This has been auto-show week in New York, and it has been a week for questions. Are there free tickets, was the one most asked, but there were others less venal. Is the show good? What's new? Is it exciting?
 For a start, times are tough and there were no free tickets. And, truth to tell, the rest could be answered by saying that excitement was in the id of the beholder. 
When the Greater New York International Automobile Show moved from the old Coliseum to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, it lost its early winter dates, and any show featuring cars that have been on the street for months definitely has a couple of strikes against it.
 Not to put too fine a point on it, if you want to see a '91 Chevy Caprice, all you have to do is hail a cab. But New York's show, dating to 1900, is the oldest in the nation, and the largest, both in terms of vehicles and in attendance. And if you were in the market for a new car, if you had not been to a show in a while, or if any sort of glitz on wheels makes you slather, then the show was worth a visit.
 Automotive News noted that the recession hung over the Convention Center "like a black cloud." Because of that, a lot of manufacturers kept their future-tech goodies back at the factory, but industry executives did do their best to lighten the gloom with words of hope for a turnaround in consumer confidence. And, in fairness, the show had its moments.
 Acura introduced its five-cylinder Vigor sport sedan, and Mazda unveiled its sporty MX-3 coupe. There were computer "test drives" and hands-on fun in the form of simulated crash tests. There were shows and dancers, splendid sets and pretty girls and giveaways.
 As usual, too, concept cars were sprinkled through the 1,200 vehicles on display, and it was just such a gem that made the week a winner, as far as I was concerned.
 The car came from Volkswagen, and I saw it demonstrated not at the show but in Central Park, where its high-tech talents could be properly appreciated by the television cameras. The thing is a blue bubble called Futura and, wonder of wonders, it can park itself.
 It can do all manner of other things, of course. It is a two-plus-two sport vehicle, and its gull-wing doors and glass hatch can be removed to turn it into a sort of convertible. It has insulating glass that reflects 60 percent of the sun's heat. And it fairly bristles with electronic gizmos, all of them neatly hidden by its steel-and-glass skin.
 The seats have microphones in the head restraints to pick up annoying sound and play it back through speakers that are out of phase, an interesting new technology that cancels unwanted noise. There is an electric parking brake so you don't have to use all that effort to pull a lever or step on a pedal, and the antilock brakes and power steering also are electrically operated.
 The wealth of electronic wizardry has been made possible by a multiplexed system of wiring, which carries digitized electrical pulses that can be unscrambled by the receiving device. In other words, the turn signals respond only to their own mother, ignoring a cue that is sent, say, to the windshield wipers. That allows far fewer wires, saving weight, space and mechanical complexity.
 Sensors measure the distance from other vehicles and obstacles and keep the driver apprised. If distance is short, a display on the dash turns from black to amber. And if the car is really upset about invasion of its personal space, it turns the display a fiery red. That could cut down on accidents. Aside from being safer, though, a driver who keeps the display in the black will save gas by avoiding unnecessary braking and acceleration.
 The Futura has four-wheel steering, but then so do a lot of cars already on the road. What is different about Volkswagen's vision, according to a technical booklet, is an "intelligent control system" that can be put on auto-pilot. In other words, the car can park itself.
 And the way it works is this:
 A driver pulls up to a likely spot and pushes a button. The car checks its distance sensors to see whether it is next to the open space, how long it is, whether it is in front of the vehicle or behind it, and whether the driver has partly driven into the space in order not to hinder traffic.
 If it decides that the space is adequate, the Futura chooses one of several possible maneuvers and indicates to the driver what it is about to do. When the driver pushes a confirming button, the little blue bus begins its park job, constantly checking its other sensors to monitor the area.
 Those other sensors are of the laser and supersonic varieties. The lasers scan the space ahead, behind and to the side. The supersonic sensors, with their wide measuring angle, look at the curb and register any other surrounding obstacles.
 Once at the curb, the Futura is perfectly willing to undo what it has done, and another push of the button will set it to backing-and-filling and working its way out of the space again. Or, of course, the driver can do it, and the process can be interrupted at any point if traffic warrants.
 It is amazing to watch, and the vehicle routinely does the kind of precise parking and un-parking that only occasionally happen when I am using my own sensors. In fact, it was while I was watching all this in Central Park that it occurred to me that I would like my future car to do a number of things that cars don't now do.
 Working nights, it would be nice to have an automobile that could drive itself home. I could just push the Tired button.
 It would be nice if the car could have its own arguments with taxi drivers and, perhaps, make its own rude gestures at pedestrians. It could call in and make excuses when I am late.
Maybe Volkswagen could come up with an automobile that would interface with my cash machine. Or one that would take back the rented videotape. Certainly, the car could extend its trunk for vacations, and maybe it could learn to clean itself like a cat.
 And then, ultimately, I would like a car that would always be good for a column. Something, say, like the Futura.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
Retirement Communities Feel Effects of Soft Market

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER KENNEALLY

DATELINE: MILTON, MASS.

 BODY:
Chester W. Nimitz Jr., a retired rear admiral, might fairly feel entitled to a certain impatience with waiting lists.
The 76-year-old son of the World War II naval hero is ready to give up the golfing and fishing life in Boca Raton, Fla. He wants to move with his wife to the Boston area to be closer to his children and grandchildren. So he is on waiting lists for two continuing-care retirement communities in the Boston area. He expects to choose between one that is to open here in 1993 and one that opened in Needham in 1983. 
 Last year, he withdrew his deposit at a cooperative community then being developed in Westwood, another Boston suburb, because of concern that his investment would not be safe. "I did not want to assume an ownership position in an operation that looked like it could get sticky," he said.
Because of a soft real-estate market, many elderly buyers are facing such uncertainties in New England and elsewhere. The slowdown in sales has generally contributed to a slowdown in the commitments that buyers will make to new retirement communities.
This is especially the case in the development of continuing-care retirement communities, which usually need substantial commitments before construction starts. There are 700 of these communities across the country, serving more than 210,000 elderly residents.
Residents generally pay entrance fees and additional monthly fees for health care, meals and other services for the rest of their lives. In 1988, the median entrance fee was $45,300 nationally, according to the Continuing Care Accreditation Commission in Washington, but the fees can top $200,000. They are generally refundable up to 90 percent of the original cost when a resident leaves or dies.
The picture in the eastern Massachusetts communities reflects the new pressures on these developments in a tougher financial environment.
The Milton development, Fuller Village, has found it necessary to secure commitments on 70 percent of the planned 150 apartments before it receives full construction financing. In the mid-1980's, such a development would have needed to show only 50 percent commitment to get a construction loan. "Even in a hot market, to get from 50 to 70 percent is a long trip," said Gardi Hauck, Fuller Village's marketing director. "In a tough market, it's going to be a challenge."
So much so that Fuller Trust, the nonprofit developer of Fuller Village, is considering halving the deposit required to reserve a place, Ms. Hauck said. This has been 10 percent of the entrance fee, which can run from $155,000 for a studio apartment to $410,000 for three bedrooms.
But as home prices fall, buyers worry more about their ability to meet the costs once they buy in.
Louise Graves, a 74-year-old Washington writer and editor, put down $1,000 for a place on the Fuller Village waiting list three years ago, when the project was proposed. Since then, Mrs. Graves said, she has watched the value of her home in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington fall. "The length of time they are taking to get off the ground means money," Mrs. Graves said. "It means it's going to cost me more."
The Fox Hill Village development, in Westwood, is an example of what the newer, expensive continuing-care communities are offering. Situated in a campus-like setting of 83 wooded acres, it is the largest continuing-care retirement community in Massachusetts.
Built by a development partnership of the Massachusetts General Hospital, the Hillhaven Corporation of Tacoma, Wash., and a subsidiary of Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, whose interest in the project was bought out by the other partners last summer, the 356 residential units at Fox Hill Village comprise 329 "independent living" apartments and 27 "assisted living" units.
Fox Hill Village's 650,000-square-foot, five-story X-shaped building was designed by JSA Architects of Portsmouth, N.H. The central section, where the arms of the X meet, has shops, meeting and dining rooms, a library and other common areas. Three of the arms are residential and the fourth is a nursing home.
Apartments range from basic one-bedroom units starting at $170,000 to three-bedroom penthouses at $460,000. Monthly maintenance fees start at $1,050 and cover medical care as well as one meal a day.
The village also includes a health care center, a 70-bed nursing home and a commons area with a dining room serving lunch and dinner daily, a library, a 200-seat auditorium and a convenience store.
The complex opened last July and 70 percent of its units have been sold or are occupied, said Vincent Cucchiara, Massachusetts General's representative on the project. But it was from Fox Hill Village that Admiral Nimitz withdrew his deposit, suggesting that buyers become timid when sales are less than ebullient.
To avoid the tax issues associated with entrance fees, new developments like Fox Hill Village and others in Illinois, Minnesota and California have been organized as cooperatives. Residents buy their apartments as shares in a cooperative, rather than paying entrance fees.
This arrangement avoids a knotty tax issue that arose with entrance fees: If entrance fees were eventually refunded, should they be treated for tax purposes as a loan? In that case, interest would have to be imputed to them and taxes would be due.
In 1984, Congress exempted entrance fees for continuing-care retirement communities paid before June 1, 1984, from any tax implications, but it has not acted on the possible tax consequences for fees paid since then. A cooperative apartment, however, can be sold much like any other home or property. At Fox Hill Village, the resident board sets a maximum resale price for units every six months, with the intention of limiting speculation by owners or their estates.
 The Continuing Care Accreditation Commission reviews the policies and services at these retirement communities. It has accredited 107 of them in 21 states. The commission will accredit a development only after it has been 90 percent occupied for at least a year.
Only a few of the communities seeking accreditation have been denied it, and no accreditation has been revoked, said Ann Gillespie, the commission's director.
"Every facility so far denied accreditation has been on financial reasons," Ms. Gillespie said. "They didn't have either the financial management or resources we require."
Originally, Massachusetts General Hospital planned to develop what Mr. Cucchiara called a teaching nursing home on the site of what became Fox Hill Village. In 1980, the hospital bought 83 acres of a 120-acre parcel in Westwood owned by the Gillette Company and once slated for development as its corporate headquarters. The adjoining 37-acre parcel has since been partly developed as an office park.
By 1985, Massachusetts General and its development partners decided instead to create a continuing-care retirement community. The hospital remains central to the medical needs of residents, however, and along with the apartments and amenities, it has built an on-site health care center, whose medical director is a Massachusetts General doctor.
For all the advantages of such communities, however, some elderly people have doubts about such a commitment.
Admiral Nimitz spoke of moving to a continuing-care retirement community as "a gamble," and said rising costs and other financial concerns, particularly while he remains physically active, "made the gamble more reasonable to wait."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: HADDAM;
As Power Plant's Tax Share Drops, Town Seeks Ways to Compensate

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
LIKE a rich uncle who helps pay the rent when the money is short, Haddam has long relied on the Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant to provide the funds for many town services. This fiscal year, taxes on the Connecticut Yankee plant will pay about $5 million of the town's $10.5 million budget. But starting next year, the plant's share of the municipal finances will begin to decline dramatically.
The town is in the middle of a real estate revaluation, and the relative value of Connecticut Yankee is expected to drop from almost one-half the town's grand list to one-third or even one-quarter. Unlike real estate, which is revalued only every 10 years, the plant and its equipment have had their value updated each year, keeping those figures much closer to market value. Thus, while the revaluation will result in increases of 200 percent or more in the official values of residents' houses and other real property, the power plant's value will change only slightly. That means everyone else will have to pay more just to maintain services. 
 "Those of us who are involved in government are very concerned about it," said First Selectman Jane W. Blau. "But I don't know that the average citizen is really aware of it yet."
The town has "used the revenues from the nuclear plant to keep taxes low," Ms. Blau said. "It's going to be very, very difficult to get used to this situation. People are going to have to choose whether they want the services they're getting now or not."
 
Rumors of Reduction
 Anthony Nericcio, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, which operates and owns the largest share of the Connecticut Yankee plant, said residents are beginning to take notice of the coming financial problems. He said he was recently asked to speak to the local Rotary club about rumors that the plant would reduce its power output by 10 percent a year, until it closes in 2000.
"The only thing I can say definitely is that Connecticut Yankee will be here until the year 2007," Mr. Nericcio said. "I'm not going to say we aren't going to make any major investments in the plant. I just don't know."
Stephen W. Hitchcock, chairman of the town's Planning and Zoning Commission, said that because revaluation is under way now, it is too late to even consider an economic development program to soften the tax blow. In any event, he said, the town has no room for new business.
"Most of the good land has already been built on," Mr. Hitchcock said, "and what's left is stone, ledge or swamp. It would be very difficult to build on, and without public water and sewer it would almost be impossible."
Haddam is the largest town in the state that is totally dependent on private wells for water. There has been talk of developing an industrial park in the northern end of town, where it might be possible to hook into utilities from Middletown, but that area is a valuable aquifer.
"I don't see anything great springing up to take the place of the power plant," Mr. Hitchcock said.
Connecticut Yankee, situated on the Connecticut River from which it draws its cooling water, began commercial operation on Jan. 1, 1968. It is a 582-megawatt pressurized-water reactor, the oldest and smallest of the four nuclear plants Northeast operates in Connecticut.
Its license expires in 2007, when the company will have to decide whether to decommission the plant, tearing it down to the foundations and shipping any radioactive parts off to a disposal site, Mr. Nericcio said.
The other three nuclear plants Northeast operates are in Waterford, which faces a similar, though less dramatic problem, because those plants are newer.
Waterford's grand list declined 4 percent last year, due largely to the 5.5 percent decline of the value of the nuclear plants there.
The bulk of the assessment of a nuclear plant is in personal property, like equipment, rather than real property, like land, said Haddam's assessor, Robert Coates. Personal property is revalued every year, so it keeps pace with inflation, he said, while real property is revalued every 10 years, and it falls behind.
When a town undergoes revaluation, the official value of real property rises steeply in that year, and the value of the personal property stays about the same, so its importance to the tax base is diminished.
"It's very insidious," Mr. Coates said. "Even if you're talking about inflation of 3 percent a year, at the end of the 10 years, with compounding, you're looking at a shift of 35 percent in the tax base. That's an enormous impact to absorb in a single year.
 
'Aware of the Contribution'
 "The system itself is a real Catch-22. The more graced a town is with an industrial base, which keeps taxes down, the bigger the shift is in that 10th year."
A municipal assessment adviser in the State Office of Policy and Management, Joan R. Robinson, said: "It's quite a unique situation to have a town where a single taxpayer makes up so much of the tax base, and it's also quite unique where the asset has a limited lifetime.
"Clinton, for instance, has Chesebrough-Pond's as its major taxpayer. But they have broadened their tax base, and a lot of Chesebrough-Pond's assessment is in buildings and property, which will not decline so fast."
Ms. Blau, the First Selectman, said: "All of the people who live in town are very much aware of the contribution Northeast makes here. I think that's one of the reasons some people move here, because the taxes are so low, due to the influence of the nuclear plant." But she said that as the value of Connecticut Yankee declines, there is very little industry to make up for it, aside from two wire manufacturers, a lumber company, and a large construction concern with a considerable amount of expensive heavy equipment.
The town will probably approach Northeast to negotiate a gradual move to its lower tax rate, Ms. Blau said. "The law provides for big tax increases to be phased in after a revaluation," she said. "But what we have here is the reverse situation.
"I don't know that we can phase in a tax decrease. But you don't usually see tax decreases of this magnitude."
Another spokesman for Northeast, Louis J. Keezing, said the company is willing at least to discuss some arrangement that might ease the impact on the town. "We'll cooperate if it's feasible," he said. "But the plant is on its way down the depreciation curve."
The company has not ruled out the possibility of filing an application for a license extension under new rules approved by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which would allow it to operate past 2007.
"The rules are relatively fresh off the press, so we're not sure what we're going to do," Mr. Nericcio said. The Yankee Rowe plant in Rowe, Mass., has applied for a license extension, and Northeast is keeping a close eye on the process, Mr. Nericcio said.
 Such a life extension would not only keep the plant on the tax rolls longer, it would require significant capital investment to keep the plant safe, which would boost its value.
"In any event, you've got a piece of land here that's zoned industrial, that has power, and I would think it would find some use," Mr. Nericcio said. "So the town isn't going to suffer."
Mr. Hitchcock agreed that such a prime site would not be abandoned.
"I find it hard to believe Northeast Utilities wouldn't use that property for something else after the plant is decommissioned," he said. "They've got a site right on the river for cooling water, and all the lines in place. Even if they couldn't use it for nuclear, I would think they would want it for a coal, oil or gas plant."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Expected to Put Off Easing of Interest Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Despite shreds of evidence that suggest otherwise, most credit market analysts say the recession is still very much with us. Hopes that a turnaround may begin in the current quarter are merely that, they say.
For its part, the Federal Reserve is looking for signals that inflation is easing, the analysts add, and will probably postpone any further moves to reduce short-term interest rates until they become evident. "The Fed will need significant evidence that inflation is improving before they ease," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. 
 The surge in consumer confidence that followed the end of fighting by American and allied troops in the Persian Gulf, a spurt in housing activity in February, falling interest rates and rapid money growth since the start of the year -- all cited as necessary conditions for a recovery -- have been all but buried by fresher statistics showing the economy went nowhere in March.
 
A Bleak Three Months
 Car sales remain at very low levels. Conditions in the manufacturing sector are still very weak. And, as last week's employment statistics showed, the labor market contracted further in March, closing out a bleak three months.
Combined with declines in January and February, the 206,000 jobs lost last month bring the total loss of payroll employment to 688,000 in the first quarter, economists say, a bigger quarterly drop than any recorded during the 1981-82 recession.
Equally troubling was the fact that factory hours worked, a key component of industrial production that is considered a coincident economic indicator, fell for the fifth time in the last six months.
"Hours-worked numbers are more instructive about current and near-term economic health," said Richard M. Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "And the new data do not suggest as yet that there is any recovery under way."
 
'One of the Worst' Quarters
 Based on what is now known about the first quarter, economists are estimating that output fell at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.5 to 3.5 percent in the first quarter, after the 1.6 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1990. "By almost every measure of economic activity, the first quarter was one of the worst in the postwar period," said Joseph Carson, a senior economist at Chemical Bank.
In coming weeks, "talk of recovery will soon fade, and people will start looking at the numbers and conclude that in periods of declining nominal income and record debt burdens it will take much more to get the economy growing again," Mr. Carson added.
"I am still looking for another six months of recession," he said.
William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm, said, "In the second quarter, the minus numbers we have been seeing should begin to get smaller, setting the stage for a turnaround in the second half, but the turnaround will be so modest that in many respects you won't know things have changed."
In a survey conducted Friday afternoon by Thompson Financial Networks, more than half of the economists polled said they expected the recovery would begin in the third quarter or later.
The bond market, which spent much of last month in full retreat, seems to be slowly waking up to the notion that recovery is not around the corner. After peaking at just under 8.40 percent in mid-March, bond yields have slowly eased back down, to 8.16 percent late Friday. Indeed, shortly after the employment data were released bond prices rose to a level not seen since the day before Iraq capitulated to the United States and its allies in late February.
Analysts said further declines in long-term rates were likely, but only after bond traders see convincing evidence that inflation is moderating.
Credit market participants will get an unusual double dose of fresh inflation news this week, because March producer price and consumer price data are expected to be released Thursday and Friday. Usually, the monthly producer price report precedes consumer price information by about a week.
After the uncomfortably large increases in the core inflation rate in January and February, analysts hope that the recession's dampening effects on inflation should begin to be seen in the March figures.
Excluding food and energy prices, most analysts estimate that producer prices rose by three-tenths of a percent last month, a slight moderation from the four-tenths increase in February.
Consumer prices, which excluding food and energy rose by an alarming seven-tenths of a percent in February, are estimated to have increased by anywhere from one-tenth to four-tenths in March. "If the core rates are both three-tenths of a point, I don't know if the Fed will move," Mr. Fine said.

HEADLINE: Colombia Ties Drug Cache to 3 in Jail

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, April 6

 BODY:
Are the Ochoa brothers trafficking in cocaine from jail?
Certainly not, protest the Ochoas, who say they have given up their multimillion-dollar cocaine exporting business and are now model prisoners in a Government rehabilitation program. 
 Certainly yes, contend Colombian police officials, who cite recent raids on two Ochoa-controlled ranches 40 miles from Colombia's Caribbean coast. The police found 12.3 tons of cocaine, worth $175 million wholesale in the United States.
At the heart of the controversy is a Government leniency offer aimed at breaking up the drug cartels. Under the offer, which has been steadily sweetened since it was unveiled last September, traffickers who surrender will not be extradicted for trial to the United States if they confess to one or more crimes and if they do not commit any crimes while in jail awaiting trial in Colombian courts.
The centerpiece of this program has been the three Ochoa brothers, confessed executives of a lucrative branch of a Medellin cartel. As if testing a cold bath, the Ochoa brothers surrendered one by one -- Fabio in December, Jorge Luis in January and Juan David in February.
 
Mother Does the Cooking
 The Ochoas, who now rank among the world's richest prison inmates, have sought to portray themselves as model prisoners at their high-security jail in a Medellin suburb. They eat their mother's home cooking, talk with their lawyers and watch television.
At first they requested permission to install a parabolic television antenna on top of the jail. Realizing that this might seem a bit flashy, they settled for a cable hookup. Some cynics say they prefer meals cooked by their mother because they are afraid of being poisoned.
Skeptics also question the Ochoas' promises to wind up their drug-exporting business. Where are the planes and the laboratories? trafficking analysts asked last January.
Hard at work, came the response last Wednesday from Gen. Miguel Antonio Gomez Padilla, director of the national police.
"From their properties, people linked to them have continued with illicit activities," General Gomez, Colombia's top police official, said of the Ochoa cartel in a television interview.
 
A Favorite for Traffickers
 Another Colombian police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, was more blunt: "We are certain that the drugs found in Cordoba are from the Ochoa clan."
Colombia's coastal state of Cordoba has long been a favorite for traffickers -- clean water is plentiful for cocaine refining, landing strips can be camouflaged on the flat raneland, drug money can be laundered through investments in cattle, and the state is a three-hour plane ride from the major export market, the United States. During Colombia crackdown on cocaine traffickers in 1989, 39 ranches were seized in Cordoba.
From their jail cells on Thursday, the Ochoas issued a communique denying any connection to the drug stockpiles seized at the two Cordoba ranches, Arizona and La Voragine.
The ranches "where a large amount of cocaine was found, are not, nor have been, our property nor ours in the name of other parties," said the communique signed by the three brothers.
 
'Great and Unique Chance'
 To bolster their defense, the traffickers made public a letter they sent in February to Colombia's Justice Minister, Jaime Giraldo Angel.
The letter complained of "reports by security organizations that we are continuing to work in drug trafficking, operating this kind of business from jail."
"Sir," the letter continued, "do you think that, right after surrendering, we are planning to stay in this business, after we have a great and unique chance to straighten out our lives and the lives of our families?"
Few people in Colombia seem moved by the Ochoas' protestations of innocence.
Reviewing the week's events, the newspaper El Espectador wrote in an editorial about the Ochoas' "five star" jail, "This establishment is no longer a place of detention for recognized and confessed criminals, but a place of protection for their continued illegal acts.' "
Despite discomfort caused by the charges, the traffickers probably calculate that time is on their side. In a recent poll on Colombians' worries, respondents ranked "solving drug trafficking" in eighth place, well below reducing unemployment, making peace with leftist guerrillas and improving education.
In the legal arena, delegates to a constitutional convention are expected to approve in coming weeks a proposal by a former Mayor of Medellin to adopt a formal constitutional ban on extradition of Colombian citizens.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Newark's Loss May Really Be Its Renaissance

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Newark may be America's most incredible shrinking city, but its ego is growing.
No bigger city in the United States lost a greater fraction of its population during the last decade, the census concluded -- giving a new dimension to its nickname as "the Gateway" and reducing its official count to the lowest since 1900. 
 But as Newark marks its 325th anniversary, it is also touting itself as "the Renaissance City" -- a reference that holds the promise of rebirth even as it risks reminding America of the riots that seared the city in the national consciousness nearly a quarter-century ago and made Newark synonymous with urban decline.
"What defined Newark was the Central Ward and that's where the cameras keep coming back," says Richard A. Monteilh, the city's business manager, referring to abandoned, burned-out buildings and empty lots. "Increasingly, they will have little left to film."
The census found that Newark lost 16.4 percent of its population in the 1980's -- dropping to 275,221 from 329,248 -- after a nearly 14 percent decline in the previous decade. The latest exodus from Newark represented a greater percentage loss than occurred in Detroit, which actually lost more people, and a larger number of people than in the 23.2 percent decline recorded in Gary, Ind.
Officials in Newark estimate that its population actually fell less than 4 percent in the 1980's. They say the hemorrhaging, to whatever degree it happened, was stanched in the middle of the decade by a continuing influx of Hispanic immigrants, who were not accurately counted. Anyway, the officials express confidence that less is more.
"We were too large at close to 500,000," Mr. Monteilh said of Newark's population, which has been declining since 1950, but still makes it New Jersey's largest city.
Some of the decline reflects a national phenomenon: the suburbanization of America, as both blacks and whites found incentives as well as opportunities to move away. (The white population declined by 22 percent; the decline among blacks was nearly as great -- 16 percent.) Some poor people apparently left, too.
 The shrinkage wasn't planned. But it represented an opportunity that Mayor Sharpe James has exploited. Public housing is being upgraded as the vacant hulks of high-rise projects are replaced by tracts and pockets of garden apartments and town houses. Newark now has more police officers per resident than any major city except Washington.
Newark's airport, seaport, mass transit and the Prudential Insurance Company's decision not to abandon its downtown headquarters provided a base that enabled the city to survive hard times better than Gary or East St. Louis, Ill., and other largely one-industry towns.
"If you've got things you can build around, you can take the town back," Mr. Monteilh said, adding that one airport is not enough to carry New York, but can have a lot more impact on a smaller city like Newark.
Blue Cross-Blue Shield is returning. Seton Hall University's law school is staying. The Port Authority opened an office building to attract tenants from the legal profession and communications industries. A postal service processing center is being wooed. An architect has been hired to design a major performing arts center. A promenade is being planned along the Passaic River.
For the first time in two decades, market-rate housing and a local movie theater are being built. The abundance of vacant land inspired K. Hovnanian Enterprises to build hundreds of town houses in the Central Ward. A 100-apartment city experiment in affordable housing drew 5,500 applications from prospective buyers.
"What's happening in Newark is the price is right," said Harold Lucas, director of development. "Some of the bogymen people used to see are no longer a major concern."
Yet despite visible signs of renewal and diminishing physical legacies of the riots, renaissance is more an ambitious goal than an accomplished fact.
The gilded dome that now crowns City Hall was the gift of a local developer whose glittery Renaissance Mall shopping center nearby stands unfinished -- a victim of the recession and the credit crisis. Inside this City Hall and others, mayors hold less sway with Trenton than they used to. New Jersey's six largest cities now account for about 10 percent of the state's population and about the same percentage of jobs.
Still, Newark is poised to defy its reputation. It hopes to re-house its poorer residents and to rebound by attracting more middle-class taxpayers. "How that trend plays out," Mr. Monteilh says, "will dictate what kind of city we have in five years."

HEADLINE: 2 Business Advisers Urge Dinkins To Take 3 Steps to Save Millions

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The leaders of Mayor David N. Dinkins's business-labor advisory panel on management are prodding him to adopt three of the group's recommendations that they say could eventually save New York City hundreds of millions of dollars a year and reduce the need for crippling service cuts and higher taxes.
In an Op-Ed article in The New York Times today, the advisers, Roger C. Altman and Donald D. Kummerfeld, urge Mr. Dinkins to save on Medicaid payments by changing the way the city provides medical services to the poor, to cut the city work force with an early-retirement program and to consolidate the city's seven economic development agencies. 
 Mr. Dinkins has been considering these ideas and others as he seeks to bring the city's fiscal problems under control for the next few years. But all three recommendations pose political or managerial difficulties for the Mayor, and his advisers' public recommendation seemed intended to spur him and to open a debate.
 
Opportunities Amid Crisis
 "Today's fiscal crisis, like the last one, creates opportunities for long-overdue changes," wrote Mr. Altman, who was an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Administration of President Jimmy Carter, and Mr. Kummerfeld, a former Deputy Mayor under Abraham D. Beame. "City Hall has recognized this, and budget and management reforms are emerging. If Mayor David Dinkins steps up the pace, government can be downsized without eliminating essential services and driving away businesses with ruinous tax increases."
Senior city officials said they had seen a draft of the article but were not aware that it was to be published today.
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said, "The Mayor is inclined to accept these recommendations, and what really needs to be done in several cases is sortiing out the implementation details."
 
Pilot Health Program Due
 Adopting a system of so-called managed Medicaid is especially sensitive for Mr. Dinkins. The idea involves requiring Medicaid patients to choose from designated clinics or hospitals for their medical care and is intended to provide better follow-up and lower-cost care, instead of leaving patients to use hospital emergency rooms where their medical history is not known and efforts may be duplicated at higher cost. But some health-care advocates contend the system limits freedom of choice for the poor.
In a pilot program to begin soon in Brooklyn, Mr. Steisel said, patients will be able to choose from a number of options. He said it remained to be determined just how city health-care agencies could best manage such a system citywide.
In an interview, Mr. Altman said he and Mr. Kummerfeld had made their recommendations public because they were tired of hearing complaints that the business community was not doing its share in working with City Hall to address the city's fiscal problems, even though the Mayor appointed the Management Advisory Task Force late last year.
"There's a very strong sense among the 17 or 18 people on our task force that that was baloney," Mr. Altman said. "Here we are in the trenches, working hand in glove with the Mayor, and we wanted people to know that. City Hall is not twiddling its thumbs. The Mayor's been totally supportive in every respect."
In their article, the advisers say that an early-retirement program for city teachers might avert thousands of layoffs. City officials have said that they are negotiating such a possibility with the teachers union but that it would be harder to realize similar savings in other agencies where there is not such a wide spread between starting and senior salaries.
